Mark - I'm so sorry I haven't responded yet, but yes, I did get your e-mail. 
I actually solved most of the issues detailed on the spreadsheet, but wanted 
to finish before I sent the document back. I've attached the spreadsheet with 
what I've done so far, and I'm forwarding most of the remaining deals to Bill 
Williams in Real Time. The two deals with volume discrepancies are going to 
take some looking into - I think they're in the system correctly and it's 
probably just an error in my spreadsheet - but I'll let you know. Again, 
sorry for the delay.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate did you receive my e-mail from the weekend for EES April activity?   I 
know you may not had time to look at them, I just want to make sure the 
e-mail got to you since it was the weekend when I forwarded it to you.

Thanks,

Mark

I just spoke with Sean and he said he was indifferent on the subject - so you 
guys can go ahead and confirm these deals. I'm looking into why Puget sales 
seem to be coming up "no confirm." Thanks for checking, though.

Kate

Hi Kate,

There were several deals that were marked not to be confirmed that appeared 
to be normal west deals that we should confirm. We've already changed them to 
yes, but please check with Sean Crandell to see if he marked them not to be 
confirmed for a reason.

I'm not sure why you're seeing a price of $65.70 come through on this deal, 
but I'm looking at the deal in EnPower right now and I see a price of $65. If 
you could let me know what report is showing the incorrect price, I might be 
able to figure out why.

Thanks,
Kate

Your deal # 581358.1 is showing a price of 65.70 but on the Real Time 
spreadsheet, I see 65.00.  Which is correct?

Thanks for you help

Judy

This deal was a physical payback to WAPA, and it should be in at a zero 
price. I've added a comment into the deal to explain this, and I asked Holden 
to put comments in any weird deals he enters from now on. Thanks for catching 
this - it does need to be confirmed.

Thanks for following up on this, Rhonda. I believe you just spoke with Chris 
about the executed original of this contract. Please let me know what else I 
can do to speed this process along. I ran a search for deals the West 
Services desk has done with this counterparty (which were entered with Sierra 
Pacific Industries, Inc.) and came up with only three deal numbers. They are:

580832
580137
580136

Would you like me to change these over? Or are you doing that along with the 
re-confirmation? Please let me know when you get a chance.

Thanks,
Kate

Because of credit reasons, the name above will remain the name under the 
contract.  Global Counterparty has agreed to set up this dba as listed on the 
contract.  Once this CP has been set up, I will need the trades moved to this 
CP and the deals will need to be reconfirmed in the accurate name.  

If there are no objections, I will move the deals and instruct the confirm 
person to resend the confirms.  I will also move the contract to this new 
name.  Genia will prepare the amendment covering just the change in the 
credit provisions.

If Portland holds the fully executed original, please forward to me at your 
earliest convenience.  If you have any questions or further instructions, 
please contact me at X35871.

I asked Bob about these this morning, and he said he's still got to work this 
out with Constellation. The way he explained it, our position is flat with 
Constellation, so for settlements purposes we're okay - i.e. We've bought the 
same volumes that we've sold, and we end up losing a bit due to the index 
offset - but otherwise the index price won't make a difference.  But I 
suspect he's not thinking of the problem from the confirmation standpoint. 
Could you tell me exactly what needs to happen to clear this up on your end 
so that I can explain it to Bob in a way that might make him DO something? 
I'm sorry for the delay on this - I'm getting ready to call Bob's contact at 
Constellation for him.

Let me know what your ideal solution would be. Should we get Constellation to 
agree to the Dow Jones index? Or should we change the deals to forward fixed 
price? We'll fix this today - I promise.

Thanks,
Kate

Thanks,

I just talked to Bob, and I don't know if he's responded yet, but I thought 
I'd fill you in anyway. He's been talking to his contact at Constellation 
about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet. 
I've reminded him and he said he WILL talk to the guy and resolve it today. 
I'll keep on it, and let you know when these deals have been changed.

Thanks,

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa

Here you go, Chris. Please ignore the last four days, as they are still under 
construction. And let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Thanks for doing that. And those deals didn't show up in my query because I 
was looking for trades done under the Short Term West Services desk - I 
didn't realize Chris was also entering these under Short Term California. 
Just let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Thanks,
Kate

Tom and Mark are not spot traders, they're cash traders. This is what I was 
referring to yesterday - that Real Time is now being charged $15 for trades - 
but cash and term traders should still be charged the traditional $.005. Why 
is Bloomberg recognizing these trades as Real Time?

Kate

Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON
04/17/2001 12:33 PM
 
Hi Kate, per our discussion on yesterday about the $15.00 flat fee on Tom's 
and Mark's deals, here is Bloomberg's response.  Please pass this info to all 
of our traders.  Please let me know what the response is from them.

Thanks

Evelyn, as of April 16, 2001 our charge for Spot trades is a flat fee of
$15/trade.

I think she'd do that. Her parents are out of town right now, so she's 
house/cat-sitting for them. I don't know when they get back, but let me check 
with her because it could get a little hectic if she had to be on the 
opposite ends of town everyday. I'll let you know.

It's been changed to Avista.

I've changed the counterparty name to The City of Oakland - and the contact 
is Wing Lau. His number is (510) 627-1457. According to Stewart Rosman, the 
middle marketer who did this deal, City of Oakland is the same entity as Port 
of Oakland; however, City is the counterparty name in the system which is 
linked with the correct contact info. I tried to look up the contract in 
Livelink, but I keep getting an error message. Is there any way you can check 
on this contract to make sure we're entering these deals with the correct 
counterparty name?

Thanks,

Here's the correspondence between Evelyn in the Houston Confirms group and

change was ever negotiated with Enron.

Yes - I was also going to mention that I talked with Christian Yoder about 
this, and he confirmed that the counterparty name in the contract is The City 
of Oakland, a municipal corporation acting by and through its Port of Oakland 
board, and on and on and on. So we'll be using that name, NOT the Port of 
Oakland, when doing deals with this counterparty. And out of curiosity, does 
anyone you know of trade with simply the Port of Oakland?

Thanks for following up,

For some reason, the time management function on eHRonline won't allow me to 
log in. It says the user is locked and to please notify the person 
responsible. I'm using the user ID and password you gave me, so I don't know 
what I'm doing wrong. This is not an urgent matter - just respond whenever 
you have time.

Bob Badeer changed the time zone in one of these deals - apparently that's 
what was throwing off the MW totals. So 458406 and 458405 should match now.

From Les Rawson:

Here's the list of current Service's Desk customers we sell as Unit 
Contingent. We want to confirm the sales but not the purchases.

Lv Cogen. located within Nevada Power service territory.

Saguaro Power Company located within Nevada Power service territory.

Unit ID: Saguaro Power unit located in Henderson Nevada.

Sale Points: Nevada System, Mead 230, Navajo, McCullough, Red Butte.

Grays Harbor Paper L.P. located in BPA service territory. Behind Grays Harbor 
PUD.

Unit ID: Grays Harbor Paper unit located in Haquiam, WA.

Sale Points: Entire Northwest interconnect.

Willamette Ind. located in PacifiCorp's service territory.

Unit ID; Willamette Ind. Albany Paper mill, located in Albany, Or.

Sale Points: Entire Northwest interconnect.

I think we ran into this problem before where the California schedulers, for 
whatever reason, didn't pull the .8 Riverside deal into their sheet, and 
therefore I didn't see it or add it to the EES sheet. Let me just check with 
Phil on this to make sure he didn't do it for a reason; then I can amend the 
sheet and re-send it. 

And on the Wed./Thurs. generation volumes - I can only assume that Phil spoke 
with Riverside at some point about the change to .55, but again I need to 
speak with him to verify this. He should be in the office soon, and I'll let 
you know as soon as I find out.

Thanks,
Kate

Daniel Kang@EES
04/18/2001 06:47 AM
Hey Kate,

For 4/15 and 4/16, our schedules that we sent you show a Riverside 
Generatioin component of 0.8 every hour (SP15).  This is not reflected in 
your current April update.  The EnPower columns for these days should be 
increased by 0.8 for every hour.  Right?

Also, The generation component that I sent you for Wednesday and Thursday 
(which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality, 
it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside 
and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where 
it had been for a while.  In your current file, you have the correct value of 
0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were 
at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Dan

Here you go, Kim. I've added a couple more counterparty names to your list, 
and made a few minor changes that I thought might clarify the reasoning 
behind and origination of these "no confirm" deals. The one counterparty name 
I couldn't recall was Bonneville - do you remember who requested that we not 
confirm these? 

Please let me know if you have any questions on the additions.

Thanks,
Kate

Kimberly Hundl@ENRON

Hi everyone!

I have begun to document all special situations and counterparties that are 
exceptions to our "not to be confirmed" rules.  Thus, in the future, when we 
need to answer questions regarding why certain deals are unconfirmed, there 
will be no confusion about where the directives not to do so originated.

Please review this document carefully.  Go ahead and make any changes that 
you'd like -but please change your font color so that I will know which items 
you have added.  I will incorporate all of your edits to the master document 
and save it to a common drive where it can be accessed and updated whenever 
necessary.

If you can think of any additional "not to be confirmed" 
exceptions/situations, or more specific details  -please add them.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for your input,
Kimberly Hundl x31647

Just a heads up from Chris Foster -

	
	

The APX called me today.  They are concerned we are sending them confirms on 
deals that we are doing with them.  Legally this is incorrect as we are 
transacting purusuant to the APX Master, not the Enron Master.  So, please 
try to remember to check the box for no confirms when you transact with the 
APX.

This deal is definitely on peak, says Matt Motley. It's a spread trade with 
Natsource, and both are logged in his book as on peak. Let me know if the 
broker still disputes this.

Judy -
I just heard from Kim Hundl in Confirms that you had a discrepancy regarding 
a Short Term West Hourly deal entered for 4/4/01. Deal 570892 was originally 
entered as a buy of 5 MW for hour ending 11. Then the trader extended the 
deal, which is something Real Time traders do often, but when they do they 
rarely modify the deal in EnPower Deal Entry. They simply make the change in 
Scheduling. Because of that, unfortunately, you can only see the true total 
volume of the deal in our scheduling system.

At any rate, I've corrected the Real Time sheet for 4/4 to show the correct 
volumes for the correct hours; and I'm terribly sorry for the confusion. 
Please feel free to call me or e-mail any questions you have regarding EPMI's 
coverage of EES's load. I'm noticing that nine times out of ten, the 
discrepancies originate when Real Time is hurriedly sending spreadsheets to 
you guys and not making sure that they match the deals we have in EnPower. 
Also, I was wondering if you could tell me what database or report you're 
looking at to tie out our deals with your records. I think if I knew more 
about your perspective, I'd be able to help more efficiently.

Attached is the revised Real Time spreadsheet for 4/4. And again, please call 
with questions.

Thanks,
Kate

So, I got the scoop from Phil, and he says that YOU called him and told him 
the Riverside deal would be decreased to .55 from the usual .8 - go figure! 
Also, it looks like Jeremy just missed the .8 mw of generation in the 4/15 
and 4/16 sheets, which in turn I did not include in your sheet. I've revised 
it and attached the spreadsheet, but please let me know if you have any other 
questions.

Hey Kate,

For 4/15 and 4/16, our schedules that we sent you show a Riverside 
Generatioin component of 0.8 every hour (SP15).  This is not reflected in 
your current April update.  The EnPower columns for these days should be 
increased by 0.8 for every hour.  Right?

Also, The generation component that I sent you for Wednesday and Thursday 
(which I sent Monday morning) had a generation component of 0.8.  In reality, 
it was actually 0.55.  I didn't have the generation schedule from Riverside 
and had to assume a value so I assumed it would be 0.8 because that's where 
it had been for a while.  In your current file, you have the correct value of 
0.55.  How did you know this?  Did Riverside call you to tell you they were 
at 0.55 instead of 0.8?  Let me know.  Thanks.

Dan

Melissa -
I think we've finally reached a conclusion on the long term PX Index deals. 
I've entered the following comment in the six deals still in the system with 
Constellation at the old index:

Constellation and EPMI have agreed to leave deal at PX Index. Counterparties' 
positions tie out - index price should not be relevant; however, index offset 
will. Per Bob Badeer, 4/18/01. KS

This is exactly how Bob explained it to me, and he said it was exactly as 
Constellation understood it as well. So if this sounds good to you, I think 
we're set. If not, please let me know and we can make whatever changes are 
necessary.

The deal numbers, for reference, are - 
453152/453175/453294/462109/471888/471889

Thanks for your patience on this,
Kate

Hello, I guess if he wants to leave the deals as they are in the system then 
the accounting group will see zero for an index price and they will see the 
index off set price.  If he and Constellation both agree to do nothing to 
these trades (not to revise the confirms or change the index on the trades) 
then we can put notes in the trades explaining that.  I just want to make 
sure that Constellation agrees with however we handle this.

Thanks for your help,
Melissa

   Kate Symes                04/17/2001 12:28 PM

I asked Bob about these this morning, and he said he's still got to work this 
out with Constellation. The way he explained it, our position is flat with 
Constellation, so for settlements purposes we're okay - i.e. We've bought the 
same volumes that we've sold, and we end up losing a bit due to the index 
offset - but otherwise the index price won't make a difference.  But I 
suspect he's not thinking of the problem from the confirmation standpoint. 
Could you tell me exactly what needs to happen to clear this up on your end 
so that I can explain it to Bob in a way that might make him DO something? 
I'm sorry for the delay on this - I'm getting ready to call Bob's contact at 
Constellation for him.

Let me know what your ideal solution would be. Should we get Constellation to 
agree to the Dow Jones index? Or should we change the deals to forward fixed 
price? We'll fix this today - I promise.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, any news on these Constellation Cal PX trades?  
Thanks,
Melissa
I just talked to Bob, and I don't know if he's responded yet, but I thought 
I'd fill you in anyway. He's been talking to his contact at Constellation 
about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet. 
I've reminded him and he said he WILL talk to the guy and resolve it today. 
I'll keep on it, and let you know when these deals have been changed.

Thanks,

Thanks for your help!

Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
these trades start flowing in July of this year.

The deal numbers are as follows:

453152.01
453175.01
453294.01
462109.01
471888.01
471889.01

Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
I can send a letter for them to sign.

Thanks,
Melissa

I've changed deals 581499 and 581605 to Sierra Pacific Power. They're suposed

Kate, I am changing the forwards to the HOlding Company.  There are 2 
transmission deals with Sierra Pacific Industries that I think should be 
Buy/Resales.  We do not have transmission with either entity.  Can you check 
and see if the counterparty should be changed or they should be Buy/Resales?

Yes, it should have been Sierra Pacific Power Co. I've changed it in EnPower.

One more question, I promise.  Bob Badeer did this deal and entered it as 
Sierra Pacific Industries and I just changed it to Holding Company.  Should 
it have been Sierra Pacific Power Company because the delivery is Palo Verde 
and the Holding Co. deals are all SP15.

Audrey,

Concerning deal #579038:  This was a mistake on my part, the price should in 
fact be $80 (as the APX is showing).  I've fixed the price in Enpower.

Concerning deal #581335:  This trade did take place between Enron and Sierra 
Pacific Industries (not the APX).  I mistakenly put that deal in under the 
wrong counterparty.  I've fixed the counterparty in Enpower.

I will ask Fran Chang to autoschedule both deals.  Let me know if I need to 
do anything further.

Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power 
Exchange, in EnPower. It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower, 
with the same name and contact information. Melissa, I believe you said we 
could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in 
the counterparty list, which Chris has verified it is. Please let me know if 
you need anymore information.

Thanks,
Kate

I'm so stoked you're going to Buena Vista Social Club. I can't believe you 
are such a rotten "bik" that you didn't invite me. What's up with that?

My advice on the Outward Bound thing is to hold off. Not for selfish, 
wine-swilling reasons, of course; but because I know how tiring it gets to be 
living out of a suitcase with no dinero for a period of time. I have to say 
that sticking around Portland for the last six months has given me a renewed 
sense of mental health. Granted, I'm not totally sane yet, but at least I can 
imagine what it would be like. If you came home and turned right around and 
went to Colorado, you'd feel unprepared and maybe a little overwhelmed. Think 
carefully about how much Outward Bound would pay you in comparison with how 
much money you actually need to get by. Then add $500/month to that figure, 
and you'll be about right. It always sounds easier than the reality - I'm 
only speaking from Maui experience here. 

If you want to do a whirlwind Denver thing and have a great, rustic, totally 
broke time, then totally go for it. But if you feel like you're getting to 
the end of your rope with scraping by and feeling unsettled - which it kind 
of sounds like you are - then hang in P-town for awhile. Like I said, I'd 
feel SOOOO much better about taking off on my next adventure NOW than I would 
have even a couple months ago. And it's only been six months since I got back 
- that's not really too long to wait. In the meantime, you don't have to live 
with mom. The Malachowsky's room will be open, although for all the help I've 
given them I wouldn't be surprised if they don't want a Symes there anymore. 
Then there's always my future apartment. I'm thinkin' downtown for sure.

Anyway, we'll talk more about it in Mexico. Don't stress - whatever you're 
meant to do, you'll end up doing whether you like it or not.

Love,
Kate

These are done.

I just spoke with Heather Dunton in Risk, and she said they've had problems 
valuing index forward deals that settle at the last 5-day NYMEX average. So 
to remedy the situation, they're taking a fifth of the volume out of the deal 
each day, beginning five days prior to the expiry date. In this case, the 
expiry date is 4/25/01, so they began with taking 5 MW out of deal 585480 and 
putting it into a fixed price forward deal - 586775. Each day Heather will 
take another fifth of the volume in 585480 and put it into 586775, and she'll 
average the fixed prices each day to eventually end up with the last 5-day 
average. That's the long and short of why this new forward deal - 586775 - 
doesn't need to be confirmed. Our position with Deseret stays the same - it's 
just split between two deals temporarily. 

Please call Heather or me with any questions. She's going to add another 
comment in both deals to indicate the changes she'll be making, so it should 
be apparent to everyone that 586775 does not need to be confirmed at any 
point. When we get to the expiry date, Heather will kill that fixed forward 
deal, since the index price will pull into the system and 585480 will value 
properly.

Sorry for the winded explanation, but I thought it was better to give you 
more than less!

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

Can you check and see why we are not confirming this deal with Deseret?  It 
is on the not to be confirmed list.

You're probably right, Sharen, since the counterparty continues to send 
confirmation letters with FPL Energy Power Marketing instead of Florida Power 
& Light. Unfortunately, the marketer who contacts our trader to transact 
identifies himself as being with Florida Power & Light, which is where I 
believe the confusion is coming from. I'll let the traders know of the 
correct counterparty name, though. 

Thanks for the heads up,
Kate

   
	
	

Can you check with the trader on this deal.  We have had to change several 
deals input with this CP name.  I believe it should be FPL Energy Power Mktg. 
not  Florida Power & Light Company.  I think one is a utility which would be 
local and one is a marketer, who can trade anywhere.

Thanks!

P.S. I changed this deal to FPL.

Hi Rhonda -

I was told you're the person to contact regarding changes in the Enpower 
counterparty list. Several items are outdated or have gone through many 
different versions, and it's made somewhat of a confusing situation for the 
traders and others who do deal entry. My sensitivity to this is heightened 
because I'm new to the Deal Control position here at the Portland West Desk, 
and I'm still getting used to which names we use and which we don't. Monica 
Lande suggested I ask you about it, although she pointed out that if we've 
ever booked a deal under any of these counterparty names, then they need to 
stay in the system. 

I'm wondering if there is any way to weed out some of those extra selections. 
For example, Duke and El Paso both have five different names in the system; 
Arizona Public Service Company has become Pinnacle; and other names were just 
tests that are no longer used. 

Please let me know whenever you have a free moment - this is certainly not an 
urgent request, and I completely understand if the list needs to stay as is. 
Just checking.

Thanks,
Kate

This deal has been changed from Pinnacle West to Arizona Public Service Co.

Thanks,
Kate

I received a message today from one of the brokers at ED&F Mann, who said he 
was waiting on our payment for a Palo Verde futures contract for April. I 
remember something like this happening last month, and I remember you two 
coming to the rescue, which is why I'm asking for your assistance. If either 
of you get a chance on Monday, let's get together and figure out why this 
hasn't been paid, or maybe why it HAS been paid and not received.

I believe the deal in question is 531782 - Long Term Southwest buys from 
Avista for the month of April, price $196, trade date 2/26. Doesn't this seem 
eerily reminiscent of the last contract that ED&F Mann didn't receive payment 
on? Was it Avista that time too?

The contact at ED&F Mann is Martin, and his number is (212) 566-9329. Just 
let me know when you have a moment to talk.

Thanks,
Kate

1. The invention of the french fry would result in an increased demand for 
potatoes - that is, the demand curve for potatoes would shift outward. This 
would result in an increase in price, and a corresponding increase in supply. 
As the supply curve comes up to meet the new, higher demand curve, we would 
actually see an increase in overall demand, supply, AND price. The statement 
is wrong in assuming that increased supply equals a lower price.

2. a. The value of one bottle of beer to me between points A and B is 8 
bottles of soda.
b. I am therefore indifferent between bundles A and B, because they both 
allow me the same frequency of use and same level of satisfaction.
c. Bundle E must include about 216 bottles of soda in order to make me 
indifferent between it and bundle D. This follows from the logic that, when I 
have 100 bottles of soda, it would take about 8 more to make me give up one 
bottle of beer in the bundle. Here I have 200 bottles of soda - I would need 
AT LEAST 8 bottles of soda to make me give up one more beer in another bundle 
with the same frequency of use.

3. Firstly, this legislation produces a disincentive for parents to travel 
with children on an airplane because it increases the already high costs 
associated with flying. Add to this the somewhat more relaxed rules of the 
highway, and you might find more families taking road trips on their next 
vacation. This is a potential secondary effect of the legislation which could 
actually increase injuries and fatalities - secondary because it would not be 
directly associated with injuries caused in airplane crashes, but because it 
would incent people to find other, possibly more dangerous, modes of 
transportation.

4. Auto safety legislation puts constraints on auto makers to make cars as 
safe as possible while still maintaining a profit. It also narrows consumers' 
choice sets when buying a new car. A person buying a car in a country with no 
auto safety legislation might make auto safety a priority in their decision. 
In a country indoctrinated by Nader's book, the choice between whether to buy 
a safe or unsafe car is taken away - all cars are made equally safe. Because 
of this, car-buyers have less incentive to drive safely and more leeway to 
choose their car for other reasons. Soon, safety in a car becomes a moot 
point and the car buyer is only concerned with a good price or other 
incentives. Auto accidents increase because there is no longer an incentive 
to drive safely - legislation has made cars, in consumers' minds, 
indestructible. If cars are indestructible, so then are the people in them.

5. a. My demand curve shows that I would purchase 1 gallon of soda at a price 
just under $10. So when I purchase 5 gallons at $5 a gallon, I am better of 
by $12.50.
b. I can purchase 3 more gallons of Diet Coke when it is priced at $3 a 
gallon than when it's priced at $5. Therefore, I'm better off by $2.50 - a 
gain of 3 gallons times a decrease of $2 divided by 2. 
c. If Diet Coke was free, I'd consume up to 10 gallons of it before it 
wouldn't be worth it for me to consume anymore. My consumer surplus is $50.

6. a. A will sell chairs to B. A can make 5 chairs in the time it takes him 
to build 1 table, while B can only build 3 in the time it takes him to build 
a table. (A's chair-to-table time ratio is greater than B's - 1/2 to 1/3.)
b. A will buy tables from C. C can make a table in only twice the amount of 
time it takes him to build a chair, while A takes five times as long to build 
a table than a chair. (A's table-to-chair time ratio is greater than C's - 5 
to 2.)
c. B will do neither. Since B can make chairs faster (rate of 1/3 for B to 
1/2 for C), B won't buy chairs from C. And because C can make tables faster 
(rate of 2 for C to 3 for B), B can't sell tables to C.

7. a. The equilibrium price is $3.96. 
 -10 + 50P = 200 - 3P
 53P = 210
 P = 210/53
 $3.96

The quantity is 188 textbooks.
 -10 + (50)(3.96) = 188
 200 - (3)(3.96) = 188
 188

b. The sticker price becomes $6.79.
 -10 + 50(P-3) = 200 - 3P
 -10 + 50P -150 = 200 - 3P
 360 = 53P
 P = 360/53
 $6.79

The market quantity stays at 188 textbooks.

c. The sticker price becomes $3.79.
 -10 + 50P = 200 - 3(P+3)
 -10 + 50P = 200 - 3P - 9
 201 = 53P
 $3.79

Market quantity decreases marginally to 179 textbooks.
 
d. If the seller pays $3 per book in taxes, the seller charges $6.79 and 
receives $3.79 per book. If the buyer pays $3 per book in sales tax, the 
buyer pays $3.79 per book. The costs are equal despite which party is paying 
the tax.

e. The government collects $564 ($3 tax times 188 books) in tax revenues for 
this set of terms.

8. a. The equilibrium price is $42.
 -10 + 5P = 200
 5P = 210
 P = 42

The market quantity is 200.

b. The sticker price becomes $210 - t.
 -10 + 5(P-t) = 200
 -10 + 5P + 5t = 200
 P = 210 - t

c. The government takes in a tax revenue of 200t. There are deadweight costs 
associated with this tax because the supply is more elastic than the demand 
for insulin. Therefore, consumers will bear more of the burden of the tax.

9. a. Affects supply; supply curve will increase; price and quantity 
exchanged will increase
b. Affects demand; demand curve will decrease; price and quantity exchanged 
will decrease
c. Affects supply: supply curve will decrease: price will and quantity 
exchanged will decrease
d. Affects supply: supply curve will increase; price will decrease, quantity 
exchanged will decrease
e. Affects supply: supply curve will increase; price will decrease, quantity 
exchanged will decrease
f. Affects demand: demand curve will increase; price and quantity exchanged 
will increase
g. Affects demand; demand curve will decrease; price and quantity exchanged 
will increase
h. Affects supply: supply curve will increase; price will decrease, quantity 
exchanged will increase

Let me know if you have questions on these. I presume Phil talked to you

Apparently it doesn't have any relevance until FSP is up and running, but it 
may affect you guys differently. Just let us know if it's a problem.

A suggestion:

One of the most interesting books I've read recently is called "The River 
Why," by David James Duncan. I believe he's from the Pacific Northwest. It's 
about fishing and religion. Check it out.....if your gigantic FINANCE brain 
can fit it in.

Kate

Hey - have you read "Options, Futures, and Other Geeky Things that Finance 
Nerds Obsess About"?

   
	
	

Kate,

The best books I've read recently are 1) "A Random Walk Down Wall Street" by 
Burton Malkiel and 2) Options, Futures, and other Derivatives" by John Hull.  
Put those in your pipe.

Don't worry about it! I got home and had to shower the day off of me, and by

he and my new roommate Chase and I all had tuna fish sandwiches and 
milkshakes for dinner. It was sooooooo good. And I am soooooo easily pleased. 
It's gorgeously sunny and warm here today, so I might have to go for a bike

After a little more digging, I've found that the deal NYMEX was referring to 
is the same one we dealt with a month ago. I spoke with Tracy Green, one of 
our contacts at Avista, and she had been dealing with the same issue all day. 
Apparently, when Avista first incorrectly reported that we hadn't made a 
payment, it set off a domino effect of doubts that seems to still be falling. 
So NYMEX called EDF Mann, our futures clearing broker, today to assure that 
payment would be made today.

Tracy had been speaking with her broker at ABN-AMRO; I had been speaking with 
ours at Mann; and NYMEX had been communicating through both of these entities 
to us. I've left a message with John Croddock at NYMEX to discuss this 
directly with him. His number, if you'd like it for your own purposes, is 
(212) 299-2146.

Other contacts are Tracy Green, Avista, at (509) 495-8535, and Gary (?), ABN, 
at (212) 859-1212.

As far as Avista, ABN, ED&F Mann, and EPMI are considered, the March Palo 
Verde futures contract has been paid, and paid on time. I'd like to speak 
with John at NYMEX to tie up any possible loose ends on this. Please let me 
know if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thanks for your help,
Kate

You're welcome for my attention to this matter.

   

At approximately 6:30 pm on 4/25 Ruth Ashe with PGE notified Enron that there

503-464-8663 or 503-323-1254.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  

This deal is a placeholder for our futures position that rolled off 
yesterday. We're awaiting our counterparty match-ups, which I asked Jason 
Fischer about yesterday. He said the broker wouldn't have those until today. 
I'll let you know once we've changed the deal accordingly.

Yes - I finally reached someone at Avista who had been working on the problem 
as well. She filled me in on a few things, and I straightened out the story 
with our broker. It turned out to be Avista's fault - they failed to report 
to their broker that we paid them for a futures contract, and that triggered 
a domino effect of payment inquiries. We did pay, and the record shows that.

Thanks for following up!

Kate

   
	
	

I did call you back yesterday on the Avista thing, but you were in a

Hi Kate!
I got your voice mail this morning (I was out sick yesterday).  I did a 
search based on the info you left in your vmail and got deal #531742.  Is 
this the deal you were looking for?  If so, this confirmation letter has been 
executed by Avista Energy, Inc.  Would you like a faxed copy of this confirm?

Here's the latest info. regarding Bloomberg's ability to accept deals with 
Pinnacle West (formerly Arizona Public Service Co.). From now on, we'll enter 
ALL deals with Pinnacle, despite Bloomberg's slow response to the 
counterparty name change. If you never knew that Bloomberg wasn't accepting 
confirms with the name Pinnacle on them, then disregard this message and 
continue as you were.

Rhonda Denton has just informed me that all deals according to Michele 
Chalmers with Pinnacle West  should be traded with the counterparty as 
Pinnacle West not Arizona Public Service.  No deals should be under Arizona 
Public just because Bloomberg is having problems or what ever re-doing the 
contract.   

From this day forward please tell all our guys to please choose Pinnacle West 
not Arizona regardless of what Bloomberg says.  If they have any questions 
please have them contact Rhonda Denton at 853-5871 or Michele 
Chalmers(Pinnacle West) at 602-250-3824.

I've left a message for Stewart Rosman, the mid-marketer who did this deal, 
to find out whether or not he wants this confirmed. Diana Scholtes said she 
thought he did, in which case I need to determine with him what kind of deal 
this should be, and we'd need to confirm the first leg. I'll let you know as 
soon as I hear back from him.

There is a leg 2 for this deal that has come up on the list to be confirmed.  
We did not confirm leg 1 of this deal and I don't think we confirm 
buy/resales as they are like transmission.  Could check into this and let me 
know.

Thanks!

I've changed both of these. Thanks a lot for the info - you know, I went 
through all of this before, even to the point of looking up the contract with

These two deals are in as the wrong counterparty.  I am asking Rhonda to 
inactivate this name so he won't keep using it.  I think it is a real long, 
involved name starting with "the" rather than city of Oakland.  Go figure how 
someone alphabetizes!  Can you check into this.

Thanks!

Just to keep you up to date on this -
I was told to call Larry Joe Hunter today for our counterparty matchups on 
the May futures contracts. I left him two messages, but never got a call 
back. I wonder if he's out of the office? Anyway, I'll definitely get a hold 
of someone tomorrow - if I can't I'll just go straight to the broker - and 
we'll get this deal out of the New CTPY status.

Dear Kate,

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to job shadow with you in Deal 
Control.  I loved your metaphor for the wheels of the clock and how all the 
cogs in the wheels need to match up.  I also enjoyed seeing how "scraps" are 
used and that there is trading between desks within Enron.  You do such a 
great job at being in the moment and keeping your cool when new tasks come 
your way throughout the day.  Your time and patience in answering my 
questions and helping me understand how it all fits together is much 
appreciated.

With gratitude,
Emily

the first time you've seen this delivery point name in a confirmation? Hold 
off on this confirm for just a minute while I go over this with Sean.

Thanks,

Buy from Idaho May Mid-C  peak 25mw at $330.00

Also, Bloomberg sent over some confirmations for deal 595472 and 595473 and 
the location is for unrestricted Mid-C.  Should we have this deal in enpower 
as unrestricted Mid-C because if so it's not a selection currently.   Just 
wondering!!

I was alerted this morning to the urgency with which certain people in the 
Portland office need this information; so I think it might help if they were 
added to the e-mail list for name change/merger notifications. Following is 
the list of Portland West Desk employees to add:

Kate Symes
Carla Hoffman
Jeff Richter
Chris Mallory
Phillip Platter

Thank you so much for your help.

HAPPY THANKSGIVING!

Sean just looked these confirms over, and skimmed our contract with Aquila, 
and he said the language is fine as it is. I guess Unrestricted Mid-C is just 
a reiteration of Mid-C. If this causes a problem with your confirm process, 
though, I would have Bloomberg change it. It doesn't seem like we should have 
to go to the trouble of adding another, redundant delivery point name in our 
system just because that's what they call it. I know that sounds mean - but 
I'm so slammed today I can't help it!

Thanks for your help,
Kate

Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON
04/27/2001 02:05 PM
Yes this is the first time I've seen unrestricted Mid-C on any of their 
confirmations.  Normally they have into Mid-C on the confirmations which I 
know should be Mid-C excluding the into part.  Anyway, I will wait to clear 
this two deals.  Keep me informed.
Below is the two confirms they sent me.

    

   

   Kate Symes @ ECT                04/27/2001 03:50 PM

595511 - buy Idaho, May, Mid-C, 330

And on the Bloomberg confirms re: Mid-C - I'm pulling up the contract through 
Livelink, because Sean wants to make sure the language does not allow for 
curtailment at Mid-C if another unit in the path goes down. He says our Mid-C 
is unrestricted anyway, so we shouldn't need another name in Enpower. Is this 
the first time you've seen this delivery point name in a confirmation? Hold 
off on this confirm for just a minute while I go over this with Sean.

Dear Kate,

Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to job shadow with you in Deal 
Control.  I loved your metaphor for the wheels of the clock and how all the 
cogs in the wheels need to match up.  I also enjoyed seeing how "scraps" are 
used and that there is trading between desks within Enron.  You do such a 
great job at being in the moment and keeping your cool when new tasks come 
your way throughout the day.  Your time and patience in answering my 
questions and helping me understand how it all fits together is much 
appreciated.

With gratitude,
Emily 

Did Chris Foster ever get back to you on this? I had asked him to let you 
know when he found out, but I wanted to make sure the information actually 
got passed along. Let me know when you get a moment.

Thanks,

Please link this CP to Enpower with group link of Power Broker-Houston.  
Please let me know when completed.  Thanks.
P.S. I mentioned this to you, Melissa. But just a reminder that we need the 
default broker fee on this to be $.03.

Thank you!
Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power 
Exchange, in EnPower. It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower, 
with the same name and contact information. Melissa, I believe you said we 
could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in 
the counterparty list, which Chris has verified it is. Please let me know if 
you need anymore information.

Thanks,
Kate

At long last, I've sorted through these deals and determined the source of 
most of these problems. I'll be calling you both shortly to go over these and 
make sure we all see the same thing. Here are a few things to note as you go 
over my responses:

566426 - rates have been changed/has this shown up on your CARP report yet?
578856 - deal done by Real Time trader at hour-ahead market price/will not 
correspond directly to the price shown in my spreadsheet
573862 - rate for this deal should not be $107 OR $168.45/it is an off peak 
sale from EPMI to EES, which means we go by the off peak short position price 
- shown in my sheet as $119.76

The newest deals in this variance list are Real Time. I've double-checked the 
deals in EnPower with what I see in the Real Time spreadsheets, and 
everything seems to match up. I'm attaching those sheets so we can ensure 
we're all looking at the same thing. If you have further discrepancies on 
these, the easiest way for me to clear them up would be if you include the 
specific hours you have questions about.

I'm terribly sorry for the delay in getting back to you on this - it's a 
twisted and time-consuming journey trying to find the source of these 
problems, as I'm sure you know! I hope this gets us up to speed, but please 
call me with questions or comments.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, verballed trade with Powerex, they show trade date as 4/26 as opposed

I just entered an index deal for one of our traders, and came across 
something I hadn't noticed before. In EnPower, we have several choices for 
the Dow Jones Mid-Columbia index, but none called specifically "Mid-C Firm 
Peak." We have non-firm peak, and something called "Mid-Columbia Index." 

I'm just wondering how to specify that I want the deal to settle against the 
Dow Jones Mid-C PEAK index. In this case, because I was entering a 
round-the-clock (all hours, all days) deal, I had to enter three different 
deals to specify the three different indices - Mid-C Peak, Mid-C Off Peak, 
and Mid-C Sundays and Holidays. But I don't see a Mid-C Peak choice, so I 
entered the first as Mid-C Index.

Deal numbers are:
597244 - Peak
597245 - Off Peak
597246 - Sundays/Holidays

I just wanted to ask because when you guys plug the index prices in here I 
want to make sure that "Mid-C Index" gets the peak price. Could you let me 
know if it doesn't? And if that's the case, then I'll need to have another 
pub code set up for peak price.

Thanks for your help on this. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Would you mind e-mailing Evelyn your contact information at the APX? And I

Amy - This is a copy of the job description you sent out to the floor when I 
took the Deal Control position. I've modified it slightly to reflect some of 
my own observations of the position.

There is a position available in Deal Control, reporting to Jeff Richter and 
the Short Term California desk. If you're interested in applying, please 
contact Amy FitzPatrick by (INSERT DATE HERE).

Following is a summary of the responsibilities associated with this position:

To facilitate the entry of West Power deals, including short term and long 
term desks and the services desk, into the trading systems.
Follow-up with Deal Clearing Settlements groups in Houston to verify accuracy 
of trades in the system.  This includes timely follow-up with the traders for 
clarification. 
Ensure that all trades are entered by a daily deadline.
Calculate and report weighted averages of daily price and volume to Dow Jones.
Prepare and distribute daily reports to ensure all books are balanced and 
report discrepancies to management.
Track and report daily and monthly error discrepancies to management and 
deliver reports for possible solutions to rectify errors.
Calculate weighted averages between brokered trades and trades executed 
through Enron OnLine and the Intercontinental Exchange.
Report any technical mishaps to appropriate personnel in Houston and track 
computer problems until demonstrated resolutions.
Test any updated versions of applications requested by programmers and report 
back any adjustments needed.

The most important attributes one must possess to succeed in this position 
are persistance and a positive attitude. Working knowledge of Microsoft Excel 
is essential, as is a general software aptitude.

How does that sound? Let me know if you need more.

Thanks,
Kate

That's strange - I entered these deals for Matt yesterday, and specifically 
typed 2 p.m. into the expiry date. Somehow it changed over, but I've changed 
it back and re-saved it - so it should read 2 PM.

Thanks for catching that,
Kate

it should be 2:00 PM on both.  thanks

I sent you and Brooklyn. Is this what you were missing?

Also, in response to your question about deal 595155 - where we show a buy 
from EES but Brooklyn doesn't show a sale on her side - this deal is shown in 
EnPower as well as my sheet. If you looked in the fixed price column of the 
sheet for 4/28, under SP-15, you'll see a sale for 10 MW hours 6 through 22. 
I'm not sure what it is, but somewhere there's a missing link between us and 
EES, because on my side this deal looks perfectly normal.

I'll also be sending along some revised Real Time sheets per my conversation 
with Brooklyn yesterday - you should receive those shortly. In the meantime, 
look over my sheet and let me know if you see the deal in question on the 
28th.

We will be offering Derivatives I training on-site.  If you are interested in 
attending, please let Amy FitzPatrick know no later than May 21st.

Derivatives I - Applied Energy Derivatives
Presented by Paradigm Strategy Group

Date:    Monday, June 4th and Tuesday, June 5th
Time:  8:00 am to 5:00 pm

This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical 
understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that 
are traded and marketed today.  An emphasis is placed on understanding how 
financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management 
needs of clients.

Participants attending this seminar will be able to:

Formulate customer hedge strategies based on a solid understanding of risk; 
its impact on capital structures and approaches to its mitigation.
Develop and interpret forward prices in the context of arbitration 
disciplines, as well as understand the divergences from these disciplines 
that are characteristic of energy prices.
Identify marketing opportunities through an understanding of both the forward 
curve and the distortions created by the physical system of production and 
transportation.
Assemble the pricing of a transaction from a benchmark price curve.
Devise cost-reducing deal structures for gas storage from an understanding of 
price curves and their components.
Exploit differences in locational pricing with insights into the relationship 
between basis and transportation/transmission.
Structure a natural gas and power swap to hedge a company's risk position, 
explaining its risks and benefits as a risk management tool.
Price a swap from the price curve and customize the structure to meet various 
customer needs including earnings, cash flow and embedded financing. 
Apply basis swaps to either mitigate locational risk or to achieve a more 
favorable risk/reward position by altering the index location.
Attain a fluency in language concepts and hedging application of options.
Package strips of options to create caps, floors and zero-premium collars.
Create structures that provide energy users with sub-index pricing using 
embedded options.
Recognize options embedded in common supply contracts and their pricing 
implications, including swing, double-ups and index contracts with maximum 
prices, etc.

Anytime! I try to at least PRETEND to the traders that we have civilized 
correspondence. Little do they know......

Thanks for letting me know about the change in this deal. I looked at the 
audit viewer, and it jogged my memory a bit. Mike originally entered this 
deal as Q2 off peak; then he came over to me the next day and said it should 
have been Cal'03-Cal'04. So we changed it, and it must have messed up the 
strips somehow. Anyway, if it checks out with the broker, that sounds good 
enough for me.

Thanks again,
Kate

Missing this deal:
Enron sells to Powerex 50 mw MidC light at $150 for 5/2

This is an index forward, so for round-the-clock deals we enter more than one 
in order to have peak and off-peak hours settle against the different index 
prices. 596722 is the off-peak part of this deal, and 596723 is the on-peak 
part.

Let me know if this makes any sense.

Tacoma called and said this is a 24 deal for May 1. We have light load in

I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. 
I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an 
incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). 
Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. 
I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he 
probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter.

Please let me know if you'd like comments added to this deal, and I'll do it 
right away.

Thanks for your help on this,

Help, I'm confused!  Yesterday I prepared a confirmation for three Montana 
Power deals, # 5467244, 597245, 597246.  I sent it to John Malowney and he 
approved it and I faxed it out. Today I noticed two of the deals have been 
killed and two legs added to the other deal.  I think it is the same deal, 
but can someone put notes into the deals saying what they did and why?

Thanks!

Here's the path to the California prices sheet:

P:Trading/California/CAScheduling/Cash/Position/CA/2001/feb2001/Cal Prices

Have fun with that.

Here's the latest -
The Short Term West Services desk bought power from Sierra Pacific Holding 
Co. for 4/29 and 4/30. Then, Bob Ellery, our contact there, called the Real 
Time desk and said they had lost a unit and needed to buy some of the power 
back from us. The deals are in our system as follows:

594854
EPMI buys Sierra Pac.
NP-15
4/29 - 45 mw round-the-clock
4/30 - 40 mw round-the-clock
$218 off peak
$328 on peak

595714
Short Term West Hourly sells Automated Power Exchange (Sierra's scheduling 
coordinator)
NP-15
4/29 - 19 mw round-the-clock
$228
(Total Value = $103,968)

Because Sierra's buy-back was in the Real Time market, we sold to their SC, 
not Sierra itself. Also, confirm letters don't go out on hour-ahead trades, 
which could be why you're running into some confusion. Let me know if this 
helps, and I'll continue to look for a deal flowing on 4/30. The Real Time 
group told me there was one, but it's only for the first 6 hours, not the 
whole day. 

I'll get back to you soon.

Kate, what is the latest regarding Sierra Pacific Industries and the buy 
backs for the 29th & 30th in the amount of $103,968 for each day?  Let me 
know if I can obtain more information for you.  The payment terms are net 5 
days after receipt of invoice, which they faxed to me on April 30th.

Again, thanks for all your help regarding this and all the EES items.

I've added a comment in each leg of 597246 - "Deal modified from three 
separate index-forwards to one deal with three legs." Does that work? And I'm 
checking with John Malowney now to see if the confirm you've already sent out 
will suffice - he's in a meeting right now. I'll get back to you in a moment.

Thanks,

If John Malowney is okay with the confirmation he reviewed, I'm fine.  I made 
the changes he suggested and sent it out, so if nothing else needs to be done 
for the confirmation, then yes, please add some notes in the comment section 
of deal entry about what happened.

Thanks!

   Kate Symes                05/01/2001 06:07 PM

I'm really sorry about the confusion - I actually just got filled in myself. 
I entered these deals for Mike Swerzbin yesterday, but he gave me an 
incorrect delivery point (mid-columbia instead of montana system border). 
Then Cara Semperger, in Scheduling, went in to change the delivery point and 
felt that the deal should be combined into one with three legs instead of 
three separate deals. 

So, in the end, she killed 597244 and 597245, and added two legs to 597246. 
I'm not sure she talked to John Malowney about any of this, otherwise he 
probably would have told her that he already approved the confirm letter.

I just realized I never heard back from Mike on this one - is Powerex still 
saying the trade date is 4/26?

Kate

Stephanie Piwetz   04/30/2001 12:26 PM

Kate, verballed trade with Powerex, they show trade date as 4/26 as opposed 
to our 4/25.  Please check with Mike.  Thanks

Kate, this deal has a new counteparty but it is not in the system yet. Can we

Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
to have the same hours......

I double-checked with Bob, and he said Prebon reported these two trades as 
peak. The other two were in fact reported as off-peak - he just entered them 
incorrectly. But as far as this sleeve goes, there's no way one side is peak 
and the other isn't - Prebon has to make up their minds!

Here's the latest list of unit contingent deals in need of unit names. I've 
tried referring to your unit name list and entering them myself, but it looks 
like some delivery points correspond to more than one unit. I.E. Navajo can 
originate from LV Cogen OR Saguaro Power. If you could add these unit names 
into the deals, or let me know what they are so I can enter them, it would be 
much appreciated.

Thanks,

You have beef-cakes up there? Are they single?

There are some Las Vegas Delight True Beef Steak tomatoes available by Jody's 
desk.

I wouldn't recommend taking ANY of them, as I'm sure they don't taste very 
good. (Yeah, right!) 

Tomatoes are available in limited quantity, so come and get it!

*NOTE* If you get a tomato that is somewhat green, that means it's probably 
not good. You can put it on my desk and I'll take care of it. =o) 
OR, you can keep it on your counter for a day or two and it'll be ripe and 
ready to go! (I recommend doing the first thing...)

To re-cap:

I've changed three Short Term West Hourly deals to reflect what all parties 
have agreed to - EPMI sells to Sierra Pacific Holding Co., HE 23-24 on 4/28, 
HE 1-24 on 4/29, and HE 1-6 on 4/30. Instead of selling to the Automated 
Power Exchange, we'll be using them as the broker, paying a $.03 per MW fee, 
and selling to Sierra Pacific. Following are the changed deal numbers, for 
reference:

595705
595714
595819

I believe this should clear up any discrepancies we had among different 
counterparties' invoices. Now all we have to do is cross our fingers....no, 
just kidding. Please let me know if you have questions, or if problems arise 
from these changes.

Thank you,
Kate

Deal number is 600553.

I notified Jim Fell and Terrell Gault of the delay in getting the documents 
to them, and Jim actually said he had both the Business Plan and the EIS and 
therefore didn't need either. Hopefully the Business Plan will arrive from 
BPA today and I'll send it off to Terrell.

Also, I'm sorry about the errors on the place cards. I was in a hurry to get 
them out to Sir Not-So-Speedy and overlooked those details. I hope it didn't 
cause too much confusion.

Kate

I've checked with Matt Motley and changed 458712 and 458718 to reflect broker 
fees of .0075.

I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin to double-check. He has 457489 entered 
in his log book with no broker fee, but 459812 says nothing either way; so 
I'd like to get ahold of him before I change anything.

Thanks,

Sean has fixed these - the computer picked up the off peak indices for the 
related deals - #465720 and #465723.

By the way, all our traders are inputting their deals now. I know you guys

I've handed this over to Jeff Richter, who will speak with his contact at

however, because if the deal didn't exist there would have been problems in 
scheduling on Oct. 12; and so far we haven't heard anything. I'm sorry this 
didn't get taken care of more quickly, but Jeff was in a meeting this 
afternoon.

Dave -
I'm the new Deal Control staff person here in the Portland office, and I've 
been told you're the person to contact regarding counterparty match-ups for 
our futures deals this month.

The futures were done today, and if you could let me know of the 
corresponding counterparties as soon as you find out, that would be very 
helpful. If there is anything I should know about your job or how we might 
help each other work better, please let me know.

Thanks a lot,
Kate

Mom -
I know how if feels when things start building like that. I'm finding that 
"alone time" is really the only way to cope - especially during the holidays. 
But don't worry about getting upset - you have every right. I am really sorry 
that I haven't helped you with Anna's finances, but I've felt so overwhelmed 
just making it to and from work everyday that I haven't managed to fit in 
much more. Just when I think I might be getting on top of things, I do 
something like lose my glasses, which then takes priority over everything 
else I thought I would finally be able to do, as I cannot see a word I'm 
typing at the moment. IThe madness is neverending! I hope it's comforting to 
know that no one has it anymore together than you do.

Kate

I've got Tim Belden checking on this. His first reaction was that it sould be 
confirmed. I'll let you know as soon as he gets back to me.

Thanks,

I think this deal should have been entered as "no confirm."  Can you please 
change it?  If I am wrong, please let me know. 
Thanks!
Kim 

Just wanted to keep you posted on this deal. You called me earlier and said 
that the counterparty, Deseret, had recorded this deal with Enron buying. We 
entered the deal with Enron selling. I have Matt Motley, Kim Ward, and Tim 
Belden reviewing the tapes of Kim Ward's conversation with Desret last week, 
in which it is clear that she was selling to Deseret. She's spoken with her 
contact there, who still disputes the deal and says we were buying. They're 
all talking it over right now, and I'll let you know as soon as we make a 
decisiion on whether or not to change this deal.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate

Finally! This deal has been deciphered and changed. I killed legs 3 through 
7, which were all inadvertantly entered as forwards instead of index 
forwards. I checked on the Dow Jones Palo Verde index price for those days - 
10/3/00 through 10/7/00 - and verified that 5% was greater than $5.00. Legs 2 
and 8 already reflected the 5% offset, not $5, so I didn't change anything on 
these. The new leg numbers are 420886.52 through 420886.56. If there are any 
further changes to be made, please let me know. Otherwise, thank you so much 
for your patience and cooperation.

Kate,  

A request (below) has been made to fix a deal that was entered by Tom and 
Mark incorrectly (through the option exercise function in deal blotter).  The 
deal numbers and legs that need to be fixed are listed below.  Instead of 
being a forward transaction, these legs should be entered as index forwards.  
We are paying the DJ PV index plus $5 or 5%, whichever is more.  Therefore, 
if daily prices were more than $100 at palo verde, the offset should be 1.05.

I know that i have totally confused you but let me know of any questions you 
might have and I will be glad to help.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim,

The message listed below was previously forwarded to Caroline.  Per
Caroline, I would need to talk to the actual Trader.  Please let me know if
you can help me resolve this issue.
Please call me at ext.  3-6488 if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Katrina

Caroline,

Deal #420886 legs 3-7 have no price attached to the deal.  Would you please
add the DJPV index plus an offset of 5%.  On legs 2 & 8 the offset needs to
be changed from $5.00 to 5%.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank You,
Katrina

I revised it in the text.

Both 457489 and 459812 were logged in Mike's trade book with "no broker fee" 
written in the margin. I checked with Mike Driscoll, who helped Swerzbin 
enter the deals, who verified that these are sleeves of other deals and do 
not require broker fees.

Let me know if Natsource still disputes this.

Thanks,
Kate

Kerri Thompson@ENRON
11/28/2000 12:52 PM
did you even find out about deals 457489 and 459812?

thanks

   Kate Symes @ ECT                11/22/2000 11:51 AM

I've checked with Matt Motley and changed 458712 and 458718 to reflect broker 
fees of .0075.

I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin to double-check. He has 457489 entered 
in his log book with no broker fee, but 459812 says nothing either way; so 
I'd like to get ahold of him before I change anything.

Thanks,
Kate

Kerri Thompson@ENRON

the broker shows the fees on these trades, we have 0.  can you check this out?

I have scheduled a conference call for Thursday, Oct. 19, from 4 to 5:30 p.m. 
Pacific Daylight Time. The call-in information is as follows:

1. 468359 is Mike Swerzbin's deal. He entered it incorrectly in his log. It's 
changed now.

2. 468404 and 468405 - Bob Badeer was given the wrong numbers by Amerex. He's 
changed the deals to reflect Amerex numbers.

3. 468302 is Donald Robinson's deal. I'm tracking him down right now to check 
on the term.

4. 468427 is $177, not $197. Jeff has really bad handwriting. I'll change 
this as soon as the calc is done (about 30 min.).

5. I've left Jeff a message - he's at an off-site meeting today and is 
probably giving a speech right now.l I don't see these deals in his trade 
log, so I really need to talk with him in order to find out whether or not he 
did them and where they might be.

Thanks,

Thanks for the in-depth information on our man of the hour, Ken Lay. I never 
could have imagined he was such a diverse guy - walks on the beach, stormy 
evenings by the fire, kittens, karaoke? Who knew!

Do you think you could find out his star sign for me?

Thanks,
Kate

God, that's so nice of you to thank me. So many of my students just spread 
their little wings and fly away, forgetting that I MADE them goddamit. 
Anyway, I'm glad you had fun in Maui. I honestly think it's pretty much 
impossible not to. I'm getting ready to go back, hopefully at the end of this 
winter when I'm nice and frostbitten, in time to see the whales, which by 
then will be like my family as I will have spent the previous six months 
porking out on turkey and stuffing and washing it down with quarts of eggnog. 

If you're planning any more trips in the future, my full list of city guides 
can be accessed at www.katerockstheworld.com. It's a start-up operation, but 
I plan on retiring in about.....wait, hold on.....I just retired.

See ya!
Kate

You're right. This deal does not need to be confirmed again, says Monica 
Lande. I'll change it in the system as soon as our calc is done today - about 
4:30 p.m. PST.

I'm sorry it's taken me so long to track down this name and number, but I 
finally spoke with someone at Puget who said Suzanne McFadden is the person 
you need to talk to. Her number is 425-462-3844. 

If you need any other information, please don't hesitate to ask.

Can you please get a contact name and phone number for this counterparty from 
Mike Swerzbin as soon as possible? -I need to get a verbal confirm on this 
deal so that we can send out the confirmation letter and the number we have 
in the system has been disconnected.  Also, we're checking on that other deal 
that I asked you about yesterday (I thought we confirmed it under the 
original deal # so I wasn't sure if we needed to confirm it again)
Thanks!
Kim

This deal finally got sorted out this morning. I believe Kim Ward and Matt 
Motley worked out another deal with Deseret to offset their loss on this one. 
But 465821 stands as Enron had it - we sell to Deseret. 

If you have any other questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Steve Thome can be contacted in Houston at (713) 853-5786. His office is 
located in EB 3115.

I'm sorry if I confused you with my e-mail last night, but I think I might 
finally have the futures figured out. Now, instead of one deal number with no 
counterparty name, we now have two deal numbers, two counterparties, and the 
correct number of MW in each. Imagine that! Here is the updated information:

467455
10 MW
175.00
Palo Verde
Southern Company Energy Marketing
Mark Watson

469098
50 MW
175.00
Palo Verde
Sempra Energy Trading
Chris Bennett

I hope this makes more sense; please let me know if there's anything else I 
can do.

Thanks,
Kate

I've got Mike Swerzbin checking on this deal. He says Holli Krebs actually 
did the deal, so he's trying to get a hold of her right now to verify the 
term. I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

When I tried to verbally confirm this deal, the counterparty has this deal 
running for three months, December through February.  Could you check with 
the trader and either change it or have him talk to the counterparty about 
it.  Let me know.

Thanks!

Here are the deal numbers, with correct counterparty names and MW hours. I 
changed deal 467455 and added one new forward:

467455
10 MW
175.00
Palo Verde
Southern Company Energy Marketing

469098
50 MW
175.00
Palo Verde
Sempra Energy Marketing

Hi Kate,
Just checking on this deal.  Is this gonna be an exchange for physical and 
the counterparty name will be added later?  It's been "new" for a couple of 
days now, which is fine, I just wanted to make sure someone is working on it.
Thanks,
Kim

RE: My newly formed case of dyslexia!

I switched the MW hours on these deals. 469098 should have 10 MW with Sempra. 
467455 should have 50 MW with SCEM. These are correct in the system now, but 
I just wanted to alert you to my error.

Thanks,
Kate

I'd like to introduce myself, as I'm sure we'll be in frequent contact in the 
coming weeks while I adjust to my new position at the Deal Control desk here 
in Portland. Please feel free to call or e-mail me with questions, concerns, 
alerts, or suggestions - I'm eager to learn as much as I can about this job 
and take it in new directions. So if there is anything I can do to make your 
jobs function more smoothly, let me know.

As a first order of business, thank you for the heads-up on the new version 
of Deal Entry. A couple of our schedulers have been experiencing delayed 
efficiency with the program  today - I'm not sure if that has anything to do 
with the new version or possibly our Terminal Server connection. Just wanted 
to let you know, in case anyone else has the same experience.

I look forward to working with you, and again, feel free to call me anytime.

Thanks,
Kate Symes

I guess I'll stop picking up random tennis balls off the street and carrying 
them around in my mouth. Bummer!

Thanks - Enron designed that stationary specifically for me. What with my 
penchant for exploding tennis balls and all.

I just heard back from Holli Krebs, who verified that Puget is right on this 
deal - the term should be December through February. I've changed it in the 
system.

Thanks,
Kate

I was just told that we are being sent the Credit Watchlist Update via fax, 
in addition to the one you send me via e-mail every couple weeks or so. Since 
I already receive and print out the list for all of our traders and 
mid-marketers, I thought it might cut down on some work for someone if they 
didn't have to fax it to us as well. I don't know if that person is you, or 
if you might know who I can contact; in any case, Iwe don't need the 
watchlist faxed to the Portland office. (Anything to take one extra step out 
of the day, right?)

Please let me know if I should contact somebody else.

Thanks so much,
Kate

Just FYI - This should cut down on the paper trail a bit.

Kate
Kate,

I was not aware that it was being faxed.  I found out that T Jae Black on the 
East Trading desk was faxing it.  I went ahead and contacted her to let her 
know that there was not necessary.  You should receive an updated Credit 
Watchlist every Monday.  Please email me if you don't receive it.

Thanks,

Well, the origination tickets are up for grabs if you want them. I have been 
informed by Mollie, Oh Holy Keeper of the Tickets, that you must, and I 
quote, "come over here and beg me" if you want to procure free seats to 
tonight's game.

The ball is now in your court. I'd suggest driving down the middle, faking to 
the left, butt-kissing to the right, and taking it straight to the hole for a 
slam dunk. Good luck!

Hey there Mr. Real Time. Looks like you did a deal with Pacificorp on 11/28 - 
EPMI STCA buys 8 MW @ $60 for hour 2. These eight silly little megawatts have 
unbalanced our book and driven the schedulers to near insanity. No, just 
kidding. But I think there should be a sale of 8 MW from Nevada to Mead on 
hour 2 somewhere in there. I don't know - I'm not the expert, which is why 
I'm asking you.

Will you please let Lisa Gang or me know how to fix this. I'm more than happy 
to do it, just wanted to double check with the man who created the mess in 
the first place. (Kidding again.)

I've ordered the 1999 Annual Report for Scottish Power, as I noticed it was 
not in the company file. It should be here tomorrow or Friday at the latest. 
If you need the information sooner than that, I can download the report from 
the company's website, although the document is understandably bulky. Please 
let me know if you'd like a print-out.

Also, if you'd like, I can talk to Sue about CASA's financial needs. Mollie 
and I had discussed splitting the auction proceeds between two charities; in 
that way we can share the wealth and not inundate an organization with more 
than they can manage. It's something to think about in case CASA doesn't need 
much help.

Kate

Thanks a lot for getting that going, John. I'm sure it'll make Carla happy

Bob does not recognize these deals, and tried to check with the broker. He'll 
talk to TFS in the morning to verify these and I'll let you know ASAP.

I have re-scheduled your conference call for Thursday, Oct. 20, from 10 to 
11:30 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time.

Dial-in number: 1-888-476-3762
Host code: 652393
Participant code: 234986

Should you have any questions, don't hesitate to call me at 503-464-3748.

Kate

Yes, this is correct. Les Rawson, our services guy, did this deal which he 
explained is a little strange because the company we're buying generation 
from didn't want to provide firm energy, so we're selling the unit contingent 
instead of firm to Avista. Anyway, that's how he tried to explain it to me. I 
hope that helps.

Thanks,
Kate

P.S. Although the energy is correct in these deals, the days are not. I'll be 
changing 471884 and 471891 to reflect Mon. through Sat. on peak hours instead 
of M-S, Sundays and Holidays, on peak.

   
	
	

These two deals have the energy type as unit contingent.  Could you check and 
make sure this is correct?
#471884 and #471891

Thanks!

Yeah - I pretty much became part of the furniture yesterday as I recouped 
from the brutality of that weekend. I ended up at a random friend's house at 
about 4 a.m., then proceeded to down a couple beers and head for bed at about 
6:30. I could not believe it when my alarm went off this morning - it's a 
cruel, cruel world when you've got a social schedule like ours. But I 
definitely had a good time Saturday, despite the fact that I was ditched by 
my ride and locked out of my house, which is never fun after a dozen 
cocktails. All in all, though, great party.

These two deals are with APB, not Amerex. I've changed them in the system. 
Thanks for the heads up.

Oops, and one more thing. The price on this is entered both in Jeff's trade 
log and in Deal Entry as $214.95. I verified that with Chris Mallory, who's 
working on the California desk today. If Prebon still has a discrepancy, let

I actually did get that last e-mail, but somehow it ended up buried at the 
bottom of my in-box, just like so many other things. As far as the Blazer 
ticket trade, I believe I bought a call from you on the Laker game, and you 
bought the option from me on the Cavaliers - so I can choose to exercise on 
12/13 at 7 p.m., and you can choose to exercise on 1/16 at 7 p.m. In other 
words, no matter what happens, I'm going to both games. Got it?

As far as good stories from that night, I probably have the best, or at least 
one of the more hilarious, of those circulating the floor. And no, it has 
nothing to do with me. Ask me about it later, and I might be able to give it 
up for firm delivery of a seat at next week's game. Think about it.

Kate

I don't know if this is at all what you were looking for. Jessica's version 
will probably work better.

As you may have gathered by now, the West Origination Group has purchased 
season tickets to see the Portland Trail Blazers on their path to 
championship glory. We have four seats which will be used primarily to 
entertain customers and foster outside business relationships. 

Please look over the attached schedule and determine the game dates you would 
like to reserve. Tickets will be distributed on a first-come first-serve 
basis, so be sure to plan as far in advance as possible. Games that have not 
been reserved as of three days prior will be distributed internally or given 
to outside parties. 

If you have any questions or would like to reserve tickets, please contact 
Blazer Command Central by e-mail, telephone, or in person. Include the date 
of the games you would like to go to and the name of the customers you will 
be taking.

Just curious - did you ever catch up with Larry Joe Hunter regarding the Long 
Term Southwest desk's futures deal with Sempra? I'm wondering if I should 
grab Matt Motley before he goes home today to let him know he needs to get a 
hold of Tim Cannon about the ADT. Let me know when and if you talk to him.

Thanks,
Kate

I realize this is late notice, but it just occurred to me that I never 
discussed my Christmas vacation plans with you when I transferred into 
Trading. I have a family trip planned and paid for, so I hope it won't cause 
too much chaos if I'm gone. I understand the tendency for people to feel lost 
and helpless without me.

I'm supposed to be in California with my dad on Dec. 22, then in Mexico with 
my mom from Dec. 26 to Jan. 2. So I basically need to miss four days of work. 
Again, I'm sorry to bring this to you so late, and I'd be glad to do any 
amount of work before or after, or even spend my holiday entering deals on 
the computer in some exotic Central American internet cafe. I've heard 
they're great places to rage.

We can discuss the logistics when you're back in the office. And by the way, 
the flame in this e-mail does not indicate anger, but rather is meant to be a 
festive, joyous, holiday-time explosion.

Kate

How did I turn around and suddenly find myself in December? Why is there a 
man parked outside my office incessantly tooting "Jingle Bell Rock" on his 
horn? When will I ever see my bare feet again? How annoying is it that I 
began this e-mail with lines of whining?

I hope the holidays are at least a somewhat more sincere experience in 
Vietnam than they are here. I guess I don't remember this kind of chaos in 
years past, but then I'm spending a lot more time in the commercial center of 
the city these days. Which, by the way, is going very well. I'm just getting 
to the level of familiarity with my new job that allows me time for pointless 
e-mails. It's been a steep learning curve, and I still have a long way to go, 
but that's what makes everyday interesting.

Other than work, I haven't had time for a whole lot. Thanksgiving was nice - 
saw a lot of friends from out of town and had enough meals with the family to 
satisfy, but not overwhelm, the quality time scale. Our office had its big 
holiday bash last weekend, which I kicked off the night before for no 
apparent reason and just continued the festivities for about 48 nonstop 
hours. There's snow on the mountain, so this weekend I might have to break in 
(or break, whichever comes first) my new snowboard.

Hope all's well on the other side of the world. It's kind of comforting to 
remind myself every once in awhile that there is another side, full of people 
who could care less about power trading and Portland, Oregon. By the way, I 
heard through the grapevine that Clinton was quite a hand-full. Good or bad? 
Or ugly?

Shoot me an e-mail when and if you get a chance. I'm out of here on the 22nd, 
and it will be so nice to see the sun again. If I don't see you, have a great 
vacation, and try not to be overwhelmed by the joyousness of the season.

Kate

This deal is with Mieco. It's been changed.

I've spoken with Tim Cannon at Sempra, who said that what he needed was for 
our broker and his broker to talk to each other and agree that this deal has 
gone physical and is no longer on NYMEX. Then I talked to Matt Motley, who 
talked to his broker, who will now talk to Sempra's broker and hopefully 
solve this once and for all.

You're right though. There's no need for it to be this difficult, especially 
when we do it every month. I think it would be really helpful if we could get 
a hold of Dave Dupre to find out how this was handled before. If we can't, I 
guess we'll just have to determine who will take responsibility for making 
sure these deals are recognized as physical by both parties. I would be happy 
to do that each month when we exercise our futures options, but I want 
everyone involved to be aware of the procedure.

Thanks a lot for helping on this. Please let me know if you find out anymore.

Thanks,
Kate

Melissa Ann Murphy

Hello, I left a message for David Dupre and he has not called me back.  If 
you want to have Matt call Tim Cannon at Sempra that would be fine.  His 
phone number is (203) 355-5190.  I don't know why this has been so 
difficult.  If I hear from David I will let you know.  I want to know how he 
handled these deals in the past.

Yes, Mike would like special language included in this deal's confirm letter. 
I spoke with him and a couple of the other traders, who said that they were 
aware of the change coming in April-02, but weren't aware they needed to 
enter comments in the deal. I'm sending an e-mail out to all of them to 
remind everyone to enter comments in deals that go past April-02 if they want 
special language.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

I got a hold of Southern finally, and Mark Watts is out until Monday. The 
assistant who I spoke to knew pretty much nothing about this, so he said he 
couldn't verify whether or not they would be willing to ADP the deal. But 
according to our traders, they spoke with Mark Watts yesterday afternoon, and 
he agreed to ADP the December futures deal.

If this still seems to be a problem, please let me know. Otherwise I'll plan 
on talking to Watts on Monday.

Done.

In regard to the special delivery point language for April-02 and beyond: 
Please use me as a liasion between the Portland traders and yourselves to 
ensure these deals get entered correctly. The traders are aware that they 
need to specify whether or not they'd like the counterparty to see this 
special language; however, if deals get through to the Confirms department 
without specification in the comments section, I'd like to be notified. In 
this way, we can resolve the matter quickly and efficiently and hopefully 
avoid a larger problem down the road. 

Thanks for your help on this.

deal 475411
Amerex shows location as NP-15 we show SP-15

I wanted to introduce myself and let you know that the Portland West Desk has 
a new person in Deal Control. I'm sure you know from working with Carla 
Hoffman that the position requires quite a bit of communication with your 
group regarding Enpower program development; so if there is anything I can do 
to facilitate the speed or success of your tasks, please let me know. 

The first Enpower question I have is regarding the Enron Online Report. 
Apparently Carla had requested a few changes, which were then put into a 
stage version of the program. I'm wondering if we can get that report into 
production, and more importantly, if we can make a few more minor changes to 
it. Right now I'm running reports by logging on as Carla, which is fine, but 
eventually we'd like to see the EOL report up and running for everyone to use.

I know that Carla and Nicolay have worked on it in the past, and I think it 
would be relevant to talk with them about issues and obstacles they found in 
the report. I look forward to meeting you (via telephone or otherwise!).

Thanks,
Kate

I am missing the following deal for Mike Swerzbin brokered through Prebon:
Enron sells to Morgan 25 mw of Mid-C for Jan'01 at $700.00

This should be changed to CAISO energy. Please let me know what you'd like me 
to do - change the deal or wait.

This deal is in "Pending - revised after sent to Ctrpty" status.  Some 
changes have been made to the deal, but it still has an SP-15 delivery point 
with Firm Energy.  Can you please find out whether it's the delivery pt. or 
the energy type that is wrong?
Thanks for your help!

We are long in Enpower for tomorrow due to a parking arrangement with EPE at 
PV.     We added this deal late,  so make sure that the EPE dispatcher knows 
of this late preschedule of energy to EPE.
We are long the following hours/mws:

He 7-10    3mw's
He 11-22     10mw's

The length is reflected on deal #476644 and this energy should be marketed 
hourly.    We need to communicate early with EPE and make sure that this goes 
as smoothly  as possible.     Once sold,  of course enter the sale( under ST 
SW book)  and route to the length.
This deal is completely ST SW in Enpower and we will share any profits with 
ST SW.

Thanks,
JMF

I know I already discussed time off at Christmas with you, but I have really 
indecisive parents who are divorced and like to do completely opposite things 
for the holidays, so I have one modification to make. If I could take off 
from Friday, Dec. 22, to Tuesday, Jan 2, then I can accomodate both of my 
parents and head off a potentially disastrous fight over which kids go with 
which parents. It ends up being two more days off than I had asked for before 
-  the 22nd and the 2nd. I'm really sorry to ask for so much time off, but I 
wouldn't do it unless my life were going to be in jeopardy if I didn't. Thank 
you!

Kate

It's done!

She didn't "warn" me that you were cheesy, but she did mention you were a 
peach too! And anyway, I love cheesy e-mails.

But since I'm writing, I might as well mention that I have a deal that was 
changed last night by one of our traders, and I think it needs to be 
re-confirmed. It's deal number 476435 - Mark Fischer caught his own error and 
changed the delivery point from Palo Verde to Mid-C. 

And speaking of confirms and all that good stuff, that's one area I was never 
really told about; so if you or anyone else in your group has any information 
to share - anything that I could do to make your jobs easier or to make our 
jobs synchronize better - PLEASE let me know. I'm very humble about how much 
I have to learn, so the more people teach me, the better.

I believe I'll be coming down to Houston after the new year to meet people, 
tour the place, and get a suntan! So if you don't want to call or e-mail with 
every detail, you can compile them all and give me the run-down when I'm 
there. Whatever works for you guys - just let me know.

Thanks a lot,
Kate

Thank you! 

The itemization was absolutely no problem, and please let me know when I can 
do things like that to make your job go more smoothly. I know the market got 
chaotic late yesterday; so I probably could have assumed that our net 
position would be off today and at least one other person would know that. 
But it seems that in this business, assumption can cause a small problem to 
breed and multiply into one of mammoth proportions down the line. So I 
thought I'd ask. In the future, is it you I should come to, or real time?

Thanks again for your help.

Kate

The broker put delivery point in wrong for a second and then changed it. It 
is Mid-C.

I guess EVERYONE is going at a mad pace today, because we just checked with 
the Amerex broker, who said he's in the process of putting that second deal 
in - meanwhile his back office is trying to check out! What the...? So Amerex 
should see the second deal, identical to the first, any second. Let me know 
if they still don't check out.

Don't worry about it. Actually, I kind of like to know what the schedulers 
are dealing with, as oftentimes in the thick of things they're too busy to 
explain to me why and how something I do affects them. It's all about the 
chain reaction in this place, I'm beginning to notice. Heaven forbid I was 
the weak link!

Kate

Yes, but can we call you "with anything"?

Winston Goodbody

If any issues with the scheduling sheet come up this weekend be sure to call 
me any time.

These two are the same deal. We just added TFS in there as the broker - Mike 
forgot that. But we recognize the trade as Cal-01, not Q3-01. Mike just 
talked to the broker, who's going to pull the tapes from Friday to determine 
who's correct, but for now he wants to leave it as Cal-01. I'll let you know 
if we hear otherwise.

Thanks!

I took a message from Pat Brown at Avista this morning. She needed to book 
one more spa reservation for Jean Gonnella. The only time Jean can do it is 
between 3:30 and 6 p.m. on the Thursday they arrive. She would like a deep 
cleansing facial and a french manicure. If there isn't time for both, she'd 
just like the facial. Please call Pat and confirm the reservation time when 
you make it. Her number is 509.495.8123. Thanks!

P.S. I don't want you to think I'm passing the buck. I would have taken care 
of this myself, but Mollie said you had a bunch more reservations to make on 
Tuesday morning. Good luck, and let me know if you need help.

Kate

I've changed 469388 to include a broker fee - trader mistake. Mike Driscoll 
and Swerzbin swear that the other two should not include broker fees. 
Driscoll just checked with the Natsource broker, who cleared this up with his 
back office - so they should agree now. Let me know if there is still a 
discrepancy. I believe the Natsource broker is changing this.

Yes, these are deals 478198 and 478199. Both are entered under Natsource, and

There is an hourly trader named Geir Solberg whose trades appear on our 
reports to be confirmed.  We go into each trade and change them to not to be 
confirmed.   The other hourly deals do not appear on these reports.  I think 
perhaps his defaults are not set correctly.  Can you check with him on this. 
I don't know why his are appearing on the reports and not other hourly deals.

Thanks!  

I've forwarded this message to Geier and Bill Williams III, the Real Time 
manager, who will remedy the problem - probably something to do with deal 
blotter defaults.

Thanks.
Kate

Hi Kate,
We had a deal with Hinson Power Company, Inc. yesterday that we ended up not 
confirming because the comments said that it was a buy-back of part of a 
one-off deal and that Legal would prepare a special confirm.  There are no 
comments entered for these deals that would indicate that they are the same 
type of deal.  Are they?  Should we prepare a confirm letter?
Thanks!

You're booked in Mt. Bachelor from 9:30 to 11 a.m. on Tuesday. I'll swing by

know if there's anything else I can do.

How many times will I have to remind them? Mike Driscoll added comments on 
both these deals - they would definitely like the special language added in 
the confirm letter.

If I don't drink anything, you get a ticket to the Blazers/Lakers game on

Kate

   

So whats the bet for the game on Wednesday?

I thought it might behoove you guys to know about this, even though I am 
unclear as to its meaning myself. Basically, Cara made a change in scheduling 
that she did not change in Enpower, and it has to do with an ongoing deal 
being managed by the short and long term northwest desks. 

In addition, Carla and I zeroed out a deal for Diana Scholtes in scheduling - 
473338 - selling to Modesto at NP-15 for BOM on peak. For some reason, she 
just needed it zeroed out for tomorrow, so we did not change the deal in deal 
entry. If you have any questions, please let me know.

246859 for 15 llh AND 25 llh.

I have zeroed out the 25's from 246859 in Scheduling, and we are flat now.  I 
did not change it in the deal because we were calcing, and I want to check 
with Diana first before doing it.

What I show in Scheduling is a sale to Smurfit for 40 mw flat, which is what 
is actually scheduled

That sounds great. Just let me know when you guys are ready to run the test 
upload. I can validate the deals and help work out any glitches, although it 
sounds like everything will go smoothly.

Thanks for all your hard work on this - having the swaps automated will make 
my job much easier. Now you can kick back and relax before you make my job 
obsolete!

I figured you'd probably see Geir before I do. If so, would you check with 
him on these deals and find out if they should be with LADWPPX or Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power? I have a feeling it's the latter, but I'd like 
to know for sure before I change the deals and eliminate the useless

Correct again....This deal has been changed. Also, I've forwarded these last 
two e-mails to Bill Williams III, Real Time manager, who can talk to these 
guys about using correct counterparty names in deal entry. In the future if 
you see errors or discrepancies in deals done by the Short Term West Hourly 
desk, please send the e-mail to Bill and myself. This will hopefully be a 
more direct way of nipping the problem in the bud.

Thanks for your help.

I've forwarded this to Bill Williams III, Real Time manager, who asked to be

Rhonda did e-mail me about these deals last night. I forwarded it on to the

real time guy using another trader's i.d. because he was waiting for his own 
- I don't think this is the kind of mistake the veterans should be making. At 
any rate, Bill changed the counterparty name and trader i.d. in all of these

I talked to Diana Scholtes last night about this deal, and she looked at it

because it was done for the days when we got hit with transmission cuts, she 
wants to look into it a little further before she changes or kills it. She

Two of these should have fees; two should not.

Add .005 broker fee to:

Sorry for the confusion, Geir. When I got the e-mail from Houston it gave me 
the deal numbers and your name - I didn't even look in the comments section. 
My fault! If you let Porter know the correct counterparty shortname, that 
would be great. Thanks for your help.

Hey

Just for the record I would like to make clear that I did not enter these 
deals. Our new trader  uses my tradee id when I work with him.( He writes 
entered by ......   in the comment section. I will point out the mistake to 
him so we can make sure it does not happen again.

Geir

Mike Swerzbin did not get a confirm from the broker on these deals. They were 
two sleeves done with EES, and Driscoll just entered them. Thanks for the 
heads up. Any other questions, just give me a call or e-mail. 

Kate

First deal is 481433. Jeff Richter entered this awhile ago.

Second deal is 481489. Sean Crandall forgot to put the broker in - he's 
adding that right now.

This deal was a sleeve done for EES, and we've had problems with the trade 
dates on these before. EES reported this trade to us on 12/6/00, and it was 
Matt Motley's understanding that the trade was executed the previous day. He 
doesn't care either way, but he suggested you talk to someone at EES - maybe 
Jubran Whalan or Neil Bresnan - about what their intent was with the date.

In the meantime, I can change the date to 12/4 if you'd like. What would be 
best? E-mail or call and let me know.

Thanks a lot!

Kate-
Please verify trade date for trade 474440.01, we received our executed Enron 
Confirmation Letter back from Powerex Corp and they struck thru our trade 
date of 12/4/00 and placed 12/5/00.  Matt Motley was trader, Jan 2001, 
$375.00, 
Cob N/S.  Please check and I will make note and send to Powerex.   Thank you.

I've changed the term to 12/4, and I'm going to make a note in our daily deal 
correction report that this was due to a late report from EES. Thanks for 
catching this.

Kate

Stephanie Piwetz   12/19/2000 09:02 AM

Kate, below is the EES spreadsheet that has the shows the powerex trade shown 
on 12/4/00.  Please verify and we can backdate the trade and reconfirm the 
document, or we can initial Powerex change and send back to them to show that 
we are in agreement.  Thanks Stephanie

I would be very interested in finding out more about the Deal Control 
position and what it entails. Coming from a background in print journalism 
leaves me somewhat at a loss for practical experience; however, I make up for 
skills in my ability to learn quickly and work aggresively. I'll come by 
sometime today to talk further about this opportunity. Thanks for the notice.

I just got this from Cute Blazer Guy - thought you might like to distribute 
it to the Origination team in case people want to partake in some more Blazer

Les Rawson has spoken with Doug Reiner at Willamette regarding this deal. 
They are in agreement now about the prices. Les said he usually has to 
explain the methodology a few times when he does deals with these guys, so 
it's nothing new. But in the future, Les said he'd prefer to contact the 
counterparty first to avoid confusion. His extension is 3924. You're also 
more than welcome to call me first and I'll track Les down. (I think I'm 
probably easier to get ahold of!) 

At any rate, I hope this clears it up. And if Willamette has any other 
questions, let me know.

Thanks,

Here's the solution I came up with. It will only take a few more minutes each 
day, but I think it will make the EOL summary more relevant. Please let me 
know if this plan suits you - 

1. You will continue to receive the same EnPower/EOL summary, complete with 
EES sleeves. If I take the EES deals out of this table, I have to adjust the 
total megawatts accordingly. This could end up taking awhile, and I'm not 
sure the effect would be worth it. Again, let me know if you agree, because 
I'd like this report to be as applicable as possible.

2. I will run the EnPower deal count, excluding EES deals. I'll compare this 
count to the original one to determine how many EES deals were done by each 
desk, then double that number - to account for both sides of the sleeve - and 
subtract. I'll enter the altered numbers into the graph, which should produce 
a more accurate rendering of the day's activities.

I think I made it sound more complicated than it is. Bottom line, this should 
solve the EES sleeve dilemma with little ado.

Kate 

The deal has been fixed. I'm so sorry about that - when I changed the dates 
at the top, the computer asked if I'd like it to copy the changes into the 
strips. I should have checked to make sure it did this correctly! 

And I will definitely add notes in the comments section of deals I change 
from now on. Thanks for the tip.

Kate

   
	
	

Whatever you changed on this deal, it now reads that it flows 32 hours a 
day!  You have five strips in, each flowing for 16 hours.

Also, when you change a deal, if you could make small note about what you 
changed in the comment section of deal entry, if really makes things go 
faster.  We know what change to look for when we make the revision.

Let me know when it is fixed.

Thanks!

Val and I have finished auto-scheduling these deals. Please let me know if 
you see them coming through approval, or if there is anything else I can do 
to assist.

Hi Kate,
Deals #478168, 478944, 478945, 478946 are to be confirmed by either Greg 
Wolfe or Christian Yoder.  We need to get the final copy of these confirm 
letters so we can scan them into the system for our files.  Also, if the 
finalized confirm has been sent to the counterparty we need to change the 
status in the system.  These deals are still showing up on our "New" report 
every morning and I need to do something with them.
Thanks for your help!

I have just a couple questions about your expense report. Let's go over it 
whenever you get a chance.

Kate

Cara - that was adorable! Thanks for the memories.

Kate

I've forwarded this e-mail to Christian and Greg. Unfortunately, the 
population of the office is quickly dwindling as the holidays come near. I've 
been told that one or the other of them will be in today, and I'll find out 
if something has been sent out already, and if not, how soon we can do that. 
I'll get back to you as soon as I talk to them.

changed the trade date in the first place?

Kate

just fyi, El Paso struck thru our 12/6/00 trade date and placed 12/5/00.  I 
spoke to Chi, of El Paso and he said the 12/6/00 was okay.  I just made a 
note on the confirm and sending it to the fileroom to be executed.

I have changed the following deals to reflect a monthly expiry frequency 
instead of daily:

483753
483759
483765
483766

Since I don't enter options very often, and have only done daily options 
before, I'm still getting familiar with all the different parameters of the 
deals. I'm sorry for the confusion. Thanks for catching that.

Kate

I've heard some mumbling about problems with EES deals, so this doesn't come 
as much of a surprise. Here's what I've done:

On the first deal, #481619, I'd feel more comfortable if Mike Swerzbin, the 
trader who did the deal, gave his okay to change the price. I've left a 
message with him to verify the price, and at the very latest I'll see him 
tomorrow morning.

Deal #480433 cannot be killed because it contains liquidated strips; however, 
it looks like Phil Platter, the Short Term California scheduler, has alreday 
zeroed out the deal. Will this work? Or is there another method by which I 
can go about killing a deal? (Sorry to ask so many questions, but 90% of our 
office is already gone for the holidays and quite difficult to get ahold of.)

I've changed #481620. I think the trader just overcompensated for the change 
back from Daylight Savings Time. I'll remind these guys to always enter PPT 
for the time zone, to be on the safe side.

I hope this solves at least some of the problems for now. I'll let you know 
as soon as I talk to Swerzbin tomorrow. Let me know if there's anything else.

Kate

   
	
	

Happy Holidays!

We have a few problems with deals with EES.  We have tried to get them 
straightened out here, but I think it has come to the traders duking it out.  
Our contact at EES, Judy Dyer has checked these deals with her traders and 
they won't come around to our way of thinking on these deals.

Deal #481619 should be $145.00 even.  The trader says the deal was done 
direct and they are not paying the 5 cent charge

Deal # 480433 should be killed.

Deal # 481620 is not input correctly.  This is another one where the hours 
have been duplicated.  The first strip and the last strip repeat 10/29 for 
the same hours.  This makes the total Mws on the deal doubled by the amount 
that flows that day which is 400.

Thanks and you have a Merry Christmas, ya' hear!

Apparently, these are deals we entered in an attempt to cancel an existing 
contract with Hinson - so they are not actual purchases of power, which I 
believe is where the confusion over the confirm letters began. Christian is 
working on the legal aspect of how best to confirm these "deals," but as is 
so often the case with these guys (and especially around the holidays), they 
slipped out of the office before giving me an answer. So we'll get this done 
tomorrow morning. I'm sorry for the delay!

Thanks,
Kate

AM when I changed the expiry frequency from Day to Month. It's been changed 
now. Thanks for the heads up.

Just to clarify - you are booked in the Mt. Bachelor conference room for your 
Monday morning staff meetings, 9 to 10:15 a.m., from now until this time next 
year. Hopefully this will eliminate any last minute confusion like what we 
ran into this morning. If you have any other questions, please let Mollie or

I'm dragging myself out of this office. I can hardly keep my eyes open, but 
it's well-deserved. Santana concert last night with friends from Ashland. The 
social schedule just never lets up. I don't know how feasible it would be for 
me to spend two months resisting the temptations of hand-holding boys and 
shadowy bars. But I will think seriously about the idea. Have a safe trip 
back home. Oh, and my Christmas plans still stand - gone from Dec. 22 to Jan. 
2. Maybe it's you who needs a schedule rearrangement.

Kate

I just changed both of these deals to CAISO energy, instead of Firm. I 
noticed that the one you asked about, #481620, was part of an EES sleeve, so 
I checked the other side of it, deal #481621, and sure enough it also had the 
incorrect energy type. It's holiday fever!

Thanks,
Kate

Mark's got the price in for deal #484076 as $325. He's gone now, but I 
checked with Tom Alonso, who also trades on the Short Term Southwest desk, 
and he said it's definitely 325. Let me know if the broker still disputes 
this. As for 484077, it's in the system as $350 - is that correct?

Thanks,
Kate

Stephanie Piwetz   12/21/2000 01:39 PM

Kate, 
I called earlier to check out with Prebon, of course all the West guys were 
gone to checkout, I spoke to a broker on the NY desk.
Please check the price of deal 
484076.01 (Mark Fischer)   $325.00  (broker thought price looked like 330.00)
484077.01                                $350.00

Thanks 
Stephanie

Risk is done calcing.

broker has 370.00

The EnPower IT group in Houston is making some changes to the EOL Report 
which in the long run will improve its functionality, but in the interim has 
left it temporarily disabled. I have left a message for Nicolay Kraltchev, 
the IT staff member in charge of the project, and he will be contacting both 
Carla Hoffman and me tomorrow. With any luck, this will be resolved by Friday 
evening and we can resume distribution of the report as usual. I'm sorry for 
any inconvenience this causes.

Thanks,
Kate

While you guys were all busy worrying over the California energy crisis, I 
slipped down to Mexico to conduct an investigation of how our neighbors even 
further to the south are faring. Do they still have lights? Is the AC shot? 
Can they even make a blended margarita?

Seriously, though, I will be out of the office on Friday, Dec. 22, and again 
from Wednesday, Dec. 27 to Monday, Jan. 2. I realize this is late notice; I 
did let Richter know awhile ago, but I probably should have spread the word a 
little further. I am truly sorry.

At any rate (below the price cap of course), while I am gone I would be so 
appreciative if one of you could run the Dow Jones report in the morning and 
the EOL report in the evening. Dow Jones will only need to be taken care of 
from Wed. through Fri. of next week. I will call on those days, and I can 
easily explain the procedure over the phone to those of you who don't know 
it. If I call and you're ridiculously busy, just hang up on me. I'll call 
back later.

The EOL report we have come to know and love is actually being fixed right 
now. I will talk with Nicolay Kraltchev, the Houston IT guy in charge of 
fixing it, on Friday, Dec. 22. It should be up and running again by Friday 
afternoon. Again, I'll call to check in and make sure this works, or explain 
how to use it.

I'll be in the office on Monday, Dec. 25, just briefly to make sure it hasn't 
exploded in my absence, but then I'll be off to the land where tequila is 
better for you than water. Sounds terrible. Please don't hesitate to call if 
you have any questions, or problems, of the work sort, of course.

I'm sorry my reply is so delayed - I was gone for the New Year holiday. This 
deal should have been entered on 12/19. It looks like it's still in there as 
12/20; but I wanted to check with you before changing it. Let me know.

I spoke with Chris, and he said this deal is in the system. He didn't know 
the deal number off the top of his head, but he said Constellation is aware 
of it. Would you like me to research further? Or does everything look okay 
from your end now? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

hey kate,

if this is not taken care of, would you mind following up on it.  
constellation called and is inquiring on a deal that goes with deal 459996 
done through prebon.  there should be another done around dec 1 with no 
broker, buy constellation, jan 01, 100 mw, np 15, index + 3.00.  this deal is 
not in the system as far as i know.  i spoke with chris mallory about this 
situation and i have not heard from him yet.  so that is why i am emailing 
you, i will be out until jan 2, and i just wanted to make sure someone 
follows up on it.  (i think it should be jeff richters deal, but he is out 
also).

my contact at constellation is tom moleatt, 410-468-3620.  i am also copying 
stephanie on this, so she can be your contact here.  hope it is not too 
confusing, but chris knows about this, unless it will already be taken care 
of by the time you return.

thanks!

This was Stan Cocke's deal, and since he just transferred into mid-marketing 
from real time, he's not used to putting the confimation request into his 
deals. This should be confirmed; but since the deal has already flowed, I 
wanted to check with you before changing anything. Please let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

This deal is coded not to be confirmed, but it flows longer than 6 days which 
is the criteria for creating confirmations.  Can you check with the trader, 
and if it should be confirmed, get a contact and let me know.

Thanks!

I'm having Chris Foster check on these deals. Stewart is overseas for the 
holidays and won't be back for awhile, so in the meantime Chris and I will do 
our best to find out which deals he was referring to. Let me know if anything 
resembling these deals comes up on your end.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

Stewart called last Friday and said there would be some deals for the City of 
Roseville to be confirmed.  He did not have deal numbers for these deals, and 
so far, I have not seen any deals for this counterparty.  Do you know 
anything about these deals?  Can check around and see if anyone else knows 
about them?

Thanks!

I have read and understood your e-mail regarding protocol for e-mail and 
files during this time of investigation by the Attorney General. I intend to 
comply with all the policies outlined in it.  I apologize for the delay in my 
response; I was out of town for the holidays.

Kate Symes

Whatever she's making now is not enough. Vickie Aldous went above and beyond 
the call of duty, not only locating, copying and expediting the article to 
me, but all within two days of my request. And it was for a good cause - 
we'll be donating the proceeds from our holiday party/auction to the 
Court-Appointed Special Advocates (CASA). Last year the proceeds went to 
Emanuel Children's Hospital - $20,000 from auction attendees plus matching 
dollars from Enron Corp. resulted in a hefty check.

I'm sorry we didn't connect while you were in Portland. I got the message on 
Monday and figured it was a little too late by then. Hope the reunion went 
well. I'm scrambling to be svelte and successful by my 10-year high school 
reunion, which descends upon me in less than four years. I know I'll need at 
least that much time, having spent four years of my life with that bunch of 
overachieving Catholic girls.

I just had a surprise visit from some Ashland friends on Tuesday, replete 
with an extra ticket to see Santana at the Rose Garden. What an awesome 
concert! I must say I'm thoroughly enjoying city life again. But I'll need to 
come to Ashland soon for a dose of good old-fashioned familiarity.

So, I guess this was the long way of saying yes, I got the article, and thank 
you so much for such indispensible help.

Kate

Chris entered this deal thinking that one was missing from a few days 
earlier. He then realized that the deal was already in, and zeroed this one 
out (instead of just killing it - sometimes those guys are in a big hurry!) 
So I'm going to go ahead and kill the deal, thus eliminating the need to 
change these other details. Does that make sense? Sorry for the confusion.

By the way, how were the holidays for all of you gals down in Texas? I spent 
mine on the beach with a Pina Colada in Mexico, and believe it or not, I'm 
actually glad to be back at work. I was beginning to feel worthless, not to 
mention sunburned. Although any minute now I'm going to be ready for my 
noontime siesta!

Hi Kate,
This deal needs to be changed to no confirm (it's a West daily deal).  Also, 
it has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy.
Thanks!
Kim

Oops - I guess the deal can't be killed because it contains liquidated 
strips. I've changed the confirm status to no confirm, and the energy to 
CAISO - so even though the deal has no volume or price, its other details are 
correct.

This deal is part of a sleeve - we bought Powerex at 145.00 and sold EES at 
145.05. This is standard procedure for these kinds of deals, said the guys at 
the Long Term Northwest desk. They're positive that the deal should include a 
5-cent charge on the sale side; and Mike Driscoll said if EES still disputes 
this, they can call him to verify.

Please let me know if this deal continues to be a problem.

Thanks,
Kate

The holidays for me were really nice.  All my brothers were home so they kept 
me pretty busy.  But it doesn't sound like it compares with yours!  Happy New 
Year!
On another, not so exciting, note, I have another question about the EESI 
deal #481619.  I just spoke with Judy and they say that the price is supposed 
to be $145.00 not $145.05.  Can you check on that one?  It's the only one 
still hanging out there from the mess before the holidays.

According to Bob Badeer, these deals were confirmed by Christian Yoder, on of 
our lawyers. I'll check with Christian to see why, and add comments to the 
deals to denote this. Let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

There are two deals for Avista the are marked not to be confirmed.  Can you 
check into these, and if they are not to be confirmed, put a little note as 
to why or who said not to confirm them, so 6 months from now when someone 
says "Why didn't you confirm this deal!"  I'll have something to jog my 
memory.  (Because I will have slept between now and then!)

Deal Numbers #487050 and 487054

Thanks!

Bob Badeer informed me that these deals have already been confirmed, possibly 
by you. Could you let me know if this is in fact true? If it is, I will go 
ahead and make a note in the comments section of the deals.

Thanks,
Kate

I've changed the deal to be confirmed. Mike Driscoll changed this deal

This deal is entered as not to be confirmed.  It looks like it should be 
confirmed.  Can you check into this and let me know.

Thanks!

I've just spoken with Christian Yoder, who said he's got the confirmation 
letters for these deals on his desk. He's also planning to call you to 
discuss this further - these deals and several others entered as part of an 
EES acquisition will all be confirmed differently than usual. I'm not 
completely clear on the subject, so I'm going to defer to Christian's legal 
expertise.

But if you have any other questions, please let me know. I can certainly sit 
down with Christian and maybe we can all conference call on the subject.

Thanks,

Just in case you're checking your e-mail in between spa sessions, here's an 
update:

The BPA Business Plan has not yet arrived.
Sir Speedy just arrived with copies of the EIS, which were supposed to be 
finished at noon.

So I'm a little frustrated with this lack of efficiency. I've left a message 
at BPA regarding the whereabouts of our order; I've scolded Sir Speedy for 
the delay; and one way or another I'll get the documents out to Terrell Gault 
and Jim Fell tomorrow.

I'm sure the last thing you want to hear while you're escaping from it all is 
that things aren't going according to planned back in the office; but I 
thought you should know just in case you hear from either of these guys. 
Nothing to worry about, though. You can now resume your poolside position.

Kate

I just wanted to check in with you before changing these deals, since it's 
been a few days since your e-mail. Tom Alonso wasn't in the office today and 
I tried reaching him by phone to confirm. These are the prices he has in his 
trade log, so as far as I can tell they are correct. Are you saying that 
these prices need to be switched? Please let me know, and I'll fix it right 
up.

Thanks,
Kate

Chris Foster checked and couldn't find anything regarding these deals. His 
take on it was that if Stewart needed them confirmed, he would have passed 
the message along to someone else or left record of the deals numbers 
somewhere. In the meantime, he said, there isn't much we can do as Stewart is 
in Italy and is virtually impossible to reach. 

If I find anything else out I'll let you know.

Thanks,
Kate

No. It looks like these are all the deals Christian Yoder and our other 
lawyers are working on. Christian is writing up confirms for these, and 
actually has a few of them done. He said he'd be contacting Sharen Cason and 
faxing her copies of the finished letters very soon.

Please let me know if you need me to add comments to these deals to make it 
more clear. I'm going to talk further with Christian and Val Sabo on my end 
to better understand what the DEAL is with these deals, because they've been 
plaguing me all day.

I'll keep you posted on the progress of this, but in the meantime you don't 
have to send revised confirms.

Whew! I've been battling with this thing all day and it's gotten me nowhere. 
The version of  EOL Deal Report I've been using for the past month, and which 
Carla used for several months prior to that, has come down with the winter 
blues and will no longer produce anything. Here is the error message it gives 
me:

Cannot create file c:\eolJF.txt.

It responds this way no matter what combination of requests I give it. One 
interesting detail is that it began doing this on 12/21, the night before I 
left for vacation (thus my delay in dealing with this problem), and on that 
same night I noticed that the report looked different than usual. Actually, 
it looked exactly like the stage version that Nadine and I worked with today. 
It had the new section at the bottom titled "Uncheck 'Desk Summary Only' to 
enable"; whereas the version I had been using did not.

Our IT guys deferred to you on this subject, so I'm still at a loss as to how 
to test the new stage version of the EOL report, as I have nothing to test it 
against. My feeling is that, even though the new version has a few quirks, it 
would be better than nothing and so should be put into production - because 
in the meantime I'm going to have to use it anyway - it's all I have now!

Thank you so much for your support on this so far. Hopefully we can work 
something out tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL 
Report to its former glory. They are making several changes to the report 
which seem to result exponentially in glitches. As of right now the 
application will not create any kind of file with any kind of data; hence the 
absence of any kind of report. I will keep you informed of our progress.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate

The STCA desk will be short 75 MW on peak at NP-15 on 1/4. This is due to two 
sales involving the STNW desk and one involving LTWM which have been zeroed 
out in scheduling but not in EnPower. All three are for 25 MW on peak.

Thanks,
Kate

That is actually the report I'm having problems with. The old EOL JF report 
on your desktop has somehow been replaced by the new stage version. It's 
trying to pull information from the C drive, which does not exist on terminal 
server. Nicolay is working with me to try to figure out why, but most likely 
they'll have to put the stage version into production in order for me to run 
this report again. 

Thanks for the suggestion,
Kate

Matt Motley and Mike Swerzbin both said this trade should be desk-to-desk and 
has nothing to do with Bonneville. Could you send me a copy of the confirm 
letter? They'd like to look at it to try and figure out what trade BPA is 
referring to. If it's a hard copy, you can fax it to 503-464-3740. Thanks a 
lot.

Kate

   
	
	

Hey Kate! I have a trade that Motley did and it shows as a desk to desk 
trade. But BPA sent me a confirmation on the trade. Is this suppose to be 
desk to desk or should the counterparty actually be BPA?

Thanks,

Kimberly Indelicato

The graphs I've set on your desks are the product of a new version of the EOL 
Report. Please look them over briefly and determine whether or not the data 
this report pulled in is correct. I've attached a table of the data as well 
for another point of reference. If there are problems or discrepancies in the 
report, please let me know as soon as possible, and we'll adjust it 
accordingly.

Thanks,
Kate

Thanks! You guys are adorable. When I become technologically advanced enough 
to get a picture of myself onto the computer, I promise to send it over. In 
the meatime, just picture me as a Cindy Crawford type, only thinner. :-)

And on the subject of the BPA deal - I just spoke with Val Sabo, who's 
working with Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden to get this deal done. Apparently it's 
a good deal; it was put into the system and calculated, then taken out and is 
currently being re-negotiated. When Greg and Tim come to an agreement with 
BPA, they will most likely send you a revised confirmation. So in the 
meantime, Val says to hold off doing anything. We'll keep you posted.

Thanks for checking up on this.

Hightlighted word? Your message is a little cryptic; so I'm not quite sure 
what you want me to explain. As for lunch, I just returned. It was delicious, 
thank you.

"Pretty tired" is the understatement of the century. What a way to kick off 
my New Year's Resolution of staying home on weeknights. And things promise to 
only get worse - I think Amber and I are getting a place together. I'm not 
sure I'll survive another month of this kind of social life.

You know, "date with destiny" is getting a little old. Can you come up with 
something more original?

Enron sell to Duke APril'01 NP-15 off-peak at $95.00

They are good deals, but we don't have deal numbers because Mike is out of 
the office right now and said he wanted to check with the broker personally 
before verifying the price. He's aware that the deals will have to go in late 
and be backdated, and that they will not be in his calculation for the day. 
Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

You didn't know that? It's actually Mary Katherine Symes. My parents decided 
that Katherine Mary didn't sound "Catholic" enough; but they still wanted a 
daughter named Katie, so they went right ahead and called me that from the 
day I was born. Needless to say, it's added an unnecessary element of 
confusion to my life in that people are always wondering who the hell this 
"Mary Symes" person is.

Thanks for noticing, though!

Mary Katherine 

Amber and I actually had a successful house-hunting weekend. Molly decided to 
get in on the bargain at the last minute, and as it turns out, finding a 
3-bedroom house is a lot easier and cheaper than a 2-bedroom. We found three 
places in NE that look great, so mark your calendar for the house-warming 
party in a couple weeks.

As far as Vietnam vacations go, I don't see one in my near future. First of 
all, I find it difficult to take either one of you seriously - your favorite 
phrases are "baby" and "poppa" for god's sake. Secondly, I have about 10 
countries on my list of places to go that precede Vietnam. And finally, it 
sounds a little precarious to fly halfway across the world to visit someone I 
hardly know who seems to be in serious denial about his status as a man with 
a significant other.

Other than that, you can tell Chris I'll see what I can do.

Kate

Kate,

I'll lay off the "Date with Destiny" stuff...I was becoming bored with it as
well.  How was your weekend?  Did you and Amber go house hunting?  I had a
great time at the beach with the boys.  Chris asked me to tell you that he
wants you to come to Vietnam.

Take care,
Roberto

It looks like 491916 duplicated a strip contained in 491893. I spoke with

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and

Wait - do you mean 287238 and 287289? Or are we really talking about 487238 
and 487239? I can't find 287289 in the system; but I want to make sure before 
making any moves that I'm looking at the right deals.

Thanks,

Carla Hoffman
01/10/2001 08:42 AM
Sharen,

This price is 29.9 for 287238,  The corresponding deal is 287289 and that 
price has been changed to 29.95 to reflect the .05 cents we are charging EES 
to do this exchange.

As for 487052, I have down here on my list that 487050 is the corresponding 
deal.   I gave the list we had to Kate Symes,  It seems that Bob had 
decreased a few of the buy prices by .05 cents and increased the sell side to 
the original deal price to collect the .05 cent for epmi. 

Please contact Kate with further inquiries.  She will check into this.

Carla

   

According to the audit viewer, you entered this deal.  It is part of the PGET 
acquisition.  The documentation we have on this deal indicates the price 
should be 29.90.  

Also, we have documentation that indicates there should be another deal that 
matches the terms of #487052, but I thought it should be with PGET.  Number 
487052 is with EES.

Can you check into these and let me know.

Thanks!

After researching the position further, I am very much interested in formally 
applying to work in Deal Control. I have spoken with Jeff Richter, Val Sabo, 
and Carla Hoffman about the requirements and responsibilities of the job, and 
I have a good understanding of the kind of candidate they're looking for. I 
feel I fit that profile and am excited by the challenge it presents.

I have also spoken with Mollie Gustafson and Chris Calger, who have given me 
their support in pursuing another opportunity within the company. (Although 
they would be understandably heartbroken.) 

Please let me know at your earliest convenience how to proceed in applying 
for this position. Thank you for your help, Amy.

Kate

These deals are all parts of sleeves we did for EES, and we only include a 
broker fee on the sale side of the sleeve. I ended up changing just two 
deals; they're highlighted in red:

459812 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve)
459813 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side of EES sleeve)

457489 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve)
457490 - no change (sale side already contained .0075 broker fee)

468444 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side)
468440 - no change (buy side)

And as a disclaimer - I'm getting my information from our traders, so if any 
of this sounds incorrect, or if Natsource still disputes, please let me know.

if there is anything else.

Kate

I've had a request from Matt Motley to begin receiving this table on a daily 
basis. Carla Hoffman said Bob Badeer had asked for it before, and for 
whatever reason she held off distributing it to all the traders.

I'd like to know if there is some reason why we don't send the EOL table to 
all the traders on a daily basis. If not, may I copy them on this in the 
future?

Thanks,
Kate

 

This actually makes him look better.

   

This has been changed. And regarding the EES acquisition from the end of last 
year, I spoke with Kim Hundl briefly about it yesterday. I was a little 
unclear about the question in your e-mail to Carla, which was forwarded to 
me. Please give me a call or shoot me an e-mail, and we'll figure this out. 
Tracy Ngo, our Portland credit person, knows all about it, so between us we 
should be able to clarify this.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

This deal has an NP delivery point with firm energy.  Let me know when it is 
corrected.

Looks great, Anna.

 I just received the e-mail regarding your visit to Portland (Monica Lande 
forwarded it to me). Regarding that, I would definitely be interested in 
gaining access to Livelink. Monica explained that Livelink is a system that 
allows one to view confirms, in which case it would greatly benefit my 
position to have access to it. I look forward to your visit, and to working 
with you in the future.

Pwx called this mroning to verbal a deal that  was sleeved with EES.  I do

the deal is Enron Buys Pwx   Q4 2001 25mws   255.00  done direct  trade date

then Enron Sell EES  Q4 2001  25mws   $255.05

Matt doesn't have any trade like this for 1/8. I spoke with Judy at EES, and

Other than the misspelling of my name. Kate is actually spelled M-A-R-Y.

Okay, I know for a fact that Natsource has been yelled at by our traders at 
least once today. NONE of these deals should have broker fees on them. Here's 
the deal....

488121 - no fee
488122 - other side of spread - FEE

495306 - no fee GUARANTEED, says Tom Alonso

495206 - no fee
495207 - other side of spread - FEE

If they still dispute, let me know and I'll sick the traders on them. Sorry 
for the hassle.

Thanks,
Kate

thanks

It looks great, Nadine. I entered a couple different deals and played around 
with them a bit, and I don't see any changes. So from my end you can go ahead 
and move this version to production.

Thanks for all the hard work.

Kate

Hi Everyone,

There is a new version of Deal Entry (Ver. 2.6.6.58)  in stage that needs to 
be User Acceptance Tested.

The changes were actually for Australia (wrong date/time showing, problem 
with EOL) and London (fix to default settings).
These changes should actually be invisible to Houston so you should see no 
difference between the way it was working before and now.

Please test the application (as you would normally use it) and let me know 
(by way of email or phone call) if Deal Entry is working well, and can be 
migrated to Production.  We are hoping to release it to Prod by this evening, 
(January 12, 2001).

Thanks, 
Nadine Costanzo (713)853-9863.
.  

Possibly. And just for your information, I think that request was actually 
three sentences crammed into one, with a misspelling thrown in for good 
measure. Nice.

   

Hey a few of us are going to grab some drinks after work wanna come?

Don't you mean Little Miss Grammar?

   

Yeah you like that?  Aren't you just little miss grammer today!

Okay, it's taken me a while to track down the answer on this, but here it is. 
Apparently Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden just signed off on this confirm letter 
and faxed it down to you guys. Greg wasn't sure whose attention it had been 
put to, but hopefully the word got back to you that the confirm language was 
fine and the deal was signed off on. If you need another copy of the 
agreement, let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

Hey Kate! I received a BPA trade that Mike/Greg did and under Special 
Provisions on their confirmation it reads:

This is a remarket of Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Company power. KAC's 
point-to-point transmission agreement will be utilized. KAC's scheduling 
agent may request changes to the delivery point(s) under alternate point of 
delivery capabilities associated with KAC's transmission agreement. BPA shall 
accommodate the scheduling of such changes.

Is this language o.k. ?

Portland West Desk lawyers have completed the application to become a 
participant in the Dow Jones survey at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points. As 
soon as possible, we would like to begin executing deals against these 
indices. In order to do this, we will need to access to them through EnPower, 
in both Deal Blotter and Deal Entry.

If you could facilitate the addition of these two indices into EnPower, we 
would appreciate having access to them by Tuesday. Please let me know what 
steps we need to take at the West Desk to help complete this process. To the 
best of my knowledge, we simply need the ability to choose the Dow Jones 
NP-15 or SP-15 index in the PubCode list in Deal Blotter and Deal Entry. We 
also need to be assured that when these deals are settled, the correct data 
will be pulled into EnPower from Dow Jones. 

Thank you for your help and cooperation. I will be in touch on Monday.

My oh my - it's a rare occasion when I am greeted by such entertaining 
e-mails in the morning. Thanks for dropping the note, even if it was just a 
covert ploy to get me to deprive your enemies of their electricity. And by 
the way, if I could do that, you can bet we would have already had rolling 
black-outs in strategically placed Portland neighborhoods.

Yes, I did finish the book. It was very interesting, although it did lose me 
for awhile in the middle. It's a super-fast read, so I'm going to send 
another book along with it called "Liar's Poker." I just heard about it and 
it's supposed to be hilarious - an account of the boom and doom of Wall 
Street in the 1980s. I know, I know - Corporate America has taken its 
stranglehold on me, and pretty soon I'll be reading the stock market quotes 
for FUN! But just give it a chance; it's something a little different.

No, Anna did not give me the fair chance I deserved to get "Heartbreaking 
Work..." She is clearly a tramp. I will be procuring that book for myself 
later today, as I do not see any time in the near future when Anna will come 
to her senses and quit being evil.

Anyway, I've got to go control the world's electricity supply now. (This 
statement should be followed by a Dr. Evil type cackle; you know, the one 
that comes after "One Meeeelllion Dollars....") But study up and make us all 
proud. Tell all your roomies I said hi, and study....or pay the price later.

Kate

P.S. What the heck is your address anyway?

I just changed this to 50 MW. Mike Driscoll says he had already changed the 
deal, but must not have saved it. Sorry about that.

Mike Swerzbin traded this deal January 11

I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was 
navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the 
retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. I 
think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I 
borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a 
minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in 
advance for your time.

Kate

So I don't need to do anything in order to be a part of the "cash balance 
plan"? When I pull up my account information from the "Savings Plan" website, 
it says my investments and balances are zero, so I assume I need to enroll in 
this myself if I want to be a part of it. The plan I'm referring to allows 
you to invest up to 15% of your before-tax income in either Enron Corp stock 
or a variety of mutual funds. In this plan, up to 6% of your contributions 
are matched by Enron, beginning one month after your hire date. I guess my 
question is - What is this plan called? And if I enroll in it myself online, 
will I be doubling up on something Enron has already done for me? If this is 
not the retirement plan, what is?

I'm sorry to ask so many trivial questions. I just want to make sure I've 
taken advantage of all the programs and not neglected opportunities because I 
thought they were automatically given to me.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate - 

401K and the cash balance retirement plan are 2 separate plans.  You are 
automatically enrolled in the cash balance plan - you would be eligible to 
participate for the year 2000.  Going forward, at the end of each year, Enron 
will set aside 5% of your salary into an account (Enron directs these 
funds).  This account has a 5 year vesting period meaning that you must stay 
with the company for 5 years to be eligible to receive these funds when you 
leave. 

Does this help?

How goes it, girlfriend? I just got your message - sorry I haven't been in 
touch yet, and I can give you all the excuses in the book about how I've been 
swamped with work, play, life in general, but we both know I'm just flaky, so 
there's no point in explaining it.

Anyway, I'm so excited to hear you're doing well in your new Rocky Mountain 
dwelling, but you left me here with no good pissing and moaning (and getting 
"pissed") buddies. So I checked out airfares to Denver, and found one for 
$118 roundtrip! Can you freakin' believe it? Anyway, you have to purchase and 
use the ticket by the end of March, so I was thinking a little spring break 
action was called for. Do you think you'd be settled enough by the end of 
March to accomodate a portly older sister for a few days? Let me know, and 
I'll do the deal.

Got to go - business abounds at Enron as usual. I'll try to drop you a line 
tonight when I have more time to write. Do you have a phone number? Amber was 
in Denver over the weekend, and she and Monica called me trying to get ahold 
of you, but I had no idea where to look. (Except somewhere in Denver, but 
from what I've heard it's a fairly big place.)

Write back soon, or call - I want to know how the internship is. But more 
importantly, how's the unlimited Starbucks coffee?

Love,
Kate

Just wanted to let you know I haven't forgotten you. All our traders and 
schedulers have been in a meeting this afternoon, and as soon as they got out 
the frenzy of trading and scheduling began again. I'm going to give things a 
minute to settle down, and then ask around as to how people would like their 
Livelink training.

I'll get back to you soon.

Thanks,
Kate

If you could go ahead and fax that to 503-464-3740, I'll have Mike take a

Thanks. Mike's looking it over. Says it's not okay until he talks with

in the middle of a busy trading morning. But I'll call or e-mail as soon as 
they've worked out a revised confirmation.

This question is a bit dated now, but I thought I'd run it by you to make 
sure it's been resolved. Sound familiar?

Kate
	
	

Stewart called last Friday and said there would be some deals for the City of 
Roseville to be confirmed.  He did not have deal numbers for these deals, and 
so far, I have not seen any deals for this counterparty.  Do you know 
anything about these deals?  Can check around and see if anyone else knows 
about them?

Thanks!

Here's the latest I've heard from Willie Harrell, the Global Management staff 
member in charge of this job. I spoke with him briefly, and he said he 
expected to have the indices available in Enpower this afternoon. 

Jeff Richter is currently consumed with sorting out EES discrepancies for 
today, but we'll work on the new spreadsheets this afternoon.

I'll keep you posted.

Thanks,
Kate
	
	

I am currently awaiting the curve codes to be set-up in Enpower pub posting.  
Rates will be posted curve codes are created.  Thanks,  wlh

Here are the absolute, final, once-and-for-all-not-to-be-changed-again vendor 
letters.

You're right - bankruptcy is a likely move for PG&E. But this deal was 
entered in place of an existing position we had with PG&E in the California 
Power Exchange, and it's been approved by our legal and credit departments.

Let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

This deal is with PG&E.  I thought they were going into bankruptcy.  Can you 
check and see if this is a wrong co name or what.

Thanks!

498837 has been changed to Natsource.

499013 - Mike Swerzbin disputes this checkout - has 190.00 price in trade log 
and checked out at that price with his broker at APB. Now they're having APB 
look into it. I'll let you know when they resolve the price.

Thanks!

499013 was changed to a price of 180. Mike is having the broker pull their 
tapes for today, but we won't get that information until tomorrow. In the

I'm so sorry it's taken me this long to get back to you. It's been truly 
chaotic around here with the California situation, and the lawyers are 
obviously preoccupied, so Christian hasn't gotten back to me yet. I finally 
went back to Chris Mallory, and we determined that the language in this 
confirm is fine as long as it matches the confirm language for the original 
deal - 459996. This was the sale to Constellation at index + $1, but now that 
we're trying to clear all our positions with the California Power Exchange, 
we had to buy it back at index + $3. Does that make any sense, or am I just 
rambling? It's been a long day. Check the confirm for 459996, and make sure 
485446 matches up. Otherwise, call me.

Thanks for your patience,
Kate

   
	
	

Kate, did we ever find out if this language for Price on the the 
Constellation confirms was o.k.?

KI

Man what planet did you come from:) Your awesome!

KI

   Kate Symes                01/10/2001 10:34 AM

Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy 
today but would try to get to it this afternoon. In the meantime, I've been 
told by Chris Mallory that the most important issue is that all 
index-forwards get uniform confirmation language. As far as what that 
language is, I'm not sure. Is this different than the confirm letters you've 
received in the past? Let me know if you need me to expedite the process and 
get someone else's opinion.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

Kate, I just faxed over the Constellation confirm just in case you need to 
view it. 

Thanks,

Kimberly

   Kate Symes                01/09/2001 06:51 PM

I've forwarded this message onto Christian Yoder, one of our lawyers. Chris 
Mallory and Jeff Richter suggested I check with Christian first on the 
language of these confirms. I'll get back to you first thing tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

Kate,
I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
confirmations states: 

The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
delivery stated herein plus 3.00.

Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.

Thanks,

Who's ready to rhumba? Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first 
Tuesday of every month. The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music 
and dancing afterward. Cost is $8 for the whole evening. The other Tuesdays 
of the month have live music and dancing, no class unfortunately. Anyway, I'm 
sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on par 
with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.

Do you want to try it out? Next class is Feb. 6. Mark your calendars and tell 
all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come along.

Hi Kate,

For Ref 499391 I don't think this is a good deal because Prebon only shows 
one off-peak deal like this and it is our reference 499390.

Thanks

Just spoke with Sean Crandall - he killed deal #499391. This has happened 
before, and seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter when traders enter off peak 
deals. I'll talk with IT about it; but thanks for catching this in the 
meantime.

Kate

Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON

Hi Kate,

For Ref 499391 I don't think this is a good deal because Prebon only shows 
one off-peak deal like this and it is our reference 499390.

Thanks

I've run across what seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter; although it may be 
caused by the default settings in a specific trader's blotter. A few times 
over the last several weeks, our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk 
have entered off peak deals by choosing the "off" selection under the "Hours" 
heading. But the mask doesn't change to include Sundays and Holidays, and the 
traders then enter another deal to compensate for this. What we've found then 
is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and 
Holidays, round-the-clock hours.

My question is - when you enter an off-peak deal in Deal Blotter, does it 
automatically read that as Mon. through Sat. off-peak hours AND Sundays and 
Holidays round-the-clock? Even though the mask does not change to show 
Sundays and Holidays? I'm just wondering if there is an easier way to assure 
that we've entered off-peak deals correctly other than double-checking them 
in Deal Entry.

Please call or e-mail when you get a chance. Again, this could be just a 
matter of incorrect settings in someone's blotter; but I'd like to make sure 
either way.

Thanks for your time,
Kate

Have fun with this!

What better time to start thinking about the winter holidays than on 
Halloween?!

Just a reminder that our happy little office will be hosting a Holiday Party 
& Benefit Auction on Saturday, Dec. 2, beginning at 6 p.m. and lasting until 
the wee hours of the morning. We hope that everyone will be able to attend, 
which is why we're reminding you while the smell of pumpkin-insides and candy 
corn is still fresh in the air.

We will be holding a benefit raffle and auction again this year, and all 
proceeds will once again be matched by Enron Corp. Donations will be divided 
between Portland's Raphael House, a shelter for battered women and their 
children, and the Court-Appointed Special Advocates, a group that assists 
foster children and at-risk youth throughout the court process.

But who said charity couldn't be a hoot? There will be a pangea of prizes and 
a gaggle of goods for everyone (think Blazer tickets and autographed Blazer 
basketballs!). And a BAND! A swing band! It will prove to be the most 
fantastic Holiday Party this office has ever had....

I just received this update from our good friend Ryan at the Blazers' office.

Mike Swerzbin is going to contact the trader at SCEM - these are good deals. 
They were originally done on EOL, then changed to direct trades. Once they 
talk, I'll get back to you and let you know if they decided to keep or kill 
the deals.

Re: the BPA deals - Sean Crandall said for pricing purposes it doesn't matter 
whether the delivery point is in as Mid-C or NW delivered. The only reason he 
entered NW delivered is because there was transmission involved. For your 
purposes, Sean said it's fine to change the delivery point to Mid-C (NW 
Delivered) in the confirms, but he didn't want to have it changed in EnPower 
because that would mess with the routing.

Does that make any sense? Let me know if you need it changed in EnPower, and 
I'll talk to Sean.

Kate, I have a couple of confirms I received from BPA with the following 
info. I spoke with BPA and they said that their trader had talked to Sean 
Crandall and agreed to Mid Columbia as the Delivery point, however in the 
Enpower they have Northwest Delivered. Could you please check into:

#492613.01, 492612.01, 492611.01, 488524.01, 488523.01 These all say NW in 
the system but BPA has Mid C on confirm

#491609.01 This trade has a trade date of 1/8/01. But on BPA's confirm they 
have a trade date of 1/5/01. Could you ask Mike who did the trade which is 
correct?

Thanks,

We will be short in Real Time Position Manager both at NP-15 and SP-15 for 
1/18/01 until Friday morning. It seems that four deals were entered by EES 
under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs. Following are 
the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out. Read this 
carefully....

SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW
 Deal #500492 - 67.89 MW short off peak
 Deal #500493 - 87.97 MW short on peak

NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW
 Deal #500494 - 102.61 MW short off peak
 Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak

If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal 
entry, by all means get rid of these. Or if you happen to speak with Suneet 
Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell 
him to do the same.

Thanks,
Kate

Carla just changed this deal - must have defaulted to no confirm. We do want 
it to be confirmed, and the deal has been changed to reflect that in Enpower.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

This deal is input not to be confirmed.  Can you check into this and indicate 
why it should not be confirmed.

Thanks!

I see that both of these deals have counterparty contact names in them now - 
did this get taken care of by somebody else? I'm sorry for the late response 
- I was out sick on Friday. Let me know if there's something else I can do on 
these deals.

Kate

   
	
	

There are two deals that do not have contact names.  Can you check with the 
trader and get him to enter names.  The confirmation has to have a contact 
name or it cannot be prepared.

Thanks!

To all of you who are without the luxury of a dial tone this morning:

Qwest Communications is working on the malfunctioning phone circuit. We don't 
know when the service will be reinstated; but in the meantime you can reflect 
on what life was like before the darn thing was invented.

Bell, Alexander Graham 

                b. , March 3, 1847, Edinburgh
                d. Aug. 2, 1922, Beinn Bhreagh, Cape Breton Island, Nova 
Scotia, Can.

                Scottish-born American audiologist best known as the inventor 
of
                the telephone (1876). For two generations his family had been
                recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech 
correction,
                with Alexander Melville Bell's Standard Elocutionist passing 
through
                nearly 200 editions in English. Young Bell and his two 
brothers were
                trained to continue the family profession. His early 
achievements on
                behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before 
his 30th
                birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training.

                Alexander ("Graham" was not added until he was 11) was the
 second of the three sons of Alexander Melville Bell and Eliza Grace Symonds 
Bell. Apart
 from one year at a private school, two years at Edinburgh's Royal High 
School (from
 which he was graduated at 14), and attendance at a few lectures at Edinburgh
 University and at University College in London, Bell was largely family 
trained and
 self-taught. His first professional post was at Mr. Skinner's school in 
Elgin, County
 Moray, where he instructed the children in both music and elocution. In 1864 
he
 became a resident master in Elgin's Weston House Academy, where he conducted 
his
 first studies in sound. Appropriately, Bell had begun professionally as he 
would
 continue through life--as a teacher-scientist.

 In 1868 he became his father's assistant in London and assumed full charge 
while the
 senior Bell lectured in America. The shock of the sudden death of his older 
brother from
 tuberculosis, which had also struck down his younger brother, and the strain 
of his
 professional duties soon took their toll on young Bell. Concern for their 
only surviving
 son prompted the family's move to Canada in August 1870, where, after 
settling near
 Brantford, Ont., Bell's health rapidly improved.

 In 1871 Bell spent several weeks in Boston, lecturing and demonstrating the 
system of
 his father's Visible Speech, published in 1866, as a means of teaching 
speech to the
 deaf. Each phonetic symbol indicated a definite position of the organs of 
speech such
 as lips, tongue, and soft palate and could be used by the deaf to imitate 
the sounds of
 speech in the usual way. Young A. Graham Bell, as he now preferred to be 
known,
 showed, using his father's system, that speech could be taught to the deaf. 
His
 astounding results soon led to further invitations to lecture.

 Even while vacationing at his parents' home Bell continued his experiments 
with
 sound. In 1872 he opened his own school in Boston for training teachers of 
the deaf,
 edited his pamphlet Visible Speech Pioneer, and continued to study and 
tutor; in 1873
 he became professor of vocal physiology at Boston University.

 Never adept with his hands, Bell had the good fortune to discover and 
inspire Thomas
 Watson, a young repair mechanic and model maker, who assisted him 
enthusiastically
 in devising an apparatus for transmitting sound by electricity. Their long 
nightly
 sessions began to produce tangible results. The fathers of George Sanders 
and Mabel
 Hubbard, two deaf students whom he helped, were sufficiently impressed with 
the
 young teacher to assist him financially in his scientific pursuits. 
Nevertheless, during
 normal working hours Bell and Watson were still obliged to fulfill a busy 
schedule of
 professional demands. It is scarcely surprising that Bell's health again 
suffered. On
 April 6, 1875, he was granted the patent for his multiple telegraph; but 
after another
 exhausting six months of long nightly sessions in the workshop, while 
maintaining his
 daily professional schedule, Bell had to return to his parents' home in 
Canada to
 recuperate. In September 1875 he began to write the specifications for the 
telephone.
 On March 7, 1876, the United States Patent Office granted to Bell Patent 
Number
 174,465 covering "The method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or 
other
 sounds telegraphically . . . by causing electrical undulations, similar in 
form to the
 vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds."

 Within a year followed the commercial application and, a few months later, 
the first of
 hundreds of legal suits. Ironically, the telephone--until then all too often 
regarded as a
 joke and its creator-prophet as, at best, an eccentric--was the subject of 
the most
 involved patent litigation in history. The two most celebrated of the early 
actions were
 the Dowd and Drawbaugh cases wherein the fledgling Bell Telephone Company
 successfully challenged two subsidiaries of the giant Western Union Telegraph
 Company for patent infringement. The charges and accusations were especially 
painful
 to Bell's Scottish integrity, but the outcome of all the litigation, which 
persisted
 throughout the life of his patents, was that Bell's claims were upheld as 
the first to
 conceive and apply the undulatory current. In 1877 Bell married Mabel 
Hubbard, 10
 years his junior.

 The Bell story does not end with the invention of the telephone; indeed, in 
many ways
 it was a beginning. A resident of Washington, D.C., Bell continued his 
experiments in
 communication, which culminated in the invention of the 
photophone--transmission of
 sound on a beam of light; in medical research; and in techniques for 
teaching speech
 to the deaf.

 In 1880 France honoured Bell with the Volta Prize; and the 50,000 francs 
(roughly
 equivalent to U.S. $10,000) financed the Volta Laboratory, where, in 
association with
 Charles Sumner Tainter and his cousin, Chichester A. Bell, Bell invented the
 Graphophone. Employing an engraving stylus, controllable speeds, and wax 
cylinders
 and disks, the Graphophone presented a practical approach to sound 
recording. Bell's
 share of the royalties financed the Volta Bureau and the American 
Association to
 Promote the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf (since 1956 the Alexander Graham 
Bell
 Association for the Deaf ). May 8, 1893, was one of Bell's happiest days; his
 13-year-old prodigy, Helen Keller, participated in the ground-breaking 
ceremonies for
 the new Volta Bureau building--today an international information centre 
relating to
 the oral education of the deaf.

 In 1885 Bell acquired land on Cape Breton Island in Nova Scotia. There, in
 surroundings reminiscent of his early years in Scotland, he established a 
summer
 home, Beinn Bhreagh, complete with research laboratories.

 In 1898 Bell succeeded his father-in-law as president of the National 
Geographic
 Society. Convinced that geography could be taught through pictures, he 
sought to
 promote an understanding of life in distant lands in an age when travel was 
limited to
 a privileged few. Again he found the proper hands, Gilbert Grosvenor, his 
future
 son-in-law, who transformed a modest pamphlet into a unique educational 
journal
 reaching millions throughout the world.

 As interest in the possibility of flight increased after the turn of the 
century, he
 experimented with giant man-carrying kites. Characteristically, Bell again 
found a
 group of four willing young enthusiasts to execute his theories. Always an 
inspiration,
 Mabel Hubbard Bell, wishing to maintain the stimulating influence of the 
group, soon
 founded the Aerial Experiment Association, the first research organization 
established
 and endowed by a woman. Deafness was no handicap to the wife of Professor 
Bell. At
 Beinn Bhreagh, Bell entered new subjects of investigation, such as sonar 
detection,
 solar distillation, the tetrahedron as a structural unit, and hydrofoil 
craft, one of which
 weighed more than 10,000 pounds and attained a speed record of 70 miles per 
hour
 in 1919.

 Apart from his lifelong association with the cause of the deaf, Bell never 
lingered on
 one project. His research interests centred on basic principles rather than 
on
 refinements. The most cursory examination of his many notebooks shows 
marginal
 memos and jottings, often totally unrelated to the subject at 
hand--reminders of
 questions and ideas he wanted to investigate. It was impossible for him to 
carry each
 of his creative ideas through to a practical end. Many of his conceptions 
are only today
 seeing fruition; indeed, some undoubtedly have yet to be developed. The 
range of his
 inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in 
his name
 alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators. These included 14 for the
 telephone and telegraph, 4 for the photophone, 1 for the phonograph, 5 for 
aerial
 vehicles, 4 for hydroairplanes, and 2 for a selenium cell.

 Until a few days before his death Bell continued to make entries in his 
journal. During
 his last dictation he was reassured with "Don't hurry," to which he replied, 
"I have to."

I added a fee of 0.0075 to this deal.

Joaner Boner -
Well, in my usual slacker fashion, I haven't bought my plane ticket yet - so 
I totally think you should go to Sunriver. I might come visit you there if 
there's room. But an S.F. visit is imminent, I swear. I'll call you soon to 
discuss the alcoholism of your co-worker/boyfriend, as well as the techniques 
for acquiring this sexy body for the new year. Work is consuming my life and 
eating me whole - very chaotic what with hiding all the power from you guys 
and whatnot. Imagine the pressure. Another reason it might not be the best 
time for me to come is that I'm moving on Friday. Amber and Molly and I found 
a big, beautiful house in NE, near Grant High - it's kickass. But it's sucked 
away all of my money and will probably take over every free moment for the 
next month just to get it set up. If you want, you should stop by for a sleep 
over on your way to Bend. We'll throw a party. And what's up with the wrist 
disease? Are you not taking your calcium or something? I'm convinced that 
these wacky desk jobs are aging us youthful beauties prematurely. At least 
that's the excuse I like to give when I come in to work looking like I just 
bathed in a life-sized ashtray. Call me soon - I'm really curious to find out 
why Brooks is doing the chicken dance EVER let alone in your room in the 
middle of the night. Wheeew!

Happy Sexy Body New Year,

Hey Kate -
My subject line is a duplicate of an email I received this morning from some
beauty .com site.  Steve Cross puts me on all of these stupid mailing lists,
so I thought I'd be retarded and put that in my subject line because it's a
stupid subject!

Anyway, how are you doing these days?  I wanted to write and see if you
really got your ticket to come visit over President's Day weekend!  I
totally want you to come down!!!  I'd be so excited.  If you don't, though,
I think I'm going to look into going up to Bend for the weekend to chill in
SunRiver and snowboard a little!  Maybe you could meet me there and stay w/
me at my parents house?  Ash is going up for sure.  If you're coming down
here, that's GREAT!  I'd be SOOO excited.

I'm on complete crack today, if you can't tell.  I have carpal tunnell, too.
Last night I woke up at 2am to Brooks coming home from a drunken night out
and he started doing the chicken dance in my room and almost knocked over my
entire shelf, tv, etc.  Then he started babbling about nothing, passed
straight out and started totally snoring.  So I didn't get back to sleep
until like 4:30 and had to wake up at 6.  I was livid this morning.  I'm
such a bitch, but I need my sleep!  Dammit.

Anyway, write soon!   I miss you!

Sorry for the delay - it's taken me a while to track down the answer to this, 
because Chris Foster, the trader on this deal, is still unclear as to the 
answer. Basically, the deal keeps getting cut by the Cal-ISO, which is why 
Carla goes in and changes the volumes sometimes. But Chris thinks that in the 
end we might not be cutting the deal financially, just physically on a 
day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent 
out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the 
original one and leave it at that. 

Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting 
with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize 
that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments 
section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to "no 
confirm"? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

This is the deal that was originally in as not to be confirmed and was 
changed to be confirmed.  Well, I have confirmed twice because it keeps going 
into pending status.   The auditor indictes that carla is going into the deal 
and changing something that causes it to go into pending.  Can you check into 
this and find out what she is changing, if we need to keep sending revised 
confirmations, wha'sssss uuup with this deal?

Thanks! 

Could you fax over the original confirm so Chris can look it over and make 
sure we won't need additional language or confirms sent? I just want to make 
sure he's aware of everything that's going on and backs up my comment in the 
deal.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

If you would put a note in the comment section in deal entry, that would be 
great.

day-by-day basis. Given that, we only need the first, original confirm sent 
out - if revised confirms have been sent, let's go ahead and send them the 
original one and leave it at that. 

Chris Foster said he would get back with me this afternoon - he's meeting 
with Real Time and Schedulers right now to sort out this issue.  I apologize 
that this wasn't more clear before. Should I add a note in the comments 
section of this deal to clarify? Or should I just check the deal back to "no 
confirm"? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

This is the deal that was originally in as not to be confirmed and was 
changed to be confirmed.  Well, I have confirmed twice because it keeps going 
into pending status.   The auditor indictes that carla is going into the deal 
and changing something that causes it to go into pending.  Can you check into 
this and find out what she is changing, if we need to keep sending revised 
confirmations, wha'sssss uuup with this deal?

Thanks! 

Diana Scholtes was the trader on these. She's not in today, but Sean Crandall 
said that a 1/8 trade date was okay. I've changed all the deals.

Kate

   
	
	

Kate, BPA shows these trades as 1/8/01 trade date. They are 1/9 in Enpower. 
Could you check with Sean to verify?

Thanks,

Kimberly

It's an Amerex deal. I've changed it.

504017  not there deal

Chris looked these over and we agreed to just re-send the original 
confirmation letter, because the ISO may make cuts again - in fact, the 
revised confirm is no longer correct. I put a comment in the deal instructing 
no revised confirms to be sent, per Chris Foster.

Also, Chris noticed that the counterparty contact name in the letters was 
incorrect. The new contact at ARCO is Alicia Izarraraz. Her number is (562) 
499-3234. I hope this helps.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

This is the original confirmation letter we sent out.

Unfortunately, before I found out anything about all this, I sent out a 
revised confirmation when the deal was changed and went into a pending 
status.  This is the revised confirmation letter that went out.

These are the only two that have been sent to the counterparty.  I have put a 
note into the TAGG system that should let us know not to send another revised 
confirmation.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks for the phone list.  Kimberly Hundl is soooo jealous!

Oh wow - don't tell me you're a NUGGETS fan now! That is so wrong. I can't 
write for long just now because the ever-flourishing energy crisis is keeping 
us all very busy here at The Big Ron, as I so affectionately call it. Right 
now I'm on the cusp of either becoming a raging workaholic or cashing in my 
chips to become a professional beach bum. I know I already tried that and 
thought it wasn't for me, but trust me, one more month of this crap Portland 
weather and I'll ship myself right over to the Caribbean. And yes, I'm 
definitely coming to visit. It won't be for a couple months because this 
house move is going to set me back a bit. Let's just say I'm hoping I'll be 
so poor I'll be forced to lose weight in February. But I'm really excited - 
we move in on Friday - and the house is so cute. You have to at least come 
home to visit sometime so you can see it. I might even bring Kitty over, but 
Molly vehemently opposed the idea, and you know how Kitty doesn't like to be 
unsettled once she's staked her territory. (Big Kitty lives in daily fear.) 
Anyway, call me soon - you can call collect, or call and yelp into the phone 
and hang up - I'll know it's you and call back.

I'm stoked you're liking Denver - I really have to experience this "Rocky 
Mountain High" for myself. Please don't turn into a stoner ski bum and lose 
all fashion sense to the point of mistaking Patagonia and Tevas for catwalk 
wear. Hey, and you need to tell me more about this "normal" guy. You've got 
to watch out for those, you know - that's how the truly psycho ones disguise 
themselves. No, don't listen to me - I'll be bitter and single till I'm so 
old I have to get cats and live out my life like the crazy woman that I am. 
And this obsession with candles? You know you could head that off by setting 
up hundreds and hundreds of smoke alarms all over the house, or tell her that 
you just saw a special on 20/20 about houses burning down via over-decoration 
with candles. 

Hey - do you have a freaking job there? That's the only thing I haven't heard 
about. You must like it or you wouldn't have applied to stay, but I need 
DETAILS, I need DIRT. Call me soon, we'll dish.

Love,
Kate

Anna Symes <annas@cobs.edu> on 01/24/2001 03:14:37 PM
Hey dork!

Just wondering how it's going over there in P-town.  I am doing well.  I
applied for a job here at Outward Bound, so I may be staying here for
awhile.  I met a super-cute guy who I will have to tell you all about - I
think this may actually become a normal relationship or something of the
like.  Michelle and I are doing well, although her decorating style bothers
me a little.  First of all, she's obsessed with candles.  Our living room
looks like the parlor at a whorehouse.  Are you still coming to visit?  I
hope so!

Also, can you send me Monica's phone number if you think of it?  I feel
settled in enough now to call her.  Tell me what's up with you!  Any big guy
stories?  Moved yet?  Let's chat.  Love, Anna

PS - "Go Nuggets!" sounds like someone with a stutter saying "Go Nuts!"

I'm working on a phone list for some of the people I work with in the Houston 
office - kind of a modified version of ours. But I just noticed that my 
information on the floor card has changed since the last printing. Debra said 
I should forward the information on to you for use in the next floor card. 
Here it is:

Ext. 7486
Cell phone 819-2181

And actually, my home phone will change too at the end of this week. I'll 
send that along when I get it. I know this isn't pressing information, but I 
figured I'd let you know before I forgot.

Thanks,
Kate

Please join me in congratulating Kate on her new position at the Deal Control 
desk. She will make the change from Origination to Trading effective 
Wednesday, Nov. 8. We wish her success in the endeavor, even as we are beside 
ourselves at such a loss.

Our new clerk, Theresa Villeggiante, will join the ranks on Thursday. In the 
meantime, please try to ween yourselves away from using Kate's services. 
Direct all requests and assignments to your respective Administrative 
Assistant.  This will help us keep track of tasks and complete them in a 
timely manner.  

Thanks for your help and congratulations, Kate!

Mollie

P.P.S. I just got Monica's number from Amber (for about the 30th time) and 
here it is: (303) 322-5035. Sorry that took so long. Call her now, though. 
She's excited to hear from you.

K

Here's what I threw together this afternoon. Let me know if there are any 
other people in particular you'd like added to the list. Also let me know if 
you try any of these extensions and they happen to be wrong (we have a hard 
time keeping up with changing numbers too!). Forward this on to anyone you 
feel it might be useful to; but please let them know to call me first and 
foremost, since I'll probably be the most receptive on the phone. 

Hope you had a safe trip back home. Again, it was great to meet you and Kim.

Talk to you soon,
Kate

Hey, I'm right there with ya, sister. As far as feeling out of place in a new 
city, it's totally normal. That's how I felt about Maui the entire time I was 
there. I kept thinking I was just picky, weird, anti-social or otherwise 
mentally unstable because I just didn't feel right there. I kept "sticking it 
out another month" because I thought, eventually, the majestic wonders and 
buff tanned men would win me over and I would spend the rest of my days 
frolicking along the white sand, swinging from jungle branches and blissfully 
speaking pidgin. But it just never clicked. I don't really know why; all I 
can surmise is that the lure of familiarity and home is much stronger than we 
know, or would like to know.

It's definitely good to get out of your comfort zone and experience something 
new every once in awhile (Lord knows that's my modus operandus), but I think 
you'll know if Denver is really "your kind of town." In the meantime, just 
take it for what it is - a fun place to be a young, swingin' single. It'll 
take more than a month to adjust and meet people; and even then you might not 
meet the kind of people you're ultimately looking for. Sorry to sound so 
pessimistic - I'm really not - maybe I'll just employ my favorite analogy to 
explain: when you walk into Mimi & Lena, or Fred Segal, or even Nordstrom, 
and you start perusing the racks, how long does it take you to decide whether 
or not you like a shirt or a pair of boots or something? A minute. Seconds, 
maybe. But you don't have to camp out in the store for several hours or days, 
just hanging out with your skirt of choice, to decide if you want to take it 
home with you. Granted, this is a mere item of clothing as compared with a 
habitat, but you get the picture.

Which leads me to my next point - men. Same goes for them. If there are 
characteristics about this guy you find make your skin crawl, it doesn't 
matter if he's Tom Cruise with the mind of Einstein and the social graces 
of....well...some guy with social graces, IT WILL NOT WORK! Run - don't walk 
- away from a situation like this. I have just one word to describe to you 
what can happen with guys like this - BRIAN. He was sooo sweet, soooo smart, 
soooo in love with me, and even tolerable to look at. But soon the walls came 
crumbling down and the level of his cheesiness, which was mild to begin with, 
escalated as he felt me pulling away. It all ended in that debacle we know as 
"Brian's Trip to Portland." It was hauntingly uncomfortable, and all I can 
tell you is, nobody could have warned me. I was blinded by something akin to 
love, but much more akin to an ego-trip, which was what I was on everyday 
with him because he pretty much thought I was God's gift and made sure I knew 
it.....constantly. 

Listen, I have to go, and I've said my piece for the day. I'll try and give 
you a call tonight and we can theorize further on the subject. When you 
really get down to it, you're doing great - exactly what anyone and everyone 
at your age, and mine, is doing - which is basically wondering what the hell 
to do with the rest of our lives. And meanwhile "the rest of our lives" are 
slipping past unnoticed. Just remember the John Lennonn quote, "Life is what 
happens when you're busy making other plans." Now THERE's a real man. Whoa.

Love,
Kate

I checked with Heather, and it turns out this second NCPA counterparty 
shortname was set up to distinguish between two different SC numbers. But 
it's only for internal use - both counterparty names have the same billing 
information, etc. So Heather said the deals are fine as they are. I'm going 
to find out more about this after the afternoon rush dies down - just so 
we'll know for the future when to use which shortname.

Kate

   
	
	

These two deals are entered with a special counterparty name that looks like 
it may have been set up for some special deal.  There is another counterparty 
name out there that looks just the same only without the very last series of 
letters.  I will check here and see if anyone knows the difference.  There is 
a note in the Global System that says Heather Dunton had this CP set up.  If 
you could check with her and see if it should be used for these deals or if 
the other CP should be used.

Thanks!

I checked in Jeff's trade log - he just stepped into a meeting - and 504970 
had been crossed out to show 50 MW. But 505118 only has 25 MW. Does this 
sound correct? I'm a little confused about what you're asking - should the 
deals match at 50 MW on peak? Or is one 25 and one 50?

That sounds fine - in fact, I think in this case that Sean Crandall just hit 
the wrong counterparty name. Since this looks like it might be a problem for 
you guys in creating confirms, I'll let the traders know to be sure of which 
NCPA shortname they're choosing.

Kate

   
	
	

If it doesn't make any difference, I will change these to the other CP name.  
This one is not attached to templates and would need some database changes to 
prepare a confirmation under this name.  If this is not ok, let me know.

I just want to clarify something, because we were here until about 9 p.m. 
last night trying to flatten our position, and just figured out this morning 
that we were off due to the Williams deal that I changed yesterday evening. 
Apparently Jeff Richter didn't do any deals with Williams for 50 MW through 
APB, but he did do one for 50 MW with Prebon. So I'm wondering why APB was 
checking out like this? If possible, I'd like to avoid this in the future. 
Let me know if you can find anything out from APB.

Please check deal no. 500771 under Pinnacle West.  I thought Arizona Public 
Service kept all transmisson.  Please let me know what you find out.

A Real Time guy mistakenly sold to Coral instead of using their established 
PGE transmission deal. 505750 has been killed and the transmission has been 
re-scheduled under deal #146517. 

Kate

Rhonda L Denton
01/26/2001 09:50 AM
Please check this deal.  It is booked under Coral for transmission.  We don't 
have a transmission contract with Coral and we don't usually sell 
transmission.  Let me know.

Pinnacle West is still working on moving all its operations from Arizona 
Public Service Co. to Pinnacle. In the meantime, all TRANSMISSION deals 
should still be made using the counterparty name "Arizona Public Service 
Company." All other deals are made with "Pinnacle" itself. This should change 
sometime in the next month, according to the confirmation group in Houston. 
Let me know if you have any questions.

Kate

Happy Monday - or whenever it is that you are blessed with the receipt of 
this message. A funny thing happened to me on my way to upload the PX deals 
on Friday. I went to process the data and was rudely stopped by an error 
message stating the following:

Error establishing lock on Trader ID and Trader Date: Trader Already Locked 
(_InboxAC11AC92.913Aoc376A1622250.4) 

Interesting, isn't it? So I entered the PX deals manually and went along my 
merry way. Just thought you should know.

This was under the wrong counterparty - it's 506051.

This sequence of e-mails is a little confusing, so I highlighted the parts 
you probably want to focus on in red. Like I said, I've been staring at these 
deals for too many hours now to see clearly what went wrong. As far as I can 
tell, either APB or Jeff Richter was checking out wrong. Now I just want to 
get to the bottom of it! Aaaaaaaa!

Thanks for your concern - that's so sweet of you. I think it's a combination

with a good dose of mid-winter blues. I'm sure a day on the slopes will do me 
good.

Broker is right - deal has been changed.

By the way, I checked out audit viewer on deal 505066, and it showed that I 
had changed the deal from Amerex to APB yesterday afternoon. It didn't show 
any other changed after that - so I've put a call into Duong Luu to figure 
out why the change didn't save, or why it defaulted back. Just FYI.

Sean is entering the first deal as we speak. I will let you know as soon as 
we have a deal number.

Sean said he is sure the second deal was done through Prebon. No one is there 
right now, but he will double-check with them. Again, I will let you know as 
soon as we confirm this.

Thanks,

ISSUE 1
Prebon sent over a confirm for a deal traded 11-9-00 where:
Sean Crandall sells SCEM Dec'00 COB at $107.00 25 mw
I did not confirm this deal with them and I don't see it in the system.

ISSUE 2
Prebon is just now claiming  that they did not do this deal from 11/7/00.  
Can you please check Sean or Dianna book because I have it checked as 
verballed but now they are saying it is not there deal.:
Enron (Sean Crandal) buys from PGET 25 mw of NP-15 for 11/10-11/30 at $95.00

Deal is 507436 - Sean forgot the broker - it's been added.

I can certainly send you this file each day - I hope it can be of some help. 
All the deals it lists are with EPMI Short Term California, which is myself 
or Jeff Richter; so I'm not sure how helpful it will be in determining which 
desk or counterparty you have discrepancies with. While we're on the subject 
of sharing files, though, I had spoken with the confirmation group in Houston 
about the deal file you send them each day. They suggested I ask to be added 
to the list so I can better assist their group in finding discrepancies in 
EPMI-EES deals. If that's okay with you, I would appreciate receiving it.

In the meantime, I'll copy you on the EES sale prices starting tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,
I am in the confirmation group with EES and try to tie out our confirmtions 
with the EPMI list I receive from Kim Hundle (EPMI), on a weekly basis.  This 
file would be great help with this process.  Is there any way you could send 
this to me as well? This would help me determine who the problem is with.  I 
would appreciate it.  
Thanks 
Judy D

Sorry for the slow reaction time - this is the contact information Greg Wolfe 
gave me, and he Sean Crandall confirmed that (he was in the midst of putting 
a Conoco deal in the system). As for why it was taken out of the GCP system, 
I have no idea. If you know of anyone around here who would have called for 
that to be de-activated, let me know. Otherwise, our traders still know Jack 
Wells as the contact. Hope that helps.

Thanks,
Kate

for some reason that contact was inactivated -if that's definitely the 
contact, i'll have gcp re-activate it.  that's strange, i wonder why  it was 
inactivated.  just let me know.

   Kate Symes @ ECT                01/29/2001 12:16 PM

The contact name is Jack Wells, and his phone number is (281) 293-6030. Would 
you like me to enter this info into the deals?

Kate

Kimberly Hundl@ENRON
01/29/2001 08:23 AM
hi kate,
these sean crandall deals need contacts.  can you please get a good contact 
name (and phone #) and i will put in a gcp request to have it added to the 
drop down list in deal entry.
i'm too lazy to press the shift key lately, sorry -no caps.
thanks for your help!
kim

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Thanks!

Thank you for the reminder, Rhonda. I'm going to send out another 
announcement this afternoon to all our traders along with the daily 
correction log. Hopefully this will incite everyone to pay more attention to 
the counterparty names they choose.

Thanks again,
Kate

I have changed the following deals b/c the selected CPs are incorrect.  Also,

507842 should be Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc.

You're definitely not being difficult - it's good for us to know these 
things. I'm going to check with Mike Swerzbin on this - he's the trader on 
347356 - after the morning trading dies down a bit. Just wanted to let you 
know I'm not ignoring you.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

Sorry, I didn't see these deals when I sent the first email.  Kimberly Hundl 
had sent you a note about the contact.  Are these deals like the other two 
deals, and should be confirmed totally separately from the deal #347356.  
Sorry to be so difficult, but we get into trouble everytime we confirm a 
Conoco deal because of the special language that needs to be included on 
deals that are part of #347356, and we never get any notes that tell us 
whether or not it is part of the extension of the original deal.

Thanks!

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only

I've changed these deals to FPL Energy Power Marketing. Chris wasn't aware of 
the difference.  I'm trying to come up with a summary list or some other kind 
of reminder to send out to the traders today. I.E. is FPL part of Florida 
Power & Light? What's a quick and easy way to determine which counterparty 
you're trading with? 

We've just been bombarded with reports of incorrect counterparty names in our 
deals, and more often than not the traders are unaware of or indifferent to 
the difference. For your sake (and ultimately theirs, since these errors will 
start adding up in the daily correction report), I want to develop a more 
efficient system of checks and balances. If you have any suggestions (other 
than asking the traders to wake up and pay attention!) please let me know 
when you get a chance. I'll just be brainstorming today....in between 
changing incorrect counterparty names!

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, I think these trades are suppose to be FPL Energy Power Marketing in 
Enpower. Currently they are in as Florida Power & Light. I received 
confirmations from FPL Energy Power Marketing. Could you please talk to 
Mallory about the counterparty name.

Thanks!

I am missing alot of deals for Mike Swerzbinh and Sean Crandall.  Do you know 
if they are still entering deals?

No, that's fine. But because of the new global standards, we're required to 
produce and report all corrections made on west power deals each day. So I 
was looking into these deals to get trader names, terms, etc., but 3 of them 
wouldn't pull up. 507901, 506767, and 507900 don't seem to be in the system.

This deal has an NP15 delivery point with firm energy.  Let me know.

These deals were entered to flatten out the traders' positions in the PX. You 
shouldn't see the index being used on any deals past tomorrow (the exchange 
closes effective Feb. 1), but Bob Badeer and Matt Motley both had positions 
they needed to back out of. They turned around and bought the same amount at 
the Dow Jones index. Hope this helps!

Kate

   
	
	

Ditto.  These two are priced against the PX index also.

Thanks!

This deal lis entered against the PX index.  We have been told by Chris 
Foster that this index is going away.  Can you check and see if this is the 
correct index?

Thanks!

no way! you look MUCH better than that!

Okay - third time's the charm. After cuts were made by the Cal-ISO last 
night, I sent you a revised volume schedule of our sales to EES for 1/31; 
however, I failed to change the total load at SP-15 to reflect cuts. Now 
you'll see the CORRECT revisions made at all delivery points. Let me know if 
you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate

I just spoke with Sean Crandall, the trader on these deals, and he said the

Gracias!!

I've received some feedback from the Real Time group regarding these 
counterparty discrepancies. Apparently, they were never given notice of the 
correct counterparty names, and chose what seemed to be the most logical 
name. Can we come up with a system or master list of usable counterparty 
names for these guys to refer to when faced with an array of choices? (i.e. 
There are five different names under Transalta.) 

The concern lies with our daily correction report, which I generate and which 
includes all deals that have been changed and the name of the person who made 
the "error." This report can weigh unfairly against a trader who may be 
unaware of the difference between "Dynegy Marketing & Trade" and "Dynegy 
Power Marketing." I feel like there has to be a more efficient way to avoid 
these errors than publishing them in a report that gets sent throughout the 
company.

If you could help me compile this master list, or direct me to someone who 
can, I would greatly appreciate it. 

Thanks,
Kate

FYI
	
	

Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

Thanks!

I forwarded this e-mail on to all our traders to give them a heads up about 
the new process. I did receive feedback from one trader, Mark Fischer, who 
said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name 
was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments 
section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these 
names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted 
to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly 
entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the 
contact name in the comments section.

Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact 
for this or how we can set this up.

Thanks,
Kate

No, this was incorrect. I'll tell you something - Real Time is having

In all the excitement of the day, I completely forgot to check on this deal. 
I know I got a call from one of you guys about the "New Counterparty" Diana 
Scholtes put in here; but I'm not sure now what I was supposed to check on.

Give me a call in the morning and let me know. Sorry!

Kate

I'm not sure if someone else got to this before I did, but I see the same end 
date at the top and bottom of this deal - 6/30/01. Let me know if this needs 
to be changed, or if it's not showing up correctly for you.

Hi Kate,
Please have a look at the term on this deal.  There is a discrepancy between 
the end date at the top of the screen in Deal Entry and the one listed in the 
strips at the bottom.  Is the correct end date 6/30 or 6/1? 
Thanks!
Kim

Here's the long and short of the contact name list. It sounds like now that 
the confirmation group is taking the time to look at all daily deals, they 
might pay attention to daily traders' needs as well. Let's hope.

If you could possibly write down contact names that still aren't in the 
system, I'll send it on to the IT group in Houston and we should be able to 
get them in the system shortly.

Thanks,
Kate
	
	

This probably happened because he is a daily or hourly trader and in the past 
we have not seen these deals to see the notes to add the contacts.  With the 
change in the criteria for confirmation, we will now view these deals and add 
the contacts as they come across.  If anyone has a list of contacts they want 
added, please send the names and the company name and we will put them into 
the system.

I forwarded this e-mail on to all our traders to give them a heads up about 
the new process. I did receive feedback from one trader, Mark Fischer, who 
said that when he began with Enron he was always told that if a contact name 
was not in the system that he was supposed to enter it into the comments 
section. He did this diligently under the pretense that eventually these 
names would be added to the system, but they apparently never were. He wanted 
to let me know of this, especially because when the traders are hurriedly 
entering deals, they probably won't always take the time to type in the 
contact name in the comments section.

Let's see if we can update this list somehow. Let me know who I can contact 
for this or how we can set this up.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

Currently, we do not confirm west deals that flow 6 days or less so we have 
not had to be real difficult about contact names in deal entry.  However, 
starting February 1, we are going to confirm all next day deals in the west 
using the same criteria we do in the east - that is - deals 3 days or less 
are sent on a confirmation that does not require a signature and everthing 
else on a letter requiring a signature.  Hourly deals will not be confirmed.  
So it is very important that the traders fill in a contact name when they are 
entering deals.  The confirmation letter cannot be prepared without a contact 
name.  It stops the whole process.  We are not going to be able to put names 
in every time they do not.  

If they do not see the contact they want in the drop down list,  put the 
correctly spelled first and last name in the comment section in deal entry 
and we will add this contact to the list and it should appear the next day.

If you can help us out with this, maybe we won't have to keep asking you for 
contacts.

Thanks!

I guess the broker resolved this - I checked and it is APB's deal. Let me 
know if there's still a discrepancy.

I've changed it to be confirmed. Chris Mallory usually does mostly daily 
deals, so his deal blotter probably defaults to no confirm.

Thanks,

This deal is entered as not to be confirmed.  It looks like it probably 
should be confirmed.  Can you check into this and see what happened?

Thanks!

I checked with Diana Scholtes, the trader on this deal, and she said the 
counterparty was supposed to be CERS - California Energy Resource Schedulers. 
I've changed the name, but let me know if your records still show California 
Dept. of Water Resources.

Thanks,
Kate

I've added two new swaps to reflect the change from the California PX to the 
Dow Jones index after 1/31/01. The following deal numbers cover the whole 
term of the deal.

404980 - 9/1/00 through 1/31/01 @ PX NP15 Index
512726 - 2/1/01 through 8/31/03 @ DJ NP15 Peak Index
512743 - 2/1/01 through 8/31/01 @ DJ NP15 Off-Peak Index

Both new deals have comments that link them back to the original deal. Let me 
know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Deal 456717 has been changed to reflect Pinnacle West Capital Corp, and the 
traders have been reminded of the name change.

Chris Mallory said he entered the index deal selling to Calpine at about 2:15 
PST today. The deal # is 457473.

Missing the following Index deal per Prebon:

I've changed all the deals I could find that contained the counterparty name 
"California Department of Water Resources - CDWR" to "California Energy 
Resource Schedulers - State of California." The following deal numbers are 
those that have been changed. If you come across other daily deals, most 
likely done by EPMI Short Term California or Short Term Northwest, let me

Hey there - I'm so sorry I haven't responded until now. I've been swamped 
with work, moving, and now the flu. Whoo, hoo! So, as far as gossip is 
concerned, I'm all dried up for now. I was going to go on a company ski trip 
this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside, let 
alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're totally 
used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied by sun and 
not eternal grayness. 

Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber out, 
but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever 
possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out, 
and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is 
foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course 
there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got 
to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore. 

I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE 
our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to Denver, 
or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either way, I'll 
definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs, friends (or 
not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and hustle so I can 
get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home. I'll give you a call 
from my sick bed, 'kay?

Take care,
Kate

These have been changed, and I'll send an e-mail out to the traders as a 
reminder.

The Prebon broker was pulling his tapes this morning when I asked Chris about

Just FYI -
The tie point and Cal PX deals we uploaded this morning did in fact load as

I talked to Will Smith, who said he thought he'd heard this complaint before

informed of the latest episode in what I'm sure will be an award-winning 
series. (How about "The Good, the Bad, and the Cal PX Bridge"?)

Willie -
Per our conversation - the West Power desk needs three new settlement indices 
for entering swaps deals in EnPower. The indices are as follows:

Last day settle for MIDC NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for PALO VERDE NYMEX contract
Last 5-day average for COB NYMEX contract

Please let me know if you have any questions. The first index is a little 
more pressing than the other two - one of our traders did a futures deal a 
week ago which we have yet to swap from his book to the one it belongs in. We 
can't execute the swap until we have a MIDC settlement index. 

Thank you so much for your help.

I just spoke with Holli, and she reported that the confirmation has been 
awaiting a signature at Grant County for the past week. She said she plans to 
send it to Kim Theriot as soon as she gets it back. Let me know if that 
sounds good; otherwise, I can ask her about sending you an unsigned copy.

Did you receive the executed copy of this deal there in your office?  We do 
not show that we have received an executed copy of this confirmation from the 
counterparty.  If you do not have the executed copy of the deal, please send 
me the copy you faxed to the counterparty and we will send it again and try 
to get it executed.

Thanks!  
Sharen,
I saw that there was a note on this deal that Legal prepared the confirmation 
and Holli Krebs sent it to the counterparty herself.  Can you obtain a copy 
of what they sent for our files.  There is nothing in Livelink and if we 
would ever need to reproduce the document we would have nothing.  Also, it 
shows that it has not been singned unless Portland has a signed copy.

This is an automated function of Deal Blotter. I have called Will Smith to 
let him know it's malfunctioning; but all deals not using NP15, SP15, or ZP26

#458255. If you could let me know the other deal numbers that need to be 
changed, I'll follow up with those too.

Looks like alot of Mark Fischer's west deals are coming over as CAISO firm

the NEW Counterparty status.

Thanks!

This deal was entered as New Counterparty which is fine for a short period of 
time.  However, within a few days someone needs to make sure to change the 
deal to the correct counterparty name.  Can you look into this and let me 
know?

Thanks!

Broker checked out incorrectly with Matt - deal has been changed to Nevada.

Hi Kate,

For deal 515363 traded yesterday, Matt has the cp as Sierra Pacific however, 
Prebon has Nevada Power Company.
Can you check with Matt for the correct cp name.  

Thanks!

I spoke with Sean Crandall, who told me that from his standpoint the deals 
ARE separate; however, John Malowney is the mid-marketer who works with 
Conoco, and he told me that this special language is fine to include in the 
confirmations for these deals. Turns out I was just asking the wrong person. 

Let me know if you need comments added in these deals.

Thanks,
Kate

Stephanie Piwetz   02/08/2001 08:20 AM

Kate, please ask Sean Crandell if the following deals need the "special 
phrase" ..The Parties agree and acknowledge that this Transaction is 
connected with the transaction referenced in Deal No. 347356.1 entered into 
between the Parties on May 31, 2001.

Jack Wells of Conoco called and said that the phrase should be included in 
confirmations: 506549.01..506550.01..506551.01 and 507417.01 and 507430.01.  
Please ask trader if deals are related to the 347356.01.  Sharen has inquired 
once before and we were under the impression that the deals were separate and 
not included.  Please let us know.

Thanks
Stephanie 

Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
but our take is that these deals are separate.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?

Thanks!

Mike Swerzbin said okay to off-peak on these deals. They've been changed.

Thanks,
Kate

Just to let you all know - the following deals have been changed per Mike 
Swerzbin -

516611 - from H01 to Q3-01
516618 - from 10 mw to 16 mw
516651 - from Mid-C to Palo

Let me know if you have any questions about these changes. (Most were due to 
my inability to read his handwriting!)

Thanks,
Kate

It's just been changed.

Thanks, Laura. Today is the kind of day I need to be reminded of SOME reason 
why it's good to be me.

Finally! After a slight uphill battle, we've successfully entered the first 
three futures deals under the Mid-Columbia NYMEX settlement price. Because 
all of you were involved in this process in one way or another, I thought I'd 
let you know that it was successful in the end, and forward the deal numbers 
along for reference. They are as follows:

TAGG Futures Deals - QQ0362 (J-01)
               QQ3837 (K-01)
                  QQ7050 (M-01)

ENPOWER Swap Deals - 517925 (J-01)
       517928 (K-01)
       517929 (M-01)

Thank you for all of your patience and cooperation. If you have any 
questions, please let me know.

Kate Symes
(503) 464-7486

These deals have a contact name - Don Imamura - in them now. I asked Tracy 
Ngo, our credit person, about NCPA's credit status, and she said that since 
they've been done, it's now a matter of risk management or damage control - 
if it should even come to that. At any rate, the deals are good and now have 
contact info.

Thanks,
kate

   
	
	

There are 4 deals for Northern CA Power Agency and they have wonderful notes 
about confirming them together.  However, I need a contact name, and isn't 
NCPA on the credit watch list?

Thanks!

517384 - price has been changed to $260
517891 - mike's book shows Palo delivery - desk was wrong - has been changed 
to LTNW
517884 - price has been changed to $300
517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been 
changed to LTNW

Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
different desks at once gets a little hectic!

All the rest of the deals I entered for Mike Swerzbin yesterday in my deal 
blotter, which defaults to Short Term California. I noticed immediately after 
saving the deals that they were under the wrong desk, and changed them to 
Long Term Northwest in deal entry. Are there other problems with the deals? 
The only change should be the desk. Please let me know.

Thanks,

It looks like you made quite a few changes to some deals and I don't see 
anything in the comment section.  Can you just take a quick look and see if 
you know what you changed on any of these.  If not, I can look it up in the 
audit viewer, but it makes things go a lot quicker if we don't have to go 
into the audit viewer for each deal.

both in Enpower the way they're in his trade log, so I don't want to change 
anything until I talk to him. I'm also going to call Judy Dyer at EES for 
confirmation on the 517876 price. I'll let you know.

This is an automated function of Deal Blotter. I have called Will Smith to 
let him know it's malfunctioning; but all deals not using NP15, SP15, or ZP26 
should default to Firm Energy. I've also changed the energy to Firm in Deal 
#458255. If you could let me know the other deal numbers that need to be 
changed, I'll follow up with those too.

Thanks,

Hello-
Looks like alot of Mark Fischer's west deals are coming over as CAISO firm 
energy, for example deal 458255.01.  Please change, needs to be Frim Energy, 
we will need to revise the Confirmation Letter.  CAISO energy on NP 15, SP

Kate-
Per our conversation this afternoon, I have changed the rates as follows:

Enpower curve code, PWRM1 - from $3.75 to $375 for 4/01, 5/01& 6/01
ERMS curve code, MIDC - from $3.75 to $375 for 4/01, 5/01 & 6/01 

Mike still has not returned my calls, and is not at work today. I checked 
with Mike Driscoll, Swerzbin's assistant, and he confirmed that 517876 should 
be $300. It's an EES spread, and the other side (deal #517877)  is $313 - is 
that what Amerex is looking for? He also checked into 517891 and found that 
the delivery point should be SP-15. It's been changed.

Carla Hoffman put a deal under an inactivated CP.  Can you check it out.  We 
should not be using inactivated CPs, and its an east CP.  Thanks for your 
help.

These ARE a kind of desk-to-desk deal, but officially they are 
cross-portfolio deals, because they cross from the ENAEXEC to WEST portfolio. 
I'm not familiar with Unity, but let me check around here and see if anyone 
knows where these deals should be settled. Also let me know if the fact that 
they are cross-portfolio deals helps you at all. That's all I know right now.

Do the deals booked here need to go to Unify to be settled?  Are they desk to 
desk?  Sorry to bug you but I'm assigning contract numbers.

Just changed it - Matt's book had a .015 fee in it, so I changed it to that. 
Does Natsource agree?

thanks

We don't have fees on the BUY side of an EES sleeve - this particular deal is 
the sale side. Unfortunately, Matt had scribbled something next to this deal 
that looked like "no bro" which usually indicates no fee, but it was actually 
".015 bro." Anyway, that's probably more information than you 
needed.....sorry!

to check with Prebon or APB, but no one was at either desk. I'll try to

I'm not quite sure how this exchange began, but it sounds like Kroum is 
referring to several different issues here. First of all, our forward 
obligation report does not reflect cross-portfolio deals, an application 
issue that Will Smith, and it looks like Kroum as well, has been working on 
for the past few weeks. 

Also, deal 498488 is a forward deal done on EOL between STSW and their own 
desk. I haven't seen a trade WITHIN a desk before, but I'm sure anything is 
possible. At any rate, this doesn't look like a cross-portfolio deal at all. 
Am I missing something?

As for the zeroed out deals, I'm pretty sure everyone here knows how to 
properly kill deals in Enpower; however, it takes so long that sometimes we 
simply zero out the volume in the interest of time. I've often wondered if 
this litters the system and makes it more confusing for other people to do 
their jobs - do you know anything about that?

I just thought I'd ask these questions while the subject was being raised. 
Please let me know if I can help facilitate these changes or improvements in 
any way.

Thanks,
Kate
             Cara,

      I think the report should work that way even now.

     I think I found a deal like that 498488 between EPMI Southwest and EPMI 
Southeast,
     Region R7, please take a look at that when you test the report.

       
       I saw lots of deals on the report with volume 0 and price 0, they were 
entered that way
       in Portland. There might be another reason, but I think someone wanted 
to kill the deals.
       There is an option in Deal Entry to do that, if one opens a deal and 
right click with the
       mouse on the status (Done), one can kill a deal.  

           Kroum 

      
      

The "two sides of a cross-portfolio deal" language is a bit vague and 
misleading. A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal. 
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.

Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals.
 1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when "Desk to 
Desk" is selected.
 2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done 
cross portfolio.

I don't think "both sides" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our 
sale when we query for our point.  When the other portfolio queries their 
stuff, they should see their side. 

C

        Cara,

     This is all I have so far. I would appreciate your help to make it 
clearer.

     If you find a deal No like that, I think it will make my job easier.

     Thanks,
     Kroum

All of these have been changed, and the real time desk has been alerted. I

in doubt of counterparty names. I'll check up on that and let you know.

Trades with TransAlta go through their energy marketing subsidiary, called 
TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. These deals were in under the parent 
company, TransAlta Energy Marketing Corp. I know this is petty, but it makes 
people like Rhonda cranky. For some reason she feels it is an offense 
punishable by reaming. I don't. This is just a  reminder.

02/12/2001 03:48 PM
I just sent Kroum a little missive on our familiarity with the "killed" 
feature, as well as why we often zero out deals (Transmission in particular) 
in scheduling only. If I have to teach a course on scheduling for him to 
understand how to build this report I will do it, but I am not really dying 
to do that.

As far as our situation here, If you can properly kill a deal, you should do 
that instead of just zeroing the volume. I quite often have great success 
having many terminal server sessions open at once, and doing the slow stuff 
through a few different channels of TS.  Even as we speak, I am running one 
report for 6 different months, 1 in each of the 5 terminal severs, and one 
locally.  I learned that trick in our old winframe system, and it has served 
me well.

I have torn my hair out over this cross-portfolio vs cross-desk thing.  I 
have explained it to both Kroum, Duong Luu, and Will each at least 3 times.  
How hard is it to get the concept that anything we sell to ourselves is not a 
physical deal?

I would say just keep sending them to me, so we don't all have to pull our 
collective hairs out. The deal you reference below is kind of like a life 
preserver thing. When the market makes a sudden move, it is sometimes faster 
to 'hit' the deal through EOL then pull it on the traders side.  It's not the 
best way to go, but better than losing a bunch of money.

Per your request for year-to-date numbers: here's an example of what I could 
include in the daily EOL summary. Let me know if this is helpful for you, and 
if you'd like it included on the graph sheet. I think it might be too tight 
to fit on the page as it is, but there's no reason why we can't generate a 
two-page report. As long as we're going in that direction, is ther any other 
data you'd like to see in graph form?

Please note that there were cuts on 2/11 and 2/12, so there will be slight 
changes in the fixed price sale volumes. Call with questions.

Prebon just sent over a confirm where Mike Swerzbin:

Is this a good deal because they did not tell me about it?

The Dow Jones report is compiled of data sent from many different 
counterparties. The lovely people at Dow Jones painstakingly analyze the data 
to ensure its accuracy. Averaged together, these prices become the Dow Jones 
daily index price. And that's the long and short of it. 

The process, as you've guessed by now, is a little more complicated than 
that. For one thing, Dow Jones looks at each counterparty's sales to reach an 
average of all the prices. It would be redundant for each counterparty to 
ALSO report their purchases from each other. Therefore, when calculating the 
Dow Jones data, we only include purchases from counterparties who ARE NOT 
participants in the Dow Jones survey. Following is a simple example:

Participant List  NP-15 Purchases  NP-15 Sales  Reported NP-15 Purchases 
Reported NP-15 Sales
Sempra  Sempra - $250   Sempra - $250  Avista - $270   Sempra - $250
Duke   Duke - $260   Duke - $260      Duke - $260
Enron   Avista - $270   Avista - $270      Avista - $270

Now that's simple!

Following is the participant list for Dow Jones' survey of trading at NP-15 
and SP-15 delivery points. Deals with these counterparty names need to be 
excluded from the calculation of PURCHASES at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points.

American Electric Power - Amerelecpo
Avista Energy - Avistaene
Duke Energy Trading and Marketing - Dukeenetra
El Paso Merchant Energy
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. - EPMI
Idaho Power Company - Idacorpene
PacifiCorp - PACE
Pacific Gas & Electric Company - PG&E
Powerex Corp. - PWX
Puget Sound Energy, Inc. - PSPL
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing (formerly Southern Company Energy Marketing) 
- SCEM
TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. - Transalt

So I've probably succeeded in confusing you even more, but please feel free 
to come bug me with questions. Good luck!

I think I found what you're looking for:

www.ferc.fed.us

Once you get to the home page, click on the "gas" icon. From there, hit the 
link to the "FERC Gas Tariffs Page." Then it gives you a choice of viewing 
the tariffs in HTML or saving them to a different file. 

I wasn't quite sure how you wanted to review this information. The website is 
updated every 30 days, or so it said, so you may just want to keep it 
bookmarked and check it out whenever you need the information.

If I totally missed the mark, please let me know and I'll keep looking.

Thank you all for being so patient with me while I am under Carla's wise 
tutelage. Hopefully I'll be up to speed in the next few days, but if you 
notice me doing anything insanely wrong, don't hesitate to yell.

One thing that has lagged slightly, but will be making a comeback tomorrow, 
is the Deal Correction Report. Every afternoon I'll check up on discrepancies 
noted by Houston and determine the source of the error. If the source of the 
error is you, me, the broker, or the computer gods, it will be noted in the 
error report and given to Risk Management to assist them in their daily 
calculation.

Thanks again,
Kate

I spoke with Mark Fischer about this - Tom Alonso stepped out of the office 
for a minute - and he said Tom would probably want to talk to his contact 
with FPL. So I'm going to wait before changing these counterparty names. I'll 
also check with him on the off peak hours for 517518, and get back to you in 
just a minute.

Thanks,

Kate, same thing on this trade. I think it should be FPL Energy Power 
Marketing b/c I received a confirm on it. Secondly on the confirm it states 
that hour 0100-0600 is priced at $95.00 and then again at hours 2300-2400. 
7-22 is priced at $140. However I do not show in the system 1-6 and 23-24 at 
$95. Did he forget to put in the off peak or is FPL incorrect.

1. Because 2/18 is a Sunday and this is an off-peak deal, no hours will be 
counted for 2/18. If you need me to change the term anyway, I can. Let me 
know.
2. The rest of these deals traded on Bloomberg after Jeff Richter and Chris 
Mallory left for a power marketing conference. This caused many problems, as 
you can see. Following are the added or corrected deals: 

  1) 523831 - changed from Dynegy to Reliant - corrected
  2) 524481 - buy Duke/March-01/NP/265.00] - added
  3) 524482 - same terms - added

Let me know if you have any further discrepancies with these deals.

I am missing the following deal:
Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for Q3'01 at $285.95. - 524248 -

Jeff Richter
deal 523881
Per Amerex the term should be 2/17 only not 2/17-2/18 - on peak deal - does 
not calculate any volume for 2/18 because it is a Sunday (all off peak hours)

deal 523882
Per Amerex the term should be 2/17 only not 2/17-2/18 - same as above

The above trades were entered in Jeff's deal blotter with a Saturday/Sunday 
mask; I guess Carla has done this before and said it shouldn't make a 
difference because Sunday is an off-peak day and these are on-peak deals. If 
it does make a difference in reference to your group, please let me know and 
I'll be happy to pass the message on to the traders and anyone else who 
enters deals. I can also change those deals if necessary.

Kate this trade is from yesterday.

Prebon sent over a confirm for off-peak hours and then sent a revision to 
peak hours.  Which one is it?

This deal is the same as all the others Carla Hoffman entered yesterday - in 
the interest of time, she entered all deals with a Saturday-Sunday mask in 
Deal Blotter. If the deals were on peak, she said it shouldn't matter that 
they were marked to flow both days, because Sunday is all off-peak hours. I 
explained this in a couple e-mails yesterday - I guess I got confused about 
who I told. Carla said she's done this before and it shouldn't be a problem. 
Please let me know if you agree with this. In my opinion, just taking the 
time to explain the discrepancy in the 10 or 12 deals that were entered this 
way actually took more time than it saved. What do you think?

These deals have been changed - just thought I'd let you guys know, for 
future reference, that deals scheduled to flow during on peak hours only 
should not be booked through Sunday. Even though the system won't recognize 
any Sunday hours, apparently it messes with Houston's reports.

Kate,

I understand that the deals are not actually flowing on Sunday but for 
auditing/reporting purposes per Melissa Murphy, these deals need to display 
the correct term of 2/17 only instead of 2/17-2/18.

The deals are:  523881, 523882, 523877, 523875, 523876, 523879, 523880,

Matt just talked to his broker and verified the price at $260. If the back

to Rodney Drake, the Prebon broker who seemed to be quite sure that our price 
was right. I'm sorry this is causing chaos on your end - but sometimes I

Surprise, surprise - Mike checked with his broker at Amerex, who said he has

Can you have Mike Swerzbin check this with Amerex.  

Thanks!

deal 524310
Per Amerex the term should be March not April - term should be April

Issue 1 - Mike Swerzbin
Missing deal = 524266 (Enron buys EES - 25 mw - off peak - Mid C - Q3'01 - 
price is $285.95)
 Mike Driscoll just spoke with Amerex broker, who confirmed he wanted the 
five-cent fee on a different deal (524247), not this one. Our price is right.

Issue 2 - Mike Swerzbin
Mike agreed to 50 mw, but if we change this deal we have to change the other 
side - therefore, 524267 and 524266 will both be changed to 50 mw.

Issue 3 - Diana Scholtes
This is the first I think I've heard about 523984 - I'm sorry if I overlooked 
it. Diana says it's $345 - it's been changed.

Let me know if this resolves everything.

This two deals checkout with Amerex fine.  Amerex has one deal at 50 mw and 
we have two identical deals at 25 mw.

deal 524247
This deal checks out with Amerex fine.

The deal that I am missing is Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 
Q3'01 at $285.95.

ISSUE 2- Mike Swerzbin
deal 524267
 Amerex has 50 mw and we have 25 mw.

ISSUE 3- Dianna Scholtes
deal 523984
Amerex has price as $345 and we have price as $335.

This has been a terrible ordeal and I will be so glad when everthing is 
resolved!!!

I'm sorry for the delay on this, Tim. I've been in contact with Will Smith in 
Houston since yesterday to try to fix the problem of PX, Imbalance, and Tie 
Point deals uploading as Enron Online deals. Here are the correct statistics.

Thanks for the update, Ryan. I've forwarded the e-mail along, and hopefully 
you'll continue to get a good response from all the Blazer fans here. I had a 
chance to catch last night's game - if you could call it that - against the 
Kings. Now all we have to do is pull a Tonya Harding on Chris Webber and 
we've got a chance at the championship! 

I also thought I'd mention that I'm no longer in the same position with 
Enron. I moved into commodity trading a few months ago, so TECHNICALLY I'm 
not the point of reference for Blazer matters - Mollie Gustafson is. I've 
retained the title only because I happen to be the most outspoken fan on the 
floor; so I love receiving all the latest news. But if you ever have a more 
urgent matter, or, for example, when it comes time to renew our season 
tickets, you'll want to call Mollie. She's the woman with the checkbook, so 
to speak. 

In the meantime, feel free to contact me with news about deals, discounts, 
free tickets, a date with the team, etc. (ha,ha)

Hi Kate,
This deal has an NP-15 delivery point with firm energy.  Which is correct? 
Have a great weekend!
Thanks!
Kim

How did you know Steve Smith would be my first choice for a Blazer date? 
Maybe I'm not as original as I thought I was.

Anyway, I think you've got it straight. Mollie is the administrative 
assistant in charge of ordering and paying for season tickets for the 
Origination group. I'm a trader's assistant  who once worked for Mollie and 
stole the Blazer responsibility out from under her nose. We still cross paths 
every now and then, so anything that comes to me will get to her. 

Thanks for taking such good care of our sporting needs. And you have a great 
weekend too. Don't forget to take a moment of silence for our past Presidents 
on Monday.

Kate

Hey Dad -
Thanks for your update on the status of the sailing club's opening day. For 
my purposes, April 22 works better simply because I probably won't be coming 
anyway..... Just joking. Looks like I mistakenly made it onto your sailing 
club e-mail list. Unless I'm really invited to opening day?

Kate

After some discussion about WSC Opening Day date,  Marilyn and I would like 
to propose moving it from Apr. 1 to Apr. 22. Our  reasoning is as follows:
?
1. Apr. 1 is last day of spring break which will be  a conflict for many WSC 
families. It's also just a week after the board chili  feed on Mar. 25.
?
2. Apr. 22 is the last Sunday of series sailing  before we go to evenings. 
It's the week after Easter, chances for good weather  are marginally better, 
and there are no conflicts that we are aware  of.
?
If you have any suggestions pro or con, please let  me know by Wednesday (we 
need to publish date in Mar. Telltales). If not, we'll  go with Apr. 22. 
Thanks,
?
Bill

Thanks for thinking of me during your consolidated e-mail spree. It's always 
nice to arrive at work Monday (or in this case Tuesday) morning and receive 
something other than urgent, faceless messages demanding my immediate 
attention. I received those as well this morning, of course, but being who I 
am decided to respond urgently to the frivolous ones and frivolously to the 
urgent ones.

Your Sunday sounds incredibly more productive than mine - pity. After a quick 
survey of the very little mess left after you two left (THANK YOU!), Molly 
and I decided to bag any further cleaning and instead go for a drive through 
some of the nicer Portland neighborhoods, admiring gardens here and paint 
colors there. Everyone was out enjoying the crisp sunshine and inhaling our 
exhaust fumes. But watching from our comfortable car seats was about all we 
could muster after the weekend's debaucheries. Then we returned home for a 
movie marathon that did not, you correctly assumed, include the Philadelphia 
story. We did watch two fabulous films - "The Virgin Suicides" and 
"Croupier," both of which I highly recommend. We built a gigantic bed out of 
couch cushions and drank chamomile tea until we passed out. 

Amber the mysteriously absent roommate turned up Monday afternoon, and I was 
amazingly more angry than I had previously thought, mostly because she walked 
into the house smacking of defensiveness, ready to fight. So rather than 
disappoint her expectations, I gave her what she wanted, only with more 
volume. If the neighbors didn't hear us Saturday night, they can be sure 
somebody lives there now.

I've got a call in to my friend Scott to locate Mr. Down Under Wine guy. In 
my slightly more sober state, I'm starting to feel like he may own a winery 
in Australia, not New Zealand. We'll find out for sure later today. And I'll 
let you know when I hear from him.

Thanks again for making the trip DOWN to Portland - you guys were great 
company. I'd love to come to Seattle this weekend; however, I never make 
plans more than one day in advance. I've found myself to be much too flaky 
for that. Let me know if you need notice sooner than that. 

Take care,
Kate

I know you won't get this until Tuesday, I just thought I'd write for the 
purposes of consolidation. It was great meeting you and thanks for your 
hospitality and easy-going ways. I wonder if you watched the Philadelphia 
story. Probably not, but it's not going anywhere. It's a bright sunny day 
here in Seattle and, over a couple?of cups of coffee, I wrote all morning. At 
some point I'm going to go outside and do something today. A walk around the 
lake perhaps or a hike through the woods. 
?
Anyway, I don't have a lot to say. Thanks in advance for your help in getting 
me in touch with the New Zealand dude and do think seriously about coming 
down for dinner next weekend. Stay in touch,
jordan

It was great - we ended up having a really eclectic mix of people. You should 
have stopped by! No worries, though, I'm sure we'll have many more. Thanks 
for the info for Molly - I'll pass it along, for whatever it's worth. Also, I 
noticed you hadn't deposited the check yet - if you'd like, I can bring you 
cash at about 11:30 this morning. Just thought maybe that would be easier for 
you. Let me know.

Bend like a reed in the wind? It's funny you should say that, since I've been 
reading a lot about Buddhist philosophy lately. I stayed with a couple in 
London who practice Buddhist meditation pretty regularly. Ever since then 
I've thought something like that would do a world of good for my mental 
health, being that I've always been more of a giant steel piling than a reed 
when the wind kicks up. I did let her have it, don't worry; but my Catholic 
guilt always gets the best of me, and I assure you I'll be extending all 
kinds of undeserved compassion by this evening.

As far as the sick thing goes - screw that. That's one occasion you cannot 
take lying down, or bending like a reed as it were. You sabotage that thing 
with vitamin C and some uber-multi-vitamin and echinacea and hot water with 
lemon and honey and 14 hours of sleep a night UNTIL IT RUNS SCREAMING FROM 
YOUR BODY. I hate being sick...almost as much as I hate bending like a reed. 

Speaking of Woody Allen - I saw his new one, "Small Time Crooks," last night. 
I'd give it an unenthusiastic "mediocre." Rent it if you've exhausted all 
other options. Tonight I think we're going to check out "Traffic" - I've 
heard rave reviews. Or otherwise it's "Cinema Paradiso" for the 
sixty-thousandth time, but this time on the big screen. The deciding factor 
will be money, and beer. "Traffic" will cost twice as much as "Cinema," but 
the theater showing "Cinema" has comfy couches and serves beer, so I'll end 
up spending twice as much as I would at "Traffic." Do you see the moral 
dilemma here? 

I'm sorry to ramble, but today happens to be alarmingly devoid of surprises. 
Having said that, I'm practically positive some catastrophe will occur in the 
next 30 seconds, so I'm going to go now.

Kate

I can't believe that bitch would just wander into the house full of ire and 
phasers set to kill. I hope you let her have it. Some friend! She was just 
trying to get your goat. Knows to how to press your buttons and will continue 
to until she grows up. If I were you I'd follow the Buddhist path--extend 
compassion to her, don't let your state of mind be controlled by what she 
does, bend like a reed in the wind, etc. Anyhoo . . .

I started to get a little sick last night. Think I might have been running a 
fever, so I came home and went to bed early. But I don't always sleep so 
well. The bed I'm?using gives me the distinct impression that I'm sleeping on 
a grade, that I'm slipping into a pit or a valley. My dreams?are always about 
climbing out of things. And then Hector the dachshund sleeps on the bed with 
me and even though he's only about a foot and a half long, it always seems 
like he takes up all the room. Oh, I'm just complaining. Cross your fingers 
that I don't get sick.

"Croupier " I've always wanted to see. Glad you give it the thumbs up. I 
think I'm going to head downstairs and watch a movie myself. Perhaps Woody 
Allen's "Manhattan," an old fave I haven't seen in years.

Talk to you soon. Oh yes, and about the weekend. Of course I give you the 
"flaky"?time allowance you need. I would demand the same for myself. If you 
decide to come down, you don't even have to tell us until Friday or Saturday. 
You don't even have to tell us at all. You could just come and not see us and 
head back Sunday if you want. We are that tolerant of flakiness here. No, 
seriously, if you feel like coming it would be wonderful to see you. If not, 
another time will come.

Wow! That's so exciting to see the words "clean checkout" associated with OUR 
beloved brokers and traders. Thanks for your persistence with all of this - I 
know it gets frustrating. Please let me know whenever I can help - I'm trying 
to respond quickly to the e-mails coming from Houston confirms, but in the 
interest of accuracy I'm also trying to be thorough. So feel free to give me 
a nudge every once in awhile.

Kate,

to cover my you know what.....this will be the new daily checkout for all of 
my brokers.  I am sending this to ensure a quality checkout to minimize any 
risks associated with our transactions.  Even if I don't have any errors I 
will still send a summary everyday of my checkouts for the west deals.  We 
have had several deals pop up from the brokers that we didn't know about and 
did not verbal the day of the trade and this will serve as proof of the 
previous days checkout. 

Amerex West Checkout

Prebon West Checkout

Bloomberg Checkout

Thanks!!

Hey there stranger!

Thanks for the pictures - they've definitely been the highlight of my day. 
It's funny that you sent those now, because over the weekend Molly and I had 
our big housewarming blowout party, and - speaking of strangers - Michael (of 
sushi fame) and his friend came down from Seattle for it! Weird, huh. I don't 
see or hear from the guy in half a year, and then in the same three days he 
not only comes to my house but shows up in my e-mail. 

I can't chat right now - things are just coming to a rolling boil here at 
work. But I'll give you a call this evening. Are you packed for Spain yet? 
Are you ready to leave the laid back island like to which you've grown 
accustomed? Is everyone there still as crazy as when I left them? Write back, 
or give me a call. I'd love to hear the update.

Take care,
Kate

In all the confusion last week, I can't remember if we figured this one out! 
Let me know.

MOM

Anna Symes <annas@cobs.edu> on 02/20/2001 10:10:28 AM
What up dude!

I haven't heard from you in awhile, so I thought I would remind you that you
have a sister and she lives in Colorado and she has no friends and no life
and one psycho roommate and is therefore desperately in need of sane
conversation/gossip through which she can live vicariously.  How's it going?
Are you feeling better?  Is the roommate situation improving?  Mine is SO
not.  And to add to the drama, lonesomeness has once again driven me into
the arms of a man with whom I undoubtedly have no future.  He launched a
surprise attack on Valentine's Day - when my guard was obviously down.  Yes,
it's still the colorblind starbucks guy.  We were just going to go out for A
drink, but 9 vanilla stoli and cokes later we were making out like teenagers
in a prom limo.  Even his baby poop green blazer-style leather jacket had
started to look like an acceptable outerwear addition to his camel-colored
wide-whale corduroy and pumpkin orange sweater ensemble.  It was madness.
So anyway, I shacked, and unfortunately now a precedent has been set, so now
I pretty much spend most of my day coming up with various believable reasons
for not spending the night at his house.    It's been almost a week so I
think he's starting to suspect something.  Little does he know that by the
time this whole debacle is over, he will wish he had never heard the name
"Anna Symes".  He's great and fun and everything, and yet I feel that
familiar desire to kill this relationship - and not just kill it, but shoot
at it and kick it in the head even after it's dead.  Think I have issues?

Other than that, not a lot happening over here.  I like my new job, although
right now it's really dead and I find myself wondering what I'm supposed to
be doing a lot of the time.  I have been playing phone tag with Monica, but
I think I might start stalking her a little more intensely as I am in
desperate need of some friends.  Actually, starbucks guy and I had an
interesting conversation about this last night.  I have been feeling so down
lately, and I finally realized that this move was a million times harder
than London or Argentina were because I am literally starting from scratch
in the social department.  Michelle is scary and therefore does not count as
a source of moral support or even pleasant conversation.  I'm trying to see
this as a positive thing, like a challenge to see if I can be happy without
the network of people I have always had around me.  I know it's not the
Peace Corps or anything, but it's still kind of scary.  Anyway, that's my
deep thought for the week.  I'm sure soon enough I'll be crying yet once
again about how I want to come home, but for now I'm great (I think!).

By the way, have you heard Ben Lee (singer)?  He Claire Danes' boyfriend, so
you may have heard of him before.  Anyway, you have to check him out - he's
awesome!  The cd I like the best has the word hurricanes or volcanoes or
something in the title (sorry, I can't remember exactly).  It's a good
feel-good cd.  So let me know how it's going out there in P-town, and when
are you coming to visit?  Okay, love you, miss you, etc.!

Besos,
Anna

Hey there - I'm so sorry I haven't responded until now. I've been swamped
with work, moving, and now the flu. Whoo, hoo! So, as far as gossip is
concerned, I'm all dried up for now. I was going to go on a company ski
trip this weekend, but I feel so crappy I can't even imagine being outside,
let alone surrounded by snow and wind at the same time. I imagine you're
totally used to that by now, but keep in mind your weather is accompanied
by sun and not eternal grayness.

Our house is coming along nicely. Molly and I already want to boot Amber
out, but that's okay. We deal with it by laughing about her antics whenever
possible - behind her back or in front of her face. It really helps us out,
and I think it does wonders for her ego too. Work is work. The weather is
foul! Men are too. I don't even have one prospect at this point. Of course
there's always the innocent, fleeting crushes from a distance; but I've got
to admit I hardly even have the energy for those anymore.

I hope you can make it home for a visit soon, because you are going to LOVE
our house. I will definitely keep my eyes peeled for cheap tickets to
Denver, or maybe I'll just do the train and take a long weekend. Either
way, I'll definitely make it there by springtime. Tell me about your jobs,
friends (or not?), and life in general. I'm going to get back to work and
hustle so I can get out of here early and suffer peacefully at home. I'll
give you a call from my sick bed, 'kay?

Take care,
Kate

Here you are, ladies. As per our prior discussion, these are the Dow Jones 
index price reports I promised to send you. Let me know how this works for 
you. If there are no questions, comments, or concerns, I'll forward the 
e-mails to you each week on Tuesday afternoon as soon as I receive them.

And thanks for encouraging Willie Harrell to automate the pub-posting system. 
Sounds pretty logical to me!

So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night? I always knew the 
Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports - they're not battling with that 
ol' Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean.

Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and I 
knew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed or I'd 
never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realized there 
would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of what's 
happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more important 
nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.

So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues - 
mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the "library" on Thursday night 
and came home.....four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out 
session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known, 
including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky 
McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than 
Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at the 
beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she DIDN'T 
TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming party this 
weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and she 
moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our landlords or paid the 
$500 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING. So many 
things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none more than her attitude 
when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's just say I spared no lung 
muscles in telling her exactly what I thought about her selfish, childish, 
idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically self-important behavior. She had 
the gall to defensively scream back that she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE 
DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmmmm. Not only did she not want to lie - how sweet - but 
she couldn't have told us because Molly and I have suddenly developed an 
insatiable urge to spread fervent and widespread rumors about Amber's love 
trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing I'd rather be doing.

Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just 
because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never been 
good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming party. I 
really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90 percent of 
the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they were all 
interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were about four 
girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no love 
connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new M.O. - 
keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in Seattle came 
down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing an article for 
Food & Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially in the closet, so 
I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to Seattle next weekend for a 
five-course meal and $100 bottles of wine at some Microsoft dude's mansion. 
Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I wear my dirty jeans or my clean 
jeans?

I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the end 
of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other hand 
will be there five times before that because some psycho over there keeps 
buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.

Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the rumor 
mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a roommate soon 
if you feel like coming back to Portland.

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Dow Jones data to a shareable file in the meantime?

I'm not exactly sure where the spreadsheet on our site comes from. Our 
preference is to keep everything in our SQL Server database, and many of the 
people that you mentioned have read access to that. When Julie Sarnowski gets 
back from vacation next week, let's talk about uploading these data to the 
server and providing a central facility for the floor.

I create a report each afternoon that tracks total volume done by each desk 
through EOL and brokered deals. I've attached last night's report for you to 
look over - if this looks like something you'd like to receive, let me know 
and I'll add you to the mailing list. 

And in regard to the dow jones file, I've just finished entering deals for 
Friday and Saturday, so my afternoon will be devoted to creating that. I'll 
let you know as soon as it's done.

I just spoke with Nicolay, who helped me develop the EOL Report, and he said 
he'd check the code in both that and the Sales Volume Report to see if they 
are in fact pulling in different data. I'll let you know what he finds.

Here's what's wierd:  I ran a Sales Volume Report for 2/21 only, and got a 
total of  596,284.

On your report for the same day,  I get a total of 1,468,175.  That doesn't 
include anything done by about 4 books that are supposed to be on mine!

I wonder what's up with that??  I just wrote to Duong luu to ask him about 
the sales volume report.  

   Kate Symes                02/22/2001 12:02 PM

I create a report each afternoon that tracks total volume done by each desk 
through EOL and brokered deals. I've attached last night's report for you to 
look over - if this looks like something you'd like to receive, let me know 
and I'll add you to the mailing list. 

And in regard to the dow jones file, I've just finished entering deals for 
Friday and Saturday, so my afternoon will be devoted to creating that. I'll 
let you know as soon as it's done.

Thanks,
Kate

I'm not exactly sure where the spreadsheet on our site comes from. Our 
preference is to keep everything in our SQL Server database, and many of the 
people that you mentioned have read access to that. When Julie Sarnowski gets 
back from vacation next week, let's talk about uploading these data to the 
server and providing a central facility for the floor.
Tim

   Kate Symes                02/21/2001 03:19 PM

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

We'd like to create a daily and monthly trade volume report, similar to the 
EOL Report we currently use to track both online and brokered trades done in 
the Portland office each day. The EOL JF tab seems to track the same data we 
need for a daily volume report; however, it does not display the data in the 
form we need. 

Under the "Sort By" heading at the bottom of the report, there are two 
choices - "Deal #" and "Desk." As I run it now, the report displays megawatt 
volumes and total deals according to desk. We now need to display the data 
according to delivery point. 

Please call Cara Semperger or myself when you get a moment, and we can fill 
you in on all the parameters she's looking for in this report. From there I 
think it should be a pretty simple modification of the query.

Thanks in advance for your help on this.

Here are details of the problem we're having with the Tagg IQ Reports:

Three Mid-Columbia futures trades were executed by Matt Motley, Long Term 
Southwest Desk, on 2/5, 2/6, and 2/7.
Trades pulled into Tagg IQ Reports -
 All three pull into Future Daily Transaction Report (RSX0245F.IQR) 
 Only two pull into Future Net Position Summary (RXSNSUMF.IQR)
 All three pull into Tagg Exchange Capture search - transaction IDs are 
980362/983837/987050
 All three pulled into Tagg Metacalc (Meta ID 77771 - Post ID 1035917 - Post 
ID 77880 - Post ID 1037269) until 2/9 - NOW GONE

Because today is the Nymex Electricity Futures exercise date, we need to know 
as soon as possible for our calculations whether or not these deals are in 
the system, and if not, where they went. My confusion lies in the fact that I 
can find these deals when I do a search in Tagg for any futures deals traded 
at the Mid-C settlement index, and yet the Risk group can no longer see 
anything for Mid-C in their calculation. Please let me know what you find.

Thank you,

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those

I just spoke with Justin about collaborating on the ICE and EOL volume

week. I'll let you know when I find out. 

Also, do you want this report simply added to the end of the EOL Summary, or 
would you like the information integrated into the tables that show our 
volumes? Let me know when you have a moment.

Thanks,

I must know why your roommates are so scary! Mine - well, that's just 
obvious. Oh, and since we last e-mailed, Molly has gone out and landed 
herself a full-fledged boyfriend. Anything to avoid getting a job. He's a 
"natural healer" and he's also had "an experience with Jesus," so this one 
should be REALLY interesting. Amber and I had a few drinks last night and 
basically pretended like nothing happened - it's easier that way. We both 
know there's no real friendship to salvage, so keeping it strictly in the 
bars is the smartest thing to do. And Anna, don't think for a minute that my 
description of life in Portland is exciting or cultured or romantic, cause 
it's pretty much the polar opposite of all those things. I've been so tired 
this week that I've been spouting out sentences like "The red computer needs 
to climb my shoelaces and the people riding the dinosaurs are wrong." It's 
definitely been interesting. I'm on my way to sushi with a few people right 
now, but of course I can see my reflection in my forehead and my hair looks 
like a sad, sad, small animal. Super! Maybe I'll meet the man of my dreams. 
I'll tell you, Anna - I know you've got scary clashing dresser man, but 
sometimes from the single person's point of view, that doesn't look so bad. 
Hang in there - and call me soon!

Love,
Kate

Hey buttface!

Wow - it actually sounds like your roommate problems may be comparable to
mine (except that you probably don't fear for your life quite as much).  Who
is paying for Amber to come to Denver?  It sounds like she might be a little
out of her mind right now, but at least she's not going back to Chris just
yet.  So are you going to Seattle this weekend?  That sounds so fun!  I am
so jealous - parties, dinners, wine, men.  You and I are NOT living the same
life right now.  I am in the process of trying to break things off with the
ugly dresser, which was proving to be difficult until last night, when I
made the mistake of letting him come to a movie with Michelle and I.  Kate,
I was scared.  It was dark and I was surrounded by the two most psycho
people I know.  Josh talked through the whole thing and laughed at
inappropriate moments and tried to hold my hand at one point.  It was
excruciating!  It made Michelle look almost normal.

Not much else going on.  I'll call you this weekend, okay?  We need to dish.

Luego,
Anna

So didya hear the Blazers creamed the Nuggets last night? I always knew the
Pacific Northwest would dominate in sports - they're not battling with that
ol' Rocky Mountain High if ya know what I mean.

Well I'm sorry I didn't get back to you yesterday - work was hectic and I
knew that if I started an e-mail to you it would either be half-assed or
I'd never finish it. Well, I'm going for the former now, because I realized
there would never be a good time to divulge the full and sordid details of
what's happening around here, and all the while I wait, more and more
important nuggets (get it!) of gossip are accumulating.

So it's quite appropriate that you wrote yesterday with roommate issues -
mine could not be worse. Amber took off for the "library" on Thursday night
and came home.....four days later. After Molly and I had a mild freak-out
session on Friday - which included calling everybody she's every known,
including Chris and the police - we heard through the grapevine that Marky
McCulloch, of Neidermeyer cousin fame, was in town from none other than
Denver and the two were having a secret and James-Bond-like rendezvous at
the beach. Well that was all well and fine, other than the fact that she
DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS LEAVING and we had been planning a housewarming
party this weekend for the past month and she DIDN'T TELL US SHE WAS
LEAVING and she moved kitty into the house but still hasn't told our
landlords or paid the $500 deposit, oh, and also, SHE DIDN'T TELL US SHE
WAS LEAVING. So many things were wrong and bizarre about that, but none
more than her attitude when she walked in the door Monday afternoon. Let's
just say I spared no lung muscles in telling her exactly what I thought
about her selfish, childish, idiotic, and most importantly, psychotically
self-important behavior. She had the gall to defensively scream back that
she didn't tell us BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T WANT TO LIE. Hmmmm. Not only did she
not want to lie - how sweet - but she couldn't have told us because Molly
and I have suddenly developed an insatiable urge to spread fervent and
widespread rumors about Amber's love trysts. Now, I KNOW there's nothing
I'd rather be doing.

Anyway, enough of that. She and I have reached an understanding that just
because we're roommates does not mean we have to be friends. We've never
been good at that anyhow. In other news, we had an amazing housewarming
party. I really wish you could have been there. Molly and I didn't know 90
percent of the people there, which is a good thing because it meant they
were all interesting, successful, gracious and cute. I think there were
about four girls there - you could tell who planned the party. Sadly, no
love connections were made that evening, but I've decided that's my new
M.O. - keep 'em guessing. My friend Michael from Maui who now lives in
Seattle came down with his friend Jordan who happens to be hot and writing
an article for Food & Wine magazine. Very interesting guy, but potentially
in the closet, so I'm keeping my distance. But they invited me up to
Seattle next weekend for a five-course meal and $100 bottles of wine at
some Microsoft dude's mansion. Definitely sounds like my crowd. Should I
wear my dirty jeans or my clean jeans?

I've got my eye on flights to Denver, but right now it's looking like the
end of March before I can scrape up that kind of cash. Amber on the other
hand will be there five times before that because some psycho over there
keeps buying her tickets. That's fair for ya.

Okay, that's all I can do for now, but call me tonight and we'll do the
rumor mill justice. Take care and hang in there - we'll be booting a
roommate soon if you feel like coming back to Portland.

She doesn't have the signed confirm back yet. Sharen asked me about it a few

she got it. She's talking to her contact there right now to find out what's

with these guys - so hopefully she'll get some concrete answers from them

So I watched the news last night and discovered to my utter dismay that the 
whole damn city of Seattle began rioting over my pointed absence this 
weekend. Some people just don't know how to control those emotions, I guess.

How was dinner, anyway? I was actually hoping to come, but I seem to have 
misplaced Michael's phone number and so had no way of contacting you guys. 
Also, I wasn't quite confident in my ability to find your house through 
"alternative" methods such as hanging out at the train station or wandering 
through Microsoft millionaire-type neighborhoods. And to top it all off, I 
lost my voice Friday night - for no apparent reason other than the usual 
deficit of sleep and surplus of cigarettes - and wouldn't you know it would 
have to turn into a full blown cold by this morning. 

As can be expected, we're experiencing the most insanely gorgeous weather 
I've seen in all my Februarys in Portland, which is making my acceptance of 
actually being sick even more difficult. Whatever happened with your fever? 
I'd feel much better if I knew others were sharing my pain. In fact, I 
promptly gave my cold to Amber on Saturday, so I'd have a partner in my time 
of homebound misery. She took it a step further, in true drama queen fashion. 
Case in point - I'm at work, she's rounding out her 39th consecutive hour in 
bed. 

Anyway, I'm going to skip out of here a whopping half an hour EARLY today 
because people are starting to look visibly pained when I try to talk. But I 
thought I'd check on the success of the dinner party and apologize for not 
making it. And if you get a chance, tell Michael that I have a very 
legitimate reason for losing his phone number. Or at least, I'll have one by 
the time he calls.

Kate

The Confirms group in Houston has asked me to obtain a copy of the 
confirmation letter you come up with for this deal. This group is responsible 
for keeping records of all confirmation letters, whether or not they execute 
them. So this includes term deals that are marked "no confirm." Please let me 
know if this is okay with you.

Thanks,

I just forwarded this e-mail to Stan and then spoke with him about the 
confirm on this deal. He said he's never received a letter of confirmation on 
these Valley Electric deals - they just verbally confirm them. I've given him 
your name, and he should be contacting you shortly to discuss how to proceed 
on this. Please let me know how I can help.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

In regard to this deal, could you please email me a copy of the confirmation 
that the trader prepares.  We will need to put a copy into the our files.  We 
will also need a copy of the executed confirmation for our files.

Thanks!
Thanks for the reminder - deal is changed and note is in comments section.

Kate

   
	
	

When you change this to no confirm, please put a note in the comment section 
about why we are not domfirming it, because it falls within our guidelines to 
confirm and at somepoint, I will be asked why we did not confirm this deal.

Thanks!

Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
as soon as risk is done with their calc.

Kate

   
	
	

This deal does not have a contact.

This deal was constructed by Holli Krebs in mid-marketing - she just put it 
under Bob's desk and trader i.d. She should be in the office shortly, and 
I'll have her look over the changes made to the deal. I'll get back to you 
soon.

Thanks,

As you know, we do not have a contract with Transalta Energy Marketing Corp. 
but with Transalta Energy Marketing (US) Inc.  I am changing this deal to 
that CP.  

Let me know if you have any objections or if you prefer to make the change 
yourself.  Do you want me to continue to let you know of these changes?  I 
know Carla preferred to make the changes herself.

Thanks - I've changed it. With deals like those, it's fine if you need to 
change the counterparty name in the interest of time or efficiency. Could 
just send me a quick e-mail, and copy Bill Williams III (real time manager), 
when you change deals under the Short Term West Hourly desk? That way we can 
both keep on top of common mistakes. And if it's at all possible for you to 
wait on making those changes until you've e-mailed me, that would be great. 
If I don't respond right away - if I'm out of the office or at lunch - then 
feel free to change away!

Nancy,

I have attached a draft Confidentiality Agreement for your review. If it is 
acceptable, please sign and fax a copy to me at 503-464-3740. We should be 
able to begin work with a faxed document in place.  

As we discussed, we need to analyze two sources of water for the project; 
city water and the port's well water. Please overnight the containers for 
collection of the water to me at: 

Ed Clark and I will collect the water samples Friday morning and overnight 
them to you (Saturday delivery) to make sure that they are there first thing 
Monday morning. 

I was able to find a Well and Water Right Evaluation that was performed by 
Robinson and Noble, Inc. If you could send your fax number to me and to Kate 
Symes (ksymes@enron.com), we will fax you a copy for your review. I will also 
work on getting you a conceptual design of the project for analysis of the 
waste water flow.

Thank you in advance for your assistance and speedy response. I realize that 
we are targeting an aggressive date (the morning of October 23) for the work 
to be completed. 

Sincerely,
Laura Wente
503-464-3830 

Disregard my other reply - I don't know what I was thinking. Prebon was right 
on this. Both deals were 50 MW (not 25 MW like I said earlier!), and they 
were changed accordingly.

Sorry about the confusion.

Kate

Can you check with Chris Mallory because when I checked out with Prebon we 
confirmed the megawatts as 25mw on these deals.

Thanks

Did you want this deal confirmed? If so, it needs a counterparty contact name 
in it. Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate
	
	

We need a contact for this deal in order to prepare the confirmation.

Thanks!

The third deal - 531910 - I'm checking on with Les right now. Sharen Cason 
asked me this morning who the contact was, and typically with services deals 
the traders like to confirm the deals themselves - so I'm not sure if it 
should be confirmed.

The other two contain contact names - are they not valid in GCP? Do you need 
new names and phone numbers or just numbers to go along with those names?

Kate

 New Energy Secretary Guesses He Ought To Read Up On Energy

WASHINGTON, DC-- Spencer Abraham, the newly installed U.S. Energy Secretary, 
admitted Monday that he probably ought to read up on energy. "I know energy 
is really important, and that there was a big crisis back in the '70s, but 
other than that, I'm in the dark," Abraham said. "I was hoping to be 
appointed Secretary of Transportation, which I know a lot more about, but 
that one was already taken." The former Michigan senator said he plans to go 
to the library Thursday to look up "Energy" in The World Book Encyclopedia.

I just spoke with Justin Rostant, who reported that ICE will begin sending 
him data tomorrow morning. So you can expect the ICE volumes to be included 
on tomorrow's EOL report. Let me know if you have any other specifications 
for the report.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

justin,
i received this e-mail from louise today with information on ice volumes.  i 
would like to get a daily extract of number of ice trades and volume for 
western power delivery points.  kate symes prepares a daily summary of our 
eol volume for me.  could you please coordinate with kate so that we can get 
the ice information into our reports.  thanks for your help.  give me a call 
at 503-464-3820 if you have any questions.

regards,
tim
Louise Kitchen
02/23/2001 11:26 AM
I am sure you expected me to comment on EOL at some point - but just in case 
you don't see the attached reporting.  Essentially in power we are now doing 
the same volume as the Intercontinental Exchange.  If you want reports like 
this, Justin Rostant can produce whatever you wish.

Yesterday:
ICE   1,892,800 MWhs
EnronOnline 1,843,874 MWhs (plus 124,850 MWhs financial)

See attached.

Regards

Louise

I'm so sorry, gals, but I feel awful and I'm going home to nurse myself to 
health. If you could direct your e-mails for the remainder of the day to the 
respective traders, I would really appreciate it. And if anything can wait 
until tomorrow, just e-mail it to me and I'll take care of it in the morning. 
I'm going to sleep for the next 15 hours and see if that rids me of this cold 
once and for all!

Thanks,
Kate

I'm feeling pretty under the weather today, so I'm going to sneak out of here 
early - but I haven't yet received the Dow Jones data for today. Instead, I'm 
sending yesterday's information. If you need today as well, let me know and 
I'll send it first thing in the morning.

Thanks,

460002
Term is Q1-01

458618

same as 532917

   
	
	

This deal is also entered with a Mid C del pt and CAISO energy.  Let me know 
when it is fixed.

Thanks!

This was changed last night to SP-15, but Jeff forgot to change the index. 
It's been changed to DJ SP-15 Peak Index.

Kate

   
	
	

This deal is against the NP index with an SP del point.  Is that what you 
want?

Thanks!    

Sharen had already alerted me to the first deal, which I changed, but not the 
second. That deal has been changed as well now.

Thanks,
Kate

Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON
02/28/2001 09:06 AM
Hi Kate,

I spoke with Jeff Richter this morning and the index sleeve he did on 
yesterday with EES (deal 533084) and Sempra(deal 533085) is incorrect in 
Enpower.  He said he would change the publication code to reflect Dow Jones 
SP-15 Peak instead of Dow Jones NP-15 Peak on both of these deals.

Can you please check with Jeff to see what the status is on these changes. 
The EES deal has been changed. The Sempra deal has not been changed.

Thanks!!

Sharen told me this morning that you guys were waiting on a deal Stewart 
Rosman did with Port of Oakland yesterday and wanted confirmed today. I've 
spoken with a few people here and discerned that the deal wasn't in because 
the counterparty wasn't in the system yet. I took a look and found that Port 
of Oakland had been added, and entered the deal according to the terms 
Stewart sent out in an e-mail yesterday. Deal number is 533916. Thanks for 
waiting.

Kate

Reminder....
	
	

Just a heads up.  We have targeted tomorrow, March 1 as the start date for 
confirming the daily deals in the west.  Please remind the guys that we will 
need the counterparty contact filled in to prepare the confirmations.  If 
they absolutely do not have a contact, they may use the Documentation 
Department as a contact if this is available.  We are in the process of 
getting this name available for use for most the counterparties.

I guess TFS originally had Palo on their confirm - which was wrong - then the 
deal got changed to Mid-C. So Enpower is right, and Mike just let his broker 
know to change the delivery point on the confirm.

Thanks,
Kate

Tim - would you like a copy of this deal's confirmation letter?

Carla - you entered this deal on 2/23/01. Should it be back-dated to match 
trade date on confirmation letter?

Thanks,
Kate
Kate,  we received the executed Confirmation Letter from Portland Legal 
yesterday with Department of Water Resources a division of the State of 
California -CDWR believe it is trade 530608.01.  The confirmation has special 
terms to extend the terms of the trade by a specific date and time regarding 
the option.  
Needed to know if you need a copy of this confirmation to note this and we 
have trade date on our confirmation letter as Feb. 22, 2001.  The trade in 
enpower has a trade date of Feb 23, 2001 Trader: Tim Belden                   
   please let me know.  

Thank you
Stephanie

Yeah, Seattle actually had a 7.0 earthquake at about 11a.m. our time. I made 
it out from under our building with only a broken leg and shattered.....no 
just kidding. What's funny is that I was on my way to lunch when the 
earthquake hit Portland, and for whatever reason - my conspicuous 
absentmindedness or the cold medicine I'm high on - I didn't feel a thing. I 
walked out into the streets of downtown to ambulances screaming all around 
and ladies freaking out and running out of buildings. I went to the little 
soup stand I always go to, and the soup guy asked if I had felt the 
earthquake, and I said, you know it's funny but I DIDN'T. And he said, well 
that IS funny because I didn't either. But I think we're the only two who 
didn't notice it. Weird, huh!

Thanks for checking though.

Kate

AWCCASEY@aol.com on 02/28/2001 01:00:29 PM
Kate,just wanted to make sure you are alright.We woke up to the reports on
Cnn,looks like you might have felt a little shakin down in Portland.Send me
an e-mail when you get a chance..B

For anyone who didn't see David Letterman the other night, this is a true 
story. A little long, but not dirty (for those who might be offended) and 
totally worth the read: 

On a recent weekend in Atlantic City, a woman won a bucketful of quarters at 
a slot machine. She took a break from the slots for dinner with her husband 
in the hotel dining room. But first she wanted to stash 
the quarters in her room. "I'll be right back and we'll go to eat,"she told 
her husband and carried the coin-laden bucket to the elevator. 

As she was about to walk into the elevator she noticed two men already 
aboard. Both were black. One of them was tall...very tall...an intimidating 
figure. The woman froze. Her first thought was: These two are going to rob 
me. Her next thought as: Don't be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice 
gentlemen. But racial stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized her. She 
stood and stared at the two men. She felt anxious, flustered and ashamed. She 
hoped they didn't read her mind but Gosh, they had to know what she was 
thinking!!! Her hesitation about joining them in the elevator was all too 
obvious now. Her face was flushed. She couldn't just stand there, so with a 
mighty effort of will she picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed 
with the other foot and was on the elevator. Avoiding eye contact, she turned 
around stiffly and faced the elevator doors as they closed. A second passed, 
and the another second, and then another. Her fear increased! The elevator 
didn't move. Panic consumed her. My God, she thought, I'm trapped and about 
to be robbed! Her heart plummeted. Perspiration poured from every pore. 

Then one of the men said, "Hit the floor." Instinct told her to do what they 
told her. The bucket of quarters flew upwards as she threw out her arms and 
collapsed on the elevator floor. A shower of coins rained down on her. Take 
my money and spare me, she prayed. More seconds passed. 

She heard one of the men say politely, "Ma'am, if you'll just tell us that 
floor you're going to, we'll push the button." The one who said it had a 
little trouble getting the words out. He was trying mightily to hold in a 
belly laugh. The woman lifted her head and looked up at the two men. 

They reached down to help her up. Confused, she struggled to her feet. "When 
I told my friend here to hit the floor," said the average sized one, "I meant 
that he should hit the elevator button for our floor. I didn't mean for you 
to hit the floor, ma'am." He spoke genially. He bit his lip. It was obvious 
he was having a hard time not laughing. 

The woman thought: "My God, what a spectacle I've made of myself". She was 
humiliated to speak. She wanted to blurt out an apology, but words failed 
her. How do you apologize to two perfectly respectable gentlemen for behaving 
as though they were going to rob you? She didn't know what to say. The three 
of them gathered up the strewn quarters and refilled her bucket. 

When the elevator arrived at her floor they then insisted on walking her to 
her room. She seemed a little unsteady on her feet, and they were afraid she 
might not make it down the corridor. At her door they bid her a good evening. 
As she slipped into her room she could hear them roaring with laughter as 
they walked back to the elevator. The woman brushed herself off. She pulled 
herself together and went downstairs for dinner with her husband. 

The next morning flowers were delivered to her room - a dozen roses. Attached 
to EACH rose was a crisp one hundred dollar bill. The card said: "Thanks for 
the best laugh we've had in years." It was signed; 

Eddie Murphy & Michael Jordan 

I'd like to talk to you about the details of my offer letter if you have a 
chance today. I'll stop by your desk in just a bit.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate,

Thanks again for the info.  It just occurred to me that we should probably 
get this on the first or second workday of the month to get the last days of 
the previous months' prices (we have to send an end of month report to 
customers), or as soon as all of the prices are available.  Is that doable?

Caroline

Yes - it's a Puget deal. I'm trying to contact Sean right now to see if he 
and Diana overlapped on these deals. I only see them written once in his 
trade log, but I'm auditing the second two to find out who entered them. 

Kerri Thompson@ENRON

534497 is a pudget deal?

   Kate Symes @ ECT                02/28/2001 04:42 PM

Verified with Diana and Sean - these should be APB.

and the Williams deal should be resolved - deal # is 534497

Sean and Diana just returned - found out they had doubled up on those puget 
deals - i'm killing 534496 and 534497 right now.

Kerri Thompson@ENRON
02/28/2001 02:53 PM
the broker does not show these trades twice, already confirmed deals 534167 
and 534168.  pls verify that sean or diana did both of these deals twice.

Sorry Sharon. I just entered this deal for Matt Motley, and my deal entry 
defaults to all days. This is a peak deal and should only flow Monday through 
Saturday, hours 7-22. It's been changed to reflect that.

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

Deal # 460860 is entered as flowing every day of the week.  Is this correct?  
Please let me know when it is changed.

Option terms are not reflected in the system. Trade date has been changed to

   Kate Symes                02/28/2001 12:11 PM

Tim - would you like a copy of this deal's confirmation letter?

Carla - you entered this deal on 2/23/01. Should it be back-dated to match 
trade date on confirmation letter?

Thanks,
Kate
Kate,  we received the executed Confirmation Letter from Portland Legal 
yesterday with Department of Water Resources a division of the State of 
California -CDWR believe it is trade 530608.01.  The confirmation has special 
terms to extend the terms of the trade by a specific date and time regarding 
the option.  
Needed to know if you need a copy of this confirmation to note this and we 
have trade date on our confirmation letter as Feb. 22, 2001.  The trade in 
enpower has a trade date of Feb 23, 2001 Trader: Tim Belden                   
   please let me know.  

Thank you

this sudden attack come from? that's low - especially considering i'm deathly 
ill but still slaving away at work to band-aid the mistakes you guys spend

Beginning tomorrow this report will contain Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE)  
trade numbers and volumes, in addition to EOL and brokered deal information. 
Please look for that information at the beginning of the e-mail. Also note 
that the ICE data is released one day later, so it will not correlate 
directly to the EOL data below it. (i.e. Daily EOL Summary 3/1 will include 
ICE data from 2/28) Enjoy...

Diana stepped out of the office for a minute, but I left the e-mail printout 
on her desk and I'll talk to her about it when she gets in.

There are four deals on the no report that look like they sould be 
confirmed.  Can you take a look at them and check to see why they are coded 
not to be confirmed?

#533919
#533931
#533932
#533934

I guess you have seen the email that shows what your computer looks like when 
you work in (or apparently near) California?  You open it and the screen 
starts moving around.

Stay well!

Diana just told me that these deals are NOT supposed to be confirmed. She's 
taking care of that. Let me know if you need copies of the letters or if 
you'd like to speak to Diana directly.

Can you change the time zone to PPT so that the strips accurately splits the 
zime change for April.

The first strip should be   4/1 - 4/1    M-S    PDT   07-22
The next strip should be  4/2 - 4/30  M-S   PDT   07-22

Thanks!

I've put a call in to Mike Driscoll to see which deal is correct. He "fixed" 
them yesterday, but frankly I have no idea what he really did, as they still 
look completely different. As soon as I confirm with him, I'll change the 
deals and let you know.

Thanks,
Kate

Kerri Thompson@ENRON

   Kate Symes @ ECT                11/15/2000 06:09 PM

Mike Driscoll went in and changed this deal to match 458405. It should be 
correct now.

458406 

i don't think this deal is entered correctly, the hours are not matching the 
other deals.  can you pls check on this deal

thanks

do you mean you changed it to PPT - it looks like that's what's in there 
already...

Kerri Thompson@ENRON
03/01/2001 09:04 AM
ch deal 534053 to ppt

It looks like your Deal Blotter settings may be defaulting to PST time zone. 
But these April deals need to flow during the PDT time zone. Could you check 
your settings and make sure the time zone defaults to PPT (that way the 
strips will choose PST or PDT accordingly)?

Two additional deals were changed to the correct time zone:
534074
534072
534071
534053

Thanks,
Kate
 
Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON
03/01/2001 08:45 AM
Kate,

these are the following deals I have amended the time zones to PPT instead of 
PST and amended the strips to reflect the change:
534066
534473
534077
534078
534064
534058

Also, these are only the brokered deals between Tom and Mark.  There may be 
some non-brokered deals in enpower with a flow of April and the time zone 
needs to be changed to PPT and the strips amended as well.  Can you please 
run a query and check the other deals to make sure the time zone is correct 
because if not they will not be scheduled correctly for April. 

If you have any question please call me.  

Thanks!!

Will you be sending confirm letters on these Modesto deals, or just verbally 
confirming them? Could you let Sharen or myself know so we can get something 
on record with the Confirms group in Houston?

Thanks,
Kate
	
	

Thanks and yes, we will need copies of the letters.  If she could send us the 
same copy she sends to the counterparty, then we can put it into our files 
and we won't have to call her repeatedly when we are trying to get a signed 
copy from the counterparty for the files.

This is worth reading.

FRIENDHSIP WEEK

If we could shrink the earth's population to a village of precisely
100 people, with all the existing human ratios remaining the same, it
would look something like the following: there would be:

57 asians
21 europeans
14 from the western hemisphere, both north and south
8  africans

52 would be female
48 would be male

70 would be non-white
30 would be white
70 would be non-christian
30 would be christian
89 would be heterosexual
11 would be homosexual
6  people would possess 59% of the entire world's wealth and all 6 be
from  the United States.
80 would live in substandard housing
70 would be unable to read
50 would suffer from malnutrition
1  would be near death
1  would be near birth
1  (yes, only 1) would have a college education
1  would own a computer

When one considers our world from such a compressed perspective, the
need for acceptance, understanding and education becomes glaringly
apparent.

The following is also something to ponder...

If you woke up this morning with more health than illness...you are
more blessed than the million who will not survive this week. If you have
never experienced the danger of battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the
agony of torture, or the pangs of starvation you are ahead of 500 million
people in the world.

If you can attend a church meeting without fear of harassment,
arrest, torture, or death...you are more blessed than three billion people
in
the world.

If you have food in the refrigerator, clothes on your back, a roof
overhead and a place to sleep...you are richer than 75% of this
world.

If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change in a
dish someplace ... you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.

If your parents are still alive and still married ... you are very
rare.

If you can read this message, you just received a double blessing in
that someone was thinking of you, and furthermore, you are more blessed
than over two billion people in the world that cannot read at all.

Someone once said:  what goes around comes around.

Work  like you don't need the money.
Love  like you've never been hurt.
Dance like nobody's watching.
Sing  like nobody's listening.
Live  like it's heaven on earth.

It's national friendship week. Send this to everyone you consider a
friend. Pass this on, and brighten someone's day. Nothing will happen
if you do not decide to pass it along. the only thing that will happen,
if you do pass it on, is that someone might smile because of you.

I've started to transfer my Dow Jones e-mails into five separate folders 
which can be found at:

P:\Scheduling\Dow Jones - Cob\Mead\Mid-C\NP-SP\Palo 

You can already access February's files for each of these delivery points, 
and prior months will be coming in soon as I have free moments in the day.

I'm not exactly sure where the spreadsheet on our site comes from. Our 
preference is to keep everything in our SQL Server database, and many of the 
people that you mentioned have read access to that. When Julie Sarnowski gets 
back from vacation next week, let's talk about uploading these data to the 
server and providing a central facility for the floor.

   Kate Symes                02/21/2001 03:19 PM

I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
index prices in order to run one of her reports.

I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
(I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Chris, Can you please give me a list of all of the middle market traders?  
I want to make sure we don't leave anyone out.

Thanks,

At the suggestion of Tim B. we are going to implement a procedure for Middle 
Market Transcation Deal Entry and Confirmation.  I will be writing this 
procedure.  There have been some confirms sent out recently that were 
inaccurate and some other EnPower entry issues.  More importantly, however, 
Tim simply wants to tighten procedures as a risk control mechanism.  He also 
will be writing procedures for other things various folks in his group do. 
These procedures will be put into a West Trading Procedure Book that is being 
created.  To get this process started (prior to my writing it up), please 
immediately start doing the following:

1.  On every future trade you do, tell the trader taking the position (i.e LT 
NW, ST CA, etc.) that you should be identified as the trader.  By doing this, 
you will be responsible for making sure the deal is confirmed properly.  
Otherwise, they are responsible for the accuracy of the Confirm.  
2.  I will be sent a copy of all MM group confirms from Houston and will be 
putting them into a Master MM Confirms notebook.  When received, I will 
indicate to you that it is here and you will be responsible for checking it 
and making sure it is accurate.  An accurate confirm generally means the deal 
was entered correctly into EnPower.
3.  For all existing deals that you think should be included in this notebook 
because they are a little hairy and you want to make sure your hands are 
clean with respect to an accurate confirm, please make sure I get a copy as 
soon as possible.

Thanks

Chris

When you guys do loss return deals like this one with PGE, could you include 
a note in the comments section regarding the zero price and "no confirm" 
status? The Confirms group in Houston has requested some kind of comment in 
these deals so they don't try to track down a price or confirm the deal.

Thanks,
Kate

Would you let me know when you might have a minute today, or sometime this 
week, to go over the EES spreadsheet with me? I want to understand how the 
Real Time group uses this data so I can depict it more accurately and avoid 
making errors.

Thanks,

Kate, I am checking out EES February deals with Brocklyn Couch and problems 
were noted on two deals 512775.1 on the 5th & 527967.1 on the 22nd.

EES was not agreeing to what we (Enron Power) has in Enpower.  Per Phil 
Platter our numbers are correct and the worksheet needs to be updated to 
reflect Enpower.

EES stated they will adjust their numbers once they get an updated sheet. 
Thanks,

Mark 

Energy type is Firm in EnPower - is this correct? Counterparty seems to 
disagree. Please let me know when you get a chance.

Kate
Kate, could you ask Tom if this transaction is suppose to be Firm in Enpower. 
Their confirmation says Non-Firm, Transmission Contingent. Could you ask him 
which is correct?

I've forwarded both these e-mails to Tom. He's in a trading meeting right 
now, but we'll clear up the energy type when he gets out.

Kate

Tom entered this trade as Firm and FPL says on their confirmation as 
Transmission Contingent. Which is correct?

Tom says this deal was firm energy, but it is transmission contingent. When 
Tom did the deal with FPL, he said he wouldn't buy it unless the energy was 
firm. The power has already been delivered, however, so Tom said it shouldn't 
matter what kind of energy the confirm has, so for the sake of getting it 
done, he said just to agree with what they have in their confirmation. Does 
that make any sense? And the same goes for deal 516506.

He is still disputing the price (where Enron shows $90 and FPL shows $95 in 
deal 517520), and he's expecting a call back from Jeff Wallace on that.

Thanks,
Kate

Yes, deal should have zero volume. Looks like Jeremy just didn't have time to 
kill it so he zeroed it out. I'll kill it, but in the meantime, it's not a

Re: Deal discrepancies for the month of February. Following are the problems 
that have been brought to my attention and the solutions we've reached. 
Please call me with questions. 

This spreadsheet includes a missing purchase for total of 55 mw @ 195.00 on 
2/25. Sorry for the confusion - per Bill Williams III.

This spreadsheet includes modified volumes in the fixed price sale at ZP-26 
on 2/6. 

In addition, deal 525625.2 has been corrected in scheduling (there was one 
strip duplicating HE 8) and autoscheduled.  Deal 529314.1 has also been 
autoscheduled, which should remedy the discrepancy on 2/24, HE 7-17. Please 
let me know if the new CARP report does not reflect this.

I was one of those technological wizards, I'd just come up with my own e-mail 
birthday greeting, and it would KICK ASS! Anyway, just to take even more of 
the fun out of your birthday, I thought I'd just go ahead and let you know 
what I'm getting you: money. Of course. I'm actually paying you back the $200 
I still owe you, and kicking in an extra $50. How's that sound? It should 
reach you by next Thursday (when I get paid), so you can plan you're life 
around it's arrival accordingly. Would it be easier for you to cash a check 
or a money order? I think cash in the mail is a little too risky. I can also 
use that money to buy you something, get you a Safeway gift certificate, 
c.d.'s, etc., if you'd rather. Let me know what you're preference is - this 
bank is willing to work with any customer requests. Hope your birthday rocks. 
I'm sorry I couldn't be there to celebrate (read: get insanely inebriated) 
with you, and that I couldn't contribute to the birthday fund sooner. 

Love,
Kate

I'm sorry - I haven't been keeping up with the Dow Jones data storage. I can 
put the data in the sheet - I just need to take a look at how you've set it 
up and determine what I should be entering where. I'm running to grab some 
lunch right now, but when I get back let's talk about how to compare the Dow 
Jones volumes with our daily volumes. I can either send you my data sheet 
each afternoon, or add a Dow Jones volume table to the sheet myself - however 
you'd like. We'll talk.

Kate

Cara Semperger

Are you going to put the data in the sheet, or are you not able to do that.  
If not, just send the sheet to the file, and I will do it.

Also, I want to get with you about your daily deal data, because I want to 
run a Dow volume vs our volume data set daily.

Hello

Melissa Murphy would like us to begin adding a note in the comments section 
of all the deals we change. I know most of you already do this when you make 
big changes to deals, but she'd like to see more comments more often. Of 
course this mostly applies to me, but I thought I'd pass it along just in 
case. See the attached e-mail, and let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,

Hi, I was wondering if it would too time consuming for you to add a note in 
the comments box inside deal entry when you change a deal.  We always try to 
put a note in the comments box so it is easier to research what has changed 
on a trade in the future.  If you could add notes it would help us out when 
we are researching past deals.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks,

today. Do they need to reconfirm this? Please let me know.

This was just a practice deal entered by Phil yesterday to test our new

Testing was done in the test database; however, once they released the new 
version of deal entry into production, they tested one more time to make sure 
that the new fields were pulling into our scheduling reports. It was a 
precautionary measure taken so that we wouldn't enter deals all day long only 
to find out that they wouldn't show up in the Enpower to CAPS report at the 
end of the day. Sorry for the confusion.

Questions about this deal - 

1. Should energy type be CAISO? 
2. Should trade date be 3/7?
3. Should confirmation status be "NO"?

I believe the answer to all of these is yes, but I wanted to check before 
changing anything. The confirms group is getting extra sensitive about deals 
marked for confirmation, since they are now confirming all daily deals. Just 
a reminder to double-check your default settings and your deals for the 
confirmation status.

Thanks,
Kate

I'm losing my mind. Did I already forward this note to you? Do you still need 
the confirmation information? I can print out whatever they have stored in 
Livelink, or you can contact Stephanie - it looks like she has what you were 
searching for.

Thanks,
Kate
Kate, I was looking into this per Valarie; do you still need the information, 
I have located the deal. 

Thanks
Stephanie
   
	
	

We are researching this deal and need your help.

Could you take a look at this deal?  I've pulled the audit viewer and the 
deal tickets.  My real question is - what deal do we actually have 
confirmed?  Leg 3 was the deal we carried on our books that had the expiry in 
March.  Since Modesto did not exercise, we realized a rather small fortune 
and want to make sure it was a real deal.  

I think we do not want to contact our counterparty but we do want to pull the 
deal records for confirm.  Can you help? 

x7756

are they sweets of any kind?

you're kidding! that's ludicrous! what exactly is there?

I just spoke with Kim Hundl in the Confirms group. She's been told by PGE 
that they do not want confirmation letters sent for daily deals. Apparently 
there are a bunch of these in the system under your desk that are noted to be 
confirmed. The confirms group can change all of these deals to "no confirm," 
but they wanted to double-check with you guys first. Do you agree with PGE, 
or would you like these deals confirmed? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

To re-cap:
I will talk to Will Smith in Houston IT about adding a function in Deal 
Blotter to choose confirm or no confirm. In the meantime, Houston Confirms 
group would greatly appreciate us changing these deals to no confirm. They 
will assume that all daily deals done with PGE are no confirm, but the deals 
will still show up on their report (and cause confirm group crankiness) if 
they are marked to be confirmed. Thanks for your help.

Kate

Diana Scholtes
03/09/2001 12:24 PM
I just heard the same.  I was talking to Tim about the requirements being 
made regarding daily confirmations, and the final decision was not to confirm 
PGE daily deals.  Question though,  when we put deals into the system in 
Blotter, they automatically confirm.  Do we have to go into every deal and 
switch the flag or is there a better way around it?

I'm curious to know how my lack of recent correspondence translates to a 
neglect of my brainpower. If I didn't know better, I'd say that was a purely 
conceited statement. But, of course, being the buff brain-builder that I am, 
I know it's not.

So how are things "down" there in Seattle? I've been meaning to check in with 
you and Michael to make sure you didn't lose any limbs in the big Quake of 
'01. By the sounds of it you've been left with at least your digits and a 
little imagination, which isn't half bad compared to the poor capitol 
building in Olympia, whose crumbling edifice has turned into another of those 
perfunctory "news" stories begging the question, "Just how much will I ever 
care?" Last evening's t.v. news actually had the bad sense to show footage of 
city construction workers picking their noses atop the dome while a coiffed 
blonde anchorwoman alerted viewers to the "urgency of the building's 
reconstruction" due to its "inability to be inhabited until 2003." Is it just 
me, or do t.v. newspeople seem to act stupid on purpose?

Speaking of stupid, what exactly is walpurgis night? And the Pogues? I 
realize I'm showing my lack of culture here, but curiosity always overtakes 
my elegant facade sooner or later. Speaking of elegant, we're having another 
party! And Amber might actually show up for this one, being that it's purpose 
is to celebrate her birthday. First weekend in April, April 7 to be exact, 
we'll be the proud hostesses of a 25th birthday/costume party. I'd love for 
you and Michael to grace us with your presence, but it sounds like you'll be 
halfway across the globe by then. If plans change, and for your sake I 
certainly hope they don't, give us a call or just drop in on the 7th.

I've got to run - there are energy crises to be mitigated, you know. But drop 
me a message before you take off for wine country. And watch out for falling 
pieces of crumbling buildings.

Kate

hey there.

it's not walpurgis night that's coming up but St Patrick's day. That's when
the little leprechaun in me comes out with a vial of food color and turns
the beer of the city green. I also like to fling myself around to the
accompaniment of the Pogues.

i'm just saying hello. Haven't heard from you in a while, which I take to be
a good thing. It means that, like the rest of us, you are using only a
minimal percentage of your brain.

life has been speeding by here like a golden motorcycle. in two weeks I
leave for New Zealand and even more of my destiny. I don't know how long
I'll be gone, but I'm trying not to worry about it. Right now, I'm just
trying to keep from shivering--it's damn cold in here.

okay, enough rambling. obviously, i have nothing to say.

take care,
jordan

Did you already settle this with Les? It looks like the deal is only flowing 
M-S, on peak hours. Let me know.

This deal is in as flowing every day, hours 7 -22, including Sundays.  Is 
this correct?

Thanks!

Bob -
Val was looking into this deal, but now that she's gone I wonder if you could 
help me with it. It's a swap that was done on 10/18/99 between LTWM and EES. 
It's an off-peak deal for 0.2 mw at a price of $23.00 and settlement index of 
PX SP-15. There are five legs that each run for one year - Cal'05 through 
Cal'09. 

I understand you've been working on making the switch from PX to Dow Jones 
indices. Do you know anything about this deal and whether or not its index 
needs to be changed? Please let Melissa or me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Hello, I noticed that deal # 253768 is an index deal with EES that has not 
been changed from the CAL PX to the Dow Jones index.  Could you ask Valerie 
or Bob Badeer if this deal should be changed?  I was going to send them a 
revised confirm.

Thanks!
Melissa

Yes, that's fine if you bring the discrepancies by later. Or I can swing by 
your desk to get them. I think I know why Mark is confused about the price. 
At the beginning of this month we started running into situations where we 
had to purchase from EES in addition to selling to them - which is all we had 
been doing to cover their load before. We determined, however, that when EPMI 
buys from EES, the price should be $5 less than our fixed price average for 
the day. (When EPMI sells to EES, the price is $5 more than the fixed price 
average.) In this way, we're still making our profit from the coverage of 
their load. Either the correct price is not reflected in the spreadsheet we 
sent them, or we purchased at the wrong price - we were working the kinks out 
right at the beginning of March, so it makes sense that they'd have questions 
regarding that time frame.

Also, I've already talked with Daniel Kang at EES to work out some 
discrepancies with him. He asked about volumes at the beginning of March, but 
didn't seem to have a question about price, so I'm wondering if everyone over 
there is communicating with each other. Please let me know what I can do to 
resolve this - and feel free to send Mark my way when he has questions. 

Kate

Virginia Thompson

Dear Bill, 

Please read forward below.
I've seen a few problems with EES lately.  Last month, Kate Symes took care 
of the differences (she knows more about EES).  You may want to contact her 
to find out what has been happening lately to cause the differences.  Sorry - 
don't know much more.

the EES differences for March.  Both of these have to do with the ST-Whourly 
desk where we are lower by $5.00 then what EES has.  I spoke with Thresa and 
she suggested we have Bill Williams look at these in case their is a trend 
started for the month and we can catch it now.

Thanks,

Mark

Mary Hain said she would get the paperwork going on this master agreement. 
Either Mary or I will be in touch to let you know when this is in place.

Thanks,

Can you check with Cara and see if this deal should have been put in as a 
buy/resale.  We don't have transmission with this entity (WAPA-CRSP).  Let me 
know.  

I've been keeping track of this with Tracy Ngo, our credit gal, and the last 
thing I heard on it this morning was that it's still pending credit. Tracy is 
in a meeting right now, but I'll grab her as soon as she gets out (she sits 
next to me) and find out what the status is. Unfortunately, Tracy said when a 
deal is "pending credit approval" it's a little vague as to when the decision 
will be made. Mike Swerzbin told her last night that he wasn't concerned 
about whether or not the deal was approved, so without the trader on credit's 
case, I think sometimes deals get lost in the shuffle. But I'll keep on top 
of it and let you know this afternoon.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate, what's the status of this deal?

   Kate Symes @ ECT                03/12/2001 10:57 AM

this deal is contingent on credit - he'll let me know later today whether or 
not it's a good trade.

Prebon sent over a confirm for a deal where:
Enron (Mike Swerzbin) buys from PPL Montana Cal'04-Cal'06 25 mw of Mid-C at 
$45.00 off-peak hours.

They did not tell me about this deal during checkout.  Can you please check 
with Mike.

Thanks!!

Done.

Kate,

Please approve and autoschedule annuity 442260. For Sept. 30,  2000.

les

Tracy just told me this counterparty (PPL Montana) is still pending credit. 
Mike Swerzbin said he would prefer to wait this out, because he stands to 
make money on the deal. So in the meantime, I've been told by credit that we 
can't enter the deal in the system and calc it. I'm not sure how this works 
in your case with the Prebon check-out, but basically it's a pending credit 
deal that will potentially show up in our system once EPMI and PPL Montana 
reach an agreement. Does that help? Let me know.

Thanks,
Kate

Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!

I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck in 
those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are going 
really well though (Rocky Mountain "highs") and that you've made it through 
most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain "lows"). Amber 
tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour, he mentions how 
they've got to get together with you when she comes to town - which will be 
on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets to go and I don't, 
being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of college and therefore do 
not enjoy such things as "Spring Break Mania" anymore. And Monica tells Marky 
who tells Amber who tells me that she'd love to hang out with you more often. 
It sounds like you guys had a ball at dinner, eh? So you've got options, 
girlfriend, which is worlds more than I can say for my life at the mo'. It 
pretty much consists of working, eating, and sleeping. I'm definitely looking 
into that SAD mental disorder thing, because I think it's got me in its 
clutches. But the recent abundance of sunshine has brought me enough renewed 
energy to start thinking about life after winter. We're doing lots of 
gardening, cooking, and decorating at the house - it's like having three 
Martha Stewarts all working together, only slightly less stylish , immensely 
less efficient, and drunk. Other than that, I've been trying to organize and 
simplify my life - taking care of mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, 
sorting out all those nagging little post-it notes that plague me constantly 
and demand my attention in vain. I'm actually starting to see the light at 
the end of the tunnel, like maybe I could buy a car or take a trip in a few 
months, or even buy a SECOND pair of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy 
just yet. So I heard Dad and Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods 
with an automobile. That is, in the immortal words of the guys in "Dude, 
where's my car?", SWEET... DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load 
off - just make sure to keep your finances in check and not get in over your 
head. Take it from one who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old 
beater car; but then I start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and 
suddenly $30,000 doesn't seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. 
Lately I've been doing a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I 
just applied for post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking 
economics and poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from 
work!) I'm also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get 
serious about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies 
and/or economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found 
my dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a 
two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington 
and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does it 
get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for 
government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in 
my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not 
getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it, dude. 
As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so much 
energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as I'm 
having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By the 
time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in 100 
million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest paragraph of 
my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a thrilling tour 
of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in exchange for a 
finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the information for 
it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever make it home for a 
weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray is coming to the 
Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your concert ticket if you 
can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me soon if you can, or I'll 
call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!

Love,
Kate

Hey Lady!

What do you think you're doing?  I haven't talked to you in way too long.
You have to update me on the sitch!  I am going on a date with a guy I met
while out with Monica last weekend.  He was our waiter and he looks like
Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see
that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?).  She is so
fun!  I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.  And
now I have a date, so I'm excited.  I'm still in contact with Mr.
Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.  In
fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!  Anyway, that's crazy news
about Mom's house!  I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home.
How are your roommates?  Your seattle boyfriend?  Your job?  Write me with
the goods, woman.  I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited
than any car-buyer has ever been.  My job is great, although i think I'm

Nothing else is happening.  Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day?  I have
to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to
afterwards.  Okay, must go work.  Call me though!  I miss you!

Love, Anna

Okay - let me know if you need anything later.

Kate,

Never Mind I found my problem.

Les

Yep - the strips are changed to reflect term 3/15 to 3/31. Glad that's 
finally solved!

Thanks,
Kate

03/14/2001 07:01 AM
Prebon agrees now because the confirm is exactly what we have, however, can 
you change both strips to reflect 3/15-3/31 in enpower (deal 549052).

Thanks!

   Kate Symes @ ECT                03/13/2001 05:45 PM

We've changed this to a BOM deal (term 3/15 to 3/31), but Sean still 
recognizes this as an on-peak deal with a price of 241.00. Let me know if 
Prebon still disputes.

Thanks,
Kate

Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON
03/13/2001 03:24 PM
yes- so this is what prebon is saying on this deal 549052:
Enron buys from Pacificorp 25 mw of peak BOM Mid-C at $141.00

Thanks!!

   Kate Symes @ ECT                03/13/2001 05:11 PM

Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.

Thanks,
Kate

Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON
03/13/2001 03:11 PM
yes

   Kate Symes @ ECT                03/13/2001 05:02 PM

549052 - del. point is already in as Mid-C, so just the price is wrong?

Prebon, but forgot to change the strip in the deal. It's fixed now to reflect 
a term of 3/15 to 3/31.

This deal is entered with a span of two weeks on the top half of deal entry 
and one day on the lower half.  Can you check it out?

Thanks!

Our IT group was able to solve the problem on this deal. It wouldn't save 
because the schedule type field was not populating correctly; which was a 
little disturbing because this is an EOL deal, and all fields should populate 
automatically. Dave Poston thinks he's fixed the problem, so you shouldn't 
run into anymore deals that won't save due to blank deal entry fields. If you 
do, though, please let Dave or me know and we'll look into it further. You 
should now be able to add to the deal clearing tab and save the deal.

Thanks,

Hey - what the heck is zero week? I might be interested in signing up for 
that - pack in some quick credits for my pre-grad school work. I figured out 
I'm going to essentially have to get a second bachelor's degree before going 
to grad school. But hey, it's all about the credentials man - as in, being 
able to tell people at my 10-year high school reunion that I have two 
bachelor's degrees, a master's, and a Rhodes Scholarship to study Italian 
wine in a 12th century villa, surrounded by buff, tan, and unusually 
good-looking farm workers.Tres important! 

So yeah, maybe we'll hold off on the visit for now. I think it's more 
important for us both to feel mentally stable about our finances for right 
now - then we party! I could maybe make it out there in April, overlap with 
mom's trip (I don't think I could handle the whole thing with her...) - I'll 
keep it in mind. And yeah, she's giddy about this whole house move thing. I 
hope it works out for the best - I really think it will. I'm starting to feel 
really bad about leaving Kitty with her, but I'm in a weird situation with 
Amber's cat at our house already. Part of me wants to just bring Kitty over 
and tell everyone to deal with it because it's my house too; but the other 
part of me doesn't want to deal with the bloodshed that will ensue between 
her and Amber's outmatched feline. Oh well, I'm thinking about it. 

The most excitement I'll be having this week is my haircut with Brett 
tonight. I think I might also be purchasing a bedskirt, a totally extraneous 
and disappointing expense that I would never have had if I hadn't insisted on 
getting a "real" house with a "real" bed and all that other crap that goes 
along with it and inevitably costs you money that you could have otherwise 
spent on beer. And as the sands flow, these are the days of our lives....

I'm so impressed with your dating maneuvers. I told Amber and Molly about it 
last night at dinner, which we ate together around our new dining room table, 
and they both said in unison, "Like sister, like sister." I guess I have some 
kind of reputation for ending up on dates with waiters - go figure. Anyway, 
it's time for me to go find something to eat and then come back to my desk 
and consume it while it flows directly to my butt. Can't wait! Write back 
soon.

Kate

Anna Symes <annas@cobs.edu> on 03/14/2001 09:18:15 AM
I'm so glad to hear everything's better at your house!  I totally want to
come visit, but my last two paycheck deposits have only raised the balance
to $0 so it may be awhile.  I'm definitely coming in June, when I take a
zero week class in Eugene.  Mom's supposedly coming out here in April and we
might go to Glenwood Springs (hot springs, spa, MASSAGES!).  You should
come, too!  Fun female family bonding time!

I am so excited for Dad to visit, not just because of the car but also
because it will increase my quantity of social engagements by about 100%.
I'm a little worried about the effect it's having on Mom, who asked me when
he was coming so she wouldn't "run into him".  Like I would allow that to
happen - how stupid does she think I am?  But it sounds like she's pretty
stoked about this house thing, so I'm excited for her.

I have a date with that waiter guy tonight, but I'm not really that excited
because I am fat, ugly and on the third day of my period.  Did I mention
broke and car-less?  I think I should just put off this whole dating thing
until I increase MY net value (to use Kate-speak), which is just ground zero
for most people.  I am trying to pay off some debt (Dad took care of most of
it, but I didn't have the heart to show him my Nordstrom account).  It's
slow-going, though.  And car payments will not make it easy, but seriously
this city is so pedestrian-unfriendly that I feel I have no choice.  I tried
to go to my tennis lessons the other day and ended up walking along the
shoulder of a highway for twenty minutes.  And every person in Denver feels
the need to own a dog and allow it to bark menacingly at every passerby (I
am SO afraid of dogs after my brush with death in the form of a Doberman).
So I need a car,  and I don't care if it means weekly visits to the plasma
"donation" center.

I actually met Marky's ex the other night (maybe don't mention to Amber - I
don't know why but the whole thing seems weird and I would rather stay out
of it).  Anyway, she is really cool!  She reminds me of my friend Jen
Sturmer, except less anorexic and depressed.  Speaking of, have you been
going out in Portland a lot?  I miss Veritable Quandary!  I haven't found
anything like that here yet.  Downtown has some cool bars, but you have to
pay $90 plus an appendage to park and cabs are not cheap either.  My
neighborhood has some good dives, like the one on our corner that has a
flickering neon sign outside announcing "Don's Mixed Drinks" - not sure, but
think that's the name of the bar.  I went in once and met Don, the king of
multiple body piercings here in Denver.

Okay, I'm rambling.  Time to get back to work (which is so good lately, by
the way!  I get to start grant-writing this month!).  Hope all's well for
you.  I'll give you the dirt on my date later, if my acne doesn't scare him
away in minute one.  Miss you, love you!!

Love, yo sista

Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!

I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck
in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are
going really well though (Rocky Mountain "highs") and that you've made it
through most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain
"lows"). Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour,
he mentions how they've got to get together with you when she comes to town
- which will be on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets
to go and I don't, being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of
college and therefore do not enjoy such things as "Spring Break Mania"
anymore. And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that she'd
love to hang out with you more often. It sounds like you guys had a ball at
dinner, eh? So you've got options, girlfriend, which is worlds more than I
can say for my life at the mo'. It pretty much consists of working, eating,
and sleeping. I'm definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing,
because I think it's got me in its clutches. But the recent abundance of
sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life
after winter. We're doing lots of gardening, cooking, and decorating at the
house - it's like having three Martha Stewarts all working together, only
slightly less stylish , immensely less efficient, and drunk. Other than
that, I've been trying to organize and simplify my life - taking care of
mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, sorting out all those nagging little
post-it notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain.
I'm actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, like maybe
I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months, or even buy a SECOND pair
of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy just yet. So I heard Dad and
Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile. That
is, in the immortal words of the guys in "Dude, where's my car?", SWEET...
DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load off - just make sure to
keep your finances in check and not get in over your head. Take it from one
who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old beater car; but then I
start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and suddenly $30,000 doesn't
seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. Lately I've been doing
a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I just applied for
post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking economics and
poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from work!) I'm
also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get serious
about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies and/or
economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found my
dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a
two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington
and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does
it get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for
government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in
my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not
getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it,
dude. As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so
much energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as
I'm having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By
the time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in
100 million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest
paragraph of my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a
thrilling tour of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in
exchange for a finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the
information for it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever
make it home for a weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray
is coming to the Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your
concert ticket if you can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me
soon if you can, or I'll call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!

Love,
Kate

Anna Symes <annas@cobs.edu> on 03/13/2001 02:55:09 PM

Hey Lady!

What do you think you're doing?  I haven't talked to you in way too long.
You have to update me on the sitch!  I am going on a date with a guy I met
while out with Monica last weekend.  He was our waiter and he looks like
Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see
that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?).  She is so
fun!  I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.  And
now I have a date, so I'm excited.  I'm still in contact with Mr.
Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.  In
fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!  Anyway, that's crazy news
about Mom's house!  I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home.
How are your roommates?  Your seattle boyfriend?  Your job?  Write me with
the goods, woman.  I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited
than any car-buyer has ever been.  My job is great, although i think I'm
getting scoliosis from bad posture in an uncomfortable chair all day.
Nothing else is happening.  Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day?  I
have
to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to
afterwards.  Okay, must go work.  Call me though!  I miss you!

How crazy would that be if we had three generations of Symes in one 
classroom! If I were one of the other students and I figured out there were 
three siblings in my class, I might actually consider that a little bizarre, 
like a circus family or something. But whatever. I'm definitely into it 
though - that is, if U.O. has decided to forgive my errant freshman year 
behavior that got me booted from those luxurious residance halls and re-admit 
me. They're probably looking over my application right now and just pissing 
themselves, "Wait a minute - that good-for-nothing druggy thinks she's going 
to GRADUATE SCHOOL...HAHAHAHAHAHA..." and so on. 

And by the way, I didn't mean to throw you into a fit of Catholic guilt over 
the kitty thing. She's totally fine, and mom actually likes her. I think my 
presence actually upsets the balance. And I think this move might be good for 
her - she'll be going back to her apartment roots. The real martyr in all of 
this is Big Kitty, who still looks completely baffled when Kitty hurtles 
herself at him from behind doorways and such. After she does that, they 
generally both walk away from each other just looking completely dissatisfied 
with the whole thing - Big Kitty because he's old and demented and everything 
confuses him, and Kitty because she's young and demented and everything 
pisses her off. Gotta love it. 

So you look like Jennifer now? Hey, don't underestimate the one-time 
popularity of that haircut. Everything comes back into fashion at some point. 
I will tell Brett you said hi. His wife just had her baby - they are such a 
freaking cute little family it makes me depressed. Even more than I already 
am from having to sit around my house all the time and listen to Amber and 
Molly call their respective boyfriends "schmoopy" and swap sex stories. It's 
thoroughly disgusting, and I've told them so. They just throw their heads 
back and laugh with self-satisfied couple-induced mania. And there you have 
my happy little family.....

Have fun on your date tonight! Just go into it like you have nothing to lose, 
which you don't, and like you don't care, which you shouldn't. 'Kay?

Love ya,
Kate

Anna Symes <annas@cobs.edu> on 03/14/2001 03:11:54 PM
Zero week is a one-week, four-credit course in June at U of O.  I'm trying
to get John to do it, too.  Maybe we should all take one together!  Anyway,
the website is uosummer.uoregon.edu (no www), but unfortunately none of the
info is posted yet because they're all a bunch of lazy pot-smoking
superfreaks over there in Eugene.  Usually you can choose from any general
ed courses - I'm taking polisci because I need it for my major.  They'll
have journalism and stuff like that.  We could crash at John's house and
party till the wee hours with all the wee freshmen!

I feel bad about Kitty, too.  Is she getting more nuts than ever?  I would
love to bring her out here if it wasn't for the obvious obstacles (she could
never go outside, she would rip my face off on the ride over, etc.).  If she
is still doing bad next year when my lease runs out, we could consider
bringing her out here.  I could move into a house.  Anyway, I'm sorry to
hear about the whole thing.  I feel really guilty too.  Hopefully Mom is
available for the five minutes a day that Kitty actually wants contact with
humans.

Well, have fun getting your hair cut and tell Brett I said hi!  I got my
hair cut here and the man confused me with Jennifer Aniston circa 1990.  I
look like a freak, and my hair is oily, and I don't want to go on this date.

Have a good night!

away in minute one.  Miss you, love you!!

Love, yo sista

Dearest Anna, my most favorite sister of them all!

I'm sorry I've been so bad about staying in touch while you've been stuck
in those Rocky Mountain highs and lows of life. It sounds like things are
going really well though (Rocky Mountain "highs") and that you've made it
through most of the tumult of moving to a new place (Rocky Mountain
"lows"). Amber tells me every time she talks to Marky, her man of the hour,
he mentions how they've got to get together with you when she comes to town
- which will be on next Friday, whoo hoo, party! I'm so mad that she gets
to go and I don't, being that I am not, like her, in my eighth year of
college and therefore do not enjoy such things as "Spring Break Mania"
anymore. And Monica tells Marky who tells Amber who tells me that she'd
love to hang out with you more often. It sounds like you guys had a ball at
dinner, eh? So you've got options, girlfriend, which is worlds more than I
can say for my life at the mo'. It pretty much consists of working, eating,
and sleeping. I'm definitely looking into that SAD mental disorder thing,
because I think it's got me in its clutches. But the recent abundance of
sunshine has brought me enough renewed energy to start thinking about life
after winter. We're doing lots of gardening, cooking, and decorating at the
house - it's like having three Martha Stewarts all working together, only
slightly less stylish , immensely less efficient, and drunk. Other than
that, I've been trying to organize and simplify my life - taking care of
mounds of paperwork, paying off debts, sorting out all those nagging little
post-it notes that plague me constantly and demand my attention in vain.
I'm actually starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, like maybe
I could buy a car or take a trip in a few months, or even buy a SECOND pair
of shoes, but let's not get wild and crazy just yet. So I heard Dad and
Laura are on their way to your neck of the woods with an automobile. That
is, in the immortal words of the guys in "Dude, where's my car?", SWEET...
DUDE! You are stoked. I bet that's a major load off - just make sure to
keep your finances in check and not get in over your head. Take it from one
who knows. I'm seriously looking into buying an old beater car; but then I
start fantasizing about the Audi A4 Quattro, and suddenly $30,000 doesn't
seem like a bad price for becoming ultimately cool. Lately I've been doing
a lot of research into self-improvement measures. I just applied for
post-baccalaureate status at U of O, so I can start taking economics and
poli sci classes online. (I just got my new FREE computer from work!) I'm
also studying for the GRE, and pretty soon here I'm going to get serious
about graduate school. I think I've decided on international studies and/or
economics, depending on how well I like the classes I take. I've found my
dream program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, D.C. It's a
two-year Masters of International Studies program that begins in Washington
and ends in.....are you sitting down?.....Bologna, Italy! Holy shit, does
it get more perfect? Apparently it's like the premiere training ground for
government officials, according to my friend Andy who laughed forcefully in
my face when I told him I wanted to get into it. But I figure, I'm not
getting any younger, and I don't want any regrets, so I'm goin' for it,
dude. As for the love life, it's nonexistant, which is why I'm putting so
much energy into the self-improvement area of my life. I figure as long as
I'm having no fun with boys I might as well be beefing up my net value. By
the time they come around again, the eligible pool will have shrunk to 1 in
100 million. Whatever. Anyway, now that I've written you the longest
paragraph of my life, I must retreat to my work duties. Then it's off for a
thrilling tour of Portland via Tri-Met. Molly's making me dinner tonight in
exchange for a finished resume. It's only taken her 3 years to compile the
information for it, so this one should be a doozy. Hey, if you can ever
make it home for a weekend, you should come at the end of May - David Gray
is coming to the Schnitzer, and it's going to be fabulous! I'll buy your
concert ticket if you can convince Dad to get your plane ticket. Call me
soon if you can, or I'll call this weekend. Take care and I miss you!

Love,
Kate

Hey Lady!

What do you think you're doing?  I haven't talked to you in way too long.
You have to update me on the sitch!  I am going on a date with a guy I met
while out with Monica last weekend.  He was our waiter and he looks like
Chandler Bing, only Monica kept calling him Chanandler Bong (did you see
that episode when they had to name who the TV Guide came to?).  She is so
fun!  I was so glad to get out of my apartment/away from my roommate.  And
now I have a date, so I'm excited.  I'm still in contact with Mr.
Colorblind, but we've had the friends talk so it's been really cool.  In
fact, he's nicer to me now than he was before!  Anyway, that's crazy news
about Mom's house!  I guess no more crashing at her house when I go home.
How are your roommates?  Your seattle boyfriend?  Your job?  Write me with
the goods, woman.  I am getting a car in two weeks and I am more excited
than any car-buyer has ever been.  My job is great, although i think I'm
getting scoliosis from bad posture in an uncomfortable chair all day.
Nothing else is happening.  Are you going out for St. Patrick's Day?  I
have
to work, but there's a big outdoor thing downtown that I might go to
afterwards.  Okay, must go work.  Call me though!  I miss you!

Love, Anna

I added the fee - but was wondering why it didn't default to a fee since 
Bloomberg is an online trading service. I know they're gone now, but if you 
think of it later, you might ask.

This is a problem I've been working on with IT. They released a new version 
of deal entry, and for some reason certain EOL trades are automatically 
populating all of the new fields, including Schedule Type. I've got Dave 
Poston working on this, and I'll let you know when we've fixed it so you can 
save your part.

I've changed 549777 to CAISO energy, but 550838 looks like it already has 
CAISO energy in it. Let me know if it was a different deal number that had a

I think this is an issue with Diana's deal entry, because I just asked Sean 
Crandall and he said you can go ahead and confirm all of these deals. I've 
changed the confirm status, and I'll look into it more later this afternoon 
when the traders are less busy. Also, did you mean to write 549903 twice, or 
is there another deal number?

Thanks,
Kate

   
	
	

We came across some deals on the not to be confirmed report that look like 
they should be confirmed.  Can you check and see why these came up not to be 
confirmed.  We thought we had fixed the system so that the daily deals in the 
west would default to be confirmed so I need to know if this was a conscious 
decision or something the comuter is defaulting to.  Am I making sense?  Call 
me if you need to interpret this message!

Hi Kate!
I just want to make sure that this is the correct counterparty name.  Usually 
we trade with El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P.  Is this name entered correctly?

Another trivial counterparty name change - it's Enmax Energy Corp., not just 
plain old Enmax Corp. These deals have been changed.

Thanks,

has prepared a credit work sheet on this CP so I believe this is the correct 
entity.  Can you check?

whadup! i'm so happy for you re: the love thing. love is sooooo in the air 
lately. molly just fell head over heels for some cowboy dude evan introduced 
her to. they've been attached at the hips, literally, for the last three 
weeks. and amber spends about four quality hours a day on the phone with 
marky, then cries when she has to hang up. seriously. but your romance sounds 
much more interesting - you absolutely have to keep me posted on how it 
unfolds. and what's the guy's name anyway? you know what's weird is that last 
night after my haircut i met up with molly and her man for dinner. we decided 
to check out the brazen bean, this little swanky cigar bar across the street 
from the blue moon on 21st. (we heard they had a martini happy hour, and we 
felt like pretending we were sophisticated.) so we're walking into the place 
when molly suddenly remembers that she knows the people who live upstairs 
(it's in one of those old rambling victorian houses) so she runs upstairs to 
say hi and then comes back down with them. it turns out to be blake and jill, 
this really sweet couple i've met before, friends of friends, you know how it 
goes. anyway, we all end up staying longer than we should and having more 
martinis than we planned on, and then blake remembers his friend dave was 
coming over to watch a movie. so he runs upstairs to meet dave and brings him 
back down. well dave happens to be amazingly cute and have amazingly great 
legs (he had just come from the gym and was amazingly good about sitting in 
this dimly lit velvet-couched candle-lit shi-shi joint in shorts and a 
sweatshirt). so dave, molly tells me as she begins to put the hard sell on 
IMMEDIATELY (i've noticed as i get older and stay single that many of my 
friends feel the need to try vehemently to get me coupled), plays the guitar 
amazingly and has an amazing voice. i find out over the course of the evening 
that he also reads A LOT and is interested in irish literature and quantum 
physics. well, who isn't, y'know. he also likes to sail - and this is really 
quite scary - LASER SAILBOATS. yep. i've officially met my father in a 
younger form. barf. anyway, he and blake and i all had a jolly time talking 
about books and parents and that show blind date. it was all very 
intellectual, i assure you. what was weirder still was that every time i said 
something, dave looked at blake and kind of laughed. and every time i was 
like, stop your laughing or i'll beat you senseless, and he was like, no i'm 
just laughing because we were just talking about that the other day or 
because i've done that or because i'm doing that next week. i said i wanted 
to start a book club - apparently he suggested that to blake two days ago. i 
said i lived in italy and wanted to go back - he's going there in two months. 
oh, and then there's our common love of running. okay, i'm rambling, so i'll 
get to the point, which is that in my single and cynical state i didn't think 
much of the poor guy last night, but today i've noticed i'm increasingly 
interested and, i'll admit, maybe even attracted. so as we were leaving i 
kind of waved goodbye and said see ya around, because you always do in an 
incestuous vat such as portland, and went on my merry way with molly and 
josh, which i'm sure they were happy about since they practically tried to 
push me into dave's car and run away. dave got in his car and drove off, then 
all of a sudden appeared in front of us as we were crossing the street to our 
car. he had driven around the block and was now getting out of his car to 
give me his card, which he handed to me under the pretense that we couldn't 
start a book club without each other's contact information. i already knew he 
worked at a running store, whatever that is, but when i turned the card over 
it had his name on it and the word "owner" underneath. do you think that 
means he's the actual owner? or is it one of those places like les schwab 
where they give all the employees stock options and call them "employee 
owners"? i'm going to look into it. now i'm probably making way too much of 
this because he was probably like, yeah i need some more members for my book 
club but i definitely don't want to talk to this drinking, smoking, lump of 
unmolded flesh for any other reason....why would i, the proprietor of a 
running store and owner of such amazing legs, do a thing like date a girl who 
shudders at the thought of exercise and loses weight only when she ups her 
alcohol consumption to the point where she forgets to eat? that would just be 
silly. okay, i've got to go. get back to me with a detailed account of your 
evening such as the one i just sent you.

kate

Anna Symes <annas@cobs.edu> on 03/15/2001 09:47:21 AM
Okay so my date was SO amazing!  This guy is SO cute, SO nice, SO smart,
wore pants that fit over his shoes, wore an amazingly cute outfit in
general, knew a lot about wine, took me to the cutest restaurant, took me
out for cocktails afterwards, was a total gentleman, etc.    Mark my words,
Kate - I WILL MARRY THIS MAN.  I kid you not.  He is the most normal guy I
have come across EVER.  He's trying to get a job in graphic design (so cute)
but he loves wine and has thought about working at a vineyard or owning a
restaurant (so cute).  We've read all the same books.  He definitely has
money somehow but he said he has a lot of student debts so at least he can
see where I'm coming from.  He was just interested enough but kind of aloof
which is the only thing that ever keeps me interested.  Kate, this is so
weird.  Oh and he mentioned having a family twice, like as in working at a
restaurant isn't good for having a family.  HOW CUTE IS THAT?  I am in love.
Just thought I'd let you know . . .

love, anna

Dave Poston and the other IT guys are working on this problem right now. 
Apparently from 3/9 onward EOL has not been pulling the schedule type into 
its deals, so they're ALL going to have problems saving. Isn't that fun? Dave 
told me that the problem will be solved by tomorrow afternoon at the latest, 
and that it will retroactively populate those schedule types into all EOL 
deals so you'll be able to save them. Sorry for the hassle. I'll keep you 
posted if anything else comes up.

Two things: First. What does the art of motorcycle riding have to do with 
lost literature or George Eliot? Second. Elliot is spelled Eliot. But 
otherwise, thoroughly enjoyable e-mail message, if not a tad smug over the 
whole book-finding issue. Where did you find it, anyway? E-bay? Afghanistan? 
You know, in some circles they would consider procurement of that book akin 
to scoring a pound of pure cocaine. Not that yucky not adulterated stuff. I'm 
rambling and should actually go do some work, being that that is the 
technical term for what I'm doing right now. "Working," that is. But I have 
several spreadsheets strategically placed around my computer screens (I have 
two, that's how important I am), to make it appear that I'm VERY, VERY busy. 
And speaking of importance, I'm curious to know if you're the actual "owner" 
of the Portland Running Co., as it states on your card, or if the Portland 
Running Co. is one of those forward-thinking organizations that gives all its 
employees pseudo-ownership in the form of one stock share, or if those are 
just cards you had made to impress people? In any case, I probably owe you 
some retroactive respect for your ingenuity, either for becoming the owner of 
such a shop, or for making people believe you are. Hey, do you know what 
George Eliot's real first name is? If you respond to this e-mail in the next 
twenty minutes, I'll tell you. Otherwise you're on your own. By the way, 
that's a beautifully worded passage you chose. And it rhymes, in case you 
didn't notice that.

"Was never true love loved in vain,
For truest love is highest gain.
No art can make it:  it must spring
Where elements are fostering.
So in heaven's spot and hour
Springs the little native flower,
Downward root and upward eye,
Shapen by the earth and sky."

Prologue to chapter 47, "The Dead Hand"
Middlemarch,  George Elliot, 1871

The Portland West Desk needs two new traders added to EnPower. I believe 
you're the correct person to contact for this, but please let me know if I 
should talk to somebody else. We'd like to have our mid-marketers enter their 
own trades now, and many of them already have the IDs to do that. Two 
marketers - Paul Choi and Greg Wolfe - do not. I know that when I took over 
the Deal Control position here John Forney contacted you to help me acquire a 
trader ID, so I'm hoping you can help me with this task.

Thank you in advance for you help in adding this trader's name to the system:

Add this Power Trader to the EnPower: Paul Choi

Samuel Schott has told me that you would prefer to have the desk this trader 
works for, but because Paul is a mid-marketer he works with several different 
desks, including Long Term California and Long Term Southwest. Please let me 
know if you need more information.

Hello Kate,

In order for Power Traders to gain access to Power Desks, my team, 
GCP_Houston, must link their names to each Desk.
(Basically, we need a list of desks that the Traders need access.)

Please provide the following info:

Example(s): 

Add these Power Trader(s) to the following Desks: Paul Choi, Greg Wolfe

CP/ID 66189 (not required, but helpful)    EPMI Short Term West Hourly
CP/ID 56849  "    EPMI Long Term West Management

Please submit your request(s) to GCP_Houston, (this is my entire team).

It might be worth it to add Long Term California to Greg's trader ID profile

there's always the potential. No rush, of course. And thanks again for your

I suppose my victory in this, our latest but not last competition, would be 
IMPLIED. Rather, I mean that my triumph could be INFERRED or even TACIT. My 
skill is UNDERSTOOD, my speed INSINUATED, and my nimble pairing of the two is 
INTIMATED by the fact that I won this competition.

Now, I'll be sadly disappointed if you don't get this e-mail until later 
today, being that you have such a confusing and multi-layered e-mail 
situation, because I need for you to know that I got the answer first. So for 
the record, it is 8:45 a.m. on Monday. A side note: I also have The Great 
Gatsby in my possession.

I'd be more than happy to run a test of the new forward obligation report in 
order for you to move it to production. I do use the application everyday 
when determining the West desk positions in relation to each other, so it's a 
report I'm familiar with and also one that may affect me if it's changed. 
Please let me know if you'd like me to run the report and under what terms.

Dave, 
Could you possibly help me set a shortcut to test this report today. I 
believe what Kroum is asking is for me to run the STAGE report against 
PRODUCTION data. Does that sound correct? I thought you'd know more. Just 
holler over here whenever you get a chance.

Thanks,
Kate
    Thanks Kate,
  
    We were looking for somebody like you. You can run it with any settings,
   as you run it every day.  Make sure you see version 3.0.0.30.
    

    I think however it is better if you can run  the report against 
production data
    because the test data are not good enough. I think David Poston created
    a shortcut on Cara's and Valarie's computers, you can talk to him to do it
    for you as well.

     The command from the command prompt should be:
      C:\Enpower\stage > FwdObl user_id user_password  pwrprodn_ded
    (ask the IT people if this doesn't mean anything to you, I can phone
       David as well you want me to)

You are clearly the quintessential malapropist. I won't even try to compete 
in that category. Especially not at the end of a long day. Of staring. At 
this computer screen. And studying tiny little. Numbers. This is the source 
of my insanity. This is no question of my money or my life. It's neither. I 
think it's time to partake in some of the mind-numbing activities that office 
workers regularly use to gain the strenth to face another day (running), or 
forget that another day is coming (drinking). I've got at least half an hour 
to decide.....

Hi Kate!
I am beginning to see a familiar pattern beginning in the West (-familiar 
because it's the same problem we have with East traders).  There are A LOT of 
deals that need to be changed to "no confirm."  I'd like to fax a list of 
them to you so that you can 1st, change their status in Deal Entry to "not to 
be confirmed" and 2nd, bug the traders who enter the deals to remember to 
enter them correctly.  Also, you mentioned working with Will Smith in IT to 
get these deals to automatically be "no confirm" when the traders enter 
them.  You may want to use some of these as examples so to help IT figure the 
logic behind which deals are confirmed and which aren't.  Please let me know 
your fax number so that i can send you this report.  
Thanks!

Also, can you let the schedulers know about the name change of this deal.

All deals are o.k.

All deals are o.k.

These deals were entered as flowing all days, and should have just been Mon - 
Sat. This was my fault, as I didn't know my computer defaulted to all days. 
(This has since been fixed!) I've changed them in the system and was told to 
let you know so you can re-confirm the deals with just on-peak days. Sorry 
about the hassle. I promise I'll get the hang of this soon!

Thanks,
Kate

sorry - we changed the year and just changed each strip - but since it was 
originally entered in deal blotter it had those extra strips and, long story 
short, it should be right now.

thanks
Kate

   
	
	

I believe this deal was changed, bu tnot changed correctly.  The hours are 
doubled up and it is running 32 hours a day.

i'm having deal blotter and deal entry problems - please bear with me while i 
try to change this, but it might be a minute.

I've changed the deal - we're running into some problems rolling out the new 
Full Service Power application. Apparently it's messed with some details of 
Deal Entry, including the deletion of strips. So you'll see three strips in 
this deal, two of which have no price and no volume. I hope that's okay! Will 
Smith in Houston IT is working on it now. Let me know if you see the right 
term and volume now.

Thanks,

Will - 

I've passed your phone number along to Bill Williams, the Real Time group 
manager here in Portland. He should be contacting you shortly to discuss 
problems with and changes to the Scheduling Activity Report. I've checked 
with other groups on the floor and found that the report is only used by Real 
Time, and less frequently by groups assisting Real Time, so I believe Bill or 
someone in his group could most suitably test the new application. Let me 
know if there's anything else I can do, and thanks for all your help today.

Kate

Cheers?

   

Kate,
Thanks for the email.  I spoke with Will Smith immediately after our 
discussion.  I do appreciate you following up.
Cheers,
B

I feel your job-hunting pain, but I am so glad you sent a resume to Amy. And 
as for having to WORK at WORK? Not if they just let you go! If they ask what 
you're doing say, "I'm surfing the internet for a NEW JOB YOU SON OF A 
BISCUIT." And as for this weekend, most definitely. On Saturday I'm going to 
see some art and have drinks at the Medicine Hat gallery on Alberta. You 
should join me in my quest for culture - of course that'll last until just 
after I finish the first bottle of wine. Who's playing on Friday? I'll pencil 
it in. And I'll keep you posted on what I hear from Amy - in the meantime, 
hang in there. It all works out in the end. (there's your cheesy piece of 
advice for the day)

Kate

I e-mailed Amy my resume.
Looking for a job blows.  I am starting to feel the
anxiety of not having one soon.  Oh well, that's
life.  I can't do much from work because I have to
actually work.  Dumb.
Well hope to see you all soon.  Maybe this weekend
if you and Molly aren't busy.  There is a kick ass concert
at Berbati's on Friday night.  Yay!

Thanks again for the contact.

Jill

Don't get defensive. I was just worried you had picked up another silly 
affectation.

   

Yeah,
Like "Thank you for the good work, I will buy you a drink sometime out of 
appreciation, cheers..."
B

Thanks a lot, Kim! 

yes....yes it does.

   

Another?  That implies ownership of some already...

DaveHarkin@aol.com on 03/20/2001 04:52:51 PM
Kate-
    I'm going for a run..uh, walk in the park to unwind from another busy
day.  Did I already RE???  I think I was in process when I was abruptly
booted off my system.  I rarely read too deeply into the metaphysics of
internet territoriality, but let's just say I was a bit freaked out.
    In other news, I was invited, as a resident shoe expert, to come fix the
feet of a certain director on a certain Paramount movie set in town...and do
I feel important??  I'll keep you updated as to whether this particular 15
minutes of fame is actually THE one, or just a facade to a deeper and more
rewarding 15 minutes somewhere down the road.
    On Gatsby - don't have it yet and implicit in this status is my inability
to compete with one so driven to ultimate domination in the category of
intellectual enormity...I am the microscopic parasite to a four-limbed,
crafty predator that disguises itself, like a siren, as a mere passenger on
the food train.
    Miss you in a sort of in-town way. Perhaps we should get together and do
this in person soon?  I am worried about your little heart, my "playuh"
positioning, and wasting the short two month window that is inevitably the
range of my welcome.
    In the "get-on-with-it"  realm, I'm out.  Call me.  Home is 224-7243 and
cell is 890-6370 in case you've misplaced the card...or something.  Any
malapropisticism was incidental this time around.

Dave

Good morning -

Just wanted to let you know that I've been running the stage version of the 
Forward Obligation report using production data, and I seem to be getting all 
the same numbers as I do with the production version of the report. I will 
continue to compare the two today when I run these reports, just to make 
sure. But in the meantime, all looks well. Thanks for your help.

    Thanks Kate,
  
    We were looking for somebody like you. You can run it with any settings,
   as you run it every day.  Make sure you see version 3.0.0.30.
    

    I think however it is better if you can run  the report against 
production data
    because the test data are not good enough. I think David Poston created
    a shortcut on Cara's and Valarie's computers, you can talk to him to do it
    for you as well.

     The command from the command prompt should be:
      C:\Enpower\stage > FwdObl user_id user_password  pwrprodn_ded
    (ask the IT people if this doesn't mean anything to you, I can phone
       David as well you want me to)

     Thanks,
     Kroum
     713-853-9980
    

I'd be more than happy to run a test of the new forward obligation report in 
order for you to move it to production. I do use the application everyday 
when determining the West desk positions in relation to each other, so it's a 
report I'm familiar with and also one that may affect me if it's changed. 
Please let me know if you'd like me to run the report and under what terms.

Thanks,

Mark - I believe our Real Time group is sending your group a spreadsheet 
outlining all of the trades they do on behalf of EES each day. The first two 
deals - 544537 and 544544 - should be included in that sheet. The only deals 
recorded in the sheet I send are fixed price (and sometimes Dow Jones 
index-forward) day-ahead trades done by the EPMI Short Term California desk.

The third deal - 553219 - is in EnPower at the correct price of $133.23. The 
worksheet price was not updated from the day before, but it's been corrected.

The fourth deal - 553219 - again is a Real Time deal. It looks like it was 
entered on 3/19 for 3/19 HE 1. It's a deal for 25 MW, not 150 MW, at $175.00. 
I'm not quite sure why EES thinks this deal should be in for HE 1-6 on 3/16. 
If you have any more information, please send that along to Bill Williams III 
and me.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have anymore questions.

Thanks,
Kate

2) 3-11-01 Sell 544544.1 not on your schedule (Kate this one may not be part 
of the schedule)  What all goes on it?

3) 3-15-01 Sell 550208.1 Price $133.23, Per EES the schedule is at $113.07

4) 3-19-01 Buy 553219.1 0-6 150 mwh @ $175.00 ST-Hourly, EES has this as a 
real time deal on 3-16 @ $125

Jeff has both sides of both deals in the system correctly. Here are the deal 
numbers.

And Deal #461139 was actually a Short Term Southwest deal done by Tom Alonso 
with Williams for the same price on the same days, but with Prebon. 
Confusion! 

Hope this fixes it.

Melissa - I just wanted to let you know that I can definitely get this list

Melissa,

We have received a request from/for Louise Kitchen and accounting for a deal 
count breakout for the following areas. Can you provide a list of traders 
that would coinside with the following areas:

EAST POWER
 Southeast (ex: Smith/Sukakly)
 Midwest (Hemdon/Pagan)
 Northeast (Sturm/Baughman)
 Management Book (Presto)
 New Albany (Presto)
 Development (Jacoby)
 Structuring (Aucoin)
 Fundamentals (Will)

WEST POWER
 Origination (Calger)
 QF (Calger)
 Development (Parquet)
 Trading (Belden)
 Middle Market/Services (Foster/Wolfe)
 Fundamentals (Heisenreiker)

If you can let us know which(ALL) traders are associated with these areas, 
then we should be able to create this report for EOL numbers. We appreciate 
any assistance you can provide. 

Thanks,

Greetings from the land of watery-eyed, flat-assed office workers! How goes 
the burly mountain man thing? I've been hearing second hand from Elliot that 
you're faring extremely well mentally despite some poorly crafted sleeping 
bags and a bad case of frostbite on your toes. (That second part I made up, 
but it sounded appropriate given the sleeping bag situation.) All's well 
here. As you could imagine, and probably often do, the sweeping expanse of 
people staring at computers that is Enron has changed not at all since you 
left. There are still many computers, many of them have changed positions, 
some have gone away, most we are not sad to see go. That's just the nature of 
this cutthroat business. Also on the stagnantly invariable list is the status 
of my life in relation to Enron. I am still here. I still stare at the 
computer. Every once in awhile I meander over to the dark window-less corner 
that enshrouds the IT wizards and ask them silly questions like, "What does 
it mean when I hit this button and my screen starts flashing at me like a 
disco ball, then makes this awkward shrieking noise and finally goes black?" 
They are incredibly helpful. I am still pretty much clueless about most 
things, although I've learned to talk about them with a semblance of 
authority, as in, "No, you twit, the 25 megawatt off peak deal should clearly 
be flowing across SP-15 to NP-15 because of the illiquidity of SP's market 
right now. What kind of idiot wouldn't hedge their position in California at 
a time like this?" It all sounds very exotic and important to me, which is 
why I'm still here. But I'm infinitely jealous of your wild exploits in the 
great American outdoors. I suspect my forbearance for sitting in an office 
will run out right around the middle of the summer, so I'm planning a trip to 
coincide with that meltdown. I haven't decided between a road trip through 
the western United States or just a direct flight to Paris. Both sound good, 
and way beyond my budget, therefore equally attractive. Well, I've managed to 
say practically nothing for long enough now. I do hope you're having an 
amazing time, rambling on toward the next crazy adventure on the horizon as I 
believe Jack Kerouac once wrote. We're all very proud of you here and 
constantly refer to you as "my good friend Winston who's skiing across the 
state of Wyoming, which was my idea." I'd love to hear about your trip direct 
from the source, although I know you're extremely busy out there, skiing and 
killing wild animals for sustenance and whatnot. But please do write 
back....if you can still move your fingers.

Sincerely,
Kate
(the slightly ditsy one who sits in the middle of the room and tries to look 
constantly busy)

It's changed to APS. I'm wondering about the status of APS and Pinnacle - I 
guess the traders here had heard we were now doing our trades with Pinnacle, 
not APS. Is this incorrect? Do you know who might know about that?

I called Seattle City Light to verbally confirm this deal and they said that 
it should be Off Peak.  I spoke with Matt Motley who agreed.  Can you change 
this deal to Off-Peak hours?  If you want to check with Matt, that's fine.  
We're not supposed to make any changes to West deals otherwise I'd do it 
myself.
Thanks!

Well, to tell you the truth, it sucks right now. Work has been snowballing 
with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems, so many that I've basically 
forgotten what they all are now. And on top of that, runner guy stopped by 
last night and it happened to be the last day of Amber's finals so she and 
Molly had been drinking since 2 p.m. Well, I'm not quite sure if that scared 
him away, but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight - he asked me, I 
accepted, we had a time picked out - now I NEVER make plans as a rule, but 
this was a goddamn plan. So he calls 15 minutes ago and actually CANCELS. Not 
even just that, he doesn't give a REASON. I am so livid right now there's 
smoke coming out of my ears. I need to go finish work so I can get out of 
here and go bomb his car. I'll call you tonight.

hey poopstain,

What's up?  I am sooooo good.  Dad and my car will be here on Monday, isn't
that great?  I just want to drive for the rest of my life!  So I get three
days off next week, plus I'm leaving for my outward bound course next
friday.  So basically I have like a week vacation!  Things are still going
with the cute waiter (Nathan), but I've discovered a flaw.  It was only a
matter of time, you know.  Actually, it's a non-fatal flaw, it's annoying at
worst.  Basically, he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and
talks on it in all types of situations, such as the video store, a taxi cab,
and while eating dinner with his friends.  I just can't stand those things.
It's one thing to chat on it when you're walking down the street by yourself
or in your car by yourself, but when you're with other people or in the
checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you, I
just think it's so rude.  But I'm going to try to get over it, because
otherwise he's great, and I seem to be the only person on God's green earth
who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze.  So that's my life,
what's going on in yours?

love, anna

I just left you a voice-mail, but thought I'd follow up with a text message 
as well. I can send you lists of all the people who work in each of these 
groups, but not all of them use Enron Online. To make this information as 
efficient as possible, I want to be sure of what you're looking for before I 
send you a huge list of names and make it more confusing than it needs to be. 
The other thing I just thought of is that I run an EOL deal count report 
every night which includes the West Desk's EOL and brokered deal counts for 
the day, month-to-date, and sometimes year-to-date. So I may already have 
this information or may be able to get it very easily. For now, I'll send you 
the list of our traders who use EOL. And please let me know what else I can 
do to assist.

Hi Kate,  Can you help me determine which traders in Portland are associated 
with each area list below under West Power?  The EOL team needs to run some 
number by trader for Louise Kitchen.

Thanks,
Melissa

	
	                           
	

Melissa,

We have received a request from/for Louise Kitchen and accounting for a deal 
count breakout for the following areas. Can you provide a list of traders 
that would coinside with the following areas:

EAST POWER
 Southeast (ex: Smith/Sukakly)
 Midwest (Hemdon/Pagan)
 Northeast (Sturm/Baughman)
 Management Book (Presto)
 New Albany (Presto)
 Development (Jacoby)
 Structuring (Aucoin)
 Fundamentals (Will)

WEST POWER
 Origination (Calger)
 QF (Calger)
 Development (Parquet)
 Trading (Belden)
 Middle Market/Services (Foster/Wolfe)
 Fundamentals (Heisenreiker)

If you can let us know which(ALL) traders are associated with these areas, 
then we should be able to create this report for EOL numbers. We appreciate 
any assistance you can provide. 

Thanks,

Matt Motsinger

After the day's confusion has settled down, I can't quite remember if you're 
the one who called me on this deal. It's a short term west hourly deal and 
there was some indication it should be with PPL Montana and not Montana 
Power. Bill Williams, real time manager, told me they trade with Montana 
Power all the time, so this trade should be good. I've changed the deal to no 
confirm, and we're working with IT to get the deal entry settings to default 
to no confirm for all real time deals (so hopefully this won't happen again). 
Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Kate

Happy reading!

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state. 

These have been approved and auto-scheduled.

Details in exchange for this - 

I read an article this morning that quoted an ISO market analyst speaking 
about the $6.2 billion the system operator would like to recover in charges 
since last spring: "We are not saying now that these are overcharges. We are 
telling the FERC that we see these as the amounts that we deem 'excessive.'" 
The lead of the story was this: "The California Independent System 
Operator......significantly upped the ante Thursday when it told the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission that 21 generators and suppliers should refund 
the state a stunning $6.2 billion for electricity sold into the state since 
last May." 

First of all, tell me what the difference is between "overcharges" and 
"excessive" charges. If there isn't one, give me your opinion on why this 
analyst would say such a stupid thing. Second, give me one reason why the 
lead is journalistically incorrect, and one why it is gramatically 
unattractive. 

Then you get details.

Kate

I'm sorry, but I can't give you full credit on your answer to the second part 
of my question. The correct answer was the author's use of the word 
"stunning" to describe the $6.2 billion figure. The word is clearly an 
editorialization on the amount of the refund requested, and is therefore 
journalistically incorrect.  In addition, you failed to extemporize on why a 
journalist for an energy trade magazine would leave such gaping holes in 
his/her story. 

But because I'm feeling lenient this morning, I'll give you the details.

There was no date.

Kate

Wow - what a nice Friday morning surprise to hear from my old friend Bobby. 
We must go back, what, at least half a year? Hey, it's no fun around our 
house with you being a stranger and all. We're having people over for a 
barbeque tonight - come by! Call me at work - 464-7486 - or catch someone at 
home later - 288-6546. We have to celebrate the beginning of spring, and 
you're not exempt. Have a super day at work. Talk to you later?

Kate

still enjoying living together.  Let me know what you gals are up to...

Hey! I'm so brain dead this morning I didn't even notice. But I'm sooooo glad 
you had a good experience. I just think he's the nicest guy, so I bombard him 
with people needing haircuts constantly. You know when I first went to him it 
was because I couldn't get in to see my regular lady and he was the only 
stylist who wasn't booked - now he never has a spare second! It makes me feel 
like a proud mother. Thanks for letting me know.

: )  Em

550206 - price is in correctly at $187.27 because this deal is a sale from 
EPMI to EES
 (550205 is the deal where EPMI buys from EES - price is therefore $5 less 
than weighted average, making it $177.27)

552990 - price is in at $195 off peak and $295 on peak, which are the prices 
reflected in my worksheet 
 Brooklyn may be looking at a price for a real time deal. If the desk is 
Short Term West Hourly, that means the deal was done in the    hour-ahead, 
not day-ahead market, and the price will be different. Bill Williams at the 
real time desk should be sending out a spreadsheet   outlining the deals 
they've done on EES's behalf. 

Please let me know if this answers your questions. Or call and we can discuss 
it person to person.

You rock, Angela! Don't worry, I'll be my usual quiet and unassuming self 
when I come by for lunch. Although, if you guys are having hotdogs, doesn't 
that mean that everyone pre-ordered? That would leave me "sans hotdog," which 
would be tragic. Let me know.

That's hilarious! My theme song for life is "Don't go breaking my heart" by 
Elton John and Kiki Dee, which incidentally has always been one of my 
favorites. I remember first hearing it on a Disney special where Elton did a 
duet with Minnie Mouse. What a kick! Thanks.

That's weird, because nothing traded for nearly that low for April today.

559066----I just checked with Prebon and for some reason they show price as

559091----Is a good deal with Bloomberg.

Therefore, the only deal in question now is 559066 and Prebon shows $258 as

I have made the following adjustment to our EPMI sales to EES on 3/1 at SP-15.

534313 - existing fixed price forward sale - volumes have been reduced by 18 
mw per hour

559314 - new index sale added and backdated (2/28)  to reflect 18 mw off peak 
hours
559316 - new index sale added and backdate (2/28) to reflect 18 mw on peak 
hours

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this change. At the 
end of last month Short Term California handed responsibility of Dow Jones 
index sales over to the Short Term West Services desk; unfortunately the 
exact date of change-over was miscommunicated, and the index sale was not 
entered for 3/1. However, the total MWh of EPMI's sale to EES should not 
change for 3/1. Also, you should see the new volumes reflected in the EES 
daily volumes worksheet which I will send later this afternoon.

Bitch ... bitch ... bitch

Hi Kate,

Thanks for the email.  Sorry it's taken me a while to respond but it's chaos
here as we prepare to head off for the next part of our trip today.  Glad to
hear the glow of the screen still has you enthralled.  Keep hitting F9 and
all will be well.  The bit when the screen flashes like a disco ball means
your pay is being cut.  I hope all those hideous applications I built that
you were using haven't blown sky high.  But you know I did put little bugs
in all of those things so that they would stop working about 4 months after
I left.  Sorry!  I neede to ensure there would be work for me to do when/if
I come back.

Your plans for a summer escape sound fun.  But what you should really do is
come out to Jackson with Elliot at the beginning of May.  We're planning a
debauched weekend here right after we finish a section of the trip.  Should
be fun.  Just the thing for relieving stress from staring at the screen.  By
the way, have you seen the movie Office Space?  I'd recommend it.

Please check that Elliot is actually working from time to time.  He does
this routine where he'll have a bunch of things up on his screen, but his
eyes are actually closed.  Whenever you see that, just throw something at
him.  Of call his phone and says it's Jeff Skilling.

Hope all is well in sunny Portland.  Keep me posted on any unseemly office
gossip.

Talk to you soon.

Winston

I am particularly worried about how these are corrected because they are long 
term transmission deals that cannot be autoscheduled.

Anna - You're stoked on the song thing. You'll never guess how cool mine is 
though. It's "Don't go breakin' my heart" by Elton John and Kiki Dee! 
Remember the song he sang with Minnie Mouse on that Disney video we used to 
watch all the time? I LOVE that song. Anyway, I had already started a reply 
to your previous e-mail, so I'll just send it along with this one.....

I love you madly and dearly! You're the only one who's managed to say 
anything of worth about this whole incidence. Amber and Molly stared at me 
blankly and said something like, "Don't be so overly dramatic," and then 
rationalized the whole thing saying he was probably tired and needed to hang 
out with his friend who just broke up with his long term girlfriend and blah 
blah blah. It was really disappointing that they didn't understand the 
importance of NEVER being rational when it comes to men. It was so not fun. 
But I was really proud of myself, because I left work fuming, on the verge of 
tears, and by the time I got home I was smiling and joking with Amber and 
Molly about how schnockered they had been the night before. Then Molly and I 
took a big long walk and got awesome Thai food, brought it home, and watched 
the Thursday night line-up. All in all, it was a very successful evening 
WITHOUT runner man, whose name by the way is Dave. (Take one point off for 
that.) And guess what? He ended up calling at about 8:30. Molly was on the 
other line and neglected to answer the call or tell me there might be a 
message, so awhile later when I got a call from Jill, Dave's friend's 
girlfriend who I'm also friends with (this all gets very complicated), I was 
very confused that she asked me to go out for a beer with "us." I just 
assumed she was with her boyfriend and Dave, and made up some sweet excuse 
about how I had just eaten and was too full to move, because I was like, no 
way is that guy going to have his lackeys call me and expect me to show up. 
NO WAY! So that was that....or so I thought. At about 10 p.m., runner man 
himself calls, and basically admits that he's psycho for cancelling our date 
and then calling me all night long. Ya think?! Anyway, he tells me he was in 
this enormously bad mood after work and had to sweat it out on a bike ride 
and didn't want me to see him in such a bad state. I still thought it was a 
lame excuse and that once you'd reached the ripe age of 31 you should be 
smart enough to just say something instead of lamely ditch someone. So I told 
him that, and he said he agreed and could he please come over and make me and 
my roommates dinner and finish mowing our lawn (which he had started the 
other night when he was over) to make it up to me. I told him if he did that 
he might bring his balance back to zero instead of being in the read which is 
where he is now. (that's finance lingo) Anyway, the plan is he's going to 
come over and help me make salads and bread and drinks for like 20 people who 
we somewhere along the way invited to our house tonight, although I don't 
remember doing that. Anna, you have to stay with me one night when you're 
home in June because it's a constant riot. I won't go into some of the things 
Amber did the other night right now, but I'll tell you soon so you can swap 
stories when you see her. By the way, she snagged an armload of my clothes, 
actually most of which were yours, to wear at fancy dinners in Denver, so if 
you see anything you want back, just let her know. I think it's just that red 
Laundry shirt and the REALLY short black bcbg skirt. Hey guess what - I have 
to go. I'll call you tonight!

Take care, 
kate

Anna Symes <annas@cobs.edu> on 03/23/2001 08:06:18 AM
That sucks, Kate.  I bet that isn't the last we'll be seeing of Mr. Running
Man, though.  First of all, who gets scared off by drunk roommates?  If
anything it should be a relief to him that he doesn't need to impress any of
your clan.  Second, it sounds like the classic insecure blow-off to me.  If
you think back, you'll probably remember a couple of instances in which your
demeanor/comments/facial expression may have sent him the message that he is
the stupidest thing on God's green earth.  I know this because I have the
same habit.  So he probably went home, mulled over those few devastating
instances, and came to the conclusion that you're not that into it.  And
being a man (only men and Symes's do this), he cancelled on you before you
had the chance to crush his ego once again.  Am I right?  I think so.

Tentatively planning on going out with Amber and Monica on Saturday night.
I'm mad that I'm hanging out with your roommate before I get to hang out
with you!  Monica and I are thinking of splitting your ticket, since we know
you'll never save the money (like I should talk).  You have to come out
here, though.  It's about 67 degrees right now and it's 9:00 in the morning
on a day in March.  I can't believe how happy this sun makes me!  You would
love it, too.

Okay, feel better, and don't sweat the stupid running guy.  If he thinks
he's not worthy of you, chances are he's not.  A stiff margarita will make
this whole problem a lot more manageable, don't you think?  You should go
have one.  Love you!

Luego,
Anna

Well, to tell you the truth, it sucks right now. Work has been snowballing
with all kinds of unimaginable computer problems, so many that I've
basically forgotten what they all are now. And on top of that, runner guy
stopped by last night and it happened to be the last day of Amber's finals
so she and Molly had been drinking since 2 p.m. Well, I'm not quite sure if
that scared him away, but we were supposed to go to a movie tonight - he
asked me, I accepted, we had a time picked out - now I NEVER make plans as
a rule, but this was a goddamn plan. So he calls 15 minutes ago and
actually CANCELS. Not even just that, he doesn't give a REASON. I am so
livid right now there's smoke coming out of my ears. I need to go finish
work so I can get out of here and go bomb his car. I'll call you tonight.

Kate

Anna Symes <annas@cobs.edu> on 03/22/2001 04:03:33 PM

hey poopstain,

What's up?  I am sooooo good.  Dad and my car will be here on Monday, isn't
that great?  I just want to drive for the rest of my life!  So I get three
days off next week, plus I'm leaving for my outward bound course next
friday.  So basically I have like a week vacation!  Things are still going
with the cute waiter (Nathan), but I've discovered a flaw.  It was only a
matter of time, you know.  Actually, it's a non-fatal flaw, it's annoying
at
worst.  Basically, he carries his cell phone everywhere and answers and
talks on it in all types of situations, such as the video store, a taxi
cab,
and while eating dinner with his friends.  I just can't stand those things.
It's one thing to chat on it when you're walking down the street by
yourself
or in your car by yourself, but when you're with other people or in the
checkout line at the video store and there are people waiting for you, I
just think it's so rude.  But I'm going to try to get over it, because
otherwise he's great, and I seem to be the only person on God's green earth
who has not caught onto the whole cell phone craze.  So that's my life,
what's going on in yours?

love, anna

Hi Kate!
This deal needs to be changed to CAISO energy.  Also, I will be faxing the 
list of West Daily Deals that need to be changed to "no confirm".
Thanks for your help!
Kim

Here's the latest I've heard from Diana regarding the deals with a PGE 
delivery point. The four you e-mailed me this morning are all daily deals 
with PGE and therefore do not need to be confirmed, so they are entered 
correctly. I believe Kim Hundl and I discussed this before; but let me know 
if you have further questions.

Thanks,

Diana Scholtes
03/09/2001 12:24 PM
I just heard the same.  I was talking to Tim about the requirements being 
made regarding daily confirmations, and the final decision was not to confirm 
PGE daily deals.  Question though,  when we put deals into the system in 
Blotter, they automatically confirm.  Do we have to go into every deal and 
switch the flag or is there a better way around it?

d

I just got your fax - thank you! I'll start changing over those deals right 
now, so it shouldn't be long. I'll send you another e-mail when they're all

I'm so glad to hear it! Cara suspected it was an EOL bug that had since been 
fixed. Thanks for clarifying this.

Kate

Hello Cara,

We have determined that the EOL Bridge in production is currently working and 
handling time zone issue very well.
Back in June 2000, there is a bug, which related to time zone issue and we 
fixed it since then. All deals that you
provided to us had entered before July 2000.

We will run a query to identify if there are any other deals, which have 
similar problem with time zone.

Please let me know if you find more problems with EOL Bridge, we will fix it 
immediately.

Your help is highly appreciated

Regards,
dluu

I ran across a bunch of EOL deals that have not represented the April Time 
zones right. They marked through April 6th as PST. Daylight savings time is 
on April 1.  I don't see any new deals so I am hoping that it was something 
in the programming that was corrected.  Steve, we will let you know if we see 
any new ones, but the latest one looks like it was done a while ago. All of 
these deals are fixed.

they should be PDT. 
 
Do you want to change all of these to PPT deals, or do you have time 
constraints today?  I need these changed today because we are already setting 
up for April.

The attached document contains the EPMI average prices for all delivery 
points for Sun., March 25, and Mon., March 26. Please let me know if you have 
any problems opening the document or reading it. The worksheet should look 
identical to the fax I send each day. An additional worksheet shows a detail 
of each deal volume and price. I'm in the habit of excluding the counterparty 
names (to save time) because I'm the only one who looks at this sheet 
normally; but if you'd like me to start e-mailing instead of faxing the 
prices I will begin entering the counterparty names as well.

We don't have any regular on or off-peak deals for Sunday. In regard to 
sending index prices via e-mail, I think it will be a lot more efficient for 
everyone involved to do it this way. I only feel badly I didn't think of it 
before! I will begin e-mailing each morning starting tomorrow, and it's no 
problem for me to add counterparty's names to the spreadsheet - I just have 
to get in the habit of doing it.

Thanks again,

djenergy <djenergy@dowjones.com> on 03/26/2001 10:52:30 AM
 Hello Kate, thank your so much for everything.  Me and Jennifer both
like email better than fax.  Therefore, you can start emailing to us from
now on.  About counter-party, we prefer to be on the report but if it takes
too much of your time then it is up to you to include it or not.  We need
conter-party's name when we confirm any kind of mismatch problem.  If you
include on the report, it save you from us calling you.  Otherwise, we have
to call you and ask for counter-party's name when we need to confirm any
transactions.  It is your call.
 Again, thank you and feel free to call me if you have any further
questions/concerns.

I'm unclear as to what Will found in these deals that needs to be looked at. 
The first one (scary!!) has notes in the comments section of each leg that 
say it was terminated on 9/30/98; however, there are still forward deal legs 
that haven't been killed or zeroed out. I don't think I could consider myself 
a deal control professional on this one - I'll need to talk to a trader. But 
let me know what you want me to look for in the remaining deals. Is this part 
of the time zone glitch?

Do you want to look into these, the first one made me nearly wet my pants!  I

I think that sounds like a great idea. It doesn't really serve a purpose to 
have all the time zones as a choice in Deal Blotter if EnPower is going to 
sort them out anyway. We're just doubling up on the work that the application 
already knows how to do. In the meantime, I'll sort through these deal 
numbers and change time zones that flow over the first week in April. Let me 
know if that sounds good.

Kate

Cara Semperger
03/26/2001 11:01 AM
Yep, the time zone glitch.  I think he was looking at all deals in the 
system.  I almost think we should deal with this April, and worry about the 
rest when it comes up.   Will and I are also kicking around making the only 
choice in deal entry PPT.  Let Enpower sort out the rest.  We can modify 
stuff on the strip level, but PPT would be the only choice in blotter and at 
the top of regular deal entry.

How does that sound?

Just wanted to give you an update on my progress so far - I'm changing these 
deals in between each of my other daily tasks, and I'm also having a hard 
time reading some of the deal numbers. I've made it through the first page 
and a bit of the second. I've changed all but four of the deals to "no 
confirm." Here are the questions I have on those deals:

1. 552516 - why are we not confirming a City of Riverside deal? Should I ask 
Jeff?

2. 553037 - looks like it's already "no confirm"

3. 553666/667/668 - are we not confirming any deals where PGE is the 
counterparty? I thought it was just where PGE System was the delivery point?

4. 553926 - this deal is killed. Do we have to change settings on killed 
deals as well?

Also, if you have a slightly bigger copy of the document you faxed over, or 
if you could e-mail it to me, that would save me a lot of guessing time. 
Thanks for your help!

These deals were entered today under STWH desk - Geir and Mark show as the 
traders on them, but I have a feeling that's incorrect as I haven't seem them 
around this morning. Might let the guys know that when they trade at 
California delivery points - NP15, SP15, ZP26 - the energy firmness should be 
specified as CAISO firm.

Sharen Cason in the Confirms group will be expecting your phone call. Her 
number is 703-853-3001.

I talked to her about the difference in energy types, to satisfy my own 
curiosity, and she explained that the CAISO modifier acts as a flag to her 
group that the deal was done in California and therefore should have an NP15, 
SP15, or ZP26 delivery point. If the energy type is CAISO, they need to 
include different language in their confirmation letter to the counterparty. 
While CAISO is still essentially firm energy, it has different stipulations, 
she said. 

I didn't go into detail with her, because the bottom line is that none of our 
real time deals should reach the confirms desk anyway. I'm working with IT in 
Houston and here to have West Hourly deals default to "no confirm," but until 
that gets done your best defense from the constant, nagging onslaught of 
petty deal entry error messages is to have your group check and double-check 
that they've marked their deals "NO" under the Confirmation heading. More 
information than you ever wanted on this subject? I thought so.

the broker has 23,775 as total mws, and also has a fee of .0075.

I just spoke with Holli Krebs about Grant County this afternoon. She said the 
confirms had already been signed by Tim Belden and gone through one of our 
lawyers, Jan King. Jan told Holli that she had sent the signed confirms down 
to someone in Houston - Holli thought it was you. Apparently Holli got a 
message from both you and me last week while at a WSPP conference, and called 
Jan to tell her to send the confirms out - so Jan sent them AGAIN. So if you 
still haven't seen those confirms come across your desk, then either someone 
else is receiving them or they're going to the wrong fax number. I've left a 
note for Jan King and hopefully we'll talk in the morning so I can find out 
more specifically where she's been sending the confirm letters. Sorry for all 
this confusion. We'll talk tomorrow.

Kim - 
I've finished changing the list of deals you faxed over to no confirm. Please 
let me know if you continue to see these deals on your new deal report. I 
still had questions on some of the Short Term and Long Term Northwest deals. 
On those I will defer to Diana Scholtes. I also have questions on the 
following deals:

557772 - why are we not confirming a daily with Pacificorp?
552516 - why are we not confirming a daily with Riverside?

And there were two deals I couldn't for the life of me read on that fax, so 
you may still see deals showing up that don't necessarily need to be 
confirmed.

Diana - 
I know we had decided not to confirm deals done with Portland General 
Electric, but before I change the following deals to "no confirm" I want to 
clarify under what conditions we do not confirm with this counterparty.
 1. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is elsewhere (Mid-C, 
Montana System, etc.), do we confirm?
 2. If the counterparty is something other than PGE and the delivery point is 
Portland General System, do we confirm?
 3. If the counterparty is PGE and the delivery point is Portland General 
System, do we confirm? 
I apologize for asking so many questions, but I've got a long list of deals 
in front of me and before I create an irreparable mess I wanted to check that 
I'm doing this right. Please let me know.

I've changed it to off-peak only. I was entering forward deals to exercise 
options yesterday, and they were all RTC besides this one - thanks for 
catching that. It should be good now.

Kate, just happened to notice when they entered the leg 2 of the deal 
428861.01.... is it suppose to be 7days a week, 24 hours a day,  the 
428861.01 is off peak hours only.

Thanks

I am so sorry I slacked on this - I guess I didn't see you around the office 
and it just got bumped off the mental "list of things to do." Don't worry - 
I've transfered it to a hard copy list now. Enjoy!

We just found that the other two options we entered yesterday were NOT, in 
fact, round-the-clock deals. We've changed 547682.2 to on peak hours only, 
and 426659.2 to off peak hours only. All three deals will be included on our

Please do not reply to this message as it was automatically generated.

I have no objection to changing the product name.  The tax issue concerns the 
location of the trader - if the guy managing the prices is in London but the

Mark,

I have not yet been contacted by legal/tax regarding the change of 
description for PIX indices.  We still basically want only to delete "US" and 
replace it with "PIX".  To my simplistic, non-legal, mind this is a pretty 
simple issue....can't we just do it??

Hi Mark:

As Portland General Electric Company prepares for its sale to Sierra Pacific

recommend?

Attached please find ETA

Any idea why this question came up?

I found this picture of my boat on the internet!

My thoughts concerning potentially novel elements of EnronOnline:

1.  The online "making of a market" i.e. the continuous posting of real-time 
prices for both purchases and sales of commodities
2.  The online ability to enter into an energy commodity or commodity 
derivative transaction.
3.  The continuous and frequent updating of prices - including the operation 
of the "Stack Manager" which automates this process in many ways so that the 
system can react more quickly than a person.
4.  EnronOnline uses multiple levels of contractual language - a single line 
"short description" of abbreviated terms identifying the transaction to the 
trader, a long description which defines the abbreviated terms and adds 
additional legal language and general terms and conditions which contain the 
remaining contractual terms and are accepted only once by the counterparty.
5.  The site directs counterparties to different contracts based on the 
counterparty profile containing both credit information and information 
concerning the contracts the counterparty already has in place.
6.  It may be relevant for any or all of the foregoing that the EnronOnline 
system is web-based - i.e. the user does not require any system-specific 
software but just a web browser (and an internet plug-in application)
7.  The Master User account gives the counterparty the ability to set up 
passwords for sub-users for that entity and control the access and trading 
authority of various password holders.
8.  Each user can create customized screens showing only those products in 
which he or she is interested.
9.  The system provides for the submission of offers to transact by 
counterparties which are automatically accepted or rejected by the system 
based on pre-established criteria resulting in binding contracts.

Mark Taylor

   

Based on earlier conversations, I have identified the following business 
methods that may be novel from a patent point of view:

1.   our site is offering "prime" paper rather than seconds or ends
2.   credit risk is managed by the site (credit intermediation) without cost 
to customers
3.   customers can access financial derivatives on paper to manage price risk 
on physical paper products
4.   customers have access to financial derivatives to manage price risk on 
prime offerings

Please give me your comments on this so we plan our strategy.

The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t=
he=20
terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll=
=20
have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. =
 I=20
also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is=
=20
traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20
Descriptions:

Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel=
y=20
clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i=
n=20
the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  If so, maybe we should add a lin=
e=20
something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS-3 for this=20
Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic reference to the=
=20
relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentence=20
referring to the quality as well.

Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere?

The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -=
=20
there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the=
=20
GTC.  Unless industry trading convention is to the contrary, the site makes=
=20
more intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the sa=
me=20
units.  If the volume is Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number=
=20
some counterparties (or perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.=
 =20
The GTC contains the defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit=
. =20
It seems to me that if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the=20
volume as Bandwidth Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth=
=20
Unit and the number of DSO miles for the transaction. =20

Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20
beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to=
=20
the GTC.

The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20
parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about=
=20
this more than I.)

If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I=
=20
would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth=
=20
Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha=
t=20
the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per=
=20
month'.

Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to =
be=20
clear from the Long Description.

So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with=
=20
something like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=
y=20
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The price=20
shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of th=
e=20
General Terms and Conditions shall apply to this Transaction. =20
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=
e=20
Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20
Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20
Date>. =20
The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling=
=20
Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,=20
CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20
Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20
LSAJCAWZH04).
The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit=
=20
per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per=
=20
month.=20

If quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesn't work it would b=
e=20
more like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=
y=20
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website. The number of=
=20
DSO=01,s per Bandwidth Unit is 672. The price shall be as submitted by the=
=20
Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of the General Terms and Condition=
s=20
will apply to this Transaction. =20
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=
e=20
Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The=20
Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination=20
Date>. =20
The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling=
=20
Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,=20
CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20
Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:=20
LSAJCAWZH04), for a total of 2,446 DSO miles.
The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one DS0 mile per=
=20
month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per mont=
h.=20
Therefore, the Contract Price will be calculated as follows: price x the=20
number of DS0=01,s per Bandwidth Unit x the number of DS0 miles x the numbe=
r of=20
Bandwidth Units.

Please let me know if you have any questions - I will go ahead and approve=
=20
the product in the system so you can proceed without me if necessary.

The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of t=
he=20
terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll=
=20
have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's. =
 I=20
also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is=
=20
traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long=20
Descriptions:

Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirel=
y=20
clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference i=
n=20
the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  You are correct. If so, maybe we=
=20
should add a line something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS=
-3=20
for this Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic referenc=
e=20
to the relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the=20
sentence referring to the quality as well. We have changed the first senten=
ce=20
of the long description to read " A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron=20
Broadband Services, L.P. ("EBS") pursuant to which the Seller shall sell an=
d=20
the Buyer shall buy the quantity of DS3 Bandwidth Units submitted by=20
Counterparty via the Website.

Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere? DS0 is a term generally known in t=
he=20
industry and is only used in the calculation of the Contract Price in the=
=20
long description, so we chose not to define it - also the definition is=20
incredibly long, complex and technical.  If you feel strongly about it, we=
=20
can include it, but since the long description tells you how many DS0's you=
=20
should include for calculation purposes, we didn't think that it was=20
necessary.

The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -=
=20
there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the=
=20
GTC.  The formula in the long description differs from the formula in the G=
TC=20
(and in the Master Agreement) in order to accomodate the way that the price=
=20
is being quoted on EnronOnline. The quote represents the variable component=
=20
of the "Unit Price" in the GTC's and the Master Agreement - In order not to=
=20
confuse people, we decided to include the formula in both the long=20
description and the confirmation so that customers could know that the Unit=
=20
Price was calculated using the price quoted.  Unless industry trading=20
convention is to the contrary, the site makes more intuitive sense when the=
=20
volume quoted and the price quoted use the same units.  If the volume is=20
Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number some counterparties (or=
=20
perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.  The GTC contains the=
=20
defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit.  It seems to me tha=
t=20
if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the volume as Bandwidth=20
Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth Unit and the number =
of=20
DSO miles for the transaction. =20

Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences=20
beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to=
=20
the GTC. Since bandwidth is such a new product, we really wanted to highlig=
ht=20
to customers that if they intend to take physical delivery of bandwidth=20
(which is what we are offering) they will need to establish connectivity wi=
th=20
us.  This is already in the GTC - but in an abundance of caution, we wanted=
=20
this fact highlighted, especially since connectivity will entail further=20
costs to the customer as well as signing documentation such as colocation=
=20
agreements, licenses etc. - this can be quite an involved process.

The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the=20
parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about=
=20
this more than I.) Agreed

If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I=
=20
would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth=
=20
Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and tha=
t=20
the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per=
=20
month'. It is a quote for one DS0 mile of a Bandwidth Unit for a month. =20
Since the short description indicates the period for the contract being=20
offered, we felt like the quotation was pretty clear.  We are also a bit=20
sensitive to using too many defined terms referring to each other in the lo=
ng=20
description.  From a commercial perspective, we are comfortable that the=20
language used in the quote and the long description are clear and accurate.

Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to =
be=20
clear from the Long Description.  If a Customer wanted to buy 5 of the OC3=
=20
Bandwidth Units quoted for the period from July 1- July 31, the Customer=20
would be entitled to 5 OC3's for the period from July 1 - July 31.  I hope=
=20
that this is responsive to your question - we weren't entirely clear.

So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with=
=20
something like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=
y=20
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The price=20
shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of th=
e=20
General Terms and Conditions shall apply to this Transaction. =20
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=
e=20

CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th=20

The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit=
=20
per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per=
=20

If quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesn't work it would b=
e=20
more like this:

A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (=01&EBS=018=
)=20
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantit=

will apply to this Transaction. =20
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effectiv=

The price is quoted in US Dollars.=20
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one DS0 mile per=

I'm in Buenos Aires today and talked to Andrea about her computer.  While 
they are having big problems with her laptop (it likes to eat hard drives) 
she will be able to bring it along (it's a Compaq Armada 1500C - will that 
fit in the docking station?).  In case it isn't working, can we get her set 
up with one of the Windows 2000 machines that are being installed Tuesday 
morning?

She can use EB3891 and the extension for that office is 5-7780.   For the

Did you know that Andrea Calo, attorney from the Argentina office, is coming 
to the Houston office on Monday morning , May 1, for a two week stay?

At Mark Taylor's request, please arrange an office, computer, and phones for 
her.  I will reserve an temporary ID for her through security.  Regarding her 
computer, she will let me know later this a.m. if she will be traveling with 
her lap top.

Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Sorry for the 
short notice, I just found out.

Thank you,
Taffy

I haven't been able to get into any off these things.  Do you know what they 
are?

Hey Amanda!

Yao just gave me your e-mail address.  He had told me you were at UVA a 
couple of months ago.  How do you like law school so far?  I have to admit I 
pretty much hated every minute of it.  Now that I think about it, I can't say 
that being a lawyer had been all that much fun either.  Oh well, the pay is 
pretty good.

I found this picture of my boat on the internet site of the charter company 
that rents it out for me when I'm not sailing (which is most of the time).  
When are we going sailing again?  Got any good vacation weeks coming up?  The 
Caribbean sure sounds good right about now......

	
	

Mark, 

This resume is the daughter of a Director in Human Resources.  She has a law 
degree and has worked as
a legal assistant/paralegal throughout her career.  I do not think her 
background is as strong as some of the other
candidates that you have seen.  But, I decided to send it anyway because it 
is an employee referral.  Take 
a look at it and let me know what you think.

We are now able to open these but can't say I'm any happier about it.  Well, 
maybe that's too extreme - at least it seems like a good idea in principle.  
But I do have several questions:  Do we have a similar system here in NA?  
Are we expected to review all of these?  Is there some way to filter out the 
junk?  To whom should I address these questions?

Dear Mark:

I refer to you e-mail of March 3 sent to my partner, Paul Davis.  I am in

Please see our comments below.

Best regards,

Our research has revealed no statements of regulators in Japan in connection
with the marketing or dealing in the above types of  products through the
internet or other electronic systems from publicly available source.  We will
let you know if we find any previous or future statements.

We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or 
trading
of any of the products set out in question 1 above through the internet.  
Under
Japanese law, formation of any contract does not require any formality.

Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or
acceptances to be valid as such. There is no Statute of Frauds, and parties 
may
make most types of contracts orally. If there is enough evidence establishing
that the offeree agreed to the terms offered, an offeror may rely on it. In 
most
simple sales contracts for consumer goods, for example, it would be easy to
prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y. The Seller's
electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy 
product
Y should be enough in this context.

In more complicated contracts, the structure of the seller's Web pages should 
be
carefully designed. Having no court decisions, we have no definite answer to 
the
question of enforceability of shrink-wrap agreements in Japan. However, the
legal implications of the Web-wrap, the online version of shrink-wrap, may be
somewhat different from shrink-wraps (e.g. licenses for software sold over the
counter).  Under a typical shrink-wrap license in the real world, for example,
the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the
product. However, in an on-line environment, a customer has a choice to click 
on
an Accept-to-Buy icon before the customer purchases the product. Further, 
with a
carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able 
to
let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the
icon, it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and
conditions than in a typical shrink-wrap license situation. Unlike shrink-wrap
in the real world, the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the
customer clicked on the icon. Given these differences, the result possibly may
be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrink-wrap licenses.

If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or 
U.K.
law and the transactions contain a choice of such law, such transactions,
including the choice of law, will be enforceable in Japan.

We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws,
regulations, or court cases.  So long as  the party maintains the relevant
website with a computer server located outside Japan, the likelihood of 
Japanese
regulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such website
established a "physical" establishment/branch in Japan is negligible.

Please let me know if you have any revisions.

I agree that an electronic system of tracking these things is a good idea.  
Either the electronic or manual system will be admissable, but the electronic 
system strikes me as more reliable.  I'm more concerned witht he 
effectiveness of the notification - it's still not clear to me that adding a 
line on the ticker will be satisfactory.  In fact, it clearly is not 
satisfactory for changes in the ETA or a GTC.  Those documents will have to 
be clicked on again if any changes are made, the only remaining question 
being how do you highlight the changes.  The significant gray area is still 
changes to the Long Descriptions.

David Forster@ENRON
05/10/2000 03:26 AM
It is important that we track when we have given notification to parties 
about changes to the Long Descriptions or GTC/ETA wording.

Although the standard form of ETA does not contain any notice requirements, 
it has been modified for some parties to say that we will "give notice".

Regardless of whether or not we are obligated in the ETA to give notice, it 
is important that we do - and can prove that we have done so.

Therefore, we should ensure that we keep an internal log of the change 
notifications (dates and text). 

Jay/Mark: Until we have a more developed notification process, can we have an 
electronic log of when a particular ticker item appeared and was then removed 
from the website? I assume this would have to be some sort of built text 
field, to account for possible multiple addtions and removals. Is this simple 
or hard to do? This would be more reliable than a manual log, and if 
generated manually, would hopefully be more admissable in court (Mark, can 
you comment?)

Sheri/Amita/Dale: Until we have a system solution, can you ensure you 
coordinate on some sort of manually maintained notice log?

Thanks,

Dave

Yes, I will take care of this one.

Let me know if this is what you had in mind.

Is this for you?

I have revised my profile to give you calendar management access - sorry 
about the delay.

We're looking forward to stopping by but it may be a little later - not sure 
about the exact schedule for the eve.  Mind if we bring a friend or two?  I 
doubt they'll come with us (they work til about 9 or 10 on Fridays and are 
usually ready to collapse at that point) but you never know til you ask.

Mark

   

We still have too much beer left and need your help in getting rid of
it.  You're invited to our house tomorrow, Friday, at 9:00 for drinks
and a pre-JR's get together.  Other beverages will be served if wanted.
 Sorry, Adobe will not deliver their tasty beverage.

Let me know if you and yours can attend.

Gordon

Thanks for taking care of this!  Sorry if I caused any confusion.

New York Mercantile Exchange Announces E-Commerce Venture

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
CONTACT:
Nachamah Jacobovits
(212) 299-2430
Maria Gonzalez
(212) 299-2436
NEW YORK, NY, May 4, 2000 - The board of directors of the New York Mercantile 
Exchange last night approved the formation of eNYMEX, an e-commerce venture 
that is intended to become the premier, global exchange for over-the-counter 
(OTC) forward trading and clearing of a wide range of standardized physical 
commodity contracts. 
The board also established an implementation schedule and retained the 
services of Andersen Consulting to work on the venture. 
The Exchange plans to use its proven clearing infrastructure to introduce 
complete counter-party risk management for OTC trading, and create net 
margining with Exchange futures markets by calculating a consolidated 
clearing position. eNYMEX will provide a single, internet-based interface to 
both the OTC market and the Exchange futures market by routing futures orders 
to the trading floor and the NYMEX ACCESSc electronic trading system, 
depending on the session. 
The Exchange's vision for the venture also includes pursuing strategic 
partnerships through which eNYMEX would provide clearing services to external 
organizations and creating a credit structure that will permit floor members 
to participate in OTC markets. 
The range of OTC products offered will initially focus on swap contracts in 
crude oil, petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity, with some spot 
cash market products also offered. Over time, this would be expanded into 
such areas as precious and base metals, coal, and, potentially, bandwidth, 
weather, and emissions. Although the initial geographic focus will be on 
North America, contracts are also expected to be offered for some European 
and Asian locations. 
In addition to today's launch announcement, the key milestones of eNYMEX, are 
expected to be a third quarter introduction of OTC trading, followed by 
Internet-based order-routing for futures trading, including a common 
interface for OTC and futures trading, and clearing and settlement of OTC 
trading. 
Exchange Chairman Daniel Rappaport said, "The global energy and metals 
community has expressed a strong need for an electronic OTC platform that 
provides an open, independent, and neutral marketplace for trading by all 
participants, price transparency, counter-party credit risk management, and 
the liquidity created by simple standardized contracts." 
Mr. Rappaport also enumerated several other advantages of eNYMEX over other 
available OTC systems: 
? Leveraging the proven market management capabilities of the Exchange. 
? The combination of the existing futures and options markets with the eNYMEX 
electronic OTC market provides an ideal combination of e-commerce with 
"bricks & mortar". 
? The Exchange's established and well-regarded clearinghouse, which will be 
used to provide counter-party risk management 
? Net margining of positions across the futures and OTC markets, providing 
significant cashflow benefits to participants trading across markets and 
commodities. 
eNYMEX will be a wholly owned, for-profit subsidiary of the New York 
Mercantile Exchange.

Sorry I missed you earlier - please blame Louise who refused to let me leave 
the meeting I was in with her to call.  I tried to call you in London just 
now but there was no answer.  If you are still around, please feel free to 
try me again but if that doesn't work I will be in all next week and am happy 
to set up a time that works for you.

The Houston desk has asked me to prepare a form of confirm for a credit 
derivative based on the bankruptcy of a Canadian reference entity.  Before I 
talk to Canadian counsel about the bankruptcy laws there I thought I should 
check with you guys and make sure you haven't done this already - any issues 
you know of?
Thanks, Mark

Here is the draft of the questionnaire for local counsel.  Let me know what 
you think.

If the NDA is the Confidentiality Agreement for the Energy Trading Platform 
(group of six?), I have marked it up with only those revisions I thought 
essential (having discussed them with Andy) and am now waiting to hear back 
regarding where I should send it (have left voice mail for Greg and Andy is 
checking).

If the NDA is something else, please let me know.

PICK NEWS - CALLS (continued)
*******************************************************
AOL  $144.50 -$1.25 (-2.00)  Hmmmmm-AOL flat for the week?
NOT!!  We deliberated whether to keep or drop AOL today,
but decided to keep it.  Read on.  AOL spiked up to close
at $165 earlier this week and has shed $20 in the last 3
trading days since.  Especially noted was the drop of $9
yesterday on 25 million shares (10 million more than
average-not a good sign).  Today though, AOL held up well
in the face of strong down-market forces on lower than
average volume.  It is, after all, the most stable of the
Internet stocks and is not going away.  While AOL feels
comfortable like a family pet, remember it's a trade that's
gone against us, and normally we would get out.  But with
the shaky Brazilian market perhaps drastically affecting
the rest of Latin America, we think the bad news and fear
is already in this stock.  We think of it more like a
rubber band stretched in reverse where the farther it's
stretched back, the harder it will snap forward.  It's
nerve-racking waiting for the bounce, but AOL is a split
candidate over $120 and should give us a great performance
once it snaps.  With a record breaking Christmas and 22,000
new users every day, AOL's earnings should be great.  Look
for the split announcement any day, or at the latest, with
earnings due Feb. 9 per Zack's. (There has been some
confusion on the actual date; Motley Fool board says as
early as Jan. 27.  We'll keep you posted.)  Still an
Internet-guts required.  Play with caution.

WCOM  $71.00 $2.94 (-4.00)  In this type of trading
environment where the "big picture" whollops the average
company press release, it pays to sit on the sidelines.  We
warned in Tuesday's letter that WCOM may need to
consolidate a bit before moving up, and urged discipline
before entering another trade.  We hope you waited.  WCOM
is still a great play, but we still need to wait for the
recovery before playing this pick.  They are now at their
30 day moving average and should bounce off it, market
permitting.  $70 is their support price.  Wait for the
bounce.  If it breaks below $70 and holds, we'll re-
evaluate and likely drop it.  WCOM is in high-bandwidth
content delivery tests with AOL, which should be successful
and more fully implemented through Bell Atlantic and SBC's
DSL services.  Remember too, they just won the FTS2000
contract (worth $5 billion)to provide the U.S. Government
with voice and data services for the next 8 years

T  $82.13 -$2.63(-$2.93)  AT&T is holding up quite well
given the market retrenchment this week.  The need to move
voice and information throughout the world will not
diminish, even in a down market.  AT&T could actually
become a low cost producer who benefits from cost-conscious
users exercising corporate belt-tightening.  It behaves
like a safe haven in a down market and a tech stock in an
up market.  Volume has been heavy over the last 2 days.  If
investors wanted to dump this stock, we'd have seen more
damage to the price.  Support is at $82 with better support
at $80.  AT&T's prospects are still great with the
integration of TCI helping to complete the "last mile" of
service availability to your home.  AT&T continues to melt
the copper in favor of fiber replacement at every turn.
Wait for the bounce and confirm market direction before
playing.

DELL  $77.63 -$1.69 (-$0.18)  Dell is holding up nicely
this week given the weak market performance.  Dell's volume
has also been weak.  We spoke with investor relations and
are now able to determine that volatility has greatly
diminished, and since their split in September, volume too.
Dell used to trade 50 million shares per day on average.
As the daily average is figured, the high numbers drop off
and new, lower numbers replace them.  This will naturally
reduce the average until it more closely resembles the
actual daily trades currently taking place.  It should not
be long until these 2 more closely resemble each other.  In
other words, the low volume is no longer cause for alarm
and supports our original assessment that huge daily price
swings are a thing of the past.  Dell's story is still the
same-big sales increases, more markets served, higher
margins.  When Dell's news season picks up (Feb.-March
according to investor relations), Dell will again be on
investors' radar screens.  Nothing's changed; they're just
a little quieter.  Still on our favorites list, consider
the slight retrenchment as a buying opportunity when the
market gets over its jitters.  Now's a good time to scale
into the trade, but confirm market direction first.

LXK $97.00 3.25 (-3.56) LXK fell with the rest of the market
on Thursday. We still like LXK with earnings coming up on
the 19th of January and the strong possibility of a stock
split. The Open Buying on the Internet(OBI) standard has taken
another leap forward with the adoption of Lexmark Interna-
tional's new OBI-compliant Internet purchasing system.  The
Kentucky-based printing solutions company has adopted a new
system that eliminates many of the manual processes Lexmark
previously used to purchase indirect materials.  Lexmark
has partnered with SupplyWorks, a Web-based purchasing
services company.  For the first time, buyers are not required
to purchase software to manage supplier connections.

LOW $51.38 -.31 (-3.31) LOW showed some nice strength today
with a loss of .6%. The DOW went down over 2%. LOW was
listed as one of the stocks picked in the dartboard contest.
Whether the professionals picking LOW is good or not is
a decision you'll have to make (just kidding). Look to last
Sunday for why LOW is a pick.  LOW's has earnings in mid-
February.  No new news.

ATI $78.81 +1.56 (-.19) ATI bucked the trend on Thursday, and
went up. Rumors continue to circulate about ATI being merged
with either BellAtlantic or Vodaphone. It's rumored that VOD
is offering in the range of $90 a share. The question now is
whether Bell is willing to raise its bid to match VOD. Thursday's
price increase was mainly due to this speculation. Bell did
just get notice from the SEC that its bid would classify as
a pooling of interests.  ATI is still $11 away from the rumored
bid by Vodaphone.

LU $105.93 +1.69 (-9.32) LU is a great company, with stock
split possibilities, and earnings coming up: so why are we
dropping it? We aren't. We have re-added LU to the pick list.
Last Tuesday we dropped LU because of the buyout situation
with Ascend. On Wednesday, the deal went through and it seems
LU has finished dropping. LU opened on Wednesday at $98.50,
yet closed at $104.50. LU is scheduled to report earnings on
January 21st. This date is in debate. We will try to get the
official date from LU directly. Though they are just short
of shares necessary to do a 2-1 stock split, they could
announce a split with earnings, contingent to the vote on
increasing shares in February.

BUY CALL FEB-105 LU-BA OI=1395 at $ 9.25 SL=6.75
BUY CALL FEB-110 LU-BB OI=4290 at $ 6.75 SL=5.00
BUY CALL APR-110 LU-DB OI=2978 at $11.25 SL=8.50
BUY CALL APR-115 LU-DC OI=3300 at $ 9.00 SL=6.50

XIRC $38.13 .50 (-.37) XIRC has held up pretty well through
this market debacle.  Earnings are on January 21st and XIRC
has announced earnings with surprises of no less than 10% over
the last four quarters.  This normally will help XIRC to have
an earnings run into the announcement. XIRC's 10-dma is at
$37.00. Watch for upward movement before initiating new plays.

COF  Capital One Financial $127.18 1.18 (-.12 for this week)

Capital One Financial, a financial services holding company,
is the parent for Capital One Bank, one of the US's top 10
credit card companies. Using the information on consumers in
its massive databases, the company solicits Visa and
MasterCard customers by mail. The company's 3,000 variations
of annual percentage rates, credit limits, finance charges,
and fees range from platinum and gold cards for preferred
customers to secured and unsecured cards for customers with
limited credit histories. Other subsidiaries include a
federally chartered savings bank that offers credit cards,
consumer lending, and deposit services and a company that
provides internal support services.

COF is near its 52-week high and when this stock breaks out,
it tends to really go. We feel with earnings coming up on the
19th of January and the possibility of a stock split, this
could end up being a great play. COF is sitting right on its
20-dma and held up pretty well compared to the market. Watch
for upward movement and then jump on for the ride.

Preliminary numbers for credit card numbers are looking very
positive for the holiday season. An analyst at JP Morgan feels
that COF outperformed its peers. An analyst at Goldman Sachs
stated; "The combination of strong fees driven by account
growth improvement in core credit is likely to produce very
strong earnings visibility at both Capital One and Providian."
Earnings are expected to come in strong.

TLAB - Tellabs $80.69 -$0.44(+$6.38 this week)(P3W $10.18)

Tellabs is quickly becoming a powerhouse in the Telecom
equipment industry. With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems,
and its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from
customers among the telephone companies, cable operators,
and government agencies.  Though they faded from news of
their failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major player.

TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78 on 11 million shares,
$8 higher than resistance previously set at $70.  We thought
it would quickly fall back; we were wrong.  TLAB drifted back
to $74, then spiked $5 to $79, on average volume of 3.5 million.
Over the previous 3 trading days, it gained in market weakness
while giving back only $.44 in heavy trading in a downright
bearish market-a terrific sign of strength.  Technical
indicators are positive, so is the chart indicating a small
correction already taking place.  3.5 million shares traded
daily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share in cash;
34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.   TLAB will be a
winner when the market turns.  We expect them to announce more
contracts in the coming weeks.  Recent news is capturing
investors' eyeballs, making for a good story.

Here goes.  Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised ther rating
to a "buy" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35
and $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000, respectively.
They further stat, "fundamentals for the telecom equipment
group has improved over the past few months which improves
visibility for Tellabs" and "Our checks with Tellabs will
report fourth quarter 1998 results slightly better than our
$0.58 earnings per share estimate, as well as having a positive
outlook for 1999" (Reuters).  Also, rumors surfaced last week
that TLAB was a targeted buyout/merger candidate, but were
quickly squashed.  Not soon enough though to draw investor
attention to the price move.

DIS - Disney $36.06 -.06 (+3.50)

Striving to be the premier entertainment company, Disney has
revenues of $10,055.1 million. It is involved in movies,
television, theme parks and resorts, home video, travel,
books, music, theater, and creative design. Recently, It has
added an internet portal in a joint venture with Infoseek, in
which it has a 43% stake.

The past year has been tough for Disney, due to high
programming costs at its ABC division, and to weak demand for
its products in Asia.  Last week Merrill Lynch's Jessica
Reif Cohen lowered earnings estimates for the current fiscal
quarter from .27 to .23, and for the fiscal year ending Sept.
1999 from .91 to .86. She cited softness in consumer products
and broadcasting operations, and continued weakness in Asia.
However, three other analysts believe the stock is oversold
and that DIS is experiencing a recovery.  On Jan.12th, Goldman
Sachs raised their rating from Neutral to Outperform, and
Salomon Smith Barney raised theirs from Neutral to Buy. On Jan.
11th, ING Baring Furman Selz upgraded DIS to Buy from Hold.
On Jan. 12th, Disney and Infoseek launched their new
Internet portal site, Go Network (www.go.com).  Numbers show
that it will be one of the top 5 sites on the Internet.
Following the upgrades and the new portal launch, Disney
stock has performed well. Its chart looks good and it has
pushed through the major moving averages. Although it was
down today along with a lot of other stocks, it is still
up $3.50 for the week, showing strength.

Disney is still ironing out final details for production
and technical workers to return to work following a one
day strike on Nov. 3rd. Their contract had expired 3/97. The
company has named Thomas Schumaker a new president and put
him in charge of its animated movie and theater business. Also,
DIS may acquire Goldenbooks and is interested in Livent Inc.,
a theater co. When the market resumes its upward movement,
look for Disney to move back up.  Earnings are due out by
next Thursday (1/21) according to First Call.

Adobe Systems, Inc. (ADBE) - $47.69
Software

Adobe Systems, Inc. (ADBE) is a leading provider of publishing
and imaging software technologies, and the second largest
desktop software company in the world with annual revenues
approaching $1 billion. Adobe develops, markets and supports
computer software products that enable users to create,
display, print and communicate all forms of electronic
documents. Computer application products accounted for 78%
of fiscal 1997 revenues and licensing, 22%.

The Company continues to be cautious about licensing revenue
in the short term due to weak Japanese market conditions and
uncertain timing of OEM customer introductions of products
incorporating Adobe's latest technologies. The Company is
coming out of a recent restructuring and trying to focus its
resources on high growth revenue opportunities in digital
color, color inkjet, short-run on-demand digital printing,
and digital copiers... although licensing revenue is likely
to be flat in the short-term. Other risks include product
shipment delays, market acceptance of new products and
upgrades, declines in printer licensing business.

Stock likely to fail at key resistance point of $48.
Declining relative strength and aggressive earnings
projections may disappoint. Many analysts have a hold on the
stock. Slight distribution taking place among top
institutional shareholders. Likely to test 52 week lows.

January 13, 1999 update

U.S. stocks crumbled at the opening on Wednesday morning on news
that Brazil's central bank president had resigned, sparking an
across-the-board flight to quality that rocked world stock markets.
The Dow was off 136, the Nasdaq down 113 and many issues had not
yet begun to trade. By mid-morning, stocks were on the rebound,
lifted by a recovery in Brazil and massive bargain hunting. By
noon, the panic was gone and many traders were selling partial
positions to lock-in gains. At the close, the Dow fell 125 points
to 9349.56 and recouped more than half its early losses. Even so,
the decline was viewed as a reminder of market vulnerability after
a series of record highs.

Our portfolio was very active. We will begin with the new plays:
LU was the focus of our attention and it dropped hard with the
rest of the high visibility techs. The stock traded as low as $96
but the first option prices available for the FEB105C/110C left
us with a debit of $1.75. Morgan Stanley raised its rating of LU
to a "strong buy" late in the morning and that helped the stock
move higher through the day. LUV was the next offering and it was
also significantly lower at the open. The first few trades on the
FEB22C/25C went through at about $1.25 debit. LEVL was far less
affected by the morning activity and the best we could do on the
FEB30C/35C was $3.25 debit. DIS was our personal play-of-the-day
and we managed to trade along with everyone else (fighting the
overwhelmed internet brokerages) with a $4.00 opening cost-basis
for the JAN00-40C/FEB40C LEAPS/Calendar spread.

In other portfolio plays; It was a great opportunity to double-up
(reducing the cost-basis) on some of the more favorable debit
positions. AOL and OXHP were our candidates and these stocks were
down at the open. The prices were: AOL, FEB155C/160C at $1.50 and
OXHP, FEB17C/20C at $1.00. We will reflect these separate trades
in the monthly summary. Of course, some of the calendar spreads
were in need of a correction and we used the opportunity to pare
losses from the recent run-up. Short positions were closed on:
ATI; JAN70C at $7.00, GM; JAN70C at $11.00, and PCS; JAN22C at
$2.38.

T was quite a mover! In the morning melee, we purchased the JAN80C
at $2.50 (with the stock price near $82) and subsequently closed
the FEB80C during the midday rebound for $8.50.

One other opportunity arose on the NXTL straddle. The MAY35P could
have been closed for $5.25, leaving the long (call) option; MAY30C
at cost of $2.87.

January 14, 1999 update

U.S. stocks tumbled Thursday afternoon as the impeachment trial
against the President added pressure to an already shaken market.
Political instability is a catalyst for investor uncertainty and
that was evident as the DJIA fell 228 points to 9120, erasing all
the big gains for 1999. The Nasdaq Composite Index was also lower,
down 40 points at 2276. Stocks have been poised for a downturn
following the recent run-up in prices but some thought the strong
U.S. economy would protect the stock market from the impeachment
drama. However, the trial opened in an investment climate that had
already been shaken by the devaluation of Brazil's currency and
jittery investors flocked to the exits.

On Thursday, we used the morning bounce to fill some of our open
calendar positions: On ATI, we rolled up to the FEB75C at a bid
price of $7.25; GM was also moved to a diagonal spread with the
sale of the FEB75C for $8.50 and PCS was moved to the next higher
strike with a FEB25C at $2.87. These spreads are no longer neutral
and are now more aggressive with the new strike positions but we
expect all of these stocks to remain at-or-above current prices.

For Friday, we still have a number of suspect issues. CPQ and CD
are near the sold strikes and we may need to close those positions
before the day is over. FTU is fading as the merger speculation
dwindles and LU is still "one to watch" as the ASND deal unfolds
and the company earnings report aproaches. Good Luck!

CIEN - Ciena Corp.  $18.68     Merger Speculation

CIENA Corporation designs, manufactures and sells architecture,
dense wavelength division multiplexing systems for fiberoptic
communications networks. In September, Ciena and Tellabs cancelled
their merger agreement and shares in the rival equipment makers
fell sharply after Ciena's financial outlook soured, primarily
because an expected contract from AT&T fell through. In early
January, coverage was initiated by Prudential as the telecom
sector started to soar. Then the share price spiked on speculation
the telecommunications equipment-maker might find a merger partner
after the announced purchase of Ascend by Lucent. Some say there
is a market rumor that Cisco Systems is preparing a bid of $25-$28
per share for Ciena. Technically, the stock price is back in a
recent trading range around $17 (November-early December) and we
will use this previous support and the excellent OTM premiums to
create a favorable play.

AAPL - Apple Computers  $41.38     Put-Credit Spread

AAPL designs and manufactures and markets personal computers and
related personal computing and communicating solutions for sale
to business, education, home and government customers. A few weeks
ago, shares of Apple jumped after its iMac consumer PC was named
the top-selling personal computer at the retail level during the
month of November. Not only was the iMac the leading product, it
has been the number one selling PC since its introduction back in
August. The iMac has captured 5.9% of retail unit sales and it was
the only PC to break into the top five best-sellers group in four
months.

Now the bad news; one day after reporting excellent earnings, APPL
dropped $5.12 when an analyst voiced concerns about the pricing of
its iMac. This surprise downgrade comes even as the computer maker
reported revenues that easily surpassed Wall Street expectations.
The APPL chart looks negative from a short-term perspective but
there is still a long history of support around $37. Play this one
on downward momentum by opening the long position first. Then sell
the short position when the stock price firms, to create the credit
spread.

SUNW - Sun Microsystems  $94.50     Calendar Spread/LEAPS

SUNW supplies enterprise network computing products including
desktop systems, servers, storage subsystems, network switches,
software, microprocessors and a full range of services.

Personally, I just like this company from long-term perspective
and the "Covered-calls on LEAPS" strategy is a favorable way to
take advantage of the extreme near-term option premiums.

Please refer to the January 12, newsletter article concerning
SUNW for more information:

http://www.optioninvestor.com/playoftheday/index.asp

PLAY (conservative/long-term):

BUY  CALL JAN00-100 LSU-AT OI=1580 A=$19.63
SELL CALL FEB-100   SUQ-BT OI=3181 B=$5.87
NET DEBIT TARGET=$13.50 ROI TARGET=100%

Note: In the long-term calendar spread, we are reducing the net
cost of the LEAP by the amount of credit from the sale of the
nearer term call. If the near-term call expires worthless, we will
sell the MAR call to further reduce our debit. If your short-term
position is ITM on the last day of the strike, you need to buy it
back so that you DON'T have to exercise the long-term position. In
that case, your LEAP is going up in value also and on the last day
of the strike period, the short call will shrink down to intrinsic
value so you will be ahead in the play even after you buy it back.

Japan, Asia, Russia, Brazil. Who is next??

Another day, another excuse for profit taking. The market sold off
again with the Brazilian flu along with a dose of impeachment blues.

The market started down early and showed little interest in turning
around. The rumors from Brazil were all negative. Coupled with the
resignation of yet another government official the rumor that the
Central Bank was set to let the Real float knocked the Brazil market
for another -10% loss. Floating the Real, the Brazilian currency,
would be a drastic devaluation since the currency would then be free
to find its own level.

Floating could start the domino theory fall of all the surrounding
Latin American countries that depend on Brazil for trade. Chile and
Argentina would be the first to go. If South America were to devalue
as a group then the countries who export to South America would be
put on a diet. The U.S., depending on who you talk to and what area
they reference, exports to South America account for between 17-25%
of our total. Companies like Colgate derive 40% of their revenue from
Latin countries.

If the feared event happened then the results would be drastic. The
companies who derive a large percentage of their business from there
would suffer huge earnings shortfalls. Layoffs could occur, plant
closings, etc. That would be the extreme but it is possible. Possible
but not probable. There are many things that can and will happen
before we get to that point. Rest assured that every Fed head in the
world is concerned about the Brazil problem. The IMF will be very
interested in preventing this scenario. Cardosa is very interested.
Power and pressure are being brought to bear. The Brazil Central
Bank issued a strongly worded press release stating they would use
every means at their disposal to prevent floating the Real. They
said they would use their $50 bln in reserves to protect the Real.
This was only minimally comforting to the market this afternoon.
Memories of many other countries last minute claims to the same
intent, and then immediate devaluation, are fresh. Russia was the
latest. While analysts feel there could be serious impacts from a
possible worst case, they also feel that the market has now discounted
the most likely scenario which is months of protracted, painful,
negotiations ending in an agreement of some sort to yet another bail
out. No harm, no foul. Just uncertainty.

Meanwhile the market has now "corrected" five percent off its record
high of just last week. My how short our memory can be. 9643, only
five trading days ago. Champagne was already being ordered for the
Dow 10,000 celebration. Should we cancel the order? Not hardly.

As I have said many times the market cycles. Remember last week when
I kept warning you about an impending bout of profit taking. Its'
here and I don't think it is over. Fear of darkness is only beaten
out by one other thing. Fear of a long holiday weekend. Yep, closed
Monday for MLK day. I have already had one of my brokers call me to
ask if I want some currency positions left open over the long weekend.
Seems the currency market closes at 1:PM on Friday. Now if you were
a country that needed to manipulate some currency to benefit your
country, a U.S. holiday would be the perfect time. Don't laugh.
Japan does it all the time. The same thing on a smaller scale can
happen to stock profits held over a holiday. Events happen, mass
exodus at Tuesday's open. Remember Wednesday morning?

You may think I have put on a fur coat. Far be it from the truth.
I am long several hundred contracts of tech stocks and I am looking
for a recovery soon. Again, being long does not make me right, just
very interested in the outcome.

I have not elaborated on the market impact from the impeachment trial
and won't because I don't think there is any impact. As I have said
before, the chances of a guilty vote are about zero and the market
knows this.

If you watched any market TV today then you know the Internet stocks
are finally starting to weave. They are getting beat from all sides.
Brokers are cutting the ratings on the high flyers left and right.
Funny how the smell of blood brings out the crowd. Nobody would cut
them last week when they were adding $20 a day. It is dogpile time
now. To add insult to injury the online brokers are now starting
to prevent customers from actually buying the stocks. I am not
kidding. Some have taken them off the margin list. If you want to
buy you have to pay cash, 100%. Others will not let you buy them
online. You have to call a broker and wait on the line while they
verify your eligibility to purchase high risk investments! Others
refuse to execute the trades at all. You might hurt yourself. Does
it strike you strange that Internet brokers will not let you buy
Internet stocks??? What ever happened to the concept of "it is
your money not theirs." In the face of this conspiracy to protect
you from yourself the Internets are losing ground quickly. Except
AOL. AOL has somehow avoided the label of "overpriced" and actually
garnered several honorable mentions from analysts downgrading other
Internet stocks. Guess where Internet money will go now?

For you technicians out there the pendulum has swung from
overbought to oversold in a very short period of time. The Dow
is now down -522 points in the last five days. Both the Dow and
the Nasdaq have corrected about 5%. Just as the sharp run up last
week was begging for a dip, this sharp dip is now begging for a
rally. The big drop today was on the lightest Dow volume in over
a week. Not as much conviction today just a lack of buyers. This
was also the third triple digit loss in a row. As I mentioned
earlier I think the odds for a down day Friday are still pretty
good. The wild card again is the options expiration which normally
provides an upward bias. I can't build a case for a strong move
upward because of Brazil and the holiday but I can see a strong
Tuesday coming as long as Brazil does not meltdown over the weekend.
Earnings will be on us in earnest next week with MSFT, LU, SUNW
announcing along with dozens of others. I think the focus on
Brazil will have dimmed and the anticipation of upside surprises
will take center stage.

Good Luck

Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
******************************************************************

Stay Focused on the Pinnacle Index

After selling off precipitously over the past couple of days, it
is very important to keep in eye on the Pinnacle Index and other
put/call ratios for clues as to whether the sell-off is a major
reversal or profit taking.

Based upon the early returns, it appears that most option
speculators are viewing the sell-off as profit taking and this
could be prove BEARISH over the near-term.  Despite the negative
economic news from Brazil, the Pinnacle Index actually climbed
and other put/call ratios indicate increased call buying.

Add this to the latest Bullish figures from Investors
Intelligence (60% Bullish 1/14) you get the impression that
investors are ignoring economic and corporate earnings pressures.

Pinnacle's short-term indicators are still flashing bearish
overtones over the near-term so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.  Any questions
regarding market sentiment can be directed at:

PICKS WE DROPPED
****************
When we drop a pick it doesn't mean we are recommending a sell
on that play. Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.
We drop a pick because something happened to change its
profile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we
don't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.
We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are
unfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we
want them to look at any current pick as a valid play.

CALLS:
******

CMGI $105.00 -8.44 (+40.75) After being derailed by the
Brazilian devaluation bomb midweek, the market when into
a tailspin and the Internets were no exception.  After
Monday's earth shaking surge of $71.75, CMGI has dwindled
away 31 points in the last 3 days ($62 pre-split).  With
a host of downgrades raining down on several of the big
hitters in the Internet sector, we figure it is time to
dodge the bullet before some valuation happy analyst sets
their sights on CMGI.  We are cutting CMGI loose and
hopefully it's consolidation will be quick.

AMZN $138.00 -10.00 (-22.25)  Brazilian devaluation.
Analysts' downgrades due to valuation.  Bearish short-term
remarks.  Impeachment proceedings.  Option expirations.  What
else can we add to the mixture in this pot of volatility??
Amazon had been doing just fine when it popped up over +$75.00
last week.  Not this week!  On Thursday in a sign of weakness,
Amazon finished only two and a half points off its low for the
day to close at $138.00.  Even earnings reports from companies
such as Yahoo that beat estimates weren't enough to carry
sympathy plays like Amazon into positive territory.  We are
dropping Amazon as a pick.  This is not to say that Amazon
won't turn around- and soon.  But in light of current
circumstances, we feel there are safer plays to be in.

ASND $82.13 +1.81 (+10.69) We finally got the price that LU is
paying for ASND, and it is .825 shares of LU for each share of
ASND.  The reason we are dropping ASND is because it has
effectively turned into a LU play since the purchase price has
been announced.  There is a little more room for ASND to move
given the share ratio, but typically the acquiree does not
close the gap completely because of the uncertainty of the deal
being closed.  There is no hint of competing bids, but ASND
would be a current play again if a bidding war started for it.

SLR $83.56 -1.50(-6.07) We are dropping SLR with the idea
we might pick it back up closer to the earnings report and
stock split date. As predicted, SLR announced a 2-1 stock
split this week. They announced after close on Wednesday.
Unfortunately, with the market volatility, SLR went down on
the day. We did see an opening that sent SLR up a few dollars,
but this faded into a loss by days end. SLR could definitely
see a split and earnings run, but we feel it's better to wait
for confirmation.

JPM  $102.00 4.56 (-12.44) The comeback in financial stocks
was derailed this week.  Hammered by the problems in Brazil,
JPMorgan lost another $4.56 today.  When we initiated this
play, JPM had momentum and its chart looked good.  However,
it's exposure to Brazil is too great, and given the seriousness
of the political and economic troubles in that country, we
have to drop JPM as a play.

GDT  $103.63  3.38 (-3.37) Guidant has lost ground since
setting an intra-day high of $119.75 on Monday. With just
13 days to go before it splits, GDT should be cruising into
a split run. It tried on Monday, but weakness in the overall
market has held it back. If the market turns positive again,
so will Guidant.  However, with the questionable market
footing we are going to cut Guidant loose until things firm up

PUTS:
******

NONE

PICK NEWS - CALLS
*******************************************************

FTL  $17.06 -.06 (-1.44)  FTL was added as a possible take
over play this week.  Something is going on but what?  We
are constantly pouring over news and rumor mongers only to
discover on Wednesday morning wires, trading was halted for
a block of shares (73,100) to trade at $16.06 down $-1.56.
Then we read about 100,000 shares being crossed by
Goldman Sachs.  Plus another 100,000 was traded at $17 today
by Salomon Smith Barney.  Unlike the techs' FTL did not suffer in
todays' trading, opening $17.69, taking a little off the table
to $16.69 then closing at $17.06.  Not providing a great
warm a fuzzy feeling, but enough of a feeling to keep this
as a play.  Remember, rumors are predicting a buyout at $23
or more.

MYG $63.25 -0.69 (-0.75)  Between Tuesday and Wednesday, MYG
seemed to be holding its own and only lost thirty-one cents
as the market dropped a combined -270.33 points.  But
Brazilian woes continued and the market plummeted another
-228.63 on Thursday.  Maytag fought and fought but finally,
the market scored a point with a knock-down.  Maytag was
stunned and conceded -$0.69.  MYG is normally a strong play
and is still one of our split candidates.  But, the market
is extremely volatile and we suggest waiting for things to
turn around before starting any new plays.

SUNW $94.50 -2.31 (+3.62)  Sun is one of the brightest stocks
on Wall Street even though the Brazilian storm continues to
darken the market.  Sun is up +$3.62 on the week from positive
press releases and rumors of a possible take-over by IBM.  On
Wednesday, CNBC presented the rumor which ended up being
dismissed as smoke but option trade volume increased none the
less.  We will keep you posted of any changes in the scenario.
In other news, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter raised its 12-month
price target for SUNW to $132, up from the previous price of
$104.  Not only does Sun have the only end to end computing
platform used in telecommunications services, it is also
working on incorporating its Java technology into the digital
TV industry.  Even though SUNW got ruffled by the market and
dropped -$2.31 on Thursday, SUNW is still a strong play.
Earnings for the company are scheduled for Jan 21st (not the
15th as we had previously reported), a prime time to announce
a possible split.  Look at the additional dip as a buying
opportunity but wait for some signs of a turn around before
entering.  Trying to catch a falling knife tends to damage
fingers and trading capital.

EMC $93.88 +1.56 (+.31) EMC is a pretty amazing momentum stock.
The NASDAQ is down 1.7% today, and EMC goes up.  On Wednesday,
EMC's gap down went as low as $84, but it was such a fast
market it probably was not a price you could have gotten
easily.  During the first 15 minutes of trading on Wednesday
1 million shares were traded.  This was almost half of
Wednesday's volume, and one-third of EMC's average daily
volume. There hasn't been any news on EMC, but then again, it
doesn't look like we need any.  FYI  In our Sunday write-up we
had EMC's earnings release date as 1/28, but we have since
learned that the release date is either 1/25 or 1/26.

JBL $71.31 -.69 (-3.56) JBL held up pretty well today
considering the action in the market.  I am sure that the
coverage initiated on JBL by Everen Securities helped.  The
press release did note, however, that in the near-term they
believe that JBL is close to fair value, but in the long term
it should be an outperformer.  The other bit of news that
probably helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for one
stock split.  As we have said on more than one occasion, this
industry tends to move together, but JBL appears to be the
upper crust of a volatile group.

UTX $108.56 2.31 (-6.13) UTX is very Dow sensitive.  Let's
illustrate it.  The Dow is down 2.3% today and UTX was down
2.1%.  It has been that way all week.  The only thing at this
point that would probably change UTX's price movement is a pre-
earnings announcement one way or the other.  UTX announces
earnings next week.  On the news side, we are amazed at the
number of varied businesses of UTX.  For example, today UTX
announced that its Hamilton Standard unit signed a letter of
intent to joint venture with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines to focus
on the maintenance of pneumatic aircraft components.  In the
press release it indicated that it's Hamilton unit also makes
space suits for the NASA shuttle program.  Only play UTX if the
Dow is moving up.

MSFT  $141.75 -$2.06 (-8.13)  Like we said, don't try to
catch a falling knife.  Though, we shrugged off an ugly
beginning to finish over 1 point positive yesterday, today
we gave it back, and then some.  We're still positive on
MSFT given their trial has begun to produce positive news,
like their appeal of the Judge's decision to force MSFT to
use Sun's version of Java in its Windows operating system,
and a new stream of MSFT-friendly witnesses on the stand.
Furthermore, Prudential Securities said analyst Doug Crooke
initiated coverage of Microsoft Corp. with a rating of
accumulate and a price target of $175 a share.  MSFT is
still a split candidate at over $140 and will announce
earnings January 19 after the close.  We realize that
trading options is inherently risky and caution to wait for
a reversal in the stock and the overall market before
starting another play.  If it falls another day, let it
fall.  The point is to catch a good entry on the way up,
not on the way down.

I spoke to Mark yesterday and he is moving as fast as possible - it may be a 
good idea to start with a detailed term sheet  whilst the fuller document is 
in drafting (we will be using external counsel to speed things up).

I looked at your list of products (sent by Kevin) which is a great deal wider 
than those we quote.  I think the best qay to proceed would be with a 
manageable list from which we build as soon as both parties are happy with 
the technology.
I have attached a draft list below (natual gas an power only so far), the 
terms would be dependent of their availability.  When do you plan to 
introduce financial transactions?

Due to the time difference this week - the easiest way of contacting me is 
email.  I would also suggest we think about setting up a meeting for early 
next week to go through the draft.

Regards

Louise

   

Hi Mark,

Thanks for taking time on Friday to participate in our meeting.  I think we
made good progress -- by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to
resolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from my
office forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on
HoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from

Louise,

Sorry I forgot to answer your financials question.  We already have
financial swaps for gas.  Financial electricity we can add very quickly with
someone's design assistance.  We only need minimal help to validate product
specification.  Functionality won't change.

I'm sorry if I was unclear on Europe/Japan.  I agreed that if you give us
your numbers in those markets you would get 10%, but I need to know whether
you are going to do that as part of this deal so I can complete other
liquidity partner discussions accordingly.  It wasn't intended as an open
option.  We can discuss Europe and Japan in the future, I'm just not sure I
can guarantee you 10% at that time.  I've got my Board primed if we do it
right now.  Perhaps we could agree that we will do it and you get your 10%
in each entity now, but that the actual technology link doesn't start until
later this year?

Regards,
Frank

I thought the European/Japan 10% was done ie if we put products we get 10%,
ie an option we could decide on later.

Any idea also on the financial date as our guys do not think we can make
any volume targets without it.  We are working on crude and products.

Also Mark please liaise with Frank on the documentation you require from
him.

Thanks

Louise

Louise,

Thanks for your email.  Your list for power and gas products are fine. I
agree we can add products/markets going forward as appropriate.  We also
discussed posting your numbers for crude and products.  I believe we agreed
crude and products would not be part of any volume targets, but that we
would incorporate those products in the first round.  Please provide me a
list for crude and products based on what we offer on HoustonStreet.  Also,
any thoughts on whether you want to take me up on my offer to include your
numbers in Europe (UK, Germany and Scandanavia) and Japan for an additional
10% equity in each of those markets?  The reason I ask is that we are
engaged in liquidity partner discussions right now and your answer might
affect our decisions.  We are on target to go live in Europe this Summer.

As for corporate docs, we are prepared to deliver whatever you need to see
whenever it is appropriate.  Just let me know when you would like them and
I'll arrange to get them to the appropriate individual at Enron.

Regards,
Frank

Also Frank I think you'll have to provide a lot of the corporation/equity
documentation.

Thanks

Louise

I spoke to Mark yesterday and he is moving as fast as possible - it may be
a good idea to start with a detailed term sheet  whilst the fuller document
is in drafting (we will be using external counsel to speed things up).

I looked at your list of products (sent by Kevin) which is a great deal
wider than those we quote.  I think the best qay to proceed would be with a
manageable list from which we build as soon as both parties are happy with
the technology.
I have attached a draft list below (natual gas an power only so far), the
terms would be dependent of their availability.  When do you plan to
introduce financial transactions?

(See attached file: product list.doc)

Due to the time difference this week - the easiest way of contacting me is
email.  I would also suggest we think about setting up a meeting for early
next week to go through the draft.

Regards

Louise

Hi Mark,

Thanks for taking time on Friday to participate in our meeting.  I think we
made good progress -- by the end of the day, Louise and I were able to
resolve most, if not all, major items.  Late on Friday, Kevin Sluder from
my
office forwarded to Louise by email a list of the proposed markets on
HoustonStreet for which we would look to receive prices electronically from
EnronOnline.  Louise indicated that you would attempt to have a draft
agreement available late in the day on Monday or Tuesday morning.  I wanted
to confirm this timing so I can make sure I have the appropriate
individuals
on my end ready to turn it around.  I think it is in everyone's interest to
try to push this forward this week.

Please let me know if you need any additional information from
HoustonStreet.

Best regards,
Frank Getman
fgetman@houstonstreet.com

Frank - 

There appears to have been a mild snafu with my e-mail address (my fault, not 
yours) and I have just now seen your note from yesterday morning.  I am 
working on the Posting Agreement.  I'm afraid Louise may have thought more 
highly of my abilities to create something like that from whole cloth than I 
deserved but we will try and get that to you soon.  Travis McCullough, our 
corporate lawyer, will get together a term sheet on the equity side of things 
which we should be able to get to you quickly (no later than Thursday if his 
schedule permits).  I'm assuming that your legal team will have to be 
draftsmen of the definitive corporate documents but the term sheet should 
give them a good starting point (and let you confirm that the lawyers on both 
sides are getting it right).

Sorry for the delay and confusion - we'll get these out to you as soon as we 
can.

Mark

Our research has revealed no statements of regulators in Japan in connection
with the marketing or dealing in the above types of  products through the
internet or other electronic systems from publicly available source.  We will
let you know if we find any previous or future statements.

We do not have any specific laws or regulations which would marketing or 
trading
of any of the products set out in question 1 above through the internet.  
Under
Japanese law, formation of any contract does not require any formality.

Japanese law generally does not require any formalities for offers or
acceptances to be valid as such. There is no Statute of Frauds, and parties 
may
make most types of contracts orally. If there is enough evidence establishing
that the offeree agreed to the terms offered, an offeror may rely on it. In 
most
simple sales contracts for consumer goods, for example, it would be easy to
prove that the customer agreed to pay x yen for product Y. The Seller's
electronic records showing that the customer clicked on the icon to buy 
product
Y should be enough in this context.

In more complicated contracts, the structure of the seller's Web pages should 
be
carefully designed. Having no court decisions, we have no definite answer to 
the
question of enforceability of shrink-wrap agreements in Japan. However, the
legal implications of the Web-wrap, the online version of shrink-wrap, may be
somewhat different from shrink-wraps (e.g. licenses for software sold over the
counter).  Under a typical shrink-wrap license in the real world, for example,
the customer cannot break the wrapper until after the customer purchases the
product. However, in an on-line environment, a customer has a choice to click 
on
an Accept-to-Buy icon before the customer purchases the product. Further, 
with a
carefully compiled sequence of screens or pages which would in effect be able 
to
let the customer read the terms and conditions before rushing to click on the
icon, it would be easier to prove that the customer read the terms and
conditions than in a typical shrink-wrap license situation. Unlike shrink-wrap
in the real world, the seller may obtain an electronic record showing that the
customer clicked on the icon. Given these differences, the result possibly may
be more favorable to sellers online than to those using shrink-wrap licenses.

If a transaction entered into via the internet is enforceable under U.S. or 
U.K.
law and the transactions contain a choice of such law, such transactions,
including the choice of law, will be enforceable in Japan.

We do not have any clear cut answer to this since we have no relevant laws,
regulations, or court cases.  So long as  the party maintains the relevant
website with a computer server located outside Japan, the likelihood of 
Japanese
regulatory bodies to consider that the party maintaining such website
established a "physical" establishment/branch in Japan is negligible.

Dear Mark

In Yasuyoshi Goto's view the agreements are well drafted and contain nothing
which is likely to cause a problem in Japan.  On the understanding that server
is to be located outside Japan, we have only the following comments:

Time of Execution

Section 3. (c) of the ELECTRONIC TRADING AGREEMENT provides that "Transaction
shall be deemed executed at the time that Enron first signifies its acceptance
of Counterparty's offer, accessible on the Website server."

We understand that this means a contract will be formed when Enron 
"dispatches"
its acceptance to its Website server so that the acceptance can be seen by the
Counterparty's computer display (if he has not yet disconnected).  In other
words, the contract will be formed at that time even though the Counterparty
does not see Enron's acceptance (due to disconnection, communication error, or
some other reason).  If this is indeed the intention, the language could 
perhaps
be clarified in this regard.  (Since the agreement is governed by New York 
law,
we have no objection to the current language if this is clear under New York
Law.  Perhaps the UCC covers the point?)

Governing Law/Jurisdiction

We see no problem with the governing law and jurisdiction provisions as they
are.

Taxation

Would you please confirm the role if any to be performed by Enron Japan in
relation to this business, so that we can ensure that Enron Japan will not be
seen as a dependent agent (and therefore permanent establishment) of Enron 
North
America Corp.

6:55 p.m. and arrives London, Jan. 25th at 9:55 a.m..  MEH will be at the 
Savoy and plans to return Jan. 29th on the 9:40 a.m. flight.

David Samuels and Rahil Jafrey have come up with an idea for an incentive to 
get people to use EnronOnline.  They want to set up a sports fantasy league 
system on the website allowing users to accumulate points and then awarding 
prizes to the winners.  The first proposal relates to European football (I 
think) and they would like to meet to discuss the idea at 10:00 a.m. Houston

Mark -

You might consider treating the choice of law and submission to jurisdiction 
as two separate issues.  For example, if BC law is not objectionable, we 
could choose that law to apply but not consent to the jurisdiction of any 
particular court.  The most likely outcome (at least in many US states) would 
be that we would end up in a BC court if we had to sue them but unless we 
have significant contacts with BC (e.g. an office there) they would have to 
sue us in Alberta.

Enron Canada Corp. ("Enron Canada") is in the process of negotiating a Master 
Firm Gas Purchase/Sale Agreement (the "Master") with BC Gas Utility Ltd. ("BC 
Gas").  In this regard, we have recently received a request from BC Gas to 
amend the "applicable law" of the Master from Alberta to British Columbia 
such that subsection 17.12 of the Master would read as follows:

"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed, enforced, and performed 
in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia, without 
regard to principles of conflicts of law, and each Party hereby submits to 
the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of British Columbia."  

BC Gas has also asked that the applicable law for the guarantee of Enron 
Corp. be governed by the laws of British Columbia.

While I am fairly sure that we will be able to persuade BC Gas to accept the 
State of Texas as the appropriate law for the Enron Corp. guarantee, it seems 
unlikely (because the counterparty is a British Columbia utility that 
operates primarily in British Columbia) that BC Gas will accept any 
jurisdiction other than British Columbia with respect to the Master.

Although I have not been called to the bar in British Columbia and there may 
be some quirks and minor differences between the jurisdictions, it is my 
understanding that the commercial law of British Columbia is generally not 
much different from that of Alberta.  Nevertheless, I am seeking your 
comments and consent to such an amendment to the Master.

Should you have any questions or require additional information, please give 
me a call at (403) 974-6708.  Thank you for your assistance with this matter.

Yours truly,

Mark Powell

Yes, I spoke to her earlier this week.

Sorry I didn't get back to you in response to your voice-mail.  I was hoping 
I could talk to Carol and Sara to see if anyone remembers why we incorporate 
the Credit Support Documents by reference.

Regarding the cross-default, we usually do not expand the definition since we 
don't want to bring in other derivatives transactions - of course that was 
before we started doing derivatives under various master agreements with the 
same entities.  It may be time to revisit this one.

	Paul Simons

As mentioned at our trading meeting on Tuesday, we are putting together a 
tailored ISDA schedule for our banking counterparties with which we propose 
to trade credit transactions.

One issue we have revisited is whether the definition of Specified 
Indebtedness (which ties into the cross default provisions) should be 
expanded to cover derivatives transactions as well as the more conventional 
bank borrowings.  

We think there are arguments both ways on this, but wonder whether we have a 
"house view".  Since the definition is not expanded in our standard ISDA 
schedule, we assume that our preferred position is to exclude derivatives 
transactions from the cross default provisions of the ISDA.

Perhaps we can discuss this when you have a spare moment! Thanks

Kind regards.

This looks fine to me.  The tax section of the draft was a holdover from the 
initial survey done in Europe last year.  In this case, I assume that Lynn is 
taking care of the tax issues and may be using different counsel for tax 
issues.  In Brazil the entire tax section of the memo was deleted before it 
was sent to counsel.

The language in the Schedule should reflect what is in our Form#3, whereby 
"Enron Re:" is the U.S. entity and "Swiss RE - EFR" is a Barbados entity.  
Also, the tax form requested should be a W-8.

In addition, the following language should be added to the confirmation:

United States Federal Income Tax Characterization and Reporting.  The parties 
recognize and intend that, for United States federal income tax purposes, any 
payment by the Counterparty of the Floating Amount will be treated as a

The process for approving these involves sending the names to the General 
Counsels of the various operating companies here in Houston.  Several of them 
then send the lists to the senior business people in their organizations.  
Unless there is a real urgency, I would suggest that we send the list all at 
once instead of piecemeal.  What do you think?

Thanks for your note.  In reply:

1.  We will change United Kingdom to England in the governing law section.

2.  and 3.  We did switch to the English law form and our form didn't provide 
for using securities as collateral.  As you point out, it is likely that SR 
will always be in the money and the CSA provides for an unlimited Threshold 
for SR at all times so that it will never be providing collateral under that 
document.   There are certainly other changes that could be made to the 
document with that in mind but in the interest of time we didn't make much of 
an effort on that score - our theory was that you wouldn't mind too much 
since you would never have to post anything under this document.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or comments.

I looked at the EFR-ENA Schedule in connection with Gordon Boozer's
comments.  I see no problems except:

1.  The document is expressed to be governed by the law of the"United
Kingdom."   I have never seen this formulation and think it should say
"England," as I believe there are in fact multiple legal systems (e.g.,
Scottish) within the U.K.

2.  I am not sure why all collateral except LCs was deleted.  Was this
agreed by EFR?  If so, OK.  If not, could the CSA provide for other
collateral as Gordon requested.  It is unusual for SR entities to use LCs
in non-reinsurance situations and would probably cost them less to post
Treasuries.  Here it is of course unlikely that EFR will have to post
anything, since EFR will always be in the money to some extent.

3. Did you switch to the English law form of CSA?

now that we are officially behind a chinese wall can this process be 
reevaluated?  I think that it will be increasingly difficult to scale at the 
pace we need to over the coming months if we can not design an automated 
process.  Are we trying to avoid actually misusing confidential information 
or the perception of misusing the information?  our intent is to begin to 
scale on a massive level from now until we have reached over a million

One day, while walking down the street, a highly successful lawyer was 
tragically hit by a bus and killed. His soul arrived up in Heaven, where he 
was met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter himself.

"Welcome to Heaven," said St. Peter. "Before you get settled in, though, it 
seems we have a problem. You see,  we've never once had a lawyer  make it 
this far and we're not really sure what to do with you."

"No problem-just let me in," said the lawyer
 
"Well, I'd like to, but I have higher orders. What we're going to do is let 
you have a day in Hell and a day in Heaven, and then you can choose whichever 
one you want to spend an eternity in."  

"Actually, I think I've made up my mind...I prefer  to stay in Heaven," said 
the lawyer 

 "Sorry, we have rules," said St. Peter, and with that, he put the lawyer in 
an elevator  and it went  down-down-down to Hell.

The doors opened and the lawyer found himself stepping out onto the putting 
green on a beautiful golf course. In the distance was a country club, and 
standing in front of him were all of his friends and fellow lawyers with whom 
he had worked. They were all dressed in black tie and evening gowns and 
cheering for him. They ran up and kissed him on both cheeks and they talked 
about  old times. They played an excellent round of golf, and that night went 
to the country club where he enjoyed an excellent steak and lobster dinner.

The lawyer even got to meet the Devil, who was actually a woman and very good 
looking.  He had a great time telling jokes and dancing.  In fact, the lawyer 
was having such a good time, that before he knew it, it was time to leave.

 Everybody shook his hand, thanked him for coming  and waved goodbye as he 
got on the elevator.

 The elevator went up-up-up and opened back at the Pearly Gates, where he 
found St. Peter waiting for him. "Now it's time to spend a day in Heaven," he 
said.

 So the lawyer spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds and playing 
the harp and singing. He had a great time, and before he knew it, his  24 
hours were up. St. Peter came and got him.

 "So, you've spent a day in Hell and you've spent a day in Heaven. Now you  
must choose your eternity," he said.  The lawyer  paused for a second, and 
then replied, "Well, I never thought I'd say this. I mean, Heaven has been 
really great and all, but I think I had a better time in Hell."  So St. Peter 
escorted him to the elevator and again he went down-down-down, back to Hell.  

 When the doors of the elevator opened, the lawyer found himself standing in 
a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. He saw his friends and 
fellow lawyers were dressed in rags and were picking up the garbage and 
putting it in sacks.

The Devil appeared before the lawyer.  She now had horns sticking out of her 
head, fire spit out her ears and nose  and she had a very evil laugh

The lawyer stammered:   "I don't understand.  Yesterday, I was here and  
there was a golf course and a country club and we ate lobster and danced and 
had a great time. Now all there is a wasteland of garbage and all of my 
friends and fellow lawyers look overworked and miserable." 

The Devil looked at the lawyer and smiled.

 "Yesterday we were recruiting you; today you're ours."

Dale Neuner   05/25/2000 11:02 AM

I brought this issue up to David Forster AGAIN, and again he suggests that if 
we are going to change the Product Description that we call it US Gas Swap - 
so a Product on the website would read, for example:

US Gas Swap   IF CNG SP               Jun00           USD/MM

We really don't want to change the name to Fixed/Float because the US Gas 
Daily products are ALSO Fixed 
Float trades, and we are afraid we would be misleading. 

Please talk about this and if this suggestion is acceptable we will make the 
changes. Also please remember that this
change requires manual intervention, so each month when you roll the product 
over you will need to let us know to 
make the change when you call to have the product activated. We also won't be 
able to use Tokenized Reference 
Periods on these Products.

There is a meeting on my calendar for Friday morning to discuss Phase 2 
content issues with people from the Research Group - not sure if this is the 
same issue or not.

	Bob Shults
	05/31/2000 08:23 PM
		 
The launch of Phase 2 of EnronOnline will include significant enhancements 
and additions to the EnronOnline web site.  One of the attributes of the 
Phase 2 launch is the development of individual Commodity/Country Home 
Pages.  The objective of the individual home pages is to allow each commodity 
group create its own web site (within EnronOnline) and to deliver a more 
personalized experience for the customers.  A significant aspect of the home 
pages is the addition of content which will be developed at a desk and or 
company level.  The content which we are adding will be much more dynamic and 
require constant changes.

In this light we will need to develop an approval process which protects 
Enron however does not completely impede our effort to provide current 
interesting content on the web site.  In addition we will need to make sure 
that we include the neccessary disclaimers to avoid other issues.

To date we have started to accumulate a significant amount of content 
(written, audio, PowerPoints and video) which is scheduled to be included in 
the Phase 2 launch.  We will need to sign off on this content within the next 
couple of weeks.

I have asked Lorraine Becker by copy of this note to arrange a meeting to 
develop a process of content approval.

Susan - Please send this guy a sample form of each of the Omnibus, Industrial 
and ISDA (both printed form and schedule).

Hello my Esteemed Doctors,

I am in Rodney Malcolm's Commercial Transaction Group focusing on selling 
energy outsourcing relationships to industrial consumers. 
Based on the list of executed master agreements that was provided to us 
recently, many of our targeted industrial customers have not signed our 
master swap agreement. 

In preparation for our transacting with these customers, would you send me as 
soon as possible a copy of our Master Swap Agreement language, a copy of the 
more intermediate "Omnibus" Short form Swap agreement, and a copy of the one 
or two page confirmation agreement.  I will forward to my group so that they 
can become more familiar with the language, and I will also accumulate the 
industrial customers that we are closest to closing deals.  I will then 
forward the names of those customers to you so that we can get these 
documents to the customers in advance of the deals.

If you have any questions or comments, please call me at x35583.  Thank you, 
Tim

We have a separate group in legal that puts these together.  Ed and I are not 
involved in the preparation or negotiation of swap agreements.  The group  in 
legal that works on them is led by Mark Taylor (x37459).  Others in the group 
are Carol St. Clair (x33989), Sara Shackleton (x35620) and Shari Stack 
(x39477).  I suggest that you contact any one of those people.  If I can 
assist, please let me know.

Hello Bob and Ed.

What is the most efficient way for us to get Master Swap Agreements in place 
with our industrial consumers.  With the commodity energy market going 
through the roof, many of the industrials are asking us to concentrate on 
solving their short term commodity exposure and look to establish a  greater 
outsourcing opportunity in the future.  We do not seem to have Master Swap 
Agreements in place with industrials such as IMC Global, AK Steel, WR Grace, 
and our solutions will involve financial swaps.

Thank you. Tim

Jason - would you take a quick look at this - I think Legal in London will be 
negotiating it so you don't have to be particularly thorough - but I thought 
you might have some insights given your recent experience with our other 
content agreements.

 - Enron Co-B agreement 2.06.2000.doc

I agree with you 100%.  I hope that Mike can make it clear to John that it is 
never appropriate to criticize another department - whether Legal or anyone 
else - in such a public manner.  If he feels there is a problem that should 
be corrected, he should proceed through proper channels.  In this case, a 
direct one-on-one conversation with Andrea strikes me as the most obvious 
route and if that is not possible, not productive or just too awkward, he 
should have approached either you or Mike.  Sending out an e-mail that might 
be considered personally critical of Andrea in such a public way is clearly 
contrary to our core value of Respect.  I hope you are able to have some 
input into the review process for John and this should certainly be 
mentioned.  If you need my help in any way, please let me know.

Let's get right to the point.

I am looking for positive motivated people that
want and need to increase their income by 10k per month.

Do you have a burning desire to change the quality
of your existing life?

Would you like to live the life that others only dream about?

If you think this is too good to be true or are skeptical
then this may not be for you... Many have been conditioned
to believe it must be illegal, immoral or unethical to ever
earn any real profits from their efforts.

The fact is we have many people in our enterprise who earn
over 50k per month from the privacy of their own home and
are retiring in 2-3 years obviously wealthy and having total
freedom both personal and financial.

How would you like to:
1. Drastically reduce personal, business and capitol gains taxes?
2. Protect all assets from any form of seizure, liens, or judgments?
3. Create a six figure income every 4 months?
How about:
1. Restoring and preserving complete personal and financial privacy?
2. Create and amass personal wealth, multiply it and protect it?
3. Realize a 3 to 6 times greater returns on your money?
4. Legally make yourself and your assets completely judgment-proof,
seizure-proof, lien-proof, divorce-proof, attorney-proof, IRS-proof,
and become completely insulated?

Are you a BIG thinker, BIG dreamer and a person that believes they
deserve to have the best in life?

Are you capable of recognizing that once in a lifetime opportunity
when it's looking right at you?

Countless others have missed their shot at the title only to look back
years later and wished they should've because they could've.

If you are serious about changing your life...

Mark, I am forwarding a copy of OUC's ISDA along with a copy of their charter 
and their outside legal opinion on their ability to enter into financial 
hedges.  Could you please assign to the appropriate attorney to work on this 
ISDA.

John, I'm not sure if you are the approprite credit person or not to work on 
this. They mentioned that they have already exchanged credit information 
between OUC and Enron.  If you're not the right person, could you please pass 
it on.

I would like to push this process along to get an executed ISDA between OUC 
and Enron.  I believe that they could be a good counterparty for us.

Thanks for your help.

Louise:

The S & C first draft of the Posting Agreement was fine as far as it went, 
but it was only a first draft and needs a rework before the meeting to make 
the best use of your time.  Mark and I plan to redraft it and recirculate it 
in the next couple of days -- I wouldnb't recommend you look at the current 
draft, because it doesn't really say anything other than what is already in 
the True Quote term sheet.

Do you need a lawyer with you in New York when you meet with S & C?

Mark,

I have researched and provided Brent with information regarding the two 
"Enron standard" laptops that are now being utilized.  We have decided on the 
Compaq M700 which has a little bigger keyboard (better for  a man's hands)  
and weighs a little less than the M300 model.  Please approve this order by 
forwarding this message to Janette Elbertson.  Thank you!  

Janette:

Please order a Compaq M700 Laptop for Brent Hendry.  Charge it to Mark 
Taylor's group (Co. 413 / Rc. 1157).  Brent will be here officially the first 
week of July but will be "in and out" of the office the last week of June.  
If we could have his computer up and running by June 23rd that should cover 
it.  Let me know if you need any additional information.

Thanks to both of you!

If you didn't believe us before, I'm sure it is by now painfully clear that 
negotiating master swap agreements is a very lengthy process.  My impression 
is that the commercial team in Portland is anxious to begin trading 
financially.  If this is correct, it would be possible, at least from a legal 
point of view, to begin trading now under the existing documents.  In each 
case where a master agreement is already in place, trades entered into before 
the amendments we want will certainly be binding on both parties.  Our only 
issues with trading under these agreements are where we need more restrictive 
credit provisions and that resumption of trading before an amendment is 
signed reduces to some extent our negotiating leverage.  As to the credit 
issue, only the credit group can decide whether or not to permit trading 
under the existing terms.  As for the negotiating leverage, if the commercial 
people want to resume trading immediately, my suggestion would be to let them 
go ahead.  If it turns out that additional leverage is needed, we can always 
stop trading.

Where no master swap agreement exists, we have documentation available to 
enable trading on a limited basis until the master is signed.  The so-called 
"omnibus" confirmation will work for any normal commodity derivative 
transaction and can be customized to include necessary credit provisions - 
even where multiple trades exist with the same counterparty.

Tana has unsuccessfully tried to get you access to our Lotus Notes database 
so you could determine the status of any negotiation on an up-to-the-minute 
basis.  She will be sending a monthly report of our progress until you get 
the necessary software to access the database.  Of course, if any issues come 
up in the meantime, please continue to feel free to call.

Mark,

I was thinking that it might be helpful for us to take Series 7 exam here in 
the US like our counterparts are taking SFA exam in UK. I did some initial 
research and found that our "compliance" group has to open an account with 
NASD (National Association of Security Dealers) in order to take the exam.

I don't know whether we already have sunch an arrangement in US with NASD for 
our other groups. If we do, could you guide me to talk to the appropriate 
person. If we don't than please let me know and we will decide, whether it is 
worth pursuing further.

Thanks and regards
Moazzam

Dan, here's our first ever market commentary.  I gather the information will 
be very stale by the time eol v2 is up and running and that this will serve 
primarily as a place holder in our web page.
From our perspective, we'd much prefer to have indenpendent "neutral" sources 
(such as Platts, ICIS, CMAI ....) do the analysis, or at least do a feed.  
The reason is (a) we'll never be construed as neutral and (b) we're so thin 
that the traders themselves are the only ones who can put this together.

Thanks,
Alan

TLAB - Tellabs $85.94 (+11.63)(P3W $10.18)

Tellabs is quickly becoming a powerhouse in the Telecom
equipment industry. With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems,
and its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from
customers among the telephone companies, cable operators,
and government agencies.  Though they faded from news of
their failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major
player.

Wow!  What a play.  TLAB gave up only $0.44 in Thursday's
turmoil and came smokin' back $5.25 on Friday to close at
$85.94.  Technicals look outstanding with a small
consolidation already taken place; all indicators in
positive territory.  We introduced the play Thursday under
the following logic: TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78
on 11 million shares, $8 higher than resistance previously
set at $70.  TLAB drifted back to $74, then spiked $5 to
$79, on average volume of 3.5 million.  Over the previous 3
trading days, it gained in market weakness while giving
back only $.44 in heavy trading in a downright bearish
market - a terrific sign of strength.  3.5 million shares
traded daily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share
in cash; 34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.  We
expect them to announce more contracts in the coming weeks.
Recent news is capturing investors' eyeballs, making for a
good story.  We could find no news on Friday driving the
price; just market recovery and stock momentum.

Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised their rating to a
"buy" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35
and $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000,
respectively.  They further state, "fundamentals for the
telecom equipment group has improved over the past few
months which improves visibility for Tellabs" and "Our
checks with Tellabs will report fourth quarter 1998 results
slightly better than our $0.58 earnings per share estimate,
as well as having a positive outlook for 1999" (Reuters).
Also, rumors surfaced last week that TLAB was a targeted
buyout/merger candidate, but were quickly squashed.  Not
soon enough, though, to draw investor attention to the
price move.

QCOM - Qualcomm, Inc. $63.88 (+3.63)

QCOM develops, manufactures, markets, licenses, and operates
advanced communications systems and products based on digital
wireless technology. The Company's primary product areas are
the OmniTRACS system (a geostationary satellite-based,
mobile communications system providing two-way data and
position reporting services), CDMA wireless communications
systems and products and, in conjunction with others, the
development of the Globalstar low-earth-orbit (LEO)
satellite communications system.  The company's CDMA technology
has become the dominant wireless transmission standard in the
US and Korea, and is gaining momentum in a host of other
countries.  Demand for CDMA phones is surging as the US
wireless industry is migrating from analog to digital.

In the news last week, QCOM, along with several other
companies, purchased a concession to operate a fixed line
telephone service in Brazil.  QCOM has indicated, in the past,
that it is lobbying China to adopt its CDMA technology.  Since
1990, the average annual growth rate of mobile phone users in
China has been about 160%, according to government figures.
QCOM is building a global presence.  It was also reported on
CNBC on Friday that there is renewed interest in QCOM as a
takeover candidate given the recent acquisition of ATI and the
LU/ASND merger.  If fact, the entire sector is expecting
another round of takeovers given the competitive landscape.

QCOM has been in a basing pattern since last November.  It
actually fell below its 200 day moving average in December, and
then started its current run around the beginning of the year.
QCOM reports earnings on Tuesday just before the close.  As
you know we don't recommend holding over earnings releases, but
QCOM might make an interesting short term trade before the
earnings release.  Depending on the earnings release on
Tuesday, we also like QCOM as a play after the release given
the merger activity in the sector.  After the earnings release,
wait for a direction before initiating a play.

NOK.A  Nokia  $138.59 (+$3.59)

Nokia is a supplier of telecommunications systems and
equipment and is the world's leading maker of cellular
phones. It's telecommunications and mobile phone sales are
growing rapidly, and margins are higher as well. Nokia is
increasing plant capacity to keep up with demand.

We covered Nokia from Dec. 13th until Jan. 10th as both a
split candidate and a momentum play. It climbed steadily
for us into the first week of January, when the stock got
ahead of itself. It had risen a little too quickly due to
enthusiasm for the new Euro and to excitement over the ATI
bids. When it began pulling back from its $142.25 close on
Jan.6th, we feared a correction and became reluctant to
recommend new positions, so we dropped it. With yesterday's
$6.34 rebound, the correction appears to be over, and the
stock remains well above its moving averages, so we are
adding it back to our recommended plays. When NOKA
announced a split in Feb. 1998, a long and steep split run
followed. We have been unable to confirm the expected
earnings release date for this foreign owned stock, but we
will keep you posted, as that is a likely time for a new
split announcement.

Since we dropped it, Nokia has entered the pre-paid mobile
phone market in an agreement with Topp Telecom, Inc., of
Miami. Other recent news on this stock can still be found
in previous newsletters posted on the O.I. website. When
researching NOK.A, be aware that some sites require the dot
and some won't allow it.

Software - Sector
*******************************************
MSFT - Microsoft $149.75 (-0.13)(+11.19)(-3.06)(P5W +28.13)

From their own words, "Microsoft Rules." Although it's
current reign is being rocked with revolution, the Evil M-
pire (as some programmers and anti-Internet Explorer
browser patriots call it), has been fighting the Federal
government on anti-trust grounds for months. The line to
take their turn and bad mouth the bully was long and
distinguished. The fact is, MSFT is good at what they do.
They are the world's #1 software company (Y2K compliant or
not!) and their operating systems dominate the PC
landscape.

Extremely volatile, but almost no change from the previous
week.  Price range last week was $136 to $150 on above
average volume for 4 of 5 trading days.  Friday gave us an
$8 gain following the Brazilian downdraft.  CS First Boston
said Microsoft "appears on track" to meet or beat estimate
of 60 cents per share - an increase of 46 percent from the
42 cents in the same quarter last year.  Sales are expected
to increase 21 percent to $4.3 billion.  With conviction,
we still predict a stock split with the earnings
announcement after the close January 19th (MSFT confirmed
this date); only 1 trading day away.  Historically, MSFT
has split like clockwork at $140.  MSFT has expressed
optimism about their future and has every reason to split
the stock.  MSFT is trading just $3 off its all-time high
of $152.50, set the previous week.  Prudential last week
set a price target of $175.  We think their relative price
compared to the market reflects strong investor confidence.
A great play in the making.

Unsavory news release late Thursday: A federal judge
scolded Microsoft Corp. over new contract language
requiring temporary workers to waive any awards from a
pending lawsuit over the software giant's employment
practices (Reuters).  It had no affect on the stock, but
raised eyebrows in the PR department.  Conversely, a new
Microsoft poll shows that 76 percent of American consumers
believe that Microsoft has benefited both U.S. consumers
and the computer software industry (Reuters).  The real
surprise was another press release stating Robert Bork
believes Microsoft should be broken into 3 companies; an
unusual comment from a free market champion, until you
realize he's paid by Netscape to represent them in the
Justice Departments case.  Finally, MSFT appealed the Sun-
Java infringement injunction citing that it believes the
court mistakenly treated the case filed against it by Sun
as a copyright issue, rather than a contract dispute.  We
reiterate, "no material effect on earnings".  Everen
Securities still has their price targets(0-6 months) of
$161 and their long term (6-18 months) of $200

CHKPF  Check Point Software $51.25 (+4.37)(+1.07)

Network break-ins get doused with Check Point Software
Technologies' firewall products -- software that protects
corporate networks from unauthorized access, from both
inside and outside the company. FireWall-1 authenticates
remote users, controls access, and blocks viruses and other
undesirable Web content. Its FloodGate-1 clears up traffic
congestion on crowded Internet and intranet links by
allocating available space to company-defined uses. Check
Point's largest customer is Sun Microsystems' SunSoft, which
accounts for about 20% of sales. Check Point operates
subsidiaries in Europe, North America, and the Pacific Rim.

CHKPF is a company that benefits from the explosion in the
Internet.  As companies increase their use of the web, CHKPF's
services will be needed more and more.  CHKPF has an incredible
record of earning surprises.  Next earnings are scheduled for
January 21st.  Holding over earnings is a risky proposition, but
for those risk takers out there, it might pay off.  There is a
possibility that CHKPF might announce a stock split.  They have
plenty of shares, but have never announced a split in the past.
MACD is positive and CHKPF price is above all moving averages.
Between Tuesday and earnings after the close on Thursday, CHKPF
could have a nice run.

CHKPF, along with other networking security companies, will be
holding a seminar in February. This seminar will outline the
future of the business and the strategies these companies use
and how they can help other companies with their information
security. CHKPF has a consensus growth rate of 37.55%. Watch
for a pullback and hang on for the ride.

*******************************************
PRIA  PRI Automation, INC. $34.50 (+4.87)

PRIA designs, develops, manufactures, and markets factory
automation systems for the cleanroom manufacturing
operations of semi-conductor makers and OEM equipment
suppliers. Last year's $178.2 million in revenues reflect
the big downturn in the semi-conductor industry, but that
is changing. The 1998 glut of chips has been depleted, and
demand is strong again for these products.

After hitting a high of $37.50 in Feb. 1998, PRIA stock had
lost about 75% of its value by the time the market bottomed
in October. However, it has been climbing fairly steadily
ever since, except for a brief correction in December. With
the chip industry recovering, it follows that a company
such as PRIA will benefit. On January 12th, CIBC Oppenheimer
upgraded PRIA to strong buy from buy. This as a momentum
play in an improving industry.  Earnings due out Jan. 28th.

MU  Micron Technology  $71.31 (+7.68)

Micron makes semi-conductor memory products, PCs, circuit
boards, memory modules, and system level assemblies, and
has a market cap. of $17.6 billion.  Revenues for MU=20
declined last year due to lower selling prices of PCs and
semi-conductor products. This was a result of too much
product industry wide and too little demand, but the
company is recovering now, as demand increases.

With the industry gaining steam, market expectations for
Micron's earnings were high in December, and the stock
pulled back when MU did not beat analysts' earnings by a
wide enough margin. However, MU has lately begun climbing
again and gathering momentum. Even in this past week's down
market, the stock looked fairly strong. Chip prices climbed
6% last week as Koreans permanently slashed production and
may actually swing the market from an overproduction last
year to a scarcity in the coming year. The wild card in the
future supply is Taiwan. Already, though, chip prices,
which were $200 a year ago, and fell below $60 in May, have
climbed to near $90. At the same time, sales for PCs and
the chips that go in them are showing strong increases, and
that will eventually show up in MU's bottom line. This is a
momentum play.

CBS Marketwatch screened stocks for 20 different
characteristics and MU turned out in the top group. The
five best characteristics: 1)Strong recent earnings/revenue
growth, 2)Selling at a discount to its growth,
3)Consistently beats analysts expectations, 4)Earnings
estimates continually revised upwards, 5)Short- and long-
term relative strength.

JBL - Jabil Circuit, Inc. $73.88 (-1.00)(+.38)(+2.94)(+3.06)

JBL is the third-largest US manufacturer of circuit board
systems, trailing SCI Systems and Solectron. The company's
products are used in PCs, printers, network hardware, cellular
phones, and cars. JBL's major customers include Hewlett
Packard, 3Com, and Cisco Systems with more than half of its
revenues coming from telecommunications companies.  JBL's
customers use contract manufacturers, like JBL, to save money
and improve production times.  JBL has manufacturing facilities
in Malaysia, Mexico, the UK, and the US.  Insiders own
approximately 41% of the company.

In the news last week, Everen Securities initiated coverage on
JBL with an intermediate term market perform and a long term
outperform.  The press release did note, that in the near-term
they believe that JBL is close to fair value, but in the long
term it should be an outperformer.  The other bit of news that
helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for one
stock split.  As we have said on more than one occasion, this
industry tends to move together.

Last week, JBL bounced off of its 21 day moving average and
closed right at its 10 day moving average on Friday.  There
also appears to be some support for JBL around $71.  JBL
has been on extended run since last September, and given the
way the sector goes in and out of favor with the Street, you
should keep a close eye on JBL if you are playing it.  If JBL
were to break below $71, in a significant way, we would be very
cautious of the stock.  Also, as with any sector, but more so
with this one, you have to keep an eye on the sector when
playing JBL.

LXK  Lexmark Intl. $98.06 (-2.50)(+.06)(+7.25)(+1.31)

Lexmark has good peripheral vision. Lexmark International
Group is a leading maker of computer printers and related
products, which generate more than 80% of its sales. Its
printer line includes laser printers (designed primarily
for corporate networks and desktops) and ink-jet printers
(for home and business use). Unlike many of its competitors,
Lexmark develops and manufactures it's own printers, which
results in fast product cycle times. The company also makes
supplies for IBM and other name brand printers and typewriters.
Lexmark's products are sold in more than 15,000 retail outlets
in more than 150 countries.

LXK consolidated this last week and is sitting right on its
20-dma. We still like LXK with earnings on the 26th of January.
Remember, holding over earnings is risky. In the case of LXK,
the risk might be justified if they announce a stock split.
Each individual has to weigh out the risk themselves.

LXK hasn't had any news the last few days. These last few
weeks have seen LXK get recommended by many different
professionals as a great stock to own for 1999. Remember,
LXK has had an average earnings surprise of 11.75% over the
last four quarters. This could help propel LXK higher before
earnings on the expectation. There are different earnings dates
listed on the web, but First Call does list the 26th of January.
We will continue to try to get a fixed date from investor
relations.

EMC - EMC Corporation $100.06 (+6.50)(+8.56)(+3.38)(+.13)

EMC is a Fortune 500 company that designs, manufactures,
markets an supports high performance storage products.  The
company's products store retrieve, manage, protect and share
information from all major computing environments, including
UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe platforms.  EMC markets its
memory products under the name Symmetrix.  EMC and its
enterprise storage systems have developed a clear cut
technological edge over its competition.  The company has been
able to successfully leverage its leadership position in the
mainframe storage area into the lucrative, faster growing open
systems market.

There really wasn't any news last week on EMC.  We think the
real story happened on Thursday, when the NASDAQ was down and
EMC went up.  This suggests that there are still a lot of
buyers who want EMC stock.  This was confirmed by the move EMC
made on Friday.  We continue to read  articles that discuss EMC
being in model portfolios of 20 to 30 growth stocks.  There was
an article in MSN MoneyCentral about EMC being one of the top
30 growth stocks.  EMC has been, and is continuing to be, a
great momentum stock.

EMC took off again on Friday.  It set a new 52 week high on
Friday, and closed near the high.  As we discussed above, EMC
is one of those stocks that people keep buying.  As long as
there are buyers of the stock, we believe it will continue with
it's momentum.  EMC is also a split candidate.  We know we keep
saying this, but as it continues to move up, it only increases
the probability of a split.  A year ago this last November EMC
split at around $63 after a strong move.  FYI - EMC reports
earnings before the open on 1/26.

XIRC  Xircom Inc. $39.88 (+1.38)(+4.50)(+1.25)

Xircom makes adapters that connect portable PCs to corporate
networks, the Internet, and commercial online services. The
company's products include adapter/modem cards (CreditCard
Ethernet+Modem), network adapters for portable PCs (Pocket
Ethernet Adapter, Pocket Token Ring Adapter), and modem-only
PC cards (CreditCard Modem). Xircom sells its products to
original equipment manufacturers and through a worldwide
network of distributors, value-added resellers, and computer
retailers. Over half of its income is from foreign sales.
Intel owns 11% of Xircom; chairman and CEO Dirk Gates owns
about 5%.

XIRC is expecting to announce earnings that are 300% higher
than the same quarter last year.  With the large earning
surprises XIRC has had the last four quarter, a nice run
could develop into earnings. Though a split isn't likely,
the company has enough shares to announced one. There is
no split history for XIRC.  XIRC reached a new 52-week high
on Friday when it hit $40.50.

XIRC was recently selected as one of the best mobile PC cards.
Its product will be competing with 3COM and a few others for
the best mobile PC card.  This award ceremony is put on the
Mobility Awards. 3COM is one of the biggest competitors of XIRC.

TLAB - Tellabs $85.94 (+11.63)(P3W $10.18)

Tellabs is quickly becoming a powerhouse in the Telecom
equipment industry. With their TITAN and CABLESPAN systems,
and its DXX multiplexers, TLAB is raking in the money from
customers among the telephone companies, cable operators,
and government agencies.  Though they faded from news of
their failed merger of Ciena, Tellabs is still a major
player.

Wow!  What a play.  TLAB gave up only $0.44 in Thursday's
turmoil and came smokin' back $5.25 on Friday to close at
$85.94.  Technicals look outstanding with a small
consolidation already taken place; all indicators in
positive territory.  We introduced the play Thursday under
the following logic: TLAB spiked up $13 last Tuesday to $78
on 11 million shares, $8 higher than resistance previously
set at $70.  TLAB drifted back to $74, then spiked $5 to
$79, on average volume of 3.5 million.  Over the previous 3
trading days, it gained in market weakness while giving
back only $.44 in heavy trading in a downright bearish
market - a terrific sign of strength.  3.5 million shares
traded daily; 147 million shares in float; $3.14 per share
in cash; 34% return on equitystrong fundamentals.  We
expect them to announce more contracts in the coming weeks.
Recent news is capturing investors' eyeballs, making for a
good story.  We could find no news on Friday driving the
price; just market recovery and stock momentum.

Monday, Warburg, Dillion Read raised their rating to a
"buy" citing raised earnings per share estimates to $2.35
and $2.93 from $2.30 and $2.85 for 1999 and 2000,
respectively.  They further state, "fundamentals for the
telecom equipment group has improved over the past few
months which improves visibility for Tellabs" and "Our
checks with Tellabs will report fourth quarter 1998 results
slightly better than our $0.58 earnings per share estimate,
as well as having a positive outlook for 1999" (Reuters).
Also, rumors surfaced last week that TLAB was a targeted
buyout/merger candidate, but were quickly squashed.  Not
soon enough, though, to draw investor attention to the
price move.

QCOM - Qualcomm, Inc. $63.88 (+3.63)

QCOM develops, manufactures, markets, licenses, and operates
advanced communications systems and products based on digital
wireless technology. The Company's primary product areas are
the OmniTRACS system (a geostationary satellite-based,
mobile communications system providing two-way data and
position reporting services), CDMA wireless communications
systems and products and, in conjunction with others, the
development of the Globalstar low-earth-orbit (LEO)
satellite communications system.  The company's CDMA technology
has become the dominant wireless transmission standard in the
US and Korea, and is gaining momentum in a host of other
countries.  Demand for CDMA phones is surging as the US
wireless industry is migrating from analog to digital.

In the news last week, QCOM, along with several other
companies, purchased a concession to operate a fixed line
telephone service in Brazil.  QCOM has indicated, in the past,
that it is lobbying China to adopt its CDMA technology.  Since
1990, the average annual growth rate of mobile phone users in
China has been about 160%, according to government figures.
QCOM is building a global presence.  It was also reported on
CNBC on Friday that there is renewed interest in QCOM as a
takeover candidate given the recent acquisition of ATI and the
LU/ASND merger.  If fact, the entire sector is expecting
another round of takeovers given the competitive landscape.

QCOM has been in a basing pattern since last November.  It
actually fell below its 200 day moving average in December, and
then started its current run around the beginning of the year.
QCOM reports earnings on Tuesday just before the close.  As
you know we don't recommend holding over earnings releases, but
QCOM might make an interesting short term trade before the
earnings release.  Depending on the earnings release on
Tuesday, we also like QCOM as a play after the release given
the merger activity in the sector.  After the earnings release,
wait for a direction before initiating a play.

NOK.A  Nokia  $138.59 (+$3.59)

Nokia is a supplier of telecommunications systems and
equipment and is the world's leading maker of cellular
phones. It's telecommunications and mobile phone sales are
growing rapidly, and margins are higher as well. Nokia is
increasing plant capacity to keep up with demand.

We covered Nokia from Dec. 13th until Jan. 10th as both a
split candidate and a momentum play. It climbed steadily
for us into the first week of January, when the stock got
ahead of itself. It had risen a little too quickly due to
enthusiasm for the new Euro and to excitement over the ATI
bids. When it began pulling back from its $142.25 close on
Jan.6th, we feared a correction and became reluctant to
recommend new positions, so we dropped it. With yesterday's
$6.34 rebound, the correction appears to be over, and the
stock remains well above its moving averages, so we are
adding it back to our recommended plays. When NOKA
announced a split in Feb. 1998, a long and steep split run
followed. We have been unable to confirm the expected
earnings release date for this foreign owned stock, but we
will keep you posted, as that is a likely time for a new
split announcement.

Since we dropped it, Nokia has entered the pre-paid mobile
phone market in an agreement with Topp Telecom, Inc., of
Miami. Other recent news on this stock can still be found
in previous newsletters posted on the O.I. website. When
researching NOK.A, be aware that some sites require the dot
and some won't allow it.

MSFT - Microsoft $149.75 (-0.13)(+11.19)(-3.06)(P5W +28.13)

From their own words, "Microsoft Rules." Although it's
current reign is being rocked with revolution, the Evil M-
pire (as some programmers and anti-Internet Explorer
browser patriots call it), has been fighting the Federal
government on anti-trust grounds for months. The line to
take their turn and bad mouth the bully was long and
distinguished. The fact is, MSFT is good at what they do.
They are the world's #1 software company (Y2K compliant or
not!) and their operating systems dominate the PC
landscape.

Extremely volatile, but almost no change from the previous
week.  Price range last week was $136 to $150 on above
average volume for 4 of 5 trading days.  Friday gave us an
$8 gain following the Brazilian downdraft.  CS First Boston
said Microsoft "appears on track" to meet or beat estimate
of 60 cents per share - an increase of 46 percent from the
42 cents in the same quarter last year.  Sales are expected
to increase 21 percent to $4.3 billion.  With conviction,
we still predict a stock split with the earnings
announcement after the close January 19th (MSFT confirmed
this date); only 1 trading day away.  Historically, MSFT
has split like clockwork at $140.  MSFT has expressed
optimism about their future and has every reason to split
the stock.  MSFT is trading just $3 off its all-time high
of $152.50, set the previous week.  Prudential last week
set a price target of $175.  We think their relative price
compared to the market reflects strong investor confidence.
A great play in the making.

Unsavory news release late Thursday: A federal judge
scolded Microsoft Corp. over new contract language
requiring temporary workers to waive any awards from a
pending lawsuit over the software giant's employment
practices (Reuters).  It had no affect on the stock, but
raised eyebrows in the PR department.  Conversely, a new
Microsoft poll shows that 76 percent of American consumers
believe that Microsoft has benefited both U.S. consumers
and the computer software industry (Reuters).  The real
surprise was another press release stating Robert Bork
believes Microsoft should be broken into 3 companies; an
unusual comment from a free market champion, until you
realize he's paid by Netscape to represent them in the
Justice Departments case.  Finally, MSFT appealed the Sun-
Java infringement injunction citing that it believes the
court mistakenly treated the case filed against it by Sun
as a copyright issue, rather than a contract dispute.  We
reiterate, "no material effect on earnings".  Everen
Securities still has their price targets(0-6 months) of
$161 and their long term (6-18 months) of $200

CHKPF  Check Point Software $51.25 (+4.37)(+1.07)

Network break-ins get doused with Check Point Software
Technologies' firewall products -- software that protects
corporate networks from unauthorized access, from both
inside and outside the company. FireWall-1 authenticates
remote users, controls access, and blocks viruses and other
undesirable Web content. Its FloodGate-1 clears up traffic
congestion on crowded Internet and intranet links by
allocating available space to company-defined uses. Check
Point's largest customer is Sun Microsystems' SunSoft, which
accounts for about 20% of sales. Check Point operates
subsidiaries in Europe, North America, and the Pacific Rim.

CHKPF is a company that benefits from the explosion in the
Internet.  As companies increase their use of the web, CHKPF's
services will be needed more and more.  CHKPF has an incredible
record of earning surprises.  Next earnings are scheduled for
January 21st.  Holding over earnings is a risky proposition, but
for those risk takers out there, it might pay off.  There is a
possibility that CHKPF might announce a stock split.  They have
plenty of shares, but have never announced a split in the past.
MACD is positive and CHKPF price is above all moving averages.
Between Tuesday and earnings after the close on Thursday, CHKPF
could have a nice run.

CHKPF, along with other networking security companies, will be
holding a seminar in February. This seminar will outline the
future of the business and the strategies these companies use
and how they can help other companies with their information
security. CHKPF has a consensus growth rate of 37.55%. Watch
for a pullback and hang on for the ride.

PRIA  PRI Automation, INC. $34.50 (+4.87)

PRIA designs, develops, manufactures, and markets factory
automation systems for the cleanroom manufacturing
operations of semi-conductor makers and OEM equipment
suppliers. Last year's $178.2 million in revenues reflect
the big downturn in the semi-conductor industry, but that
is changing. The 1998 glut of chips has been depleted, and
demand is strong again for these products.

After hitting a high of $37.50 in Feb. 1998, PRIA stock had
lost about 75% of its value by the time the market bottomed
in October. However, it has been climbing fairly steadily
ever since, except for a brief correction in December. With
the chip industry recovering, it follows that a company
such as PRIA will benefit. On January 12th, CIBC Oppenheimer
upgraded PRIA to strong buy from buy. This as a momentum
play in an improving industry.  Earnings due out Jan. 28th.

MU  Micron Technology  $71.31 (+7.68)

Micron makes semi-conductor memory products, PCs, circuit
boards, memory modules, and system level assemblies, and
has a market cap. of $17.6 billion.  Revenues for MU=20
declined last year due to lower selling prices of PCs and
semi-conductor products. This was a result of too much
product industry wide and too little demand, but the
company is recovering now, as demand increases.

With the industry gaining steam, market expectations for
Micron's earnings were high in December, and the stock
pulled back when MU did not beat analysts' earnings by a
wide enough margin. However, MU has lately begun climbing
again and gathering momentum. Even in this past week's down
market, the stock looked fairly strong. Chip prices climbed
6% last week as Koreans permanently slashed production and
may actually swing the market from an overproduction last
year to a scarcity in the coming year. The wild card in the
future supply is Taiwan. Already, though, chip prices,
which were $200 a year ago, and fell below $60 in May, have
climbed to near $90. At the same time, sales for PCs and
the chips that go in them are showing strong increases, and
that will eventually show up in MU's bottom line. This is a
momentum play.

CBS Marketwatch screened stocks for 20 different
characteristics and MU turned out in the top group. The
five best characteristics: 1)Strong recent earnings/revenue
growth, 2)Selling at a discount to its growth,
3)Consistently beats analysts expectations, 4)Earnings
estimates continually revised upwards, 5)Short- and long-
term relative strength.

JBL - Jabil Circuit, Inc. $73.88 (-1.00)(+.38)(+2.94)(+3.06)

JBL is the third-largest US manufacturer of circuit board
systems, trailing SCI Systems and Solectron. The company's
products are used in PCs, printers, network hardware, cellular
phones, and cars. JBL's major customers include Hewlett
Packard, 3Com, and Cisco Systems with more than half of its
revenues coming from telecommunications companies.  JBL's
customers use contract manufacturers, like JBL, to save money
and improve production times.  JBL has manufacturing facilities
in Malaysia, Mexico, the UK, and the US.  Insiders own
approximately 41% of the company.

In the news last week, Everen Securities initiated coverage on
JBL with an intermediate term market perform and a long term
outperform.  The press release did note, that in the near-term
they believe that JBL is close to fair value, but in the long
term it should be an outperformer.  The other bit of news that
helped JBL was that Solectron announced a two for one
stock split.  As we have said on more than one occasion, this
industry tends to move together.

Last week, JBL bounced off of its 21 day moving average and
closed right at its 10 day moving average on Friday.  There
also appears to be some support for JBL around $71.  JBL
has been on extended run since last September, and given the
way the sector goes in and out of favor with the Street, you
should keep a close eye on JBL if you are playing it.  If JBL
were to break below $71, in a significant way, we would be very
cautious of the stock.  Also, as with any sector, but more so
with this one, you have to keep an eye on the sector when
playing JBL.

LXK  Lexmark Intl. $98.06 (-2.50)(+.06)(+7.25)(+1.31)

Lexmark has good peripheral vision. Lexmark International
Group is a leading maker of computer printers and related
products, which generate more than 80% of its sales. Its
printer line includes laser printers (designed primarily
for corporate networks and desktops) and ink-jet printers
(for home and business use). Unlike many of its competitors,
Lexmark develops and manufactures it's own printers, which
results in fast product cycle times. The company also makes
supplies for IBM and other name brand printers and typewriters.
Lexmark's products are sold in more than 15,000 retail outlets
in more than 150 countries.

LXK consolidated this last week and is sitting right on its
20-dma. We still like LXK with earnings on the 26th of January.
Remember, holding over earnings is risky. In the case of LXK,
the risk might be justified if they announce a stock split.
Each individual has to weigh out the risk themselves.

LXK hasn't had any news the last few days. These last few
weeks have seen LXK get recommended by many different
professionals as a great stock to own for 1999. Remember,
LXK has had an average earnings surprise of 11.75% over the
last four quarters. This could help propel LXK higher before
earnings on the expectation. There are different earnings dates
listed on the web, but First Call does list the 26th of January.
We will continue to try to get a fixed date from investor
relations.

EMC - EMC Corporation $100.06 (+6.50)(+8.56)(+3.38)(+.13)

EMC is a Fortune 500 company that designs, manufactures,
markets an supports high performance storage products.  The
company's products store retrieve, manage, protect and share
information from all major computing environments, including
UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe platforms.  EMC markets its
memory products under the name Symmetrix.  EMC and its
enterprise storage systems have developed a clear cut
technological edge over its competition.  The company has been
able to successfully leverage its leadership position in the
mainframe storage area into the lucrative, faster growing open
systems market.

There really wasn't any news last week on EMC.  We think the
real story happened on Thursday, when the NASDAQ was down and
EMC went up.  This suggests that there are still a lot of
buyers who want EMC stock.  This was confirmed by the move EMC
made on Friday.  We continue to read  articles that discuss EMC
being in model portfolios of 20 to 30 growth stocks.  There was
an article in MSN MoneyCentral about EMC being one of the top
30 growth stocks.  EMC has been, and is continuing to be, a
great momentum stock.

EMC took off again on Friday.  It set a new 52 week high on
Friday, and closed near the high.  As we discussed above, EMC
is one of those stocks that people keep buying.  As long as
there are buyers of the stock, we believe it will continue with
it's momentum.  EMC is also a split candidate.  We know we keep
saying this, but as it continues to move up, it only increases
the probability of a split.  A year ago this last November EMC
split at around $63 after a strong move.  FYI - EMC reports
earnings before the open on 1/26.

XIRC  Xircom Inc. $39.88 (+1.38)(+4.50)(+1.25)

Xircom makes adapters that connect portable PCs to corporate
networks, the Internet, and commercial online services. The
company's products include adapter/modem cards (CreditCard
Ethernet+Modem), network adapters for portable PCs (Pocket
Ethernet Adapter, Pocket Token Ring Adapter), and modem-only
PC cards (CreditCard Modem). Xircom sells its products to
original equipment manufacturers and through a worldwide
network of distributors, value-added resellers, and computer
retailers. Over half of its income is from foreign sales.
Intel owns 11% of Xircom; chairman and CEO Dirk Gates owns
about 5%.

XIRC is expecting to announce earnings that are 300% higher
than the same quarter last year.  With the large earning
surprises XIRC has had the last four quarter, a nice run
could develop into earnings. Though a split isn't likely,
the company has enough shares to announced one. There is
no split history for XIRC.  XIRC reached a new 52-week high
on Friday when it hit $40.50.

XIRC was recently selected as one of the best mobile PC cards.
Its product will be competing with 3COM and a few others for
the best mobile PC card.  This award ceremony is put on the
Mobility Awards. 3COM is one of the biggest competitors of XIRC.

Trading lessons...

This week we are going discuss one of the many pitfalls that you
will eventually encounter as a trader; Incorrect Information...

Occasionally, we will discover an error in a stock or option quote
and usually it comes to us "the hard way". Last week, we offered
a position on Reliance Bancorp (RELY) and it turns out that the
option quoted was for another stock. It was not a research error
or miss-type, just erroneous quote information provided to the
trading public. One of our faithful readers had the unfortunate
experience of buying into this play on the assumption that the
option existed. We received permission to reprint portions of his
remarks to educate our readers. Here is the general narrative;

"I did my 'due diligence' on the options play with Reliance
Bancorp but like a growing number of people this was all handled
on-line with me as the only human in the food chain willing to
take any chances. Oddly though, I did speak to two other people
in this and got an interesting mix of answers.

I used (two common brokerages; names deleted) for my information,
perhaps using two separate entities was my downfall here. One
stated just as you did that there was a Reliance, FEB25-Call at
the same bid as you published. If fact, it showed an array of
options for Reliance. However, come to find out they were Verio.

I then bought shares of Reliance on-line through another broker in
my IRA with the intention of selling calls against them the next
day. When I entered the ticker symbol to 'sell calls to open', I
was greeted by a statement about Verio. Calling the broker, I was
told that the ticker symbol was in fact for Verio but only the Feb.
call. I then contacted the option trading desk and found that the
ticker symbol belonged to Verio and there were no options on RELY
at all. I was fooled by the apparent presence of options at one
brokerage, which tells me that I need to do all my research
through the top name brokerage."

The reader went on to point out that; "It turned out to be the
systems that were fouled up and not the analysis, all information
that is received on-line or through humans should be verified
before investing...I sure plan to do so from now on!"

Words of wisdom for sure!

-ROI is equal to the profit (or loss) divided by the cost-basis.
 Monthly ROI represents the return on a monthly basis.
 Example: a 10% return in 20 days equals 15.2% ROI for a month).
-Margin is not used in any calculations.
-Profit/Loss Column: Asterisk indicates stock price above strike
 price and should be called.  Stock that will not be called is
 assumed sold at current price (for tracking purposes).

*** LOSING PLAYS ***

Determining when to exit a play is a matter of personal preference
but we strongly recommended closing any play that falls more than
20% below the initial cost-basis. Some positions may eventually
become profitable but it is generally more productive to exit a
losing play and move your capital into another prospective trade.

NAKED PUT SECTION FOR JANUARY 17, 1999
******************************************************************
This month, the naked-put portfolio performed very well. Most of
the success was due to the January effect and the bullish movement
of the market after the new year's holiday. Some of the more
successful plays were Internet and Pharmaceutical positions. In
fact, a number of Internet stocks continue to climb as if the sky
had no ceiling. We did have one negative position. Zila fell on
news that Federal advisers recommended against approval of Oratest,
a test to help see cancerous lesions in the mouth. The play should
have been closed for a $0.75 loss.

Brazilian woes continue...

The market is being subdued by the deteriorating situation in
Brazil and no one knows whether this virus will spread like the
Asian Flu. It all stems from the fact that the current world
markets are very susceptible to global meltdown and the closest
thing to a controlling entity is the US government. A serious
situation like the South American financial turmoil won't go away
quickly and although the floating of the Brazilian 'real' should
help the situation in the short-term, it may not prevent trouble
from spreading to other countries. Our economy has never been out
of control but we now face a period of potentially disappointing
earnings reports which will definitely have an effect on the U.S.
stock market in the coming weeks. Good Luck!

PTVL - Preview Travel  $22.50

PTVL is a provider of branded online travel services for leisure
and small business travelers. Preview Travel has been in a stage
I base since October. Recently corrected after a quick doubling
in price due to the Internet craze. Gaining notice with coverage
initiated by Friedman Billings and now Warburg Dillon Reid. Good
bullish potential with stock above 150 dma and support near $15.

SCUR - Secure Computing  $26.00

Secure Computing Corporation designs, develops, markets and sells
complete network security solutions, including firewalls, filters,
authentication and network services. Earnings are due shortly and
the whisper number is moving higher. SCUR is expected to maintain
a 30-50% growth rate and now option interest is increasing with
rumors of a stock split. Paine Webber reiterated "BUY" rating with
a conservative target of $30.

********************************************
SDTI - Security Dynamics  $27.63

SDTI provides enterprise network and data security solutions.
The recent lawsuits have been forgotten and analyst upgrades
have had a positive effect. The company started a market trial
program of higher levels of security for customers like IBM and
introduced SecurWorld for delivering two-factor authentication.
A good technical play with Internet bias. Stock price is trading
above all recent resistance and the current trend is bullish.

SMOD - Smart Modular  $25.38

SMOD designs, manufactures and markets memory modules, personal
computer card products and embedded processor modules for the
telecommunication, computer and networking industries. Experts
say the sector is already grappling with the specter of a supply
crunch for DRAM devices. Brisk demand from PC makers may cause a
severe shortage that will result in excessively high premiums for
the technology. We prefer to play based on the support near $20.

SPLN - Sportsline  $31.13

Sportsline USA, Inc. is an Internet-based sports media company
that provides branded, interactive information and programming
as well as merchandise to sports enthusiasts worldwide. Some say
its #1 in sports information on the Internet and more rumors of
a target-price upgrade. The new issue of the Dines Letter rates
SPLN as one of 4 top Internet stocks to buy now! A steady climb
since mid-Oct and a recent gap-up when the company said it will
post outstanding Q4 revenues, up 90% from a year ago. CBS's new
record-breaking IPO (Marketwatch.com) probably helps this one!

SRCM - SourceMedia  $19.75

SRCM is a provider of information and programming through
the company's proprietary digital operating systems to mass
market consumers. Customers subscribe to Source Media audio
content and have it featured on their web site. The company
launched audio programming with Broadcast.com and says the
Internet audio means it has content on PC's, cable TV and
telephones. A rumored deal with American Online may also be
causing some of the buying pressure and the stock has good
technical support around $15.

VIRS - Triangle Pharm.  $14.13

Triangle Pharmaceuticals is a pharmaceutical company engaged
in the development of new drug candidates primarily in the
antiviral area. Still playing this stock again as it has exited
the tip of the isosceles triangle formation and started to move
higher. Dec 15 entered into definitive purchase agreements to
sell 4.8m newly issued shares of stock to selected investors for
a price of $10. Technically still neutral (basing) to bullish.

WAVO - Wavephore  $9.44

Wavephore is a media content integrator and architect of digital
communications systems. Recently sold $7.5 million worth of its
common stock to a current institutional shareholder at a premium,
thus eliminating any near term financing issues. Also provided a
warrant to the investor to acquire an additional 250,000 shares
at $10.66. The funds will be used for working capital and should
fund existing operations beyond 1999. Good support around $8.

PICKS WE DROPPED THIS WEEK
*****************************************
Remember that historically, when we drop a pick it will go up
10 to 15% the very next week. It is part of Murphy's Law.
Just because we drop a stock as a pick does not mean we are
advocating a "sell" on any position you have. We are simply
dropping our recommendation as a new play. Existing plays
can and do continue on and are usually profitable.
*****************************************

CALLS:

LOW $50.63(-4.06) We are dropping LOW this week. They have
taken a fall and we don't see any catalyst to continue the
move up.  LOW's has had a nice run. Earnings aren't until
February and we feel there are other picks that will out-
perform.  We are not saying those holding LOW's should sell,
every investor makes their own decision, we just feel it
isn't worthy of a new purchase at this point.

PUTS:

CBE - Cooper Industries  $44.81  (2.69)
Stock rallied sharply on Friday (1/15) after retesting prior
support at $43. Pinnacle dropping CBE after reaching price

NETWORKING - Sector
***************************************
CSCO - Cisco Systems $101.69 (-5.00)(+13.88)(-1.38)(P6W +29.49)

Cisco is the leading networker and is expected to help
build the next generation Internet. Their goal is to allow
people to access or transfer information without regard to
differences in time, place or type of computer systems,
voice or data.  About 85% of the routers used to decipher
and direct data traffic on the Internet are made by Cisco.

Panic, over-reaction, reality. That best describes CSCO's
trade pattern last week.  We're adding CSCO back after
dropping it from Tuesday's publication.  The market
realized that Lucent's acquisition of Ascend is not the end
of the world for CSCO, sending CSCO back up from its knee-
jerk/market induced sell off. "Often it's the very best
employees who approach Cisco after a takeover.  "That's
wonderful for us and bad for the other guy," said Larry
Lang of CSCO's business services division.  CSCO will
provide the equipment needed for AT&T to offer
TV/phone/internet/data services through (what will be) it's
TCI division.  CSCO is truly leading the development of the
Internet by helping cable and phone companies complete "the
last mile", or the distance between the cable in the street
an your home.  Also making news, this from Newswire, "Cisco
Systems to Invest $6 Million in Technical Support for
China; Technical Assistance Center and Additional Support
Options to Benefit Channel Partners and Customers."

The big picture is that CSCO is due for another split now
that the price is over $100.  Historically, their split
range is $80-$100.  While they have enough shares
outstanding to complete another 3:2 split, a 2:1 would
require the shareholder's to approve more shares.  Next
earnings announcement is scheduled for 2/2 (company
verified); perhaps then we'll get the announcement.  Though
up to $108 the week before, CSCO couldn't hold the gains and
fell with LU/ASND and Brazil news.  Nice recovery back over
$101 on Friday after falling as low as $89 in Wednesday's
sell-off.  A better entry is now available.  Look for
market direction and make your move.

AOL - America Online $146.50 (+0.00)(-8.63)(+18.50)(P5W+65.06)

America Online is the largest online Internet access
service in the world.  Membership now exceeds 15 million
users.  Its Chairman, Steve Case, said more new users
signed up with AOL on Christmas Day than any other day in
the company's history.  With estimates of 16 million users
by the year 2000 and growing advertising revenues AOL has
been called the blue chip of the Internets. (If only they
could get their mail problem resolved!)

Given Internet weakness last week, it's a wonder AOL
finished even from the previous week.  AOL traded between
$130.00 and $167.  What action!  It finished Friday up
$2.00 on light volume, faring well against significant
losses on other 1st tier Internet stocks.  Consolidation may
be nearing an end as we approach earnings.  At these price
levels, AOL is again well over its historical $120 split
range, though rumors seem to have died for an immediate
announcement.  Currently they have 1.8 bln shares
authorized.  That's enough for a 3:1 split, but a 2:1 is
more likely.  Earnings are on January 27th (company
confirmed).  Look for the split announcement then along
with surprise earnings (as usual).  For the next couple of
days, target shooting your entry may be a safer play.  As
always, confirm market direction first.

Making news this week, AOL stated they expect to close the
Netscape deal by the end of April.  Also, they are
partnering a deal with Bell Atlantic to bring AOL service
at DSL speeds (Digital Subscriber Line-1.5 megs of
bandwidth) to Bell Atlantic customers, putting them in
competition with @Home, another successful cable internet
access service.  DSL service could be available by mid-
Summer (at less than $20 additional per month) and will
cover 15 million homes by the year 2000.  Potential revenue
is huge.  Other DSL agreements are being discussed with
other Baby-Bell regional carriers. Never failing to come up
with new marketing ideas to get subscribers, AOL is taking
its cue from Amway, Mary Kay and Tupperware, and will begin
marketing it's AOL Select service through a multi level
marketing organization called Monument Communications,
based in McLean, VA.

Still an Internet stock.

YHOO  Yahoo! Inc. $317.00 (-26.63)(+106.69)

Yahoo! Inc. is a global Internet media company that offers
a network of branded World Wide Web programming that serves
millions of users daily. As the first online navigational
guide to the Web, WWW.YAHOO.COM is the single largest guide
in terms of traffic, advertising, household and business user
reach, and is one of the most recognized brands associated
with the Internet. The company provides targeted Internet
resources and communications services for a broad range of
audiences, based on demographic, key-subject and geographic
interests.

We are adding YHOO back to the pick list with a precaution:
Wait for a positive confirmation!  YHOO is down over $125 from
its 52-week high.  Of all the Internet stocks, YHOO is the
closest thing to a blue-chip, except for AOL in this list also.
We like the chances that YHOO will turn strongly positive over
the next few weeks leading into it's split.  YHOO showed a classic
example of high expectations when it announced great earnings and
a stock split, yet has fallen drastically.  The internets have
played this game before.  They go in spurts, consolidate and then
take off again.  This is a risky play, but those that are willing
to take the risk, are often rewarded with extraordinary gains.

There are a lot of companies out there trying to duplicate the
success YHOO has had with it's web site.  Many on-line shopping
sites have used YHOO as a model.  Though this seems like it
might eat into YHOO's profits, the fact is that YHOO still leads
the pack.  The more awareness there is for online services, the
more hits YHOO will receive.  These added hits turn into added
advertising revenue which turns into more profits.  Ultimately,
more profits means higher stock prices.

*******************************************
WCOM - MCIWorldCom $75.06 (+0.06)(+3.25)(+1.62)(P4W +7.69)

Telecommunications behemoth, MCIWorldCom, is the recent
offspring between a marriage of formerly #2 long distance
provider MCI and #4 provider WorldCom.  Now the newly
formed giant of giants is duking it out with AT&T as they
stake their claim in the local phone service, international
service, cellular, paging, and Internet access arenas.
WorldCom's $37 billion purchase of MCI last September
qualifies it the 7th largest merger or acquisition in 1998.
WCOM is one of the largest Internet backbone providers in
the world.  If you're reading this letter, somewhere in the
transmission, WCOM fiber brought it to you.

Friday, WCOM gained over $4 from Friday's trading low on
heavy trading - nice comeback.  WCOM is showing a lot of
relative strength.  In last week's action, profits were
shaken out and buyers stepped in.  Though WCOM dipped below
support of $70, they didn't stay there long and finished
each day at no less than $72.  It appears to have
consolidated, and having bounced off its moving average,
should continue upward, market permitting.  Slight
resistance is $76 with harder resistance at $79.  Any
volume or overall market strength should push it right
through.  The markets were not disappointed when WCOM
backed away from bidding on Air Touch, which helped WCOM's
recovery.  We're still big believers in Bernie Ebbers,
WCOM's "awe shucks" chairman.

The big news last week, the U.S. General Services
Administration selected MCI WorldCom to provide long-
distance telephone, data and video telecommunications
services to Federal government agencies worldwide in the
second and final round of its multi(5)-billion dollar
FTS2001 competition.  WCOM is in high-bandwidth content
delivery tests with AOL, which should be successful and
more fully implemented through Bell Atlantic and SBC's DSL
services. With recent court rulings preventing the baby
bells from entering the long distance market in their home
areas, 20% growth in voice traffic and 100% growth in data
traffic every 4 months (!!! Gilder Technology Report) this
spells good news and continued earnings growth for the big
3 long distance providers.

T - AT&T $84.25 (-0.81)(+9.31)(+1.19)(+1.56)(P4W +12.06)

AT&T, the mother of all phone companies isn't just a long
distance company any more. Through growth and acquisition,
they now provide data transmission, video tele-
conferencing, PCS/wireless/cellular, Internet, paging and
local phone services via microwave, fiber and copper
infrastructure throughout the U.S. and international
markets.  Their annual revenues in excess of $55 billion
dwarf their nearest competitor, MCIWorldCom, by 5 times.
Their 1998 acquisition of TCG (formerly Teleport
Communications Group, the nations largest competitive local
exchange carrier) and IBM's data services division will add
substantially to their revenues.  Pending a merger with
cable giant, TCI, revenues could grow even more.  Michael
Armstrong, AT&T's CEO, has investors believing that AT&T is
no longer a copper wire dinosaur heading-up the telecom
extinction list.

Great defensive play in the face of market woes last week.
AT&T dipped just below $81 after the open Wednesday, it's
low trading point of the week, but finished up strongly at
$84.75.  Friday's recovery of $2.13 after Thursday's
nosedive to $82.12 came as investor's realized the sell-off
was overdone.  Merrill Lynch upgraded the week before last
to "Long Term Buy".  Technicals are a bit weak in light of
market conditions, but should recover with any market
strength.  Still, the big news:  3:2 stock split to occur
when the TCI deal closes around the end of March (no firm
date yet-we'll let you know the details when available), $4
billion stock repurchase (about 2.7% of shares in float at
current levels) and increased earnings estimates.  With
some of the profits shaken out, a better entry is possible,
but confirm direction before playing.

Not much price moving news this week (other than Brazil).
The week before last, AT&T got the green light to merge
with TCI thus creating a huge bandwidth pipe (lots of
transmission capacity) over "the last Mile" or that short
distance between the street and your phone jack.  It's
estimated that it costs $1200 per home for a typical
utility to trench and install any transmission equipment.
That's why even though the fiber optic cable runs down your
street, you can't yet access it.  It's too expensive to get
it to you.  Soon, you'll be able to bypass that fiber in
favor of AT&T/TCI cable.  It's already there.  Translation:
increased revenues.

ATI  AirTouch Communications $83.38 (+4.38)(+6.56)(+4.56)(+5.19)

AirTouch Communications provides wireless communications to nearly
14 million customers in the US and in 11 countries in Asia and
Europe. Its operations include cellular telephone service (#2 in
the US, after AT&T), paging, and personal communications service
through PrimeCo, its joint venture with Bell Atlantic. AirTouch has
joint ventures in Europe and Asia, including Portugal (Telecel)
and Sweden (Europolitan), where the cellular market is growing
rapidly. It holds a minority stake in the Globalstar satellite
network, which is scheduled to begin providing worldwide digital
phone communications in 1999.

Well, it is finally done. ATI is merging with Vodaphone. The
combined company, to be known as Vodafone AirTouch Plc, will
reach nearly one billion people in 23 countries on four
continents. Serving over 23 million proportionate cellular
and PCS customers, Vodafone AirTouch will be the largest
wireless company in the world by a substantial margin. The
merger is expected to benefit employees, customers and
stockholders. The deal puts ATI shares value at $97 based on
the January 15th close.

If you are not already in ATI, it's too late. ATI will gap open
on Monday.  We will wait and see how the reaction is after
Monday to decide if we should keep ATI long-term.  The only
reason we might keep it is because the deal involves 1 share
of ATI for .5 shares of VOD's ADR share price (plus $9 in cash
per share).  Thus if VOD continues to move up, ATI should
continue to move up too.  ATI is scheduled to announce earnings
on the 22nd of January.

Options will be out of date on the open Tuesday (that means
anything we quote today will probably be $10 too cheap by
Tuesday).  If we keep ATI on Tuesday, we will update the
current option prices.

LU  Lucent Technologies $110.25 (-5.06)(+5.31)(-2.12)

Lucent Technologies, Inc. is one of the world's leading
designers, developers and manufacturers of telecommunications
systems, software and products. The Company is a global market
leader in the sale of public telecommunications systems, and
is a supplier of systems or software to most of the worlds
largest network operators. They are also a global market
leader in the sale of business communications systems and
in the sale of microelectronic components for communications
applications to manufacturers of communications systems and
computers.

LU is back!!! After trading as low as $96.00 three days ago,
LU took back over $4 of those losses.  LU took a hit with the
news it was in talks with Ascend.  When the news became reality,
LU has firmed and is heading higher into earnings on the 21st.
LU says the merger will not affect earnings in 1999 and should
help earnings in 2000. It seems the merger is viewed as
positive by the public since LU has trended higher since the
news became official.  There is a possibility that LU could
announce a split with earnings, but the more likely time will
be after the shareholders meeting in February.

Lucent announced a new product for radio.  Lucent Digital
Radio's advancement, called Multi-Streaming, is based on
state-of-the-art capabilities in audio and wireless channel
coding technologies from Lucent's Bell Labs, and allows for
the best-quality FM audio to be delivered over a wide coverage
area, even under impaired channel conditions.

COMBINATION PLAYS - MARKET RECAP -Boom or Bust?
******************************************************************

U.S. stocks rallied on Friday, snapping back from the problem of
Brazilian currency devaluation as investors showed new confidence
in the market. The Dow closed up 220 points at 9340.55 and the
Nasdaq was up 71 points at 2348.21. Internet traders were focused
on Marketwatch.com as shares surged 473% and markets around the
world benefited from Brazil's move to let the inflation-busting
real float. The question is: Will the enthusiasm fade next week?

Our new spread plays were all available at favorable prices. The
first candidate was CIEN and a debit price of $3.50 (FEB12C/17C)
was easily attained in the morning trading. SDTI and SRCM went in
different directions but both were still playable. The credit for
the SDTI spread (FEB17P/20P) was slightly less than expected at
$0.50 and SRCM (FEB15P/17P) was right in line at $0.75. SRCM is
primarily a merger-speculation play and without news or continued
rumors, the stock price will drop. Watch it closely! AAPL was our
leg-in play and as recommended, we started with a long position
(FEB35P) at $1.12 and used the afternoon's downward momentum to
increase the price of the short option (FEB37P) to $2.00 for a
credit of $0.87. SUNW was up at the open but favorable positions
were still available at 10:00 AM as the stock price took a quick
breather. The (LJAN100C/FEB100C) calendar spread traded at $14.00.

Friday was expiration day for many of our plays and one of them
was a heart-stopper! Our credit spread on MCHP suffered cardiac
arrest after the company (on Thursday night) reported earnings
that were up from the previous year, but below Street estimates.
Shares fell over $5 in morning trading and although it eventually
went the distance (finishing at $35.12), the prudent exit was at
mid-day for a closing debit of $0.50, to break-even. The rest of
the credit spreads expired safely OTM. Even those that held AAPL
and BMCS to the close were successful.

We are starting to see more progress in the calendar spreads as
some of the positions are "paid for" and many have been moved to
the next higher strike. Our biggest dilemma is the ATI LEAP play
as the company said it agreed to merge with Britain's Vodafone
Group in a stock deal valued at about $56 billion. The merger is
considered valued at $97 per AirTouch common share and we are
curious to see the opening prices on our current positions next
week. Other short positions that were closed include CPQ, NOVL
and WCOM. New options need to be sold on OXHP and WCOM. BGP was
our only dismal failure and there may be some recovery next week.

The debit spreads did better this month, primarily because the
market was so bullish. Our main focus next week is the LU play.
We already have a profit and will plan to exit early on any bump
before the earnings. We are also watching FTL for any further
downward movement and hopefully some new take-over rumors will
surface. Good Luck!

The calendar (or time spread) is profitable if the value of the
position exceeds the initial debit (or cost-basis) at the end of
the expiration period for the long position. However, because we
track the plays based on the current closing cost/value, and some
of the plays have diagonal positions, the gains will rarely be
reflected until the play closes. Each month, as we sell a new call
against the long position, the net cost should decline or position
value should increase.

ABI - American Bankers Insurance  $48.87     Call Debit Spread

American Bankers Insurance Group (ABIG) sells wholesale, credit
related specialty insurance. Financial institutions, retailers,
automobile and manufactured-housing dealers, and representatives
then retail these policies to consumers. Products include property
insurance (on items ranging from mobile homes to appliances), as
well as life, unemployment, and disability insurance.

Trading in American Bankers Insurance Group options has been brisk
lately following weeks of inactivity as bid speculation reemerges.
Traders cited talk that American International Group, which had
attempted to buy American Bankers last year, (before Cendant Corp
outbid AIG and then pulled out of the deal because of accounting
problems) would return with another offer. Things are heating up
as ING Baring Furman Selz said it resumed coverage of ABI with a
"strong buy" rating. The report says American Bankers is one of
its favorite companies among specialty insurers and states the
company is likely to resume double digit revenue and earnings
growth in the second half of 1999 while earning 15% to 20% on its
equity. The 1999 share price target is $58 and the technical
outlook is favorable.

HUM - Humana Inc.  $19.50     (Neutral) Calendar Spread

One of the largest health care companies in the US, Humana offers
health maintenance organizations (HMOs), preferred provider
organizations (PPOs), and Medicare supplement insurance. They have
about 6 million members and Humana tries to cut costs by offering
physicians incentives and requiring pre-authorization for hospital
inpatient services and outpatient surgery. Medicare accounts for
almost one-third of sales, but Humana is cutting back its Medicare
HMO business. The company markets its products to employers and
other groups, as well as to certain Medicare-eligible individuals.
In the past year, Humana has been the sector's most active merger,
acquisition and divestiture participant as the company moved to
purchase health plans in its largest markets while divesting non-
strategic assets to focus on profitable core businesses.

A Florida appellate court recently ruled that a lawsuit against
Humana could not proceed as a class action and that it should be
dissolved. The opinion strongly supports HUM's contention that
the class action had no merit. This may help investors regain
favor with the company as its likely their business practices have
always been both ethical and legal. The chart reflects a new range
of trading developing near $20 and that makes it perfect for a
calendar spread.

PLAY (conservative):

BUY  CALL MAY-20 HUM-ED OI=3D567  A=3D$2.43
SELL CALL FEB-20 HUM-BD OI=3D1814 B=3D$1.12
NET DEBIT TARGET=3D$1.25 TARGET ROI=3D40%

Note: In the long-term calendar spread, we are reducing the net
cost of the long-term option by the credit from the sale of the
nearer-term call. If the near-term call expires worthless, we will
sell the MAR call to further reduce our debit. If your short-term
position is ITM on the last day of the strike, you need to buy it
back so that you DON'T have to exercise the long-term position. In
that case, your long option is going up in value also and on the
last day of the strike period, the short call will shrink down to
intrinsic value so you will be ahead in the play even after you
buy it back.

GMSTF - Gemstar Intl.  $59.87     Put Credit Spread

GMSTF develops, markets and licenses proprietary technologies and
systems that simplify and enhance consumers' interaction with
electronics products and other platforms that deliver video,
programming information and other data. A recent report rated the
stock "neutral" for conservative investors and "accumulate" for
more aggressive investors based on the company's huge potential
and superior management. A 14 month conservative target price was
set at $57.00. GMSTF also recently filed patent infringement suits
against Scientific Atlanta, Pioneer and General Instrument Corp,
claiming that these companies willfully infringed two (Levine)
patents, by virtue of deployment, marketing, offers to sell and
sale of cable set top boxes containing an interactive program
guide not licensed under these patents. The Levine patents broadly
cover, among others, an interactive program guide using locally
stored or cached data. Gemstar is seeking injunctions and monetary
damages from these companies. Other news includes acquisitions of
VideoGuide and Starsight.

Basically, we favor the technical trading range tops near $45 as
current support for this position but use the downward momentum
by opening the long position first. Then sell the short position
when the stock price firms, to create the credit spread.

Capital One Financial Corporation is a holding company, whose
subsidiaries provide a variety of products and services including
credit card products, certain consumer lending, deposit services,
and various operating, administrative and other services. COF is
one of the largest issuers of Visa and MasterCard credit cards in
the United States. Quarterly earnings are due soon and they expect
to exceed analysts' current expectations. The reported earnings
should be approximately 30% higher than 1998 and that is above the

which develops drugs for such disorders as Alzheimer's disease;

INDEX OPTION SPREADS...
******************************************************************
As a trader, you may be familiar with options on individual stocks
where you have the right to buy (call option) or the right to sell
(put option) a particular stock at some predetermined price within
some predetermined time. The buyer has the rights and the seller
the obligations. With index options the basic ideas are the same.
Index options allow you to make investment decisions on a specific
market industry or on the market as a whole. Spread strategies can
be made with index options similar to those made with individual
stock options. Many professional traders employ index spreads as a
hedge strategy. We favor debit positions on the SPX for momentum
and longer-term plays and OTM credit spreads on the OEX when the
risk/reward is favorable. Low ROI disparity spreads will be listed
(when available) for the conservative index trader.
*******************************************************************
OEX - S&P 100 Index  $616.46     OTM Credit-Spreads

The Standard & Poor's 100 Index is a capitalization-weighted index
of 100 stocks from a broad range of industries. The component
stocks are weighted according to the total market value of their
outstanding shares. The impact of a component's price change is
proportional to the issue's total market value, which is the share
price times the number of shares outstanding.

OBSERVATIONS:

For OTM credit spread trades, we like to use the actively-traded
S&P 100 Index options because they contain much more premium than
options on individual stocks and provide an underlying instrument
less prone to huge, gapping moves. Remember however, that you can
always be exercised early so monitor your positions daily.

TECHNICALS:

The overall market seems likely to remain in a wide trading range
over the next few weeks and the long-term outlook is for a two-way
market with somewhat neutral bias. Secondary issues are performing
well but big-caps continue to suffer. The DOW and the S&P 500 both
remain above their 30 wma's and over 50% of all stocks are now in
stage II. The call/put ratio is slightly pessimistic so there may
be some upside testing before any further correction. Review the
OEX trading pit for more specific technical information on the S&P
100 Index.

Here is the most recent draft of the Posting Agreement which we would like to 
discuss with you at our meeting tomorrow.

This is certainly a tough one.  We go to great lengths to avoid regulation 
here and have been fairly successful to date.  We do have some oversight from 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regarding our power trading 
and pipeline activities and local state regulators keep an eye on our purely 
intrastate pipeline activities, but for the most part we are unsupervised.  
If it helps, we conduct our derivative trading operations in accordance with 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulations (but that's just 
complying with the Eligible Swap Participant and Trade Option Exemption 
rules).  It is true we are a member of the NYMEX and subject to their rules 
but they relate almost exclusively to trading on the NYMEX.  It might be more 
helpful to talk to the guys in London about our SFA regulatory status.  We 
have quite a bit more supervision there than we do here in the states.

Mark, we are attempting to get a broad approval to trade any types of 
products in Australia through EnronOnline. (Currently our ability to trade 
products other electricity through EnronOnline using standardised 
documentation is not beyond doubt). What the Australian regulators are 
looking for is for us to point to a regulatory oversight in the US of Enron's 
trading activities. They hopefully then will back off. Particularly they want 
us to demonstrate  there are some prudential requirements Enron Corp. needs 
to meet in respect of trading activities. Pardon my complete ignorance but 
are there any? Would membership of NYMEX be relevant?

I have just had another call from ASIC (Alan Worseley and Tim Hardman).

It seems that there is a single significant policy concern for the ASIC
policy committee.

This arises because ASIC believes that a significantly wider range of
sophisticated counterparties will be interested in the EnronOnline products
(such as weather and credit) than those that are interested in Australian
electricity derivatives.  As a result, ASIC is not able to simply
"transfer-across" its approval of EAF under the electricity declaration
without separate consideration as to how EAF can meet the prudential
regulation criteria specified in PS 70.

They have asked for further information in this regard.  Obviously I
mentioned the presence of the Enron Corp guarantee. However, ASIC may
require something further, such as evidence of procedures in place to
prevent an Enron failure.  PS 70 states in this regard (in paragraphs 46 and
47):

 "The ASC considers that providers of safe harbour market facilities
should be subject to regulation which at least sets minimum capital
standards and ensures regular reporting against them. This is because the
financial stability of a facility provider is a crucial factor in the
stability of any market conducted by that provider. This will ensure that
risks associated with the conduct of a safe harbour market are monitored.
Standard setting and monitoring will contribute to the continued financial
stability of the facility provider. If the facility provider is a
significant participant in other markets, it will also help prevent any
adverse consequences for those markets if the facility provider fails.

 Regulatory supervision of this kind may occur in a number of ways.
For the purposes of the ASC's policy, it is not the identity of a
 particular supervisory authority that is important, but the fact
that the organisation is subject to supervision which produces the results
mentioned in para 46. Regulatory supervision will meet this test only if the
capital standards which it imposes on an organisation take into account the
organisation's derivatives market activities."

The following paragraphs are also explanatory, particularly as they refer to
certain US licensees.  Are any Enron entities subject to prudential or
similar regulation due to the licences/authorisations which they hold? This
could be a useful starting point.

They also mentioned that there may be difficulty in achieving the 23 June
timetable.  However, the focus of the discussion was the policy issue rather
than timing.

Best regards

Sorry about the delay.  Here are my responses:
1.  Yes, this is primarily a tax issue.  However, there are some countries 
with strange laws regarding internet usage and we have covered some of those 
issues with specific PA provisions for those countries. 

2. No.  Only one user from each counterparty has to accept the GTC and that 
only the first time they trade that product.  The GTC's are arranged by 
"Product Type" so you only have to agree to it once for that type - 
regardless of how many products there are - so for example you only agree to 
the financial derivatives GTC once no matter how many different types of 
swaps and options you subsequently trade.

3. No.  But if that would be helpful it can be arranged.

4.  This one doesn't make much sense to me.  EnronOnline itself doesn't make 
any money.  There is no advertizing, and EnronOnline doesn't trade - the 
trades are all done by the various Enron trading entities.  EnronOnline is 
actually providing them a service.

5.  I really have no idea.  I guess we would have to print out the records 
and have one of the IT people testify that they had not been modified.

6. So far we haven't deleted anything.  If we need to keep the records for a 
long time we probably can but this has not been discussed.

Two of the internet attorneys at Marval came over today to look at the system 
online.  They posed the following questions that I did not know the answer 
to.  Can you help me out on getting them a response today if possible?

1.  They would like to know the intent behind the sentence in Section (2) of 
the password application that prohibits the user form using the password 
outside their country.  I told them it was probably a tax driven issue but 
was not sure.

2.  They need to know if the user must scroll through and agree to the GTC 
each time they transact a trade.  I believe each product is represented by a 
separate line on the page and that each product has its own GTC even thought 
several related products will probably have identical GTCs.  I told them I 
thought that for each product that you only had to select it once, but that 
for each product, even if the GTC is the same as another produce you have 
reviewed, you must accept the GTC again.  Is this correct?

3.  Are the Enron trading entities signing service agreements with EOL for 
use of the system?

4.  They wanted to know if the trading entities providing the prices etc. for 
each product could be considered "content" for EOL and be considered value 
for which EOL should pay the trading entities.  I haven't heard of this issue 
before but I said I would ask.

5.  As a proof issue, what would be the process of proving and electronic 
trade?  How can we show we have not modified the screens or manipulated the 
data.  How would the data be presented to a court?  

6.  How long are the electronic trades retained in our systems and how are 
they retained?

Any help you can give me would be appreciated. 

Thanks,
Brent

Rosemary,

Should we limit the presentations to ISDA members only?  What about
FPML/Swift/Londex or e speed, or treasury connect, etc?  I believe we should 
try
to be inclusive of any important venture, member value from attendance goes up
as a result.

I think this attachment is probably the treaty you want.  I'm sorry it didn't 
"save" better but I think you can probably print it out legibly.  I have a 
copy printed from Westlaw.  Let me know if you want me to fax it.

Mark, congratulations on your promotion to Vice President.

On a more mundane matter could you have a clerk or legal assistant get me a 
copy of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the US and Argentina.  Our 
regulatory and commercial group wants to leave no stone unturned in their 
search for how to deal with the ENARGAS.

Here is my first cut - what do you think?

Here is the language I mentioned in my voice mail.  Cynthia Sandherr's office 
should be getting in touch this afternoon with the addresses, forms of 
address, etc.  The letters need to be hand delivered in DC on Monday so they 
need to be fed exed to our DC office tonight.  Please call if you have any 
questions.

Thanks!

Mark

Dan - How does this look?

Jason Peters (x39720) will be able to go with you - you might meet with him a 
bit ahead of time to fill him in on what you plan to do.

This looks like and ISDA comparison to me.  I'm not sure who is next on the

As you work through these issues, please remember that even though the Mexico 
commercial group may not plan to offer many of their own products and may not 
expect many other products to appeal to their customers, the EnronOnline 
people will expect all products listed online to be available unless we can 
articulate a compelling reason to restrict them.

Carol,

I've been working with Jaime Williams and our outside tax advisors to 
determine the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products that 
Jaime has informed me will be offered to Mexican counterparties through 
EnronOnLine and, potentially, a separate ENA Mexican entity.  I should be 
able to provide the results by Friday or Monday.  Please contact me at ext. 
35777 if you'd like to discuss in the meantime.

Best regards,

Jeff

Jeff:
As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement 
online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we 
should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone 
trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights 
create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will 
be ENA.

I would follow the Canadian model for the UK and would endorse Scott's views 
about the sophistication of the UK courts. Deals done on the ISDA form, where 
Engish law is agreed, will automatically bring the parties to the English 
courts. I think we should also consider the position under our continental 
power documents and perhaps think about crystallising in writing a policy on 
this area which is more trading oriented than the existing policy.

Paul

Scott:

The response from Richard is that we are happy with UK courts so long as our 
counterparty is in the UK, but if we have a counterparty on the continent and 
there is any chance that submission to the exclusive jurisdiction of UK 
courts might not be fully enforced in the counterparty's country, we should 
go to arbitration.  In other words, we would prefer arbitration to ending up 
in court in a jurisdiction in Europe.

Let's add this to the list of topics to discuss when I'm in London.

Thanks,

Mark

Scott Sefton
01/11/99 04:08 AM
My sense is that the market custom here is to use the English courts, not 
arbitration. I think the English commercial court judges are pretty 
sophisticated and would be able to work through the issues.

Since Paul is out this week, I haven't had a chance to speak to him about 
this. Let's wait to hear his views when he returns to the office. Thanks!

Richard:

In the US we have changed our swap agreement forms to provide for arbitration 
in order to avoid having to explain the intricacies of derivatives trading to 
judges or, God forbid, juries.  In Canada we are continuing to submit to the 
jurisdiction of Canadian courts (on the theory that there are no juries in 
civil actions and arbitration is rarely used in Canadian contracts 
generally).  As we are presently in the process of revising our UK swap 
agreement forms, I guess it's time to revisit the issue as it applies to UK 
agreements.  Currently we agree to UK law and the jurisdiction of UK courts 
(where there are no juries in civil actions).  Should this continue to be our 
policy or should we begin going for arbitration in the UK contracts also?  I 
would ask Paul and Scott to let Richard and me know if arbitration is widely 
enough used in UK agreements that we can get away with asking for it.

Thanks,

Mark

Dave:

Here is the agreement I received from London which I have revised to apply to 
the Chicago situation.  Let's consider this a rough draft at present.  It 
does identify some interesting issues regarding how this will work.  let's 
get together and go through it and see what we need and what we don't.  Let 
me know what time works for you.

Will the Reuters feed contain a time stamp?  Some other sites let you know 
what  time the trade was done that resulted in the quote.

Dear Mark

Do you know of any legal issue that there could be about adding our own time 
stamp to a stock quote from Reuters (so that people viewing the site would 
know when the stock quotes were last updated by us)?

Let me know if I should direct this question to someone else.

Thanks Mark

Jay

We may have a problem with adding our own time stamp.  First, I believe our 
agreement with Reuters limits our ability to modify their content and 
restricts what we can say about the current nature of the quotes (they are 
time delayed) and second, we don't want our time stamp to make people believe 
that the quote was even current as of that time - since it won't be.  It 
might be ok to have the entire quotes section headed by a line indicating 
when it was last refreshed.  Many sites providing quotes like this have a 
line (usually towards the bottom) indicating the delay period and most people 
using those sites know they have to refresh their screen to update them.  
Jason Peters is the expert on the terms of that agreement, so if you still 
feel like you need to add something you might check with him.

	James Bruce
	06/28/2000 11:26 AM
		
Mark

As I understand it, the answer is 'no'--we get a quote from Reuters but not 
the time stamp.  The time stamp that would appear is the one that we place 
next to it, telling the user when the quote was placed on the site.  So if 
you happen along at noon and you see 'ENE 70 9am', you know that you're most 
certainly not getting a recent price.

Paul -

I think we handled this in Phase I through the Legal and Privacy Statement 
which is available through a link from each EnronOnline page, including the 
home page.  If memory serves, the advice (including the language for the 
Legal and Privacy Statement) came from Clifford Chance.  Justin will probably 
be able to fill you in on our thinking at the time.  Will that be sufficient 
for Phase II?  We can revise the Legal and Privacy Statement if that is 
necessary.

services of EnronOnline as we are offering a system which would allow a 
registered user to enter into financial products. This would inculde the 
EnronOnline main Home page in addition to all the new URLs that we are 
setting up for the different markets.
Paul should be able to suppply theh standard disclaimner language required.

Unfortunately, they had nothing to do with EnronOnline.   It was a promo 
video we can't use.

They were a company that was subcontracted out to do a promotional video for 
EnronOnline.  The people we contracted with is the one Enron uses for all 
videos - I believe are suing Hydrogen as the video is unusable.

Hi all;

There is some coverage of Enron Online through a highlighted site of the day 
on Macromedia.  A company called Hydrogen Interactive is highlighted, and one 
of the highlighted claim to fames of Hydrogen is some work that they did for 
Enron Online.  This should increase Enron exposure in the techworld as this 
macromedia site is well followed.  Links below.

Just to let you know that I have approved the following for Carol:

1. In addition to the 6 weeks that Enron allows for leave, Carol will add to 
that period by using any remaining vacation time that she has for 2000 (I

2. After that time is used up, Carol will be on an unpaid leave of absence

1.  I changed 'standard" to 'familiar' and deleted the reference to price 
discovery since these are elements of futures contracts, comparison to which 
we would like to avoid.  If the price reference is important, 'transparency' 
would work as a replacement for 'discovery.'

2.  The changes to the last paragraph are to avoid the suggestion that the PA 
and Reg. forms can be filled out online (they are available to be downloaded 
but must be signed and sent to us offline).

What do you know about the issue of electronic signatures?  Is this service 
or a similar service something we should further explore?

I received this solicitation from this company last week.  Do we have any 
interest in discussing anything further with them?  (all of the attachments 
appear to be messed up, but the website provides more detail)

thanks

Dave,
Thank you for the prompt reply.
There are many areas where electronic signatures can reduce business costs
and enable new applications.  But, most importantly Enron and Enron Online
needs to know they can trust an electronic signature.  AlphaTrust can
serve as the 3rd party managing your electronic signatures including risk
management.  There are many costs associated with implementing an
electronic signature service with the polices and legal requirements.  And
typically there can be a 12-18 month time frame to implement.

AlphaTrust provides the infrastructure,
AlphaTrust provides the legal framework and fraud protection across all
jurisdictions including internationally,
AlphaTrust can enable your business to get started quickly.

I will call you next week to follow-up.  If you like we can coordinate a
call with your legal counsel and my CEO who understands the laws to a
great extent.

Thank you,
Randall Whitfield

Do you know when they are building the walls around the cube we designated 
for Janet Moore?  She is concerned.

Do you see any problems with a customer having the ability to chat with an

I'm going to put together a very short form of consent to obtain from those

Please look over the proposed language below and advise.

Tana and I were unable to find anything useful here.  David Mitchell thought 
he might find something for us in his files and will send it to us but as he 
remembers it, we never got very far with the details.  He probably just 
advised that if we ever did set up a CTA that it should be completely 
separate - both in legal entity and staff - from our trading activities and 
should be Chinese Wall fenced  as well.  I'll send over whatever we receive 
from him and warned him that you might be calling.

My comments:

It's not clear to me what it means to say that Joe Hockey "joined" in the 
launch (end of first paragraph).
They may be planning to update this just before release but the numbers in 
the fourth paragraph have increased (I think it's up to $90 bil.) .
The word "values" should probably be "value" in the last line of the fourth 
paragraph.

Attached is a first draft of a press release announcing the availability of 
Australian and Japan weather derivatives through EnronOnline.  We currently 
plan to issue this press release on May 26, in conjunction with a briefing 
event in Sydney.  However, there is a slight possibility that the 
announcement will be moved up to July 19.  Since there are a number of 
subsequent approval steps, your early review and comments would be 
appreciated.

Dave, please let me know whether you would like to run this by Louise now or 
have me make any recommended changes and send it to her directly, later.

Thank you for your attention to this request.  I will be in the office 
(1-713-646-6423) for the remainder of the week if you want to discuss this.

John 

Will this only be available inside the house?

AtHome dialed Excite's number and Compaq is on hold....

AtHome agreed to purchase XCIT today for $7 billion. This was
a significant premium over the current stock price but when
you are an Internet stock this could be a one day move.

Rumors are flying that Compaq is preparing to make a major
Internet purchase maybe as early as tomorrow. Lycos is the
most mentioned possible target.

This Internet mania helped power the Nasdaq to another record
close and is credited with pulling the Dow out of another
valuation worry induced profit taking session. How can you
be bearish about the market in general when the tech stocks
are continuing to beat earnings estimates and blow away whisper
numbers.

Microsoft announced after the close and showed just how big
the $5 bln gorilla really is. The $5 bln was sales for last
quarter. MSFT announced $.73 vs estimates of $.59 and blew
away the whisper number of $.62. Microsoft was trading up +5.00
after the close. There was no split announcement and this could
be attributed to the trial publicity. They don't want to appear
too prosperous for the penalty phase. The conference call was
typically pessimistic as they tried to keep a lid on analyst's
estimates for the future. I would expect MSFT to gap open on
Wednesday.

The futures are up +6.50 at 7:10 ET and we give the credit to
MSFT and several other announcements after the bell. The fly
in the ointment could be the Alan Greenspan testimony tomorrow
in Washington. He is sure to be asked some "irrational exuberance"
type questions and the answers could be earth shaking. Some
analysts say Mr. G. has been criticized so severely by congress
for his previous market moving performances that future comments
will likely be constrained. Don't bet the farm on this. Alan
is tasked with many insurmountable projects one of which is
keeping the U.S. markets under control. The recent Internet
"froth" is something that other Fed governors have pointed at
in the past as a sign of a speculative bubble. So even though
the futures are up now, we may see some weakness before the
testimony. If we get by without any earthquake comments then
the week could continue up strongly. The Brazil problem could
even be a muzzle for Mr. G. Better to be quiet than roil the
markets and have to lower rates again next month to rescue them
again.

Clinton gets a major play tonight with the televised State of
the Union speech. He is under a strong spotlight as people look
for signs of cracks in the presidential armor. What should he do?
Pull out some heavy firepower! He is planning just that. Clinton
will unveil his support for a plan to take some Social Security
funds and put them into the market in a retirement savings account
program. Estimates in the $500-700 bln range are being tossed
about. This is not a new concept but his support for this popular
plan is new and timely given the other problems he is facing.
Maybe we should keep his feet to the fire longer if he is going
to do us favors like this. Not only would I rather my Social
Security was gaining ground in an account of this style but can
you imagine the market impact of a $700 bln inflow of cash?
Don't count your chickens yet but stay tuned for plan details
if it is ever approved. Opponents claim losses could occur if
a long term bear market were to appear.

I got considerable email about the 10% plan in Sunday's commentary.
Some good and some bad. Most of the good came from traders that
started putting this type of plan into action several months ago
when I wrote about it last. Most of them have multiplied their
accounts by several hundred percent. The negative mail seemed to
come from readers that were new to the newsletter and had small
accounts and were adamant that you should only settle for 200-300%
returns on every trade. We will see what kind of mail I get several
weeks from now when we start publishing the results from the readers
who are going to implement the plan. I had many readers email that
they were going to faithfully try it and report back. Good Luck!
The first ten who can show ten trades will win a years subscription.
Anybody can still play. Just send a recap of your completed plays
after 1/17/99 using the 10-20% plan from Sundays newsletter.

This is going to be an interesting week. Keep your options open
and make those trades. With the put/call ratio at .42 and the
advances only barely beating the declines 1506/1492, we are not
out of the woods yet. Tommorrow could be another record breaker
for the Nasdaq but the broader market internals are still weak.
Just three stocks in the Dow accounted for over +60 points today.
T +7.75, IBM +7.06, GM +4.69. The odds are real good that these
stocks will not be the leaders tomorrow and new leaders are hard
to find. Without these huge gains today we would have been very
negative. -46 without accounting for the positive impact they
had on other Dow components. Keep your fingers crossed.

Good Luck

Jim Brown

Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
************************************************************

Option Speculators Quiet ahead of State of the Union Address

With the State of the Union Address and Greenspan scheduled to
speak tomorrow, not much was revealed in the market today with
respect to market sentiment.  Pinnacle is still tracking what
option speculators do over the next couple of days for clues as
to where the broader market is likely to go.

We are entering a new expiration period and therefore some of the
indexes and put/call ratios will become volatile over the next
couple of days as options traders establish new positions.

Pinnacle is still concerned by the excessive Bullish sentiment as
tracked by Investors Intelligence latest poll - 60% Bullish, %30
Bearish.  This is the highest level for bullish sentiment that
we have seen for a while.

Pinnacle's short-term indicators are still flashing bearish
overtones over the near-term so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.  Any questions regarding
market sentiment can be directed at:

PICKS WE DROPPED
****************
When we drop a pick it doesn't mean we are recommending a sell
on that play. Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.
We drop a pick because something happened to change its
profile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we
don't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.
We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are
unfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we
want them to look at any current pick as a valid play.

CALLS:
******

None.

PUTS:
******

XCIT $110.00 +42.50 (+42.50) Gapped up on buy out news from
At Home (ATHN). Represents one of the biggest Internet deals
to date. Pinnacle, therefore, dropping XCIT. It does
underscore one of the benefits of buying a put instead of
shorting the stock. Only the premium is lost on the $42 gap.

BMCS $41.50 +1.44 (+1.44) Pinnacle dropping software firm
after BMCS closed above key $41 benchmark and the Software
Index (CWX) closed in record territory.

PICK NEWS - CALLS
*******************************************************
SUNW $105.31 +4.88 (+4.88)  This could be a huge week for
Sun Microsystems.  Already, the horses are off and running.
On Tuesday, Sun added +$4.88 to set another all time high in
intraday trading at $105.44.  In an awesome display of
strength, it broke and held above its former resistance level
of $104.50.  Maybe the move was propelled by some formidable
press releases.  Royal Philips Electronics NV and the Sony
Corp. will announce an alliance with SUNW.  The plan is to use
Sun's Jini, a form of the Java programming language, to develop
software that can network entertainment devices and appliances
by using the Internet.  The Sharper Image, Digital Video
Express, 1-800-FLOWERS, Egghead.com, Inc., and Brite Voice
Systems have all turned to Sun's highly reliable servers,
storage, and software products to handle their growing needs.
More than likely the stock is taking off because of Sun's
earnings announcements which are due out after the market
closes on Thursday Jan. 21st.  Earnings estimates for SUNW
are $0.66.  Along with a solid earnings report, we are
predicting a 2:1 stock split announcement.  SUNW last split
in November of 1996 when the stock was trading near $60.
With 950 mln shares authorized and only 380 mln outstanding
they have plenty of room for a split.  After MSFT's huge
earnings explosion, the techs should take off tomorrow,
but then again investor enthusiasm will be fighting
investor fear with Greenspan speaking on Wednesday.

MYG $64.69 +0.44 (+0.44)  Maytag is looking good so far this
week.  The turn around in the market on Tuesday seemed to
help Maytag add +$0.44 on the day.  Hopefully the market will
continue to stabilize and help MYG challenge its latest
resistance level of $66.00 which isn't too far away
considering Maytag inched up to $65.25 in intraday trading.
Maytag announces its earnings on Feb. 4th and remains one of
our split candidates.

FTL $18.00 +$1.31 (+1.31) Even though we are playing FTL as a
take over play, (on rumors), with this weeks news that the
clothing maker is now the exclusive apparel supplier for
all 56 Planet Hollywood Cafes, FTL still opened on a down
note.  But picked up the pace and shot up to $18.75 for
the daily high, then settling down to close at $18.00.
Rumors had a $23.00 buy out announcement coming on last
Tuesday but as we all know, it didn't show. FTL is still
showing volatility, so be careful with this one.

CCU $63.13  +$2.69 (+2.69)  CCU was added as a play this
weekend and did not disappoint us on the first day of trading
News about this new concept in Internet communications
(digital radio) is all around the street.  By investing
in the research that will carry Net surfing to new levels,
CCU might just catch that big wave.  CCU opened and tested
it's support of $60.00 by dipping its toes below the water
line at $59.62.  Then came up for a big gulp of air to
$64.00, and caught a good wave to finish at $63.12 on
the day. Protect your profits, while watching for tomorrow's
next call of "surfs up"!

EMC $102.13 +2.06 (+2.06) EMC just keeps going up.  It set a
new 52 week high today, and closed at the high.  There was an
interesting article at MSN MoneyCentral comparing EMC and its
rival NTAP.  An observation by the article was that every bit
of new e-mail, every sale over the Internet, and every extra
page view increases the need to build more storage into the
Internet.  It also pointed out that EMC has just begun selling
software to its customer base.  Software sales are expected to
grow from $400 million in 1998 to $1 billion by 2001.  EMC
reports earnings before the open on 1/26 (next Tuesday).

JBL $73.75 -.13 (-.13) JBL keeps bouncing around and off its 21
day moving average which is currently at $72.82.  We really
need something to get this stock going again.  We have not had
any news, and JBL doesn't release earnings until March.  JBL's
two main competitors, SLR and SCI, both went up today.  JBL has
been following these two, so maybe JBL will start moving up.
Otherwise, its chart is starting to flatten out and it looks
like its momentum is slowing.  Wait for confirmation of upward
movement before initiating any new trades.

UTX $109.00 .69 (-.69) UTX gapped open this morning and then
traded down the rest of the day.  There was an article today
about the run that UTX has been on since October in seeming
defiance of a slowing global economy.  UTX does about 55% of
its business overseas.  Analysts pointed out that the company's
forecast of 15% growth in 1999 has been one of the keys to its
recent run.  UTX releases earnings this Thursday.  Only play
UTX if the Dow is moving up, otherwise wait for the earnings
release on Thursday to see which direction UTX is headed.
There is the possibility of a split announcement with their
earnings but we don't feel that strongly about it.

QCOM $66.50 +2.63 (+2.63) QCOM announced earnings today of 65
cents per share and blew away the estimate of 59 cents per
share.  QCOM also reported the highest quarterly revenues in
its 13-year history.  Revenues were $941 million for the first
quarter of fiscal 1999, an increase of 20 percent over the
first quarter of fiscal 1998.  Net income for the first quarter
was $49 million compared to $37 million for the first quarter
of fiscal 1998, a 32 percent increase.  In other news, QCOM's
joint venture with Microsoft announced their first service
offering, named Revolv.  Revolv is a service that will provide
mobile professionals with secure access to information using a
variety of wireless or mobile devices form anywhere they
travel.  QCOM should have no trouble with its old 52 week high
of $67.38 tomorrow.

DELL $82.13 +3.13 (+3.13)  More un-noticed, great
news.  "Dell has become a force to be reckoned with in the
personal workstation market," said Tom Copeland,
workstation analyst at IDC.  "Dell's workstation market
share grew at 186 percent, substantially more than the
industry average of 36 percent, and far more than any other
vendor"(Business Wire). Dell is now tied with Hewlett
Packard as the number 1 producer of personal work stations.
They announce new products weekly without fanfare.  Dell
closed at a new all-time high today on average volume in
the wake of stellar NASDAQ gains.  Volume was 14 million
shares, a little light for our taste.  But we'll take a $3
gain any way we can get it.  Look for Dell to move up more,
market permitting.  Wait for small pullbacks to scale into
a position.  Earnings to be announced February 16.

CSCO $106.38 +4.69 (+4.69)  Cisco closed $0.12 off its
high of the day.  Nice show of strength on 21% higher
than average volume.  No earth shaking news, but
Cisco has announced 3 new programs to not just sell
equipment to service providers, but design, manage and
implement its installation for maximum efficiency and least
cost to the client.  More important to the bigger picture,
CSCO is the big beneficiary in developing the Internet,
including providing equipment for the AT&T/TCI deal.
Looking strong, but after 3 days of higher closings, keep
an eye out for the dip, and then make your move.
Resistance is $108.  Still a split candidate.  Look for
earnings February 2.

AOL $150.50 +4.00 (+4.00)  Not much AOL news since last
week.  Today's Internet spotlight held all eyes on @Home's
proposed purchase of Excite, which should have thrown some
competitive cold water on AOL, but it didn't.  Even on 60%
of average volume, AOL added $4.00.  We'll feel a lot
better when AOL adds volume to confirm the upward price
movement.  In the meantime, AOL adds more tension to the
rubber band as it consolidates toward a "snap" date between
now and earnings scheduled to be announced on January 27th
after 5:00pm ET.  AOL is also a split candidate at these
price levels (over $120).  We anticipate a split along with
earnings.  For the next couple of days, target shooting
your entry to coincide with the dip after opening should
get a better entry.  As always, confirm market direction
first.

WCOM $77.25 +2.19 (+2.19) Baby Bells lost another one in
court today in an attempt to over turn provisions of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 which are effectively
preventing from entering the long distance business.  Under
the Act, the Bell companies are prohibited from offering
long distance service to their local customers until they
have opened their local networks to competitors (Reuters).
Though this is beneficial for all long distance carriers,
WCOM appeared to be an indirect beneficiary of AT&T news.
Today's volume was 20% over average, a very good sign.  We
look for WCOM to test and break through resistance of $79,
having cleared $76 easily.  The more conservative play is
to wait until it breaks $79 and holds.  But in light of the
telco sector's momentum, we can make a case for jumping in
after confirming market direction.  Just don't try to catch
a falling knife if profit taking sets in.

T $91.50 +7.25 (+7.25)  Welcome to what seems like
the newest Internet play.  Michael Armstrong, AT&T's
chairman, is trying with measurable success, to turn the
Queen Mary on a dime, from a copper-based dinosaur to a
broadband fiber based communications powerhouse.  AT&T is
actually a big beneficiary of @Home's offer to purchase
Excite.  Here's why:  @Home's largest shareholder is TCI
who is about to be absorbed into AT&T.  With Excite, AT&T
now has a substantial "portal" to the Internet which can be
delivered over TCI's cable infrastructure.  AT&T had, from
what we could tell, its largest 1-day gain ever on volume
exceeding the average by 80%.  Resistance has been
obliterated.  The sky is the limit, market pending.  Watch
out for profit taking on such a large 1-day run-up, and buy
the dip.

MSFT $155.63 +5.88 (+5.88)  MSFT blew away earnings
estimates true to form, by posting a fiscal Q2 net of $0.73
a share, well ahead of the First Call mean estimate of
$0.59.  Revenues rose 36.8% to $4.9 billion.  As of this
writing, we have heard no news of a split just yet.  But in
after hours trading, the stock was up $9.00 in the $164
range.  For those of you with a position held over earnings
(which we normally don't recommend), congratulations.
Remember to protect your profits with stop-loss/stop-limit
orders.  Also, don't use a market order to enter a play in
the morning, you could be filled at the high of the day.
Instead, if MSFT sells off in the first 30-45 minutes of
trading, enter the play on the rebound.

TLAB $84.63 -1.31 (-1.31)  No news to be found on
TLAB today, just old-fashioned profit taking on 1/3 less
than average volume.  This really is a "buy the dip"
opportunity.  We still like TLAB and expect further gains
when investors de-couple from today's Internet magnet.
Confirm upward direction before entering a play.

DIS $36.50 +.50 (+.50) Disney edged a little higher today.
A judge dismissed the $20 million that had been awarded to
Children's Broadcasting Corp. when Disney ended it's
agreement to sell national advertising for a Children's
Broadcasting deal with AAHS World Radio.  Meanwhile,
Infoseek, Disney's partner in the Internet portal GO
NETWORK (and 43% owned by Disney), has completed its
acquisition of Quando, another Internet company.
Infoseek's Ultraseek Server powers the web site search
capability of many top private and state universities, as
well as several corporations.  A report shows a drop of 1%
in all theme park attendance in 1998. However, for Disney,
that may not be too great a cause for concern. Its Magic
Kingdom saw a 23% jump in attendance only the year before.

NOKA $144.00 +5.38 (+5.38) Nokia blasted to a new intra-day
high today of $145.75, and set a new closing high as well:
$144.00.  Nokia has chosen to use the high performance,
highly secure processing products made by Chrysalis-ITS.
Separately, Dolphin Telecom, of France, has chosen Nokia to
supply and install the infrastructure equipment for its
Tetra digital wireless communications network in France.
Nokia plans to double production of mobile phones at its
plant in Bochum, Germany to meet increasing demand. The
entire telecommunications market is hot now, and Nokia is
one of the top ten providers of telecommunications products
in the world, and the leading maker of cellular phones.
Looking strong, Nokia is also a split candidate.

MU $73.00 +1.69 (+1.69) Micron gained $1.69 on the day,
even as Novellus dropped after reporting earnings only in
line with analysts' expectations. The pre-earnings run-up
for Novellus had been driven by investors' expectations.
Robert Maire, an analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin, and
Jennette, issued cautious statements about the semi-
conductor industry. He believes that it has not started a
full recovery yet and chip stocks are ahead of themselves.
Intel and Micron must not have gotten the news, for they
were both up today.  Intel's numbers showed a 12% surprise,
and Micron is reportedly doing well this quarter.  MU's
current quarter doesn't end until February, though, and
earnings won't be out until March--enough time for a bit of
an earnings run.

PRIA $35.50 +1.00 (+1.00) Up a full dollar is a decent rise
on a $35 stock.  In fact, this stock was only down one of
the last 5 trading days, and that was on a down market day.
PRIA has been steadily climbing since its early December
correction and it looks like it intends to keep going. The
same factors helping the semi-conductor industry will help
drive up this stock: increasing demand for computers and
other equipment that use chips, and a decrease in the
formerly overabundant supply of chips.

LXK $102.38 +4.31 (+4.31) LXK had a stellar day today with its
rise of 4%. This seems to be a pre-earnings run. We have
noted in past commentaries that LXK has had earnings runs of
an average of $6.00 over the last four quarters. It seems that
this quarter will be no different. There is added expectation
that LXK will announce a split. We have the earnings date as
January 25th. If we hear different we will update you. LXK had
an interesting article written about it's trials in selling
printers to China. The problem wasn't the printers themselves,
but the paper they were printed on. The paper was so difficult
that LXK sent reams of paper to their researchers and told them
to develop a printer that would print on the ancient paper. Shows
the extent at which companies are willing to go in this world
economy.

ATI $92.63 +9.25 (+9.25) ATI did as expected and gapped open
on Tuesday. The open was $95.75, over $3 above the close of
the day. ATI and VOD have stated the deal needs to be completed
by December 31st, 1999. The deal states that ATI shareholders
will get 1/2 share of VOD plus $9 in cash. This will cause the
value of the deal to change as time goes by. ATI is obviously
trading well below the true value of the deal, but this is
common until the deal is finalized.  If you want to play
the rest of this deal (since currently ATI should be worth
$101.25 based on VOD's close today):

*We suggest waiting for the next dip.
BUY CALL FEB-85 ATI-BQ OI= 6868 at $10.00 SL=7.50 ITM $7.63
BUY CALL FEB-90 ATI-BR OI=10024 at $ 6.88 SL=5.25
BUY CALL APR-90 ATI-DR OI=  658 at $ 9.25 SL=6.75

LU $114.06 +3.81 (+3.81) LU had a pretty good day on Tuesday
and closed just $.75 off its highs for the day.  We are now
just $6 from LU's 52-week high.  We have verified LU's earnings
date.  Earnings will be announced before the market opens on
the 21st of January (this Thursday). We are seeing a nice
earnings run which should continue until the earnings release.
Watch for pullbacks to initiate new plays. There are always
times to purchase, just be patient and buy the dips.

XIRC $42.00 +2.13 (+2.13) XIRC shot up today on the expectations
of it's earnings announced after the close today. We had the
earnings date as January 21st, so we apologize for the mis-
information.  For those of you that are holding XIRC, the
earnings came in at $.39 a share.  This is $.04 more than
estimates and a penny ahead of the whisper. If anyone is
thinking of buying into XIRC, wait for a pullback after the
gap open.  XIRC's earnings were $.11 same quarter last year.
XIRC unveiled high-speed ISDN data support for its Global-
Access RealPort Ethernet+Modem and modem-only integrated
PC cards. This technology connects notebook PCs at 128Kbps.

COF $131.50 +1.06 (+1.06) COF announced earnings today and
they came in right on estimates of $1.04. This originally
pushed shares of COF down slightly. As the day played on,
COF traded up and ended up at its high of the day. The whisper
number was the same as the estimate. COF is sitting right
around its 52-week high. If the market continues to trend up
then COF should be a leader. Their earnings rose from $.86 a
share in the same quarter last year.  We were a little bit
disappointed that they did not announce a split.  We are
guessing that COF's management does not have a split clause
in their compensation.  They receive some pretty big bonuses
if they can get COF's share price to $175 within the next
2 1/2 years.

CHKPF $55.50 +4.25(+4.25) CHKPF took off today and closed just
1/2 a point off its intraday highs. CHKPF blew by its prior 52-
week high on strong volume. CHKPF's earnings are on the 21st,
and we are seeing the effects of an earnings run. CHKPF has
historically blown away earnings estimates. CHKPF's last five
earnings surprises have gone like this: 13,22,28,23,78. These
are percentage surprises. Numbers like these cause an earnings
run. Though a split isn't eminent, they do have shares to do
a split.

ETH $49.56 +.63 (+.63) ETH traded in a range of $49.13 to $50.75.
Not a bad day considering that ETH is not in the technology
arena.  ETH announced earnings on the 13th of January and beat
estimates by $.02.  The general feeling out there is that
furniture stores had a great holiday season.  ETH is still $17
away from its 52-week high.  This leaves a lot of room to go.

YHOO $323.00 +6.00 (+6.00) YHOO had an interesting day.  YHOO
opened at $340, which was a premium of $23 above Friday's close.
YHOO traded as high as $345 and as low as $318.  YHOO got it's
boost from the purchase of XCIT by @Home.  This has stirred up
speculation that other consolidation is in the works.  YHOO has
had a strong correction over the last week and this could be
the start of a new Internet frenzy. This remains a risky play.
Wait for upward confirmation.  YHOO continues to be a blue-chip
of the Internet.  The price of Exodus Communications rose 34%
from the mention that it is in a deal with YHOO. Remember, YHOO
has a split coming up at the end of the month (about 3 weeks).

F - Ford Motor Co. $63.94 (+1.94)

Everyone knows who Ford is and what they do, but did you also
know that Ford is not only the second largest producer of
cars and trucks but is one of the largest providers of
financial services in the world?

Not over twenty years ago, certain analysts had all but
the nails in the coffins of the U.S. Automobile Industry.
"A dying industry" it was said to be, "no innovation", a
"lack of direction", "inefficient".  Let's get back to reality.
Ford Motor Company has taken on a huge European market and
done quite well thank you.  Their recent acquisitions of an
aluminum stamping company, the assisting of Poland, which is
the second largest auto production country in Eastern and
Central Europe.  Plus recent media reports of Ford taking
a 10% stake in Nissan.  Almost forces you to take notice of
a company with all this potential.  We have and we are adding
Ford as a new play.

First call has Ford reporting earnings on this Thursday,
Jan. 21, while we don't recommend holding over earnings,
this play has a couple of more days of a possible run up to
the announcement.  If it posts a positive surprise, you may
want to consider jumping back in if you miss the run up.

COMBINATION PLAYS   Merger-mania dominates the telecom group...
******************************************************************
U.S. markets closed higher Tuesday and the Nasdaq hit a new record
high amid optimism about President Clinton's State of the Union
address tonight. The DOW closed up 14 points at 9355 after falling
significantly earlier in the session. Internet/Tech stocks soared,
driving the Nasdaq up 60 points to 2408.20. Traders said rounds of
program trading linked to stock index futures sent stocks lower in
the early part of the volatile session. Post-market earnings and
positive expectations forced investors to speculate in afternoon
trading and that led to a closing frenzy. Traders and analysts are
amazed that investors continue to demonstrate bullish sentiment on
Technology, Internet and Telecom issues.

Our portfolio was quite active, first the new plays: ABI was our
conservative bull-call spread (FEB45C/50C) and the prices near the
open were favorable at $2.87 debit. HUM was the calendar/time play
and the opening price for the MAY20C/FEB20C was $1.25. GMSTF moved
higher right away but there was an opportunity near 10 am to fill
the spread (FEB40P/45P) at $0.50. ELN surprised us with a morning
rally but the best we could manage without "legging" in was $0.75
credit for the FEB80C/75C bear-call spread. COF wandered for most
of the day, the average price for the FEB105P/110P credit spread
was $0.62.

Other activities: We closed the ATI (LEAPS/covered-calls) spread
just after the open for $9.50 credit. There just wasn't any reason
to risk a loss with a successful merger (shrinking volatility/time
values in the options) expected to occur. LU was another morning
exit and we closed the debit position for $3.00, (a $1.25 profit.)
FTL finally started moving again and the positive activity offered
an easy exit for our FEB15C/20C bull-call spread. A closing price
of $2.38 was available and after watching it fall last week, we
decided to take the safe route; $0.87 profit. LUV was up almost $2
at one point and the FEB22C/25C spread closed easily for $2.25 to
achieve a profit of $1.00. OXHP was a calendar position and we
opened the FEB20C at $1.25 against our existing MAY20C for a new
debit of $1.50. WCOM was another open calendar spread and we sold
the FEB75C for $5.25 to reduce the cost basis on our LEAP to $5.62.
NXTL was the final play and our GTC limit of $5.00 was filled near
the end of the day to close the call option. A profit of $2.12 was
the overall outcome for the position.

Other notable portfolio movers included: GM, up almost $5.00, SUNW
up almost $5 and CPQ was $3 higher on news of a possible Web-deal.

Today's plays are mostly speculative positions based on smaller
Internet and Telecom stocks. That's where the action is right now
and the speculation is fairly cheap...

PTEK - Premiere Technologies  $11.38   *** Internet IPO? ***

Premiere Technologies provides enhanced communications services.
PTEK services include 800-based services, voice messaging,
enhanced document distribution and conference calling. Recent
speculation and heavy option volume concerning some of the new
technology from the company. Some say it involves USA.net and the
ability to listen to your email messages and post email via voice
from any touch-tone telephone. PTEK's communications management
technology may be used for their mail engine. Others are betting
that PTEK ownership of Usa.Net and Web.Md will create revenue if
either company goes public. The recent hype of internet IPO's
make this a favorable speculation play, using current momentum
and taking advantage of overpriced options.

PLAY (speculative):

BUY  CALL MAR-12.50 TQO-CV OI=18   A=$1.68
SELL CALL FEB-12.50 TQO-BV OI=2010 B=$1.06

OMPT - Omnipoint  $14.06     *** Telecom Takeover ***

Omnipoint offers digital personal communications services (PCS) to
16 million customers in the US as well as in 30 countries (via 45
international roaming partnerships) around the globe through GSM
(global systems for mobile communications) technology. Worldwide
PCS services are obtained by the use of a subscriber information
access card. Omnipoint also designs and sells phone handsets for
vendor partners including Ericsson, Mitsubishi, Motorola, Nokia,
Northern Telecom, Sagem, and Siemens. Just another small telecom
getting attention as the merger-mania continues. The short term
momentum has this stock over-extended but the risk is worth the
reward if it finds a partner. A March position gives us time to
sell-off some of the initial debit.

Secure Computing Corporation designs, develops, markets and sells

I have attached a final copy of the Media General Confirmation.

The most recent news is that Carol has been admitted to the hospital and is 
in labor - things are looking ok.  I'll let you know if I hear anything new.

Do you have time to talk about the direct connection issues tomorrow 
(Thursday) afternoon at 3:00 NY time?  I also have some new issues regarding 
the need (or hopefully lack thereof) for written confirmations of online 
transactions which we can tee up then.

On that basis I think we can go ahead without any trouble.

Yes

Will this only be available inside the house?

Do you want to take a stab at this?  I'm happy to go over it with you if you 
are unsure.

Mark,

This request was previously made to Susan Flynn.  Confirm has had no response 
from Legal and is awaiting our word.

Since you are the most Veteran member of the team would you mind advising as 
to whether Souad's language is OK.

If I can be of further help, just let me know.

Thanks.

Susan,

Please advise on the below issue-  this trade is from June 14th, and I 
haven't heard anything back on it from your team.
Please let me know as soon as you can in order for me to send out the confirm.

Thanks,

Susan,

This deal with Anadarko is a little tricky.  It is a Gas Daily Call Option 
with a cap.  I have added the cap language in the cash settlement paragraph.  
Joe is ok with the change, but wanted to get your approval before sending out 
to CP.  Let me know if language is ok.
Thanks,

Carol had the baby at 10:15 p.m. last night.  Charles Eugene St. Clair 
weighed 8lbs 8 ounces.   

Carol is in Methodist Hospital, Room 633
6565 Fannin
Houston, TX
Phone Number is 713-790-3867

This looks fine to me.  I would feel better without the Big "E" on the screen 
since I wouldn't think you would want to give the impression that each of 
your trading floors was an Enron office.

Here is the revised confirm - let's chat about the issues I mentioned in my 
voice mail.

Excessive Optimism / Pessimism

Often times when companies release corporate earnings, the stock
will move/gap up or down depending on the level of expectation
built into the stock prior to the release date.  This level of
expectation can be measured, in part, by the Call/Put ratio and is
represented by our Pinnacle Index figure.  The average Pinnacle
Index is 2.0.  Therefore, an index appreciably higher than 2.0
reveals a high level of optimism while an index lower than 2.0
reveals a high level of pessimism.  For aggressive options traders,
we have highlighted companies reaching extreme expectation levels
below:

For example, the company with the highest and lowest expectation
reporting this week is Citrix (CTXS) and Bankers Trust (BT) with a
Pinnacle Index of 15.1 and 64, respectively.  This suggests that if
Citrix does not beat their estimate on Tuesday, they are likely to
sell-off.  Conversely, if Bankers Trust beats their estimate or
reports any favorable news, they are likely to move higher.

The Power of Sentiment Analysis

Last October (1998), Pinnacle Capital Advisors tracked corporate
earnings reports and advised subscribers about the impact that
excessive optimism and pessimism can have on the stocks's performance
following the release of its quarterly earnings report.  If you
recall, we identified several stocks that reached excessive sentiment
levels including Intel (INTC) and Pfizer (PFE).

Reporting                            Estimated   Pinnacle
Date        Company                        EPS      Index
Excessive Pessimism:
10/13 JPM   JP Morgan                     1.08        .4
10/12 C     Chrysler                       .87        .7
10/14 PFE   Pfizer                         .57        .9
10/13 GM    General Motors                 .98-      1.2
10/16 G     Gillette                       .30       1.3
10/14 MER   Merrill Lynch                  .56       1.5

The first is Intel (INTC).  The semiconductor powerhouse had
rallied ahead of its earnings report Tuesday night (10/13) and closed
at $83.88.  What's interesting is that they beat the street's estimate
by 9 cents and yet the stock gapped down the next morning (10/14).
And despite the 330 point Dow rate cut rally on Thursday (10/15), the
stock had trouble taking out its recent previous high of $85.88.  Here,
our sentiment analysis alerted subscribers that expectations had gotten
ahead of itself and that despite the good news, the stock had trouble
advancing.

We saw the opposite in the case of Pfizer (PFE).  This blue-chip
Pharmaceutical company had sold off more than 20% from its summer high
($120) to close at $95.50 before its release Tuesday night (10/13).
Here, Pfizer actually missed its estimated earnings by a nickel.
Although the stock initially gapped down the next morning, it quickly
rallied and closed higher. Our message: it's all about understanding
and managing expectations.

Pinnacle Index

What is the Pinnacle Index.  It is simply the put/call ratio at key
overhigh benchmark levels.  Typically, there should be two (2) calls
for every one (1) put.   So when this ratio reaches extremes levels,
it can presage key turning points in the stock.  The average Pinnacle
Index, therefore, should read 2.0.

One of the key components that separate OptionInvestor.com from any
other advisory services is our sentiment indicator or Pinnacle Index.
The Pinnacle Index is designed to measure the level of overhead
resistance at key overhead benchmark levels. This analysis can give
savvy option traders a jump on other traders.

It's important to note that the Pinnacle Index, like many
sentiment indicators, is a contrarian indictor.  This means
that the stock can and will go higher or lower despite what
our sentiment indicators might suggest.  However, our
experience has shown that the market is subject to a
precipitous sell-off if the Pinnacle Index reaches extreme
levels.

As we discussed, the following is revised disclosure regarding direct access 
to deal with the cost issue:

EnronOnline will assist users, upon request, in arranging for the connection 
of "T1" lines or other means of direct access to EnronOnline, as an 
alternative to internet access.   Direct access connections might enable 
users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through 
internet access.

fyi... it sound like Bobby is in serious condition. 

Thanks, 
Sharon 

I think they'll send us another update once he's out of emergency and into a 
room.? Then it's real easy to call Ben Taub to find out a room number.? The 
address is below.? It doesn't sound like he can receive visitors yet.

A. 
Thanks for the heads up.? Do you know the address to send cards?? Do you know 
if Bobby can see visitors?? Some of the folks here would like to know.

Thanks, 
Sharon

Jann, phoned this morning and asked me to pass this information to the group, 
concerning Bobby Riggins. 
Bobby is a member of a bicycle team, while cycling this weekend, he and 
other members of his team were injured by a truck.? There was one death in 
the injured group and the others with major injuries.? Bobby is one of those 
with major injuries.? He is currently in the emergency room at Ben Taub 
Hospital.? Ben Taub hospital is located at 1504 Taub Loop, Houston, Texas, 
phone number: 713-793-2000.? He cannot accept calls, visits or flowers at 
this time, since he is in the emergency room.? An update will be e-mailed, as 
soon as one is available. 

Keep Bobby, his team members and their families in your prayers.

I think it's a good idea since the provisional application is on file - 
Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so 
he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and 
appropriate look and feel (I would guess near the copyright notice and 
roughly equivalent size).

We are thinking of adding a Patent Pending message to key EnronOnline pages

Does it make sense for us to set up a meeting with you participating from 
Buenos Aires?  I'm not sure we have much to tell them at this stage - 
actually, I'm sure I don't have anything new to report but if you do that 
would be fine with me.

like to fit a meeting with you as a group or individually. 
Please let me know about your availability and if it is possible to meet with

Thank you

If you need more, there is a proposal from the documentation committee for a 
new alternative for calculating termination amounts (we heard about it in 
Amsterdam) that I think will be particularly attractive to the energy 
markets.  I don't know where this stands officially (I haven't heard any 
developments since Amsterdam) but I can find out from Bob Pickle if you want.

We should include ISDA energy definitions, CFTC matters re energy and an 
overview of power deregulation developments in North America.  I might also 
add a few items about international developments and the EEI physical power 
trading form.  I am thinking 4 slides at the most.  Is that what you want?

Mark

Current Plan:

Days away: Sept. 21 through Oct. 3 (assuming you work on the day we leave and 
go back to work the day after we return)

Wed. Sept. 20  - Leave Houston around 6:00 pm
Thur. Sept. 21   -   Arrv. London early a.m., transfer to flight to Nice
                              -  Arrv. Nice around noon?  rent car & drive to 
first hotel (less than 1 hour away); collapse
Fri. Sept. 22       -  Stay in same hotel, visit Monaco, Nice?

To make matters even more confusing, there are two Mark Taylors.  I believe 
the message you forwarded to me belongs to the Mark Taylor at EI (based in 
London).  Unfortunately, I can't forward your message to him directly (there 
seems to be a problem with the attachment).  If you still have it, can you 
send it to him at "Mark EI.London Taylor"?

I will take care of it.  Thanks for the reminder.

Rick Buy asked me to chat with Sally Beck about this and apologized for not 
having consulted with Legal before submitting the report.  He indicated that 
the results were not cast in stone and should not have been characterized, at 
least in connection with legal documentation, as mandates.  Sally has been 
out of the office but promised to call me this week once she had settled back 
in and explain the origins of these suggestions.

Mark,
     I was wondering if you had an opportunity to look up the abritration 
provision that you favor. Any help you could provide would be greatly 
appreciated. Thanks Janet 

As I mentioned in my voice-mail, this needs to go somewhere that users might 
actually see it - e.g. a news ticker story.  Simply adding it to the Legal & 
Privacy Statement, while helpful, is not sufficient.

EnronOnline will assist users, upon request, in arranging for direct access 
connection (such as a "T1" line or other means of direct access) to 
EnronOnline, as an alternative to internet access.   Direct access 
connections might enable users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is 
currently possible through internet access.

It turns out they're talking about something completely different.  I can 
fill you in on it next time we get together.

I think we're talking about a Senior Legal Specialist position.  Do you have 
the posting that we used last year (when we hired Susan Flynn)?  I think it 
would have gone out in July or August.

Please review and make any changes.

You're right, we have not agreed to the final sentence with any of our other 
counterparties.  I doubt that the EOL people will let us do it (though we can 
always ask).  I have sometimes gotten counterparties comfortable with this 
issue by suggesting that the master user id and password should be held by 
someone in the back office, the control group or even the legal department so 
that when a trader leaves the master user can immediately shut them off.  It 
seems to me that this puts the risk and responsibility for dealing with 
rogues where it belongs - why should we be at risk if one of their traders 
decides to damage the company?  Having said that, I think that even without 
the last sentence requested we are probably in that position - if we have 
actually received the notice and request for termination of the password and 
don't do it, it would be very hard to defend if we kept doing trades and they 
can show they weren't authorized.

	Leslie Hansen

Mark:

As I mentioned in my voice mail, Kennecott Coal Sales has requested the 
following modification to the ETA:

Section 6(a) shall be revised to provide that Enron shall use reasonable 
efforts to cancel CP's master user password and/or user IDs upon receipt of 
notice from CP.  Notwithstanding anything in Section 6(e) to the contrary, 
all such notices must be sent by certified mail to Enron at the following 
address:   [TO COME], or such other address as may be specified by Enron from 
time to time.  The notice shall be deemed effective five (5) days after its 
receipt by Enron.  After the effective date of the notice, the Counterparty 
shall have no liability to Enron for any Transaction initiated with the use 
of the master user password and/or user ID identified in the notice.

Please advise.

Leslie

As I mentioned in my voice-mail, this needs to go somewhere that users might 
actually see it - e.g. a news ticker story.  Simply adding it to the Legal & 
Privacy Statement, while helpful, is not sufficient.

EnronOnline is conducting a pilot program involving direct access connections 
(such as a "T1" line or other means of direct access) to EnronOnline, as an 
alternative to internet access.   Direct access connections might enable 
users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through 
internet access. 

My back office suggestion is that the master user id and password be held by 
the back office.  The master user has the ability to open and close sub-user 
(i.e. individual trader) user ids and passwords.  So if a trader leaves, the 
back office master user can immediately turn off the user id for that trader. 
 They can react much more quickly than we can and certainly faster than 5 
days.  I suppose the remaining risk there is that the back office person is 
the disgruntled employee.

	Leslie Hansen
	07/20/2000 02:23 PM
		
I agree that it's their responsibility for dealing with rogues.  However, 
Kennecott's position is that all they can do is notify us and rely on us to 
cut off access once they terminate an employee.  They cannot ensure that the 
employee doesn't write the password on his or her palm to take it with them.  
Apparently, they have had some bad experiences with disgruntled traders.  
Thus, their proposal that their notice must be by certified mail and the 
proviso that we have 5 days to act on the notice.

I have a question regarding the back office suggestion -- are you suggesting 
that no individual trader be given an id but rather you give the id to 
someone in the back office and the trader has to call that individual to 
actually submit a trade.  If that's not what you intend, even if the back 
office or control group holds the password, if the trader knows the password 
to get into EOL, what's to stop him or her from continuing to access EOL 
after leaving the company.  The back office can notify EOL that the password 
should be cancelled, but if we don't act on the notice, what is left for the 
CP to do.

Who should be my EOL contact on this issue and other ETA issues?

The only changes were in the definition of Floating Price - otherwise this is 
the same as the "no-out" version we prepared last week.

Sally did not realize that the recommendations as drafted had referred to the 
master agreement process at all.  She indicated that if she had noticed that 
she would have deleted the reference and will revise the recommendations to 
that effect now.  The net result is that the only change regarding financial 
trading documentation will be to designate someone on the confirmation desk 
in Calgary to handle derivatives confirmations.  Jeff Sorensen will 
coordinate with Peggy Hedstrom.

I will be leaving at noon on August 4.  Please add to the calendar.

Any chance you can help with this?

Hi.  I am hoping you can help me.  We are putting together a cost summery of 
the events that took place in 1999.  I have come across an approval form as 
well as a cost estimate for an ECT Legal Conference in The Woodlands on 
October 28-29, 1999.  I do not have final numbers for this event.  Do you by 
any chance have a total cost?  Please let me know if you have anything that 
can help me.

Prepay team;

Here's the latest on the restructurings that we thought we might be doing 
earlier in the week:

Molly and Chase have worked out an arrangement whereby we can post collateral 
under the existing deals without adversely affecting our cash position.  
Therefore a fast-track restructuring will not be needed at this time.  Chase 
and Teresa will negotiate an addendum to the credit annex allowing us to 
re-hypothecate collateral, and Molly is currently working out the operational 
issues associated with doing so.

We still intend to restructure the existing deals over the next few months or 
so; I'll advise as we get closer.

Best-
Davis

Just a reminder that when original documents are received on this transaction 
(which should be soon given that they went out Monday night), an original 
incumbency certificate for Media General should be included.  This should be 
delivered to Mark Taylor for his records.  Mark agreed to waive the 
requirement that the certificate be delivered at closing with the 
understanding that it would come promptly thereafter.

PICK NEWS - CALLS, continued

PRIA $36.25 -.69 (+1.75) Yesterday, PRIA gapped up and set a
new 52 week high of $37.50 shortly after the open. It finished
slightly higher on the day. Today, however, it succumbed to
market pressure and headed lower with the rest of the chip
sector. (We are including PRIA in the chip sector, since it
makes the automation systems that chip makers use in their
clean-room manufacturing operations.) Even though PRI
Automation was lower today, it is still up from its close on
Tuesday, and that shows a lot more strength than many of the
other technology stocks are showing. This stock keeps a low
news profile - it's momentum is what we are watching. Earnings
are January 28th.

NOKA $145.00 5.00 (+6.38) After rising to a another new 52
week high of $155.38 by mid-day yesterday, Nokia sold off,
along with the rest of the market. Today, though, it lost $5.00
in a market that saw most of the telecommunication and tech
stocks sell off sharply.  There was no bad news on Nokia to
point a finger at; investors simply wanted to lock in profits
when they saw the market moving down.  Nokia is supplying the
products that will hasten the coming wave of digital data
transmission over mobile phones.  We are playing Nokia both
on momentum, and as a split candidate.

Earnings are due out before the open on  January 29th, and
that represents a strong possibility for a split announcement.
If it doesn't occur then, we may have to wait until the
shareholders meeting at the end of March.
(We doubt we'll have to wait for the shareholder meeting.
NOKA has unlimited authorization for shares outstanding).

DELL Computer $84.19 -1.13 (+5.19)  Pump up the volume!
The market got that message in yesterday's action sent Dell
up over $3 on 25 million shares.  Average is 19 million.
If Microsoft has blowout earnings, Dell is partially
responsible and should have big earnings too.  Today, Dell
lost just $1.13 on 20 million shares; actually a victory in
light of the 70 point loss on the NASDAQ today (remember
Dell is the 4th most weighted stock in the NASDAQ 100).
Dell still offering little news.  When they do, the news is
big, though (recently) sometimes unnoticed.  For those with
patience, Dell should ultimately give us one of the better
plays, market willing.  Wait for pullbacks, then the bounce
to scale into a position.  Earnings to be announced
February 16th.

CSCO - Cisco Systems $101.13 -4.81 (-0.38)  What goes up
must come down, or so the clich goes.    We stated
Tuesday, "looking strong, but after 3 days of higher
closings, keep an eye out for the dip".  Dip happens.  CSCO
closed flat yesterday at $106.13 after rising as high as
$109 inter-day, at what looked like would be an excellent
week.  CSCO couldn't hold the new high yesterday and gave
up all of this week's profits on 19 million shares in
today's trading.  No analyst has chosen to downgrade CSCO,
but off-handed remarks, like "overextended", pop into news
service comments.  Still an excellent play when fund managers
put that 401K cash to work.  Resistance is $108.  Still a
split candidate.  Look for earnings February 2.

AOL - America Online $141.00 -7.50 (-5.50)  Whoosh!  That's
the sound of the rug being pulled from underneath the
Internet stocks.  AOL suffered too.  Honestly, it could be
a lot worse.  AMZN and YHOO are down approximately 46% and
40% respectively from their highs, while AOL's price looks
more like consolidation.  AOL is sitting near its 30 day
moving average and should bounce off it if the internet
sector doesn't experience complete meltdown from here.
With internets already well off their highs, a lot of air
has now escaped the bubble.  A further huge sell-off is not
as likely.  Bottom line:  AOL has rapidly growing real
earnings from an outstanding Christmas and is a split
candidate at these price levels (over $120).  We anticipate
a split along with earnings to be announced January 27
after 5:00pm ET.  Only 4 trading days left.  We think an
earnings run has got to start soon.  Confirm market
direction backed by strong volume before playing, or target
shoot for a better entry.  Still an Internet; iron stomach
and ice in the veins required. [almost every commentator
about the internet stock meltdown today made an exception
for AOL.  They all felt that AOL would comeback and was
the best play in the entire sector]

WCOM - MCIWorldCom $73.88 -3.63 (-1.18)  Not much news to
report, just Brazil/China/Greenspan jitters and profit
taking.  We still like WCOM as a fast growing
internet/broadband play.  Big Three long distance
providers, WCOM included, are winning court battles against
Baby Bells and eating their lunch in the process.  WCOM is
sitting above support of $72.  Real resistance is at $79.
Weighted at number 5 in the NASDAQ 100 makes WCOM a target
for fund managers with $9 billion in fresh cash.  Today,
Morgan Stanley upped the price target to $95.  Confirm
market direction before playing.  As we said Tuesday, don't
try to catch a falling knife if (more) profit taking sets
in.

T - AT&T $88.06 -3.44 (+3.81)  Tuesday, we cautioned,
"Watch out for profit taking on such a large 1-day run-up,
and buy the dip".  We hope you protected your profits.  The
dip may not yet be over.  AT&T held up relatively well in
yesterday afternoon's and today's sell-off by gaining $0.38
yesterday and losing only $3.44 today, both on heavy
volume.  This indicates real strength since T was up $7.50
in Tuesday's trading - the market could have taken it all
back, but didn't.  Though largely forgotten today, AT&T is
a big beneficiary of @Home's offer to purchase Excite.
Here's why:  @Home's largest shareholder is TCI who is
about to be absorbed into AT&T.  With Excite, AT&T now has
a substantial "portal" to the internet which can be
delivered over TCI's cable infrastructure.  Today Morgan
Stanley raised their price target to $105.  Near term
resistance is $91.75, it's all-time closing high; $96
thereafter.  Wait for market reversal and confirm direction
before playing.

MSFT - Microsoft $158.31 -4.31 (+8.56)  What a day for MSFT
on Wednesday in the wake of blow-out earnings; up as much
as $12 to $167.75 inter-day from Tuesday's closing price of
$155.63. Justice Depart or not, MSFT is firing on all
cylinders.  Look mom!  No material effect on earnings!
Despite giving some back in today's down-draft, fund
managers can't argue with a 73% earnings increase and will
put new cash to work shortly, keeping demand (and volume)
high, which should push the price further.  Salomon Smith
Barney raised their price target to $200 while reiterating
their "buy" rating.   We view this pullback as a buying
opportunity.  As always, confirm market direction before
playing.

TLAB - Tellabs $84.25 +0.50 (-0.31)  No news again, but
we'll take trading volume with a price increase in the face
of overall market loss any day.  That's what we got with
TLAB.  TLAB had a bad day yesterday, giving up a $4 gain
inter-day, to close with a loss of $0.88.  Today was a
different story as TLAB experienced a 21% increase in
volume with a small gain while the rest of the market
headed bearishly south.  Since Lucent exceeded earnings,
TLAB should have a strong showing too, when they announce
after the closing bell January 25.  We surmise that
Lucent's earnings news ($.05 over estimates) coupled with
yesterday's dip presented a buying opportunity continuing
the earnings run.  We think it will run further but caution
against holding through earnings since, 70% of the time,
they fall back after the announcement.  Confirm market
direction before playing

MYG $63.75 -0.19 (-0.50)  Maytag really needs the market to
string a few positive finishes together.  Our rock is
weathering.  Its resistance level of $66.00 isn't far away.
But, market weakness is making the breakthrough a real
challenge.  Maytag is on our split candidate list and
earnings are approaching.  Feb. 4th is the expected date.
Wait for market momentum to aid MYG in ascending to new
heights before scaling into new plays.

SUNW $98.25 -7.13 (-2.19)  Do you want the good news or the
bad news first?  We will go with the good news.  As we
predicted, SUNW announced a 2:1 stock split along with it's
earnings that beat the street by a penny and crushed last
year's Q2 number.  Their net income for the second quarter
also increased 22% over last year's results.  The bad news
is profit taking in anticipation of the announcements dropped
SUNW -$7.13 on Thursday at a trade volume level that was four
times its norm of 6.88 million.  In after hours trading, the
stock continued to fall.  As reported by Joe Kernen from CNBC,
the additional plunge may have been due to confusion.  Some
thought that SUNW would miss the estimates and sold.  In an
article published just today, their CFO predicted months ago
not to expect SUNW to have earnings that beat their first
fiscal quarter.  Others thought that SUNW would crush
estimates since they are in such a hot sector.  Built up
expectations led to disappointment in the reality and may
have contributed to the sell-off.   In any case, SUNW is now
way off its intraday high of $115.75 hit on Wednesday.  Once
investors realize that SUNW is still in great shape, the stock
should resume its upward course.  If the market turns and works
its way uphill again, this pull back could be to our advantage
and a great time to buy on the dip.  Wait to see Sun's upward
trend re-established.

LXK $99.88 3.81 (+1.82) LXK held up reasonably well for most
of the day, but couldn't hold on at the end and lost over 3%.
LXK will announce earnings before market on Monday the 25th.
This date has been confirmed with LXK's investor relations.
We feel there is a good chance of a stock split announcement,
though there are no guarantees.  For those of you that have
watched the earnings announcements this last week, you have
probably noticed the punishment many stocks have taken on the
announcement. It seems many have bought the anticipation and
when a stock fails to beat the expectation, they are being
punished. This makes holding LXK over earnings a risky play.

XIRC $40.75 +.13 (+.87) XIRC held up extremely well today
considering the carnage the NASDAQ took.  XIRC traded as high
as 41.88 before falling off for a small gain.  XIRC did gap
open on Wednesday, but fell with the market. After announcing
great earnings on Tuesday, XIRC should continue to trend
higher, market permitting.  XIRC's 10-dma is around $39.00.
XIRC option prices should deflate slightly for those interested
in buying in.  This tends to happen after an anticipated event
like earnings.

COF $131.00 4.00 (+.56) COF has held up extremely well in
comparison to the market. On Wednesday, COF traded as high
as $140 before closing at $135. COF is an example of a stock
that didn't have the huge expectation to blow away earnings.
This, in turn, gave COF the opportunity to rise after the
earnings announcement. When the market firms, COF should
continue to move higher and should eclipse its high of $140.
COF's 10-dma is around $129.00.  COF's sector sidekick PVN
did well today after beating estimates yesterday.

ETH $48.75 +.06 (-.19) ETH hasn't done much this week, but did
hold strong in a negative market on Thursday.  This strength
was possibly derived from the statements from the CEO that
there is a "tremendous pent-up demand".  ETH also stated they
are targeting a strategy to have quicker delivery.  This all
points toward a positive future. ETH is still $18 from its
52-week high.

PICK NEWS - PUTS

AVT $45.50 -.81 (.75) Stock experiencing continued weakness off of

VOD  Vodafone Group PLC $190.31 4.31 (+14.31)

The vote is in, and Vodafone Group is the UK's #1 mobile
telecommunications company, serving about four million
customers. It operates analog and digital cellular networks
offering voice communications, messaging, paging, and mobile
data services. Vodafone sells its cellular phone services
through three distribution businesses: Vodafone Retail,
Vodafone Connect, and Vodafone Corporate. The company provides
cellular services in 12 countries outside the UK; international
operations account for 28% of total revenues. Vodafone will
nearly double its size with the purchase of US-based AirTouch
Communications.

For those of you living in a cave or that were abducted by
aliens, VOD recently merged with ATI. The deal calls for ATI
shareholders to receive 1/2 share of VOD plus $9 in cash. Simple
math says it's better to trade the stock that moves point for
point, not a half for a point. Vodafone's phones are owned by
1 in 15 people in the U.K.  The deal with ATI has been applauded
by most, thus the nice run that VOD has had even though it was
the purchaser. VOD took a dip today and this might present a
good buying opportunity. Watch for a direction on Friday.

A European official stated that the VOD-ATI merger is a perfect
fit. The only problem seemed to be in Germany, where both
companies have ownership in competing firms.  VOD has mentioned
they are willing to sell the ownership they have in one of
the companies.  Projected annual sales for the combined company
is around $10 billion.  Pretty impressive.

QWST - Qwest Communications $59.38 -.88  (+3.07)

The Colorado based Qwest Communications International is the
fifth largest local and long distance telephone company in
the United States.  It is also secures broadband
Internet-based data and provides voice and image
communication capabilities to businesses and consumers.
It is currently expanding its reach into Mexico and most of
Europe. In the US, QWST is building its Internet
Protocol-based fiber-optic network which will connect
over 130 cities by mid 1999.

The telecom service sector has been on Wall Street's good
side as of late.  U.S. telecommunication companies are
expected to meet or slightly beat estimates due to the
increased demand for phone lines, Internet access, and
other phone services.  Qwest is projected to announce its
earnings in three weeks on February 11th.  Even though QWST
was set back slightly on Thursday in a weak market, we feel
Qwest has the potential to make a run.  Wait for confirmation
of positive movement before positioning yourself for earnings
movement.  [note: Zack's has earnings date as the 11th.
QWST's investor relations said they have not released a
date yet.]

News:  Qwest has recently formed relationships with several
companies.  The most recent is with Verio Inc.  QWST was
awarded a contract worth up to $60 million to provide Verio
with additional broadband capabilities.  Qwest will also help
Ford, the car company, with its domestic and international
communication needs.  Hometown Connections and Qwest will work
together to provide community owned electric utilities voice
and data telecommunication services.  Qwest will also invest
$15 million in Covad Communications Group Inc, a company that
provides high-speed digital communication services, to extend
its ability to provide users with nationwide connectivity.

COMBO PLAYS
***********
U.S. stocks ended mixed on Wednesday, as technology issues rallied
on Microsoft Corp.'s strong earnings report, but the Dow fell back
from early gains to close with a loss. Investors grew cautious in
the trading session when Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
warned that financial markets were still fragile and a drop in U.S.
exports posed a risk to the economy. He said that recent gains in
stock prices may be difficult to sustain, based on the relative
growth of corporate profits. The late session sell-off was boosted
by computer driven trading programs and some technical selling as
the market dropped through support levels. Strong earnings at MSFT
helped push the Nasdaq to a record high. The Nasdaq index closed
with a gain of 7 points after being up 59 points in early trading.
The strength of MSFT's earnings was surprising and welcomed news.

Our Tuesday spreads were all available near the recommended entry
points. PTEK was the first of the speculation plays and the debit
for the MAR12C/FEB12C was $0.50. OMPT was the next position and
the MAR15C/FEB15C spread traded near $0.87 debit for much of the
morning. Our initial entry was slightly better at $0.81. SCUR was
a bullish debit spread and the FEB20C/25C opened and traded near
the target price of $3.50. Our position was not quite as good at
$3.75. The last position was RHD and although the stock price fell,
the debit for the MAR15C/17C bull-call spread remained near $1.12.

Other portfolio activities: LEVL shot up almost $3, allowing us to
take the early exit at $4.38 credit and a $1.12 profit. PCS also
moved $3 higher but that won't help us as it is now in danger of
closing well above the sold strike for this month. Remember, we
lose our edge (in a calendar spread) when the stock price moves
significantly higher in a short time. Both positions become deep
in-the-money with little time value and we have to roll-up to the
next higher strike at the end of the month.

Wall Street stocks fell Thursday as fears over the global economy
reined in the U.S. bull market. High technology issues suffered as
a sell-off in Internet stocks sent the Nasdaq tumbling. The DJIA
closed unofficially down 71 points to 9264.08 and the Nasdaq index
fell 70 points to 2344.89. The Dow had mounted a late rally from
the day's lows, cutting losses by half, before succumbing to the
general malaise. Worries about Brazil, earnings and the trade
deficit got the better of stocks and profit-taking also had an
affect on the downward movement.

On Thursday, the spreads portfolio weathered the storm as did most
of us traders. Some of the positions were obvious candidates for
"double-downs" but none were in danger of being closed-out. The
most significant moves came from AOL, AAPL, and DIS. Although some
positions were down, (SUNW and WCOM) those were actually favorable
when compared to our "sold strikes". Others that survived the day
included GM, PCS and OMPT. Hopefully, it will get better tomorrow!

Diagonal Spreads - In these plays, the purchased position has a
longer maturity than the written option as well as a different

requirements (if any) before opening a position.

CTXS - Citrix Systems  $89.00     *** Earnings Slam! ***

Citrix Systems is a supplier of thin client/server application
server products and technologies that enable the effective and
efficient enterprise-wide deployment of applications designed for
Windows operating systems. The WinFrame software allows networked
computers, (even non-Windows-based computers such as Macintoshes,
UNIX machines, pre-Windows PCs, and stripped-down "thin clients")
to run Windows-based applications from a central server. Citrix's
3,000 clients include Sears Tire Centers, Hewlett-Packard Europe,
and Canadian wireless telecommunications provider Bell Mobility.
IBM, Sharp Electronics and Microsoft, (which owns about 6% of the
company) also licenses Citrix's technology.

On Wednesday, Citrix said it earned $0.52 a share in the fourth
quarter, $0.03 more than the consensus estimate from analysts. The
report came after CS First Boston reiterated its "strong buy" on
the compnay but the stock fell $13 anyway. The stock held ground
on Thursday is now trading right at the 30 dma. This stock should
eventually rebound and continue its upward momentum.

RDRT - Read-Rite  $18.93     *** Positive Earnings ***

Read-Rite is the world's #1 maker of magnetic recording heads used
in hard disk drives. It also makes thin-film magnetoresistive (MR)
tape heads used in quarter-inch cartridge tape drives. Read-Rite's
heads, which record and retrieve information from the surface of
computer disks, are sold to disk drive makers as head gimbal
assemblies (recording heads combined with suspension arms) or
headstack assemblies (modules of multiple-head gimbal assemblies).
Read-Rite is increasingly basing its products on high-capacity
technologies such as MR. Key customers include Western Digital
(its largest customer), Quantum, and Maxtor.

On Wednesday, the company posted a profit of $0.02 a share in the
fiscal first quarter. Analysts expected a loss of $0.17, according
to the consensus of six brokers polled by First Call. The company
also reported strong sequential growth in the quarter, with sales
up 31% from the third quarter. Some consolidation is in order but
the stock price looks poised for further upward movement.

LVLT - Level 3 Communications  $44.19     *** Telecom ***

LVLT is a telecommunications and information services company that
plans to build and operate advanced fiber networks across the U.S.
using Internet technology. Acting as a stepping stone for Craig
McCaw will take Level 3 Communications to the next level. Level 3
is developing a national fiber-optic network, which an investment
firm and McCaw-controlled Nextel and Nextlink will stake for $700
million in return for network capacity. Level 3 will use Internet
technology to offer local and long-distance services, provided
initially through an 8,000-mile network leased from Frontier. LVLT
also provides computer outsourcing and systems integration through
subsidiary PKS Information Services. A spinoff of a construction
firm, the company owns large stakes in Kiewit Coal, Commonwealth
Telephone Enterprises of Pennsylvania, and RCN (telecom provider).

The company just announced Tuesday that it will begin providing
select telecommunications services in the Boston metropolitan area
as part of its national city roll-out. The plan is to construct
local city networks that directly serve businesses in 25 cities
within the next three years. The company plans to offer service
capabilities over its own fiber facilities in 50 U.S. cities.
Additionally, the company is currently building an approximately
16,000 mile long distance national network to interconnect these
cities.

Coverage was initiated by Salomon Smith Barney in early January
with an "Outperform" rating.

SEPR - Sepracor  $99.62     *** LEAPS/Covered-Calls ***

Sepracor develops and commercializes improved chemical entities
that are new, patented forms of existing pharmaceuticals. These
products can offer reduced side effects, improved safety, new uses,
and improved dosage forms over traditional compounds. Sepracor is
developing pharmaceuticals to address asthma, allergies, pain,
urological disorders, sleep disorders, periodontal disease, and
depression. It developed Allegra as an alternative to Seldane (the
FDA withdrew its approval of Seldane in 1997). The company is also
developing antihistamines similar to Claritin and Hismanal. SEPR
has licensed to J&J the rights to an improved version of Propulsid
heartburn medication.

Sepracor said last week, it planned to begin clinical trials on
hopefully safer versions of drugs now on the market, including
obesity drug Meridia and J&J's antifungal drug Sporanox. They also
said the ambitious plan signaled determination by Sepracor, which
previously has licensed its patented drug formulations to large
pharmaceutical companies, to conduct its own clinical trials and
thereby become an independent drug developer and marketer.

The fundamental outlook for 1999 is very good and the long-term
chart reflects an excellent bullish pattern.

PLAY (conservative/long-term):

BUY  CALL JAN00-100 LGD-AT OI=4   A=$25.25
SELL CALL FEB-100   ERQ-BT OI=361 B=$5.25
NET DEBIT TARGET=$19.50 TARGET ROI=100%

Note: In the long-term calendar spread, we are reducing the net
cost of the LEAP by the amount of credit from the sale of the
nearer term call. If the near-term call expires worthless, we will
sell the MAR call to further reduce our debit. If your short-term
position is ITM on the last day of the strike, you need to buy it
back so that you DON'T have to exercise the long-term position. In
that case, your LEAP is going up in value also and on the last day
of the strike period, the short call will shrink down to intrinsic
value so you will be ahead in the play even after you buy it back.

The Internets all suffered from circuit failure with investors
today.

Bearish comments from George Soros, Ralph Acompora and Barton
Biggs along with restrictions placed on trading Internet stocks
by the brokerages all worked together to slam the prices back
to last years levels.

Every other news article on CNBC and in my email today was about
the bursting of the Internet price bubble. Think for a minute,
how much would have heard about the overvalued Internet bubble
if it was never reported on CNBC? I doubt it would even be a
topic at the dinner table without their daily "extensive"
coverage. Don't get me wrong. They do a good job reporting on
the market but they have a negative bias toward these stocks.

In any event the leaders all dropped double digit numbers with
the exception of AOL. The largest Internet blue chip, AOL, did
drop as low as -9.50 but had recovered to -$5.00 until the
market drop at the close. It finally settled at -7.50.

AOL has firmly established itself as the favorite of analysts
who follow this group. With 23,000 new subscribers every day
AOL has power. We view this as a buying opportunity before
next weeks earnings.

The real culprit today was profit taking on worries over the
global currency problems. Brazil's lower house passed the
pension reform law last night but the Bovespa dropped -6% at
the open. The Real lost value again on the open market and
started putting pressure on other world currencies. The large
market drop at midday was caused by a rumor that China or
Hong Kong were going to devalue based on losses in Brazil's
currency. The rumor was so strong that China made a formal
statement that denied it completely. (remember my comment
last week about never believing anything from any country
under currency attack. They will say anything to protect their
options.) After the denial the market recover significantly
from the days lows. Fear of the dark manifested itself with
global rumors still circulating and profits still on the
table. Another rumor that Greenspan was going to leave office
also put a scare into the markets. Even though the market
holds it's breath every time My G. speaks, they still respect
the work he has done in the last few years.

The Nasdaq got hammered. The sixth biggest point loss ever.
Down -80 at one time it rebounded in late afternoon to only
-38 but when the bottom fell out at the close it sank to -70.
Put this in perspective. It had just set another record high
yesterday. The Nasdaq was up +215 in the last three weeks.
It has been going straight up since the October 8th lows.
It was due for a sell off.

Remember in the Wednesday commentary on the website we talked
about the Microsoft gap open on earnings. I warned again about
holding over earnings and the dire consequences. I advised
watching LU, IBM and SUNW today for signs of the gap down
effect. The results are in! IBM +2.50 in regular trading,
beat the street by +.02, failed to announce a split and traded
down -7.50 in after hours. Lucent announced earnings that beat
the street by +.04 and issued strong profit forecasts for the
next two quarters. They did fail to announce a split and
analysts felt the current sales were lacking. Lucent dropped
-8.56 today after gapping down -6.00 at the open. SUNW
announced after the close and beat the street by +.01 and
issued a strong profit forecast AND announced a 2:1 split.
SUNW had suffered strong profit taking during the Nasdaq
sell off today and was down almost -9.00 at the low of the
day. The most active stock on the Nasdaq today with 27 million
shares, SUNW closed at 98.63 in after hours trading, gaining
+.38 after the close. Because SUN suffered so much today
and announced a split they did not suffer after hours but
could drop tomorrow. The stock split will help but the
timing is in March, a long way off.

The point here is "everybody beat estimates but IBM and LU
got killed in afer hours and SUNW will probably suffer
tomorrow." It is just not safe to hold over earnings.

The S&P Futures dropped -17 points in the last hour of trading
on global worries. Since the close they are only down -.30.
If we do not have a negative global currency event overnight
then we could get a strong rebound in the morning. The key
word here is "could". We could also suffer another round
of profit taking in front of the weekend. Many traders will
want to get flat before the close so plan your trades
accordingly.

Good Luck

Jim Brown

Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
****************

Thursday, January 21, 1999

Are you Complacent?  Are you Fearless Buying the Dip?

Are any of your long positions unprotected?  If you answered yes
to any of these questions, you are among the growing number who
will feel the sting of the next market sell-off.

Many of our trusted sentiment indicators are suggesting that if a
sell-off materializes, the general investing community will have
NO fear of buying the dip, particularly after the favorable
experience of last October's strong and profitable advance.  But
if the rallies DON'T hold, most investors won't recognize the
trap until it's too late.

Write these numbers down and commit them to memory.

Dow Jones Industrial Average / 9,400
Market Volatility (VIX) / 30.0%

First, If the Dow Jones Industrial average has trouble getting
back over 9,400, begin developing a balanced attack and build
some hedge positions.  The market broke into record territory in
the first week of January on strong volume, yet failed to hold
the gain.  This is a bearish development.

Next, the Market Volatility Index (VIX) is a powerful short-term
sentiment indicator that will help presage what will happen next
in the market.  The VIX closed Thursday at 31.95 - above the 50
day moving average.  Everyday above 30% means that the recent
declining trend on the VIX has been broken.

Pinnacle Capital Advisors was among the first advisory firm to
alert investors that the VIX had violated a key benchmark on
Monday, January 11, 1999 which preceded the 145 point sell-off
the next day.  Pinnacle believes that this action marked the
near-term top.

The final straw will be the value of our Pinnacle Index on the
S&P 100 (OEX) and S&P 500 (SPX).  If these begin to climb, it
means that option speculators are ignoring early warning signs
and buying excessive out-of-the-money call options believing th
at the market will reach higher levels.  This is when savvy and
experienced investors will know its time to go to cash and get
short.

Pinnacle's short-term indicators are still flashing BEARISH
overtones over the near-term so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.  Any questions regarding
market sentiment can be directed at:

Great Expectations - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
******************
Thursday, January 21, 1999

The Power of Sentiment Analysis

On Tuesday (1/19), we provided a closer sentiment analysis on
companies reporting earnings this week and alerted subscribers
that several companies revealed excessive optimism as reflected
by our Pinnacle Index.  It's worth taking a minute and looking
at how each of the following stock's reacted after they released
their numbers.  All the companies gapped down or sold off
precipitously even though many reported favorable news.  The
bottom line:  It's all about expectations.  Pinnacle Capital
Advisors will be providing another analysis this weekend.

PICKS WE DROPPED
****************
When we drop a pick it doesn't mean we are recommending a sell
on that play. Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.
We drop a pick because something happened to change its
profile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we
don't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.
We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are
unfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we
want them to look at any current pick as a valid play.

CALLS:
******

QCOM $59.50 2.50 (-4.38) Go figure.  QCOM announces great
earnings and beat estimates, and then trades down after the
announcement.  The downgrade QCOM received Wednesday morning
certainly didn't help the situation.  A weak market today added
to the losses.  Since the run into the earnings announcement
wasn't followed through, we are going to drop QCOM as a pick.

DIS $34.56 1.44 (-1.44) We picked up Disney last week
because of its multiple upgrades and because it had become
a bit of an Internet play with its GO Network portal site
launch.  Unfortunately, Disney came late to the party in
the Internet game. The internets have been selling off all
week, and analysts are talking about the bubble bursting.
Although Disney hit $36.00 today, it ended the day at only
$34.56 - down $1.44. We are dropping it for lack of
performance.

YHOO $265.00 22.19 (-52.00) It doesn't seem that YHOO is
ready to reverse paths as of yet.  We just don't see any
news pending that will possibly start YHOO up again other
than its stock split coming up.  This could change at any
time, but a few internet earnings announcements of late have
just met estimates and this just isn't enough to keep these
stocks afloat.  We'll watch for a reversal and possibly add
YHOO back when the split run starts, if ever

CHKPF $40.25 -4.75 (-11.00) Watch out below!!!  CHKPF is being
dropped.  CHKPF met earnings estimates on the 20th.  This just
didn't cut it.  CHKPF has a history of destroying earning
estimates and this just took the wind out of their sails.  The
company also sees 1Q revenues in the single digits.  Though
this may be an extreme sell-off, the near term prospects just
don't seem positive.  CHKPF hopefully didn't catch any of you
off guard when it moved it's earnings announcement up a day.

LU $106.94 -8.56 (-3.31) We can't seem to get this one right.
We have decided to drop LU in case the big drop today was
more than an over reaction.  LU announced earnings before the
open today and beat analyst estimates by a nickel, then
proceeded to go down close to $9. Go figure.  It seems that
investors are concerned about the addition to income because
of some accounting issues with the pension play.  What people
are failing to realize is that this practice was figured into
the estimates and also caused LU to show better earnings in
the past to keep up with competitors accounting methods.  We
feel it's too risky to guess on this falling knife.  For those
that like LU, waiting for a bounce off the bottom could be
very profitable.

ATI $94.13 3.75 (+10.75) Since ATI's price is basically
contingent on the price of VOD, we have decided to drop ATI
and pick VOD. ATI will increase approximately 1/2 of what VOD
increases.  We feel ATI is a still a good play, so don't sell
current holding in ATI just because we are dropping it.  We
just feel we might as well get more bang for the buck.

UTX $113.94 +1.94 (+4.25) UTX reported earnings today of $1.16

represented an 18% increase above the same quarter a year ago.
Strong showings in its aircraft and refrigeration businesses
were factors in the increase.  What probably helped the stock
more than the earnings announcement was UTX saying that it has
hired Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives for its
automotive components business.  The automotive components
business is consolidating, operating profits are falling and
revenues are flat.  The Street liked that announcement.  After
the gap up this morning, UTX traded down in what looked like
profit taking.  We would wait for some upward movement before
initiating any new trades

CCU $60.00 -$4.25 (-$0.43)  Well now everyone is getting
into the act. CCU announced this week, they had opened up
their 3D interactive mall which allows shopping from
your desktop for just about anything. Actually, it is not
really CCU, but National Media.  National Media is owned
by Jacor who in turn is merging with CCU.  So in an indirect
way, CCU has got it's own Internet play.  They expect 15,000
stores to join them.  The difference in their mall compared
to the others is, each store is downloadable separately,
saving disc space on your PC and your time at the mall.
You will stroll into the mall, go to the store of choice,
pull an item from the shelf and purchase it on line.
Weakness in today's market didn't help us take any big
steps up again, but CCU showed strength anyway.  CCU opened at
its high of $63.50, dropping to $59.00.  The rest of the
market held it back and made it rest on it's support at a
close of $60.00 for the day.

F $62.06 -2.63 (+$0.06) Ford announced it's earnings today,
nearly a 7% rise in 4th Qtr earnings.  F posted its 11th
consecutive quarter of beating the street estimates and
reporting earnings of $1.35 a fully diluted share.  Up from
$1.6 billion or $1.27 a share a year ago. Ford says, they
more than doubled their cost cutting goal by reducing costs
by $2.2 billion last year.  Ford's operating profit was up
10%, this means about 160,000 U.S. employees will receive
profit sharing checks averaging $6,100 on March 3rd.  Stocks
did close generally lower today and F was no exception.  F
opened at $64.00 just below it's high of $64.31 finished off
of it's low of $61.56 to $62.06.  We may see a continued up
trend after the market digests the figures and regains it's
momentum.

FTL $17.81 -$0.31 (+1.13) What is going on with FTL?  We're
asking the same question. Wednesday's and Thursday's call
options again, showed signs of increased volatility.  Some
take over plays happen over night, and others want to tease
you into doing something rash.  We peeked in on the insider
trading and found none to speak of.  In some cases the
principles are advised not to do anything that would cast
suspicion, one way or the other if something is in the
works.  On todays' trading, FTL had a good open at $18.25,
clawed its way to $18.75 amidst a downturn in the S&P and
settled at $17.81 for the close. Be careful, with a weak
market, even if this is a takeout, it could be postponed
for a better time and price.

EMC $96.00 4.00 (-4.06) EMC set a new 52 week high on
Wednesday, and then started trading down.  It tried to recover
towards the end of the day today, but to no avail.  In the
news, Staples, the world's largest operator of office
superstores, announced that they have standardized their data
storage needs on an EMC system.  The reasons they gave were to
more effectively manage rapid business growth, reduce
information management costs, and improve customer service.  We
have done some more research into EMC announcing a split with
earnings next week, and it doesn't appear likely.  They do not
have enough shares authorized and their shareholder meeting is
not expected until April.  Repeat  No split announcement
with earnings.

MU $69.81 3.19 (-1.50) Almost the entire tech sector was
down today.  Intel, Texas Instruments, and Micron Technology
all lost ground.  ALTR suffered from two downgrades, even
though it's earnings beat consensus estimates, and that helped
pull the sector lower.  Even upgrades today on both TXN and
MU did not help these stocks.  Warburg Dillon Read raised MU
from hold to buy.  It's analyst, Gregory Mischou, upped his
1999 earnings estimate to $.12 from a loss of $.11, and his
fiscal 2000 forecast from $1.95 to $2.31. He believes MU
could trade up into the mid-90s in the current market. Intel,
which has already invested in MU, has just established a
relationship with Samsung, and may do so with Hyundai as well.
It wants to insure Direct Rambus DRAM production in the
future, and hopes to expand cooperation in the next-generation
memory chip industry.  The Koreans have been drastically
cutting production.  The chip sector is still recovering from
a dismal year, and its turn-around is showing up in increasing
chip stock prices. They may trend lower with the Internet
stocks.  However, confirm upward movement in the sector and
in MU before initiating new plays. Current quarter ends in
February.

JBL $73.13 -.06 (-.75) JBL actually held up pretty well today.
As we discussed on Tuesday, its chart is starting to flatten,
and it looks like its momentum is slowing.  JBL's 3, 10, and 21
day moving averages have all converged at this point.  A lot of
times a momentum stock will base for a period, and then start
its move again.  Wait for confirmation of upward movement
before initiating any new trades.

Andrea and Fabian;

Over the past few days, Randy Young, Mike Guerriero and I discussed the 
proper manner to have the both of you working as an integrated legal team in 
Argentina.  According to Mike, the below listed activities are being pursued 
in Argentina:

Wholesale Origination
Retail Origination
EES
EnronOnline
Power Trading
Gas Trading
Weather Derivatives
Energy Finance
Networks

Although I would be comfortable to leave the workload division up to you, I 
would like to suggest the following (bearing in mind that there is never a 
clear understanding about "where you draw the line"):

Andrea:  Wholesale and Retail Origination; EnronOnLine; Power and Gas 
Trading; Weather Derivatives; Energy Finance.
Fabian: Wholesale and Retail Origination; EES; Energy Finance.

Please correct me if I am wrong, but it seems to me that there is not a 
significant difference between Wholesale and Retail Origination deals in 
Argentina.  In view of this, I would suggest the two of you assist all 
Origination deals (regardless of being a Wholesale or a Retail deal).  Also, 
both of you should be involved in Energy Finance as I believe such deals 
would arise from Wholesale and Retail Origination transactions.  In short, 
both of you would do legal support to "Origination", however, Andrea would 
focus on Trading and Fabian would concentrate in EES type of deals.

In addition, Fabian would manage Luiz Watanabe's workload in Argentina, but I 
would leave this to Luiz to structure and implement.

Kindly let me know if my thoughts make sense to you and please return to me 
with your comments asap.

I have not made any reference to "Networks" as I have no idea what it relates 
to ...  Is this related to Enron Communication ?

As a final note, please be advised that our baby should arrive on Thursday, 
July 23.  As of such date, I will be available by e-mail and cel phone only.

Rgds,

Sami

I believe I approved this yesterday.  If further action is required, please 
let me know.

Sorry about the delay.

I know we subscribe to various information services from Bloomberg and 
Reuters, but I am not aware of any relationship we have with Thomson 
Financial - then again that's not too surprising.  I suggest you talk to the 
people in investor relations and maybe the Info Central people who may have 
subscribed to such services.  The only way I would have heard about them 
would be if they were to be used for EnronOnline or in the highly unlikely 
event that they had consulted me on the subscription contracts.  Please feel 
free to call if I can be of any other help.

I understand that you oversee the legal issues/contracts relating to our 
financial trading activities and consequently was hoping you might be able to 
assist us in regard to the following query that relates to sourcing data from 
external financial information providers.

I work in EnronCredit.com as a Telecommunication analyst and am interested in 
accessing the above information source which is provided by Thomson 
Financial.  FYI, "FirstCall" allows online realtime access to a wide variety 
of debt and equity focused investment house/broker reports.

We originally had access via a trial that was apparently initiated by a "C. 
Weber" who was based out of Houston but who has subsequently left the company.

Unfortunately, access to this service has been withdrawn by Thomson Financial 
here in London on the basis that we are a "corporate" and not a "financial" 
or "fund manager".  Thomson Financial are now offering us a reduced 
time-delayed service ("Investex") which is not sufficient for our needs and 
consequently we would like to reestablish the FirstCall service or a service 
providing similar or superior functionality.

Prior to meeting with Thomson, I would very grateful if you could enlighten 
us on any of the following:

- Whether Enron has any relationship and/or agreements in place with Thomson 
Financial in the US;
- If the latter is the case, which services we receive from this data 
supplier;
- If this is not the case, which alternative but similar data services we do 
receive.

I believe that if we can establish that we already receive the FirstCall 
service in the US it would greatly strengthen our case for receiving it here 
in the UK.  Alternatively, if we do not receive this service in the US it 
would be extremely valuable for us to know what alternative, but similar, 
sources of information are available, in order that we might have another 
option should Thomson Financial prove to be inflexible on the issue of 
supplying FristCall.

Should you have any queries in relation to any of the above, please do not 
hesitate to contact me either by return or on the direct number below.

Thanks for your help with this.

Regards

Simon Duff (## 44 20 7783 4585)

Paul:

Here is the FSA letter with my comments inserted in red.  I have tried to 
make it a bit stronger by deleting references to our positions being merely 
"arguable."  The language I deleted in the first part of 3.4 I thought was 
unnecessary and just point out doors that may remain open for the SFA.  The 
language added in 3.5 was an attempt to show how much EEFT does vs. 
EnronOnline.

Is there a reason we are referring to Net Works rather than EnronOnline LLC?  
It is also a Delaware limited liability company.  Are we afraid it may have a 

I also wonder if the discussion of EPOL's involvement in 2.2 and 4.2 is 
really needed since the ETA is entered into on EEFT's behalf.  If this has 
not yet been raised by the SFA, it doesn't seem necessary to flag it for 
them.  My position would be that EEFT is a party to that agreement whenever 
it is necessary in connection with an investment.

Today we were successful in killing an amendment that was offered by Rep. 
Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) in the House Banking Committee during its markup of 
the Commodities Future Modernization Act of 2000.  This amendment would have 
stricken language that provided an exclusion from CFTC jurisdiction for all 
non-agriculture transactions (energy, metals, broadband).  The amendment 
failed, largely due to pressure from Enron, by a vote of 20-12.  Rep. Ken 
Bensten (D-TX) joined Chairman Leach in speaking against the amendment.  

In more positive movement, yesterday the House Commerce Committee passed its 
version on the bill including a provision that exempts metal trading 
multilateral trading facilities from CFTC jurisdiction.

Congress goes into recess tomorrow and we will have a better sense on how the 
Rules Committee plans to reconcile differences between the versions of the 
bill later this week.  The Senate is still the unknown.

Call me at any question - Chris

Bradley: 

We have learned that two amendments will be offered tomorrow my Rep. Maloney:

#1  - Strikes lines 15-25 from page 41 and the entire page 42 (these are the 
sections of HR 4541 as reported out of the Ag. Committee which address the 
exemption for all most non-agriculture commodities trade on an electronic 
facility.

#2  - Request a comprehensive study on the President's working group, DOE, 
and FERC.  

We strongly oppose amendment #1 which intends to more heavily regulate the 
energy derivatives industry.  Please have Rep. Bentsen voice his opposition 
to this amendment.  My guess is that amendment #2 should and will be ruled 
non-germane, however this is not a compromise we would support.  

Thanks - Chris

Big blue beat estimates but investors turned red on Friday.

The bluest of the blue chips turned red on Friday after beating
analysts estimates. Even though they posted a win on the surface
the numbers behind the numbers painted the true picture. IBM made
$.04 a share on hedging currency. What this means is the currency
of other countries went up in value compared to previous levels
and IBM either made money on their currency hedge instruments or
the currency their customers used had gone up in value over
the value assigned when the deals were first done. If you agreed
to pay 1 million Baht for a computer when the Baht was worth 125
to the dollar and by the time the computer was delivered the Baht
was worth 100 to the dollar then IBM would get a windfall profit
of +20%. The difference between 125 and 100 to the dollar. (The
numbers used are for example only and not accurate) So IBM did
not do anything to earn the extra money except be in the right
place at the right time. IBM also had less sales than expected
which did not go well with analysts.

After the smoke cleared IBM had lost -$17 for the day. -$16 bln
in market cap. IBM accounted for over -70 points of the Dow loss
for the day.

SUNW on the other hand beat estimates by $.01 and announced a
split and only closed down -.44 for the day. It really was not
the fault of SUNW. The Nasdaq was hell bent on following the Dow
down even though it made several nice runs to positive territory
during the day. Sun had a backlog of $770 million in orders and
more coming in every day. The CEO said sales were expected to
increase as much as +20% this year. We expect SUNW to continue
upward with any Nasdaq rally.

The Clinton problem took a hard turn on Friday. With Republicans
starting to defect and looking for an easy way out to avoid more
negative press, the prospects of a dismissal look better every
day. This would help the market some as "no change" is typically
considered good news. The Byrd motion for dismissal is not likely
to pass but it set the tone for the future votes.

The real culprit again on Friday was the fallout from the Brazil
problem. Continued rumors of other countries possibly devaluing
their currencies put a cautious tone in the market ahead of the
weekend. Even though many very knowledgeable analysts said the
possibility of China or Hong Kong devaluing based on the current
Brazil problem was "very, very remote" the more safety conscious
investors were moving to the sidelines before the close. The
Brazil Bovespa recovered from earlier losses to close down only
-131 or -1.8%. All the European exchanges had closed down on
Friday as the increasing worry had investors taking profits there
also.

Is the U.S. market going down as some bears are saying? We don't
think so, YET. Without a "tail wagging the dog" news event this
week we feel that positive corporate earnings will continue to
move the market upward. Interest rates are going to remain flat.
Inflation is flat, the economy is growing. We have no reason to
sell off. The wild card is the Brazil crisis. The DOW, OEX and
RUT are all sitting at support on their moving averages. The
market is down -522 points in the last two weeks. We are due for
another technical "relief" rally this week. With all the negative
news out Friday the fact that the Dow only lost -73 points (if
you take out IBM) is remarkable. The Nasdaq had recovered from
a -38 point early loss and traded +15 until the end of the day
"fear of darkness" sell off. This is remarkable. The buy the
dip mentality is alive and well. There was strong buying at the
close on Friday as well as the early morning dip. As long as
buyers keep filling in the holes we will continue to build a
stronger base here. Again, the wild card is Brazil and the other
Latin America countries. A news flash on Monday morning could
wipe out the market in a heartbeat. Until the Brazil Real gains
some strength traders should consider playing smaller positions.
You can still capture some gains but have less at risk should
lightning strike.

We are at a pivotal point in the market. With all the major
averages setting on support it will take more bad news to push
us down and less good news to make it go up. There is still
lots of buyers in the market. As CNBC reported Friday there
is a huge "book" of buy orders at $2-$3 less than current prices
for many blue chip stocks. As long as these limit buy orders
stay on the books the chances of a substantial drop are slim.
Institutions want to buy but not at the top of the market. They
are using the "target shooting" approach we always suggest.

The target shooting approach to opening a position is simply
placing a limit buy order at -25 to -50% less than the current
ask and waiting for a dip to fill your order. Sometimes you
can wait days for a dip but in the current market climate we
are seeing dips almost every day. Normally the dips are too
quick to react with manual orders but if you have an existing
limit order you can get filled when it happens and sometimes
at the low for the day. For instance the SUNW FEB-100 Call
had a low for the day on Friday of $5.00 and a high of $8.00.
It closed at $6.50. The previous close was $7.50. A limit
order for -25% less than the previous close would have been
$5.63. You would have filled at $5.63 and could easily have
sold again for a +15% to +25% profit.

The AOL-140 Call closed Thursday at $14.00. A -25% limit order
would have been $10.50. On Friday the low for the day was $10
and the high was $14.88. You would have filled at $10.50 and
could have easily sold again for +20 to +30% profit the same
day.

Most traders would have bought at $13 or more after AOL started
back up. They would be thinking. OK, now it is moving, I will
jump in now. While this is not a bad idea it is not as good
as buying cheap. Once you make a decision to buy AOL or SUNW
or whichever stock you want, then the next decision is WHERE
to buy. If you use this method you will make fewer plays
because not all options will dip -25% in one day but the plays
you do make will be much more profitable. You will normally
be buying in at the low for the day. Would you like to be in
a position cheaper than everybody else?

We have had several serious rumors that Microsoft is going
to announce a 2:1 split this week. While the MSFT CFO had
said in an offhand remark several weeks ago that he would
"like to wait" until the $200 range before they split again,
I am being covered in emails that claim they will split
either Monday after the close or sometime during this week.
I have never had the volume of email on a split rumor that
I had on MSFT this week. I own MSFT currently and would
really be a happy trader if this comes to pass.

Watch the news Sunday for signs of the Brazilian flu and
plan your trades accordingly for Monday.

Good Luck

JIM'S PLAYS

The week started out great with Microsoft blowing away earnings
and gapping open the next day. I had broken a cardinal rule and
held over in anticipation of a split and got the earnings gap
as a surprise. THIS IS A VERY BAD IDEA!! I was forced to hold
some SUNW over earnings as the market was dropping too fast
and my limit orders never filled. Ouch! Fortunately Sun did
not do the IBM thing and actually traded up on Friday. If we
can get a Nasdaq rally Monday I might be able to get out of
the position alive. Other than the those two major trades
early in the week I did almost nothing. Friday I bought the
dip on faith and still feel pretty good about it. Now if
only Brazil does not blow up over the weekend.

This looks like a pretty good week but what you don't see
is the large loss I am currently holding in SUNW. If Sun does
not rise from the ashes this week the next Sunday recap will
be very ugly.

Market Sentiment
By Pinnacle Capital Advisors

Market's Momentum Lost

Don't look now, but the powerful market has lost its momentum and
we are beginning to see several classic failed rallies develop.
You would expect the financial and airlines sectors to roll over
given that these have been under pressure and trading below
their declining moving averages.  But what about Drug and
Healthcare? These sectors have been trading higher and should
follow the Technology sector into new territory, right?  Wrong.
Pinnacle turned Bearish on these sectors this weekend over the
near-term after violating key benchmarks of (DRG /740) and (HCX
/ 720), respectively.

More problematic is the Russell 2,000 (RUT). Not only is the
small cap coming up short of last July's high, but excessive
call buying by option speculators is occurring at out-of-the
money overhead benchmark levels as reflective by our high
Pinnacle Index (14.7) for the Russell 2,000.

Pinnacle's short-term indicators are still flashing BEARISH
overtones over the near-term so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.  Any questions regarding

The Power of Expectation Analysis

It has often been said that the crowd is right during the
market trends but wrong at both ends.  Measuring and
evaluating the sentiment of the crowd, therefore, can give
savvy option traders a decided edge.

that we have received a near term reversal signal across many
sectors that many have violated their 50-day moving averages.

Great Expectations

Great Expectations

With another wave of key corporate earnings reports due out this
week, we have highlighted below the companies that will likely
have the greatest impact on the overall market.  Keep close
track of these companies.  If they beat expectations, we are
likely to move higher.  If not, we are likely to re-test our key
support levels again.

Options traders playing the Technology sectors, watch Microsoft
on Tuesday.  Microsoft will likely dictate the climate for
the technology sector for 1Q99.

Excessive Optimism / Pessimism

Often times when companies release corporate earnings, the stock
will move/gap up or down depending on the level of expectation
built into the stock prior to the release date.  This level of
expectation can be measured, in part, by the Call/Put ratio and is
represented by our Pinnacle Index figure.  The average Pinnacle
Index is 2.0.  Therefore, an index appreciably higher than 2.0
reveals a high level of optimism while an index lower than 2.0
reveals a high level of pessimism.  For aggressive options traders,
we have highlighted companies reaching extreme expectation levels
below.

For example, the company with the highest and lowest expectation
reporting this week is Realnetworks (RNWK) and Baker Hughes (BHI)
with a Pinnacle Index of 12.2 and 1.0, respectively.  This
suggests that if Real Networks does not beat their estimate on
Tuesday, they are likely to sell-off.  Conversely, if Baker
Hughes beats their estimate or reports any favorable news, they
are likely to move higher.

The Power of Sentiment Analysis

Last October (1998), Pinnacle Capital Advisors tracked
corporate earnings reports and advised subscribers about
the impact that excessive optimism and pessimism can have
on the stocks's performance following the release of its
quarterly earnings report.  If you recall, we identified
several stocks that reached excessive sentiment levels
including Intel (INTC) and Pfizer (PFE).

Reporting                            Estimated   Pinnacle
Date        Company                        EPS      Index

Excessive Optimism:
10/13 INTL  Intel                          .79       5.2
10/13 JNJ   Johnson & Johnson              .70       3.7
10/15 AAPL  Apple Computer                 .49       3.6

Excessive Pessimism:
10/13 JPM   JP Morgan                     1.08        .4
10/12 C     Chrysler                       .87        .7
10/14 PFE   Pfizer                         .57        .9
10/13 GM    General Motors                 .98-      1.2
10/16 G     Gillette                       .30       1.3
10/14 MER   Merrill Lynch                  .56       1.5

The first is Intel (INTC).  The semiconductor powerhouse had
rallied ahead of its earnings report Tuesday night (10/13) and
closed at $83.88.  What's interesting is that they beat the
street's estimate by 9 cents and yet the stock gapped down
the next morning (10/14).  And despite the 330 point Dow rate
cut rally on Thursday (10/15), the stock had trouble taking
out its recent previous high of $85.88.  Here, our sentiment
analysis alerted subscribers that expectations had gotten
ahead of itself and that despite the good news, the stock had
trouble advancing.

We saw the opposite in the case of Pfizer (PFE).  This blue
chip Pharmaceutical company had sold off more than 20% from
its summer high ($120) to close at $95.50 before its release
Tuesday night (10/13).  Here, Pfizer actually missed its
estimated earnings by a nickel.  Although the stock initially
gapped down the next morning, it quickly rallied and closed
higher. Our message: it's all about understanding and
managing expectations.

Pinnacle Index

What is the Pinnacle Index.  It is simply the put/call ratio
at key overhigh benchmark levels.  Typically, there should be
two (2) calls for every one (1) put.   So when this ratio
reaches extremes levels, it can presage key turning points in
the stock.  The average Pinnacle Index, therefore, should read 2.0.

One of the key components that separate OptionInvestor.com
from any other advisory services is our sentiment indicator
or Pinnacle Index.  The Pinnacle Index is designed to measure
the level of overhead resistance at key overhead benchmark
levels. This analysis can give savvy option traders a jump on
other traders.

It's important to note that the Pinnacle Index, like many
sentiment indicators, is a contrarian indictor.  This means
that the stock can and will go higher or lower despite what
our sentiment indicators might suggest.  However, our
experience has shown that the market is subject to a
precipitous sell-off if the Pinnacle Index reaches extreme
levels.

Please be advised, I am planning to take the week of Vacation, 8/7-11/2000, 
unless this creates a conflict within the group.

I will notify, Brenda Whitehead so she can arrange coverage for my desk, as 
soon as I receive your approval.

Thank you for your consideration.

Taffy

I'm sorry I've been so hard to get ahold of lately.  Will you be available 
this afternoon - say around 3:30 or 4:00 (I'm pretty well booked until then).

Which makes it hard to call.  If you get this I'm at 713-853-7459 or you can 
e-mail back your number.  Sorry about that.

Justin:

Do you know whether we have acquired any companies with CFTC registrations of 
any kind (e.g. Commodity Trading Advisor or Futures Commission Merchant)?  I 
was wondering who was responsible for compliance matters if we have.

I hope you're well and all my best to Fran.

Mark and I are both unable to attend at that time. 

Can we reschedule for either 11:00 or after 3:30 Houston time?

I assume also that Andrea will attend. I would very much like her input, as I 
understand she is the one who raised the enforceability issue.

Mark and Dave,

 Last week, we met with a local "Certifying Company" called GIRE. Their 
service is based on the "Asymmetric Password Method" . We believe that using 
their services in the process of granting passwords to our local clients will 
contribute significantly to the enforceability of our transactions from a 
legal stand point. We would like to discuss this issue with both of you to 
determine if it is worth while to consider this alternative.
Is everyone available at 12:00 noon Buenos Aires, 10:00 am Houston?. Please 
confirm.

Regards

Patrick

PICKS WE DROPPED THIS WEEK
**************************
Remember that historically, when we drop a pick it will go up
10 to 15% the very next week. It is part of Murphy's Law.
Just because we drop a stock as a pick does not mean we are
advocating a "sell" on any position you have. We are simply
dropping our recommendation as a new play. Existing plays
can and do continue on and are usually profitable.

CALLS:

JBL $70.00 (-3.88) JBL closed under its 30 day moving average
on Friday.  Its chart has flattened out and it looks like it
has lost all momentum.  JBL has had a nice run since October,
but we are going to have to drop them as a pick.

MYG $63.63 (-0.62)  It is time to say good-bye to our
good 'ole friend Maytag.  For the past two weeks, MYG has
struggled in the weakened market.  It sure would have been
nice if Maytag had managed to keep its incredible streak alive.
But, the -143.41 drop in the market on Friday snuffed out any
chance of MYG rallying.  For the first time in eight
weeks it finished with a net negative.  Even though Maytag
announces earnings on Feb 4th and the possibility of a split
remains, we feel that Maytag has lost some of its steam.  We
are dropping it as a pick for the time being.

TLAB $79.63 (-6.31) Ciena, the flea, puts Tellabs in the
doghouse.  Seems like every time we get a good play on
Tellabs, rumors circulate that Ciena is again in
acquisition talks with them.  Ciena goes up $4 on the rumor
while TLAB pays the $4 penalty.  TLAB is still a great
company, but until the Ciena rumor goes away or the market
decides it likes the idea of a merger, we can't recommend a
play.  Thus we are dropping TLAB for now.

COF $128.69 (-1.75) We are dropping COF this week.  COF had
a sub-par week and just hasn't been performing like we would
expect it to.  Providian Financial has performed much better
and is COF's key competitor.  It is likely most of the damage
is sector related.  The banks are always weak whenever there
is economic worries overseas.  COF suffers with them despite
the fact that they have virtually no overseas exposure.  COF
did announced earnings that were right on estimates.

ETH $48.00 (-.94) We are dropping ETH in favor of some quicker
moving plays.  ETH has had a strong run, but has turned down
now for three straight days.  ETH had a nice earnings push and
was able to get as high as $50.75 on the 19th, but since then
has tapered off.  ETH CEO did mention that there is a lot of
pent up demand for their products and when this comes to
fruition, we might see a move to the upside.  Of course this
could just be a consolidation after the strong move.

FTL $17.81 (+1.13) While the possibility of a takeover is
still there, FTL has hit a ceiling in it's enthusiasm.
For the last couple of weeks it's been trading sideways.
We feel it may be stuck in a holding pattern while waiting
on news of an offer.  If you are still interested in playing
you might consider the May options thus giving yourself
more time.  However, if volume is any indication, current
month Febuarys have been popular.  Monday mornings have
become the popular time to announce news of mergers and
buyouts.  Something could be brewing for the Jan. 25th.

F $60.88 (-1.13) After a 10% rise in operating profits,
a 100% increase in their cost cutting success, and their
11th consecutive quarter of beating the street's estimates
and their stock drops almost 4 points.  It is quite likely
that the Dow's 215 drop Thursday/Friday was a catalyst
for the decline but we expected better from this automaker.

CCU $59.06 (-1.37) Dropping 2 days in a row after setting
a new 52 week high, CCU has succumbed to profit takers.
We understand the need for consolidation and pullbacks
after a strong run, but breaking through it's 10 dma is
not a good sign.  Depending on how the market performs
next week, we will either see a large bounce back up
through its 10 dma or a continued slide.  Increased
interest in competitor AMFM's merger or acquisition
activity may drive interest back into this sector but
we are cautious and willing to trade this play for a
stronger one.  Nimble traders should watch for
opportunities.  This stock is prone to strong 3-5-7
day cycle trading.

PUTS:

Eastman Kodak (EK) - $65.50 .25  (-3.50)
Big winner for OI subscribers after stock gave up more than
$15 over the past two weeks.  Stock reached our target of $65
and now trading at prior support level.

Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS) - $47.75 +1.75 (.75)
Stock trading and holding above key support level of $45.
Will revisit play if ERTS violates support.

Eli Lilly (LLY) - $80.25 2.31 (-1.00)
Stock rallied more than $2.00 during Friday's (1/22) broad

CSCO - Cisco Sys. $102.81 (+1.13)(-5.00)(+13.88)(P7W +28.11)

Cisco is the leading networker and is expected to help
build the next generation Internet. Their goal is to allow
people to access or transfer information without regard to
differences in time, place or type of computer systems,
voice or data.  About 85% of the routers used to decipher
and direct data traffic on the Internet are made by Cisco.

CSCO will gain tremendously from the AT&T/TCI merger since
they will build the equipment needed to harness the mass
appeal of broadband services.  Similarly, in an agreement
signed this week, Cisco will provide technology to Daxian
Electronics so that Daxian can build cable modems under the
Cisco brand to develop cable broadband services in China.
China already serves 100 million cable customers, just 10%
of the market.  Wow!  What potential to connect Chinese
citizens with local and long distance phone service,
Internet, data services, video conferencing, etc.  CSCO
will earn royalties from the transaction too.  Also, a
reminder from a Reuters news release, Cisco continues to
grow 35% per year while the market grows 15%.  CSCO is
truly leading the development of the Internet by helping
cable and phone companies complete "the last mile", or the
distance between the cable in the street an your home.

With as volatile a week as we had on NASDAQ, CSCO held up
well.  It is time we watch for CSCO's earnings run.  Plus,
the network giant is once again a split candidate.  They
are due to announce earnings after the close on February 2nd
where we expect them to announce a split.  It's unusual that
they would split so soon after their 3:2 in September.
Historically though, CSCO splits in the $80-100 range and
they have enough shares authorized to give us another 3:2.
Greet price dips as a buying opportunity, confirm market
direction and use stops.  Day trading CSCO can usually earn
you 5-10% on any given trading day (if you pick the right
option), but you have to watch it and use limit orders (target
shooting works too).  If you do, at least be disciplined.

Internet
********
AOL - America Online $140.44 (-6.06)(+0.00)(-8.63)(P6W +83.56)

America Online is the largest online Internet access
service in the world.  Membership now exceeds 15 million
users.  Its Chairman, Steve Case, said more new users
signed up with AOL on Christmas Day than any other day in
the company's history.  With estimates of 16 million users
by the year 2000 and growing advertising revenues AOL has
been called the blue chip of the Internets. (If only they
could get their mail problem resolved!)

A case of throwing the baby out with the bath water.
Almost every analyst we hear from regarding the "long
overdue" sell-off of Internet stocks qualifies it with,
"But AOL is the exception".  This was not a good week
overall for the internets; tough on AOL too, though they
showed good strength in adding back $5 from their $135 
opening on Friday morning.  Frankly, we struggle at times
playing AOL during it's consolidation phase.  We still think
that with earnings just 3 trading days away, with the
expectation of a split announcement, buyers will step in to
raise the price and give us a healthy run-up.  AOL reports
23,000 new customers logging on daily, and over $1 billion
sales through its site for the Christmas season.  Weekly,
they add new advertisers paying dearly for the exclusive
privilege of appearing on AOL.  Ever notice those companies
don't report how much it costs them?  It's a lot and we
expect it to be nicely reflected in an earnings surprise.
AOL is well over historic split territory, usually $120-
$130.  They have enough authorized share to give a 3:1, but
2:1 is more likely. Earning are expected after 5:00 p.m.
ET, Wednesday, January 27.  Given the recent pounding
stocks take after announcing great earnings, we strongly
caution all traders to re-analyze their risk to hold over
an earnings announcement.  Just because we expect great
numbers and a split doesn't mean that their earnings won't
turn sour or that a split may fail to materialize.  Confirm
market direction and use stops.  Intestinal fortitude
required.

In the news this week, Prodigy, once a strong AOL
competitor, threw in the towel on 208,00 subscribers of its
Prodigy Classic service because it will not be Y2K
compliant.  Wednesday, AOL reported that they drew 54.5% of
all Internet users at some point in the month of December.
MSFT trailed by 6 percentage points.  AOL Japan reported
200,000 total subscribers.  The real news, not in print, is
about earnings and possible split.

********
WCOM - MCIWorldCom $74.88 (-0.18)(+0.06)(+3.25)(P5W +9.31)

Telecommunications behemoth, MCIWorldCom, is the recent
offspring between a marriage of formerly #2 long distance
provider MCI and #4 provider WorldCom.  Now the newly
formed giant of giants is duking it out with AT&T as they
stake their claim in the local phone service, international
service, cellular, paging, and Internet access arenas.
WorldCom's $37 billion purchase of MCI last September
qualifies it the 7th largest merger or acquisition in 1998.
WCOM is one of the largest Internet backbone providers in
the world.  If you're reading this letter, somewhere in the
transmission, WCOM fiber brought it to you.

WCOM, the 5th largest component of the NASDAQ 100, was down
slightly on the week, which we think is good news given the
Brazil/China/Greenspan jitters.  Buyers stepped in with
heavy volume of 11-18 million shares daily to offer support
in the $73 range.  Average daily volume is 10.7 million
shares.  Technical indicators are not looking so great
right now, except for the strong bounce off Thursday's low.
Resistance is $80.  Market permitting, we expect the bounce
to continue and look for nice profits as WCOM tests $80
again.  If it breaks $80 with good volume, the sky is the
limit.

Noteworthy this week, UUNET, the ISP (Internet service
provider) division of WCOM announced they would be the
service provider for Gateway Computer customer's Internet
service.  Gateway said it chose UUNET because it was the
first company to offer commercial access to the Internet,
and it continues to maintain the industry's most reliable,
rigorously managed and most widely deployed network
(Reuters).  Reuters also noted in a different release that
WCOM was one of Fidelity Magellan's top 10 holdings.
Analyst have also said, "earnings will benefit from the
company's strong position in the fastest-growing segments
of the industry, such as data, Internet and international.
Still getting mileage from award of the GSA contract and
baby bells unfortunate court rulings preventing the baby
bells from entering the long distance market in their home
areas.  This spells good news and continued earnings growth
for the big 3 long distance providers.

QWST - Qwest Communications $60.13 (+3.82)

The Colorado based Qwest Communications International is the
fifth largest local and long distance telephone company in
the United States.  It is also secures broadband
Internet-based data and provides voice and image
communication capabilities to businesses and consumers.
It is currently expanding its reach into Mexico and most of
Europe. In the US, QWST is building its Internet
Protocol-based fiber-optic network which will connect
over 130 cities by mid 1999.

It was nice to see that QWST continued the upward trend it
established early in the week.  We initiated coverage of
this company in Thursday's newsletter.  On Friday, it
affirmed our beliefs by finishing the day up +$0.75 even
though the markets were extremely shaky.  The most recent
date we have for earnings is listed in Zack's as being on
February 11th.  Confirm upward movement before initiating
any new plays.

News:  Qwest has recently formed relationships with several
companies including Verio Inc., Ford, Hometown Connections
and Covad Communications Group Inc.  All of the contracts
formed revolve around improving communication capabilities.

T - AT&T $88.25 (+4.00)(+9.31)(+1.19)

AT&T, the mother of all phone companies isn't just a long
distance company any more. Through growth and acquisition,
they now provide data transmission, video tele-
conferencing, PCS/wireless/cellular, Internet, paging and
local phone services via microwave, fiber and copper
infrastructure throughout the U.S. and international
markets.  Their annual revenues in excess of $55 billion
dwarf their nearest competitor, MCIWorldCom, by 5 times.
Their 1998 acquisition of TCG (formerly Teleport
Communications Group, the nations largest competitive local
exchange carrier) and IBM's data services division will add
substantially to their revenues.  Pending a merger with
cable giant, TCI, revenues could grow even more.  Michael
Armstrong, AT&T's CEO, has investors believing that AT&T is
no longer a copper wire dinosaur heading-up the telecom
extinction list.

This is an earnings and momentum play.  Up $4.00 on a down
week, T is behaving more like a tech stock with $6 daily
swings.  Technicals look great and will look even better
when the market shakes off its jitters.  T traded as high
as $96 inter-day Wednesday to give us tremendous profits.
We hope you protected them from the backslide using stop
loss orders.  Given AT&T's turnaround with Michael
Armstrong at the helm, we think AT&T will show excellent
earnings and revenue growth.  There is some confusion with
earnings announcement date shown as January 26 by Zack's.
This is most likely inaccurate.  First Call lists no report
date.  AT&T shareholder relations says, "between February
23-25".  We'll report it to you when AT&T clarifies the
pictures.  In the meantime, with AT&T's current strength,
dips should be met as a buying opportunity.

Some great news: AT&T may sell it's WorldNet ISP division
to @Home for $1 billion in @Home stock.  At Home would then
fold WorldNet's 1.3 million subscribers into its customer
base of 330,000, with the goal of converting the AT&T users
to its much faster, cable-based service.  AT&T, however,
essentially would retain control of it's online service
because it's about to acquire voting control over At Home
with its pending $41 billion purchase of the second largest
U.S. cable TV operator, Tele-Communications Inc.  TCI owns
a 58 percent voting stake in At Home and 28 percent of its
common shares (CBSMarketwatch).  With @Home buying Excite,
AT&T would then have the content to compete with the likes
of AOL.

For those new to our publication (veterans, please forgive
us), three weeks ago, AT&T got the green light to merge
with TCI thus creating a huge bandwidth pipe (lots of
transmission capacity) over "the last Mile" or that short
distance between the street and your phone jack.  It's
estimated that it costs $1200 per home for a typical
utility to trench and install any transmission equipment.
That's why even though the fiber optic cable runs down your
street, you can't yet access it.  It's too expensive to get
it to you.  Soon, you'll be able to bypass that fiber in
favor of AT&T/TCI cable.  It's already there.  Translation:
increased revenues.

NOKA - Nokia $144.56 (+5.94)(+3.63)

Nokia is a supplier of telecommunications systems and
equipment and is the world's leading maker of cellular
phones. It's telecommunications and mobile phone sales are
growing rapidly, and margins are higher as well.

We dropped Nokia on Jan. 10th as it began a correction and
picked it up again in last Sunday's letter.  It rewarded us
with a 16.81 jump in price by mid-day Wednesday, before
losing two thirds of that to market weakness the rest of the
week.  Nokia was still up $5.94 on the week.  The
entire telecommunications industry is very strong now, as
investors realize that it is one of the sectors with the most
exciting growth prospects.  As one of the premier companies in
that sector, Nokia is especially strong.  It continues to
announce new contracts to supply its cutting edge products to
companies throughout the world, and plans to double
production at one of it's German plants to meet demand.

We are recommending Nokia as a momentum play and also as a
split candidate.  It's last split announcement was followed be
a long, powerful rise in the stock price. Earnings will be
announced before the bell on Friday, January 29th. Although we
believe that a split announcement is likely, remember what
happened to several other stocks that either did not beat
estimates by a wide enough margin, or did not announce the
expected split.  There is opportunity to play Nokia before the
earnings are released. You could pick them up again Friday
morning if the company announces a split, and the earnings
are as strong as we expect. Holding over can be rewarding but
is always risky.

VOD - Vodafone Group PLC $187.38 (+11.38)

The vote is in, and Vodafone Group is the UK's #1 mobile
telecommunications company, serving about four million
customers. It operates analog and digital cellular networks
offering voice communications, messaging, paging, and mobile
data services. Vodafone sells its cellular phone services
through three distribution businesses: Vodafone Retail,
Vodafone Connect, and Vodafone Corporate. The company provides
cellular services in 12 countries outside the UK; international
operations account for 28% of total revenues. Vodafone will
nearly double its size with the purchase of US-based AirTouch
Communications.

VOD took a down turn with the rest of the market on Friday.  We
don't view this as anything other than profit taking.  If and when
the market resumes it's uptrend, we feel VOD will be a big winner.
Analysts have seemed to like the recent merger announcement of
VOD and ATI.  On the 19th, one analyst raised VOD from neutral
to outperform.  The combining of these two companies has very
little overlap.  This is good news for the current stock price,
because very little overlap means the quicker earnings can be
increased.  When you look at a chart of VOD, you'll notice the
choppy nature of the chart.  VOD has a lot of gaps at the open.
This is due to the nature of an ADR(American Depository Receipt).

*OI is low because the stock moves so quickly.

Before I get legal and PR to look at this could you give me a bit more 
background on the potential arrangement with NextSet. I dont understand where 
the need for training will come in. 

I know that generally Enron has a policy of not being seen to endorse a 
client's products. PR may therefore have a problem with giving NextSet the 
ability to put our logo on their site. How important is this likely to be ?

Thanks again for stopping by this morning.  Per our conversation, I am
attaching a mutual NDA and a standard LOI.  With the former in place, we
should both be able to get a little deeper into the technology to see if
there is a strong fit between our respective companies.  I would be very
interested to introduce our CTO with your technology counterpart the next

best.

I saw this on the internet & thought I'd pass it along.....

Eating fish does contribute to your intelligence, particularly before and 
just after you're born. 

A researcher at the University of Connecticut has found that some fish are 
high in a certain chemical that's vital to brain and nerve cell growth in 
fetuses and newborns. 

Babies can't make enough docahexanoic -- or DHA -- a fatty acid that helps 
the brain develop. They must take whatever their mothers give them, either 
through the umbilical cord or by breast-feeding after they're born. And note 
that baby formula isn't fortified with DHA. 

Women who eat cold-water species, like salmon, trout, sardines and tuna, give 
their babies a better chance at maximizing brain tissue development, the 
research found. Other fish high in the chemical are herring, swordfish and 
mackerel. 

It would be nice if they could give us a counterparty name - I've never heard 
of Jerry Peskuchi.

Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on.

Did you get this?  I didn't see your name on the addressee list.

Mark, 

I will be back in Houston this weekend, so I wanted to check with you for a 
time to come meet you and the other people next week.? Right now my schedule 
is wide open so let me know a time that is convenient for you.

Sorry if you have left any messages on my cell phone.? Estes Park is outside

I look forward to hearing from you.

now and anything we were talking about is under a Confidentiality.

Andy needs some advice on how to pursue - obviously it helps them to say the

  Leading online platform signs agreements with HoustonStreet Exchange
and True Quote

  EnronOnline, Enron Corp.'s giant online platform,, has made the first
Commodity in what may become a consolidation of competing electronic
trading exchanges in the energy industry.

  Enron Net Works, the division which operates EnronOnline, last week
signed cooperative agreements with HoustonStreet Exchange and True quote
LLC.

  And industry sources confirm that EnronOnline is negotiating similar
deals with several other exchanges, including Houston-based Altra Energy
Technologies and RedMeteor, as well as e-Speed, an exchange backed by
Dynegy and, Williams.

  HoustonStreet Exchange, headquartered in Portsmouth, N.H., was
recently ranked among the top 20 dependent energy exchanges by AMR
Research, a Boston consulting firm which put Altra in first place.

  True Quote, based in Louisville, Ky.,  a startup trading platform
being developed by APB Energy -- an over-the-counter brokerage firm --
along with PG&E National Energy Group, EnForm Technology and Microsoft
Corp.

  EnronOnline is the world largest commodity trading platform, but users
an only trade with Enron. Rather than being a true trading exchange,
industry insiders describe it as simply an online extension of Enron's
business.

  But in EnronOnline's first six months of operation after being
launched last November, the value of transactions conducted on the,
system surpassed $50 billion at a rate of $1.5 billion a day. The
platform offers trading in a wide variety of commodities, from most
forms of energy to bandwidth and paper

  MORE EYEBALLS

  The agreements EnronOnline has struck will enable the company to post
the prices at which it will buy or sell natural gas and electricity on
HousonStreet.com and TrueQuote.com Neither HoustonStreet nor TrueQuote
prices, however, will appear on EnronOnline. Customers on those two
sites who click on an Enron quote will be instantly linked to
EnronOnline, where the trades will take place.

  "As Louise (Kitchen, president of EnronOnline) said, extending their
pricing to more eyeballs will build more transaction volume for Enron,"
says Paul Bourke, president of Altra. "The question is whether it will
build volume for the other exchanges.

  "We are talking to Enron," Bourke adds. "We are intrigued, and we are
attempting understand what the business benefits to Altra would be."

  He says an Enron-Altra deal would be "more complicated" than those
involving other exchanges because of Altra's significant liquidity in
natural gas. Altra is the leader in online natural gas trading.

  While none of the exchanges would reveal what, if any, financial terms
are involved in the agreements--other than to say there is no sharing of
commissions --Bourke says he expects that if Altra and Enron finalize an
agreement, Enron would take a small equity position in Altra. He
speculates that this is what Enron did with HoustonStreet.

  Brian Pieri, vice president of Red Meteor, says the value of
EnronOnline to the other exchanges is that "they bring' tight-bid
offers, which is something the exchanges have to work hard on. And more
people will make the bid offers even tighter."

  This means buy and sell prices are close together, which helps market
liquidity.

  Asked if the additional liquidity and trading volume that Enron might
bring to the other exchanges wouldn't just further fragment the market,
Pieri compared the whole online trading scene to a sixth-grade dance.

  "The boys are all on one side of the room and the girls are on the
other side, and nobody is dancing. Somebody has to start and then
everybody else joins in. Enron brings more validity to this very new
situation," Pied says.

  "All of the exchanges are trying to build liquidity, of which Enron is
the king," says Bill Swanton, an analyst with AMR Research.

  Swanton predicts that the energy exchanges will consolidate within the
next six to eight months, and the ultimate surviving exchanges will not
be owned by any single player.

  "You need an independent exchange. I can't imagine Enron will end up
running it. The trading community won't be satisfied with that," he
says.

  Swanton points out, however, that Enron "will attract attention they
don't want if they force, some of these guys out of business."

  But HoustonStreet's CEO, Frank Getman, takes a different view of what
the Enron deals mean.

  "Web-based energy trading exchanges are no longer about liquidity,
thanks to these EnronOnline data deals," he says. "The game is now about
functionality and value-added services."

Sorry for the delay in catching up with my e-mails. Yes, MG London Inc is the 
clearing member of NYMEX/COMEX and is FCM & CTA. The only other MG companies 
who have any exchange/regulatory registrations are in the UK and are 
Metallgesellschaft Ltd (LME & SFA, also LIFFE to come), MG Brokers Ltd (LME &

Jon,

Grateful if you could complete the picture for me and for Mark Taylor.    Is 
MG London Inc. the entity that is the Clearing Member of NYMEX + a Futures 
Commission Merchant and Commodity Trading Advisor?   Do any other (MG) 
entities have similar registrations, and if so, what are these?

Thanks

Justin

Justin:

Do you know whether we have acquired any companies with CFTC registrations of 
any kind (e.g. Commodity Trading Advisor or Futures Commission Merchant)?  I 
was wondering who was responsible for compliance matters if we have.

I hope you're well and all my best to Fran.

SNC - Snyder Communications, Inc. $37.75 (+2.44)

Snyder Communications, Inc. designs develops and implements
innovative and value-added outsourced marketing services.
The company's marketing programs are designed to target
high-value customer segments through database management
services, proprietary product sampling, publications,
sponsored information display in prime locations, field sales
representatives, inbound and outbound teleservices and related
services.  Snyder also provides proprietary distribution
channels, customer care and retention services.  The company
has international operations in the United Kingdom, Ireland
and Hungary.

SNC is right at previous resistance.  If it can break through
and hold above $38.00, it could have some room to really go.
SNC doesn't announce earnings until February 10th.  In the past,
SNC has announced nice earnings surprises.  The last seven
surprises have gone like this: +4%,9%,11%,6%,15%,33%,14%.
Earnings are figured to increase by 65% over the prior year
period.

Snyder Communications, Inc. announced on the 14th of January
that it has extended an earlier contract sales relationship
with Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  This latest
two year pharmaceutical sales contract builds upon earlier
agreements under which Snyder Healthcare Sales, a division
of Snyder Communications, has provided targeted national sales
support for Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals since 1997.

Software - Sector
*****************
MSFT - Microsoft $156.25 (+6.50)(-0.13)(+11.19)(P6W +25.07)

From their own words, "Microsoft Rules." Although it's
current reign is being rocked with revolution, the Evil M-
pire (as some programmers and anti-Internet Explorer
browser patriots call it), has been fighting the Federal
government on anti-trust grounds for months. The line to
take their turn and bad mouth the bully was long and
distinguished. The fact is, MSFT is good at what they do.
They are the world's #1 software company (Y2K compliant or
not!) and their operating systems dominate the PC
landscape.

To those who closed their eyes and held their breath
through earnings, congratulations on a great play!  If you
sold prior to the announcement you still did very well.
MSFT gave us blowout earnings of $0.73.  The street's
whisper number was $0.64.  See, no material effect on
earnings.  Technical indicators are still positive, but a
pullback from its 1-day $13 spike after earnings should be
expected.  MSFT may drift a bit during this period of
market turmoil.  But be ready when the market firms, as
fund buyers have fresh cash to buy the big cap tech stocks.
MSFT will be their #1 target after its muscular
demonstration of earnings growth.  This post-announcement
drift won't last and presents a buying opportunity.  Rumors
are circulating that MSFT may still give us our previously
predicted split this coming week.  It comes from a
reputable source in addition to the usual suspects, but
should still be treated as a rumor.  We've also heard that
Microsoft's CFO, Greg Maffei, would rather wait to split
the stock until it reaches $200.

We will keep you apprised if it happens.  In the meantime,
the trial goes on.  MSFT's man took the stand today in the
company's defense.  To wit, Dow Jones News quotes Mr.
Maritz, "Competitors such as International Business
Machines Corp., Apple Computer Inc. and Sun Microsystems
Inc., focus primarily upon selling their operating system
products as part of relatively expensive new computer
systems, necessarily limiting their sales volume, and
thereby reducing incentives for other software developers
to create applications that run on their operating system
products.  Conversely, Microsoft provides a platform that
is compatible with a range of products, offers its product
at a low price and continually innovates.  Ironically, the
very thing that makes Windows valuable to computer
manufacturers, software publishers and customers is now
under attack in this lawsuit."  Well said.

ORCL - Oracle Corporation  $49.88 (+2.75)

Oracle is the leading developer of database management system
software, which lets multiple users and applications use the
same data at the same time.  Its flagship database software
runs on everything from notebook computers to mainframes.
Oracle8, a faster, more flexible version of the firm's database
software, provides support for a system of network computers -
stripped-down, low-cost computer terminals operated through a
control server.  Oracle also makes application development
productivity tools and computer-automated software engineering
products, among others.

ORCL gapped open on Tuesday in reaction to the IBM
announcement (see below).  After setting a new 52 week high
early on Wednesday, it traded down for the rest of Wednesday and
Thursday on what looked like profit taking.  It then bounced
nicely off of its 10 day moving average on Friday.  Since late
November, ORCL has been getting a little ahead of its 10 day
moving average, then pulling back to it, all in a nice upward
trend.  Last week this movement was a little exaggerated with
IBM announcement, but ORCL might be a good candidate for some
target shooting around its 10 dma.

In the news last week, ORCL announced that it is teaming up
with IBM to offer its software on IBM hardware.  The offering
will be targeted at manufacturers and will be available
sometime during the 1st quarter.  It will feature ORCL's
manufacturing and financial applications running on IBM's
Netfinity and RS/6000 servers.  In other news, Morgan Stanley
raised their price target for ORCL to $58 and maintained its
outperform rating.

WAG - Walgreen Co. $58.44 (+1.44)

Walgreen's is ranked #1 in the US among drugstore chains.
It has more than 2,600 freestanding stores located throughout
the US and Puerto Rico.  They even have the infamous
"drive-through" service in case you're just too sick to go
into the store! On January 13th, they announced a 71% increase
in first quarter earnings above that of last year's Q1 report.
Prescription drugs account for almost half of their sales.
Over the counter medications and general merchandise ranging
from food an beverages to toiletries make up the other half.

A little over a week ago, Walgreen Co. reported strong first
quarter earnings and a 2:1 stock split scheduled for Feb. 12th.
We waited until WAG showed signs of a steady uptrend before
adding them as one of our plays.  Walgreen's finished the week
up +$1.44 and held firm in the rocky market waters.
This could be the beginning of the split run.

No new news for Walgreen's this week.

PRIA -PRI Automation, Inc. $35.88 (+1.33)(+4.87)

PRIA designs, develops, manufactures, and markets factory
automation systems for the cleanroom manufacturing operations
of semi-conductor makers and OEM equipment suppliers. Last
year's $178.2 million in revenues reflects the big downturn
in the semi-conductor industry, but that is changing. The
1998 glut of chips has been depleted, and demand is strong
again for these products.

Although it hit a high of $37.50 in Feb, 1998, PRIA stock had
lost about 75% of its value by the time the market bottomed
in October. However, it has been climbing fairly steadily
ever since, except for a brief correction in December. With
the chip industry recovering, it follows that a company in
PRIA's business will benefit. This is a momentum play in an
improving industry.

PRIA is a quiet company, with little news. Earnings are due
out Jan. 28th.

MU - Micron Technology $70.50 (-.81)(+7.68)

Micron Technology makes semi-conductor memory products, PCs,
circuit boards, memory modules, and system level assemblies,
and has a market capitalization of $17.6 billion. Revenues
for MU declined last year due to lower selling prices of PCs
and semi-conductor products. This was a result of too much
product industry wide and too little demand, but the company
is recovering now, as demand increases.

An overabundance of chips sent prices down from $200 a year
ago to below $60 in May, but they have recovered to near $90
now, as the surplus has dried up. A decreasing supply is
partly the cause. The Koreans, for instance, have been
cutting production. But the demand for chips is also
increasing because sales of PCs are on the rise. PC maker
Gateway reported strong earnings on Thursday after the bell.
Intel, the semi-conductor sector heavy-weight, showed a 12%
earnings surprise in its just-ended quarter. Micron's quarter
doesn't end until February, but it appears to be doing well.

Analyst Gregory Mishou, at Warburg Dillon Read, upped his
1999 earnings forecast to $.12 from a LOSS of $.11, and
raised his 2000 estimate to $2.31 from $1.95. He believes MU
could trade up into the mid-90s in this market. After hitting
a new high of $78.25 on Wednesday, MU pulled back with the
rest of the market. It was up slightly on Friday, however. If
the stock continues to move up on Monday, this may be an
opportunity to move into options on MU.

XLNX - Xilinx, Inc. $78.19 (+5.31)

Xilinx is one of the top makers of field-programmable gate
arrays (FPGAs) and complex programmable logic devices (CPLDs),
integrated circuits that customers can program to perform
specific functions.  The company also provides the software
necessary for programming its chips.  Xilinx's chips are used
by electronics makers in the telecommunications, data
processing, industrial and medical instrumentation, military
and aerospace, and networking markets.  The company minimizes
its overhead by contracting out its chip manufacturing to
companies in Asia.  About a quarter of Xilinx's sales are in
Europe.  Main rival Altera has a nearly equal market share.

XLNX had an interesting week.  On the 20th, XLNX announced
record earnings along with a 2:1 stock split in March.  This
pushed the shares as high as $87.63 on the 20th.  The last two
trading days saw a little bit of profit taking.  It looks like
XLNX might fill the gap open it made on the 20th and start a new
run.  A good risk reward ratio would be a bounce off the gap on
the 20th.  This is at the $75.00 range.  XLNX might also just
turn and go up if the NASDAQ continues its record move up.
(the split is set for March 11th)

On the 20th, six different analysts upgraded XLNX.  This is a
very good sign for the future.  These analysts would have
downgraded the stock if they thought the stock was to highly
valued already.  XLNX noted in their earnings report that
revenue from telecommunications companies increased substantially.
This is a good sign.  The telecoms are a fast growing industry
and this should help XLNX's future earnings.

LXK - Lexmark Intl $99.25 (+1.19)(-2.50)(+.06)(+7.25)(+1.31)

Lexmark has good peripheral vision. Lexmark International
Group is a leading maker of computer printers and related
products, which generate more than 80% of its sales. Its
printer line includes laser printers (designed primarily
for corporate networks and desktops) and ink-jet printers
(for home and business use). Unlike many of its competitors,
Lexmark develops and manufactures it's own printers, which
results in fast product cycle times. The company also makes 
supplies for IBM and other name brand printers and typewriters.
Lexmark's products are sold in more than 15,000 retail outlets
in more than 150 countries.

LXK held up pretty decent this week, considering the market.
LXK has it's earnings announcement before market on Monday (25th).
This has been confirmed with investor relations.  LXK is sitting
right on its 20-dma for the 2nd week in a row.  For those looking
to get in on the split, wait for a pullback after the gap
open.  If LXK disappoints, we feel its time will come to an end.
This earnings season has been disastrous for many companies that
seemed to have announced good earnings.

LXK news has been non existent for the last week.  In general,
the technology sector has held up.  LXK has held up slightly
better than its industry.  It all depends on the announcement
Monday.

EMC - EMC Corporation $98.50 (-1.56)(+6.50)(+8.56)(+3.38)

EMC is a Fortune 500 company that designs, manufactures,
markets an supports high performance storage products.  The
company's products store retrieve, manage, protect and share
information from all major computing environments, including
UNIX, Windows NT and mainframe platforms.  EMC markets its
memory products under the name Symmetrix.  EMC and its
enterprise storage systems have developed a clear cut
technological edge over its competition.  The company has been
able to successfully leverage its leadership position in the
mainframe storage area into the lucrative, faster growing open
systems market.

In the news last week, Staples, the world's largest operator of
office superstores, announced that they have standardized their
data storage needs on an EMC system.  The reasons they gave
were to more effectively manage rapid business growth, reduce
information management costs, and improve customer service.
Also, there was an interesting article at MSN MoneyCentral
comparing EMC and its rival NTAP.  An observation by the
article was that every bit of new e-mail, every sale over the
Internet, and every extra page view increases the need to build
more storage into the Internet.  It also pointed out that EMC
has just begun selling software to its customer base.  Software
sales are expected to grow from $400 million in 1998 to $1
billion by 2001.

Last week was EMC's first losing week in the last 5 weeks.
Then again, the techs were under some heavy selling pressure
last week.  EMC set a new 52 week high on Wednesday, and then
traded down.  There was a scary gap down at the open on Friday,
but EMC recovered nicely.  EMC reports earnings before the
open on 1/26, and as we indicated last week, we don't believe
there will be a split announcement with earnings.  After
further research, EMC does not have enough shares authorized
and their next shareholders meeting is not expected until
April.  Also, please note that the option root on some EMC
options has changed.

XIRC - Xircom Inc. $42.00 (+2.12)(+1.38)(+4.50)(+1.25)

Xircom makes adapters that connect portable PCs to corporate
networks, the Internet, and commercial online services. The
company's products include adapter/modem cards (CreditCard
Ethernet+Modem), network adapters for portable PCs (Pocket
Ethernet Adapter, Pocket Token Ring Adapter), and modem-only
PC cards (CreditCard Modem). Xircom sells its products to
original equipment manufacturers and through a worldwide
network of distributors, value-added resellers, and computer
retailers. Over half of its income is from foreign sales.
Intel owns 11% of Xircom; chairman and CEO Dirk Gates owns
about 5%.

XIRC announced earnings on the 19th of January that were $.05
above consensus estimates and a penny ahead of the whisper.
On the 20th, XIRC traded as high as $44.50.  We feel when the
market resumes its bullish stance, XIRC will be a strong
mover.  XIRC bounced off its 10-dma Friday for the 3rd time in
5 days.  A close right on the high of the day on Friday also
shows some internal strength.

No recent news on XIRC.  Here are some of the actual figures
announced with XIRC earnings.  Net sales increased 83% over
the prior year period.  Net income increase 354%, to $.39
from $.11.  The RealPort family of Integrated PC Cards now
accounts for about 40% of revenues.  Pretty impressive.

SUNW - Sun Microsystems $98.00 (-2.44)(+9.56)(+5.25)(+2.32)

UltraSPARCs, Netra servers, SPARCstations, and Solaris (for
Unix) are all products of Sun Microsystems.  Sun is also the
creator of the Java computer language.  They are also the
recent partners with AOL in the Netscape merger.

This past Wednesday, SUN traded as high as $115.75.  But
severe profit taking and differing opinions drove the stock
to as low as $96.44 before their earnings announcement on
Thursday.  Even after announcing positive earnings, a 22%
increase in revenues, and a 2:1 stock split, SUNW's stock
wasn't able to recover.  Sun had actually attempted to shrug
off all of the profit takers and reached $100.25 in intraday
trading on Friday.  But, it then lost those gains and closed
down -$0.25.  Maybe the unstable market contributed to the
drop.  Maybe it had to do with BancBoston Robertson Stephens
downgrading the stock stating a drop-off in bookings, backlogs,
more competition, and revenue reports that weren't up to par
with their expectations.  However, S&P rated them an
accumulate and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rated them a strong
buy.  They were happy with the "sharp rise" in earnings which
were in line with their expectations and the positive future
outlook of the company.  In any case, we would like to see the
market and Sun Microsystems turn around before initiating any
new plays on the split news.  Friday's lack of any serious
profit-taking on top of Thursday's action and earnings
report is an encouraging sign.

Other News:   SUN will officially unveil their Jini technology
on Monday.  Excitement is building over the possibilities of
networking electronic devices by using the new language.
Eight companies, including Sony and Sharp, will collaborate
with SUN to develop the ability for HAVi compliant devices to
use the new Jini.

It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office 
used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new 
office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out 
your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will 
probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you 
as much notice as possible.

Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet?

Yes - please go ahead and forward a copy to Ed.  I don't think Mark Holsworth 
needs to be involved in this one.  Unfortunately, I don't know of anything 
directly on point other than the agreement we negotiated the last time (I 
guess Justin coordinated that - I don't remember reading it).

Mark:

I just received the ISN contract for the Olympics game.  Should I send a copy 
to Ed at Milbank as well?  Any reason Mark Holsworth needs to be involved?    
I have reviewed numerous license agreements and feel comfortable with many of 
the issues, but I do not hold myself out as an IP expert.  Have we entered 
into similar agreements with other content providers that would be good 
precedent for my review.

Jon,

I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX 
Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory 
issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM 
entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity?

[Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & 
Cromwell paper]

Thanks.
Justin

Jon, 

My suggestion would be for the FX business be run out of a NON FCM firm in 
the states (NY) since it is a non-regulated product. 

If you have an questions please call me at x5845.

We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
change MG's status.

Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
"arranger" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
solutions:

The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
and Switzerland.

Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
you need any further information, please let me know.

Many thanks.

Suzanne:
FYI.  Can you and the clerks handle packing up my office?  I may be able to 
help but I don't want to make any commitment  that I can make it up there.  
Hopefully, it won't take that long and the only files that need to be marked 
or perhaps put in the legal assistant area are the files near my window.  If 
the move-out timing slips and happens while you are on vacation, I would 
prefer that it be handled before hand so that the floater doesn't have to 
worry about it.  Let me know what you think.  Sorry to impose but I tried to 
do as much as I could before I left.

My only concern is the 8 hours out of date reference.  As of when?  It might 
not be 8 hours old when they go to press so do we mean when it is being

DELL - Dell Computer $83.00 (+4.00)(+1.19)(+4.62)(P3W+6.00)

Dell is the largest direct sales PC manufacturer in the
world, listed at 125th in the Fortune-500 and 343rd in the
Global-500 of top companies, with $16.8 billion in sales
over the last 4 quarters. Dell has consistently
outperformed any other major stock for price performance.
Dell is up +1200% in the last five years and has split
their stock five times in the last three years, two times
in 1998 alone.  Dell is a low price, high margin producer
because it has only 6 days of inventory and doesn't have to
pay its suppliers (some who manufacture in Asia) until 8
days later. Since Dell gets paid before it manufactures a
box, they have a huge cash float-can you say "83% return on
equity?"  In late December, they announced a multi-year
marketing deal with AOL to place AOL on all Dell desktops.
In its server business, Dell managed a 62% year over year
sequential revenue growth.  With over 200 product and
service awards earned during 1998, Dell has not forgotten
its manufacturing and marketing prowess

Veteran readers may recall our obituary to DELL written in
October.  For those who missed it, "It is not often we have
to write an obituary for a great play but for those of us
still in denial, Dell may be dead.  We still think Dell is
a great company.  Great earnings, great sales, growing at
+50%, opening new markets.  We think the problems are
many."  We assumed that the shares in float, now totaling
about 980 million (that's "m", not "b"), had split so many
times, so as to dilute the stock's ability to have big
daily run-ups or even bigger earnings per share surprises.
We reasoned it now takes an additional $10 million of
earnings to create $.01 per share surprise.  Dell used to
surprise us by $.05 routinely-pretty hard now to hide $50
million quarterly from Wall Street, especially for an
earnings surprise.  In essence, Dell's ratio of daily
turnover compared to shares in float couldn't move the
price as much.  To add insult to injury, Dell really
flattened out after its last split run to $69, where it
fell back to languish in the $60-$66 range.  In early
November, DELL spiked up  to $72 in anticipation of another
earnings surprise but couldn't hold it after the
announcement.  So we dropped it despite its sound
fundamentals.  Now, Dell's back.

From their 10Q filed with the SEC December 14th, we glean
the following: During the third quarter and first nine
months of fiscal 1999, enterprise unit sales increased 112%
and 165%, respectively, compared to the third quarter and
first nine months of fiscal 1998, and increased
sequentially 13% over the second quarter of fiscal 1999.
Notebook unit sales increased 141% and 123% in the third
quarter and first nine months of fiscal 1999, compared to
the same period of the prior fiscal year, and increased
sequentially 16% over the second quarter of fiscal 1999.
Net revenue increased in all geographic regions in the
third quarter and the first nine months of fiscal 1999 as
compared to the same periods of fiscal 1998. Net revenue
for the third quarter of fiscal 1999 compared to the third
quarter of fiscal 1998 increased 46% in the Americas, 68%
in Europe and 49% in Asia-Pacific and Japan. Net revenue
for the first nine months of fiscal 1999 compared to the
first nine months of fiscal 1998 increased 48% in the
Americas,67% in Europe and 39% in Asia-Pacific and Japan.

Nowadays, this stuff barely makes the news.  We think their
price would be higher if it did.

Wednesday, Dell's volume swelled to over 27 million shares,
well above its 19 million share average, raising the price
$2.19 to an all-time closing high of $85.31.  If Dell can
break this, its next resistance is $88.13, set in Wednesday
intra-day trading.  Thursday and Friday, Dell fared much
better than the overall NASDAQ giving back only $2.31 on
lower than average volumes.  This shows investor
unwillingness to part with the stock, though we could sure
use more high volume trading days.  As evidenced by Dell's
tie for the #1 position in PCs and workstations, we can
only offer an educated guess that Dell contributed
significantly to Microsoft's stellar earnings.  What's good
for the goose is good for the gander, and we expect this to
be well-reflected in Dell's earnings too.  Heck, Gateway
impressed the market with upside surprise earnings. So will
Dell as news of Dell's success's get more notice running
into earnings, scheduled Tues., February 16, after the
close.

It is not likely you'll hear this from the Wall Street
Journal, Baron's or CNBC.  So we'll spread the word.  While
Hewlett Packard still rules the NT space, price deflation
is favoring direct seller Dell, which claimed 20% of the NT
market in the September period, nearly double its previous
share (motley Fool).  Hewlett-Packard and Dell, which had
zero market share in the beginning of 1997, are in a
virtual tie for first place in both units and revenue for
the personal workstation segment (Reuters).  That knocked
Compaq out of the number two slot, as its market share
plunged from 34% to 17% (Motley Fool). Dell will integrate
@Home's broadband Internet service experience with cable-
ready and Dell Dimension desktop PCs (PRNewswire).  Dell
will be the first major computer vendor to offer the
multiple award-winning Digital Flat Panel Solution Pack
from Number Nine Visual Technology. Thursday, they
announced ImageWatch(SM), a program that provides early
notification of technology changes to Dell corporate and
institutional customers, available at no charge.

Dip buying is warranted, but confirm upward market movement first.

Biotech  - Sector
*****************
AMGN - Amgen $114.63 (+5.75)

Founded in 1980, Amgen is a global biotechnology company that
develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics based
on advances in cellular and molecular biology.  With sales of
$2.34 billion, it is the largest of the biotech companies and
is more than twice the size of its nearest rival.  Amgen's
products include the billion-dollar blockbusters Epogen (EPO)
and Neupogen, as well as Infergen.  Epogen is used to treat
anemia in patients with kidney failure or patients undergoing
chemotherapy.  Neupogen is used to stimulate the immune system
and Infergen treats chronic hepatitis.  Many other drugs are
in the pipeline, but the most important new drug is NESP--a
next-generation drug to succeed EPO.

On December 22, 1998, Amgen won a critical court ruling over
Johnson and Johnson (JNJ), which gave AMGN exclusive rights
to NESP.  As a young, struggling company, Amgen had sold the
rights to Epogen (EPO) to JNJ, and JNJ claimed NESP, the new
successor to EPO, was just a revised version of the same
drug, and was covered under the EPO sales agreement.  EPO is
one of the top selling drugs in the world.  It's three makers,
JNJ, Roche, and Amgen sold over $3 billion of the drug last
year.  EPO must be injected three times a week and is done in
a hospital setting.  NESP is injected only once per week and
may eventually be used by the patient at home. It will almost
certainly replace EPO when the final phase of ongoing human
testing is completed, and it could give Amgen $1 billion in
annual sales.  Amgen is also working on Major new drugs for
weight loss and Parkinson's, but they are 4-5 years away. EPO
shows skeptics that Amgen really does have important drugs
in the pipeline.

*AMGN announces earnings on Jan. 27th (according to Zack's).
They last split 2:1 in 1995 near $100.  They have 750 mln
shares authorized and only 254 mln outstanding.  A split
is a definite possibility.

Amgen set an intra-day high Wednesday of $115.44, it's only
resistance. Even when the rest of the market was diving
Thursday and Friday, AMGN  was looking strong.  This stock
has been considered a possible take-over target at times in
the past, but has wanted to remain independent.  Now Amgen
has the ability to do the acquiring, if it desires.

VIA.B - Viacom Inc. $82.56 (+3.25)

Viacom Inc. is an entertainment company centered around
"fun stuff."  It owns networks like MTV, VH-1, Nickelodeon,
Nick at Nite, and Showtime.  It dabbles in Comedy Central,
United Paramount Network, and the All News Channel.  It has
stakes in book publishers, Blockbuster Video, Paramount
Pictures, movie theaters, and music/theme parks.  It even
syndicates it's popular TV show creations like the "Melrose
Place" and "Beverly Hills 90210."

Strictly a momentum play, Viacom has been in a great
long term uptrend from it's October lows.  It has graciously
provided several dips along the way for patient investors.
We would suggest the same.  However, it's latest run
is looking very strong (not a hint of trouble with last
week's market worries).  Maybe investors are jumping
in now for an early start on any earnings run (due out
in about a month).  Surprisingly, A.G. Edwards' multiple
downgrades on this stock has had no effect.  Why they
have it out for this company we don't know.  Fortunately
VIAB (or VIA.B) has been able to shrug them off without
penalty.

No earth shattering news for Viacom this past week.

UTX - United Technologies Corp. $114.56 (+4.88)(-5.00)(+5.94)

UTX makes a variety of products, from elevators to air
conditioners. Its subsidiary Carrier is the world's largest
maker of heating and air-conditioning systems.  It manufactures
and services heating, ventilating, and refrigeration equipment.
UTX's Otis is the world's #1 elevator manufacturer; it also
makes and services escalators, moving sidewalks, and shuttle
systems.  Its subsidiary Hamilton Standard produces engine
controls, environmental systems, propellers, and other flight
systems. Another subsidiary Pratt & Whitney makes engines for
both commercial and military aircraft.  The company's Sikorsky
unit makes helicopters

In the news last week, UTX reported earnings of $1.16 per share
which beat the estimates of $1.11 per share.  This represented
an 18% increase above the same quarter a year ago.  Strong
showings in its aircraft and refrigeration businesses were
factors in the increase.  What probably helped the stock more
than the earnings announcement was UTX saying that it has hired
Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives for its
automotive components business.  The automotive components
business is consolidating, operating profits are falling and
revenues are flat.  The Street liked that announcement.

UTX set a new 52 week high on Thursday, and then traded off in
some profit taking.  After the close on Friday, UTX was
downgraded from a buy to a hold by CIBC Oppenheimer.  We don't
know how this will affect UTX on Monday, but we would wait and
see before initiating any new trades.  Also, you need to
remember when trading UTX that it is a Dow 30 component and is
very Dow sensitive.  UTX has two things going for it next week.
One, UTX did not trade down after its earnings announcement
like a lot of stocks have recently.  Two, the Street likes the
fact that it is attempting to sell its underperforming
automotive unit.

DH - Dayton Hudson $59.94 (+3.00)(P3W +4.87)

Dayton Hudson is the parent company of Target Stores, which
accounts for approximately 75% of the company's sales.
Target is the #3 large-format, discount department store
behind K-Mart and Wal-Mart, #2 and #1, respectively, and
the focus of Dayton Hudson's expansion.  Target (pronounced
"Tar-zhay" in some circles) differentiates itself by
offering more upscale merchandise than either K-Mart or
Wal-Mart, but with prices similar to the K-Mart/Wal-mart
genre.  Dayton Hudson also operates Mervyn's California and
Marshall Field's.  All told, Dayton Hudson operates over
1100 stores under the 3 formats, generating almost $28
billion in 1998 sales.

Dayton Hudson's chart reminds us a bit of Maytag with a few
more gyrations.  The chart, with the exception of the mid-
December negative spike and recovery, shows a great
trajectory.  Technicals including MACD, momentum,
stochastics and RSI are all in positive territory.  Last
week, DH showed lots of strength by rising $3 to $59.94, a
new closing high in the overall market downdraft.  That it
held at this level on heavy volume shows strong buying
activity and new support.  Its only resistance is $61.50
reached in inter-day trading.  DH is not a fast mover, but
is a steady performer and a safer play for the less risk
inclined among us.  1189 institutions own 89.5% of the 395
million shares in float leaving about 40 million shares in
daily float; very little percentage-wise for the small
investor.  Earlier in the month, DH announced plans to buy 
back $1 billion of its stock, or about 16.8 million shares
at its current price; should make great action when the
volume picks up.  In Thursday trading, a block of 500,800
shares crossed at $58.75-more support.  Market permitting,
this could be a nice long ride.

Of note, Target "unveiled an exclusive collection of
products for the home designed by highly acclaimed
architect Michael Graves.  Products include clocks,
utensils, small appliances, picture frames, lawn and garden
furniture and much more," according to a PRNewswire
release.  On July 25, Target also plans to open 24 new
stores including its first stores in New England, which
will bring its total to 884 stores.  15 others will open on
March 7.  Total store openings for 1999 should exceed 70.
December 1998 sales increased 11.7% over the previous year,
with 6.5% same store gains over the same period.  We like
this kind of new as it makes the future look pretty good

PUTS, PUTS, PUTS

Put plays can be very profitable but have a larger risk than
call plays. When a stock is falling the entire investment
community (except the shorts) is hoping it will reverse and
start back up. The company management is also doing everything
they can to shore up their stock price. The company issues
press releases, brokers talk it up, analysts try to put a
positive spin on everything. Then of course there is the death
knell, the "buy recommendation" simply because the price has
dropped to some level that analysts feel attractive again.
Buyers who like the stock wait until it appears a bottom has
been reached and then jump on it in a feeding frenzy. They may
already have a large position and are averaging down. Many
factors can stop a free falling stock in mid drop.

Downward trending gross profit margin is due primarily to the

its core businesses to better serve the needs of customers
and suppliers.  Recent news of a "significant" slump in
December sales of core products in its electronics and
computer marketing groups will result in fiscal Q2 EPS of

Play Description:
Becton Dickinson and Co. shares tumbled 8 percent Friday after
two brokerages concerned about the medical equipment
company's growth rate downgraded the stock. The maker of
medical supplies, devices and diagnostic systems (BDX) saw
shares fall 3 1/16 to 33 3/4 after analyst Ann Barber of Credit
Suisse First Boston cited disappointing first-quarter sales.
Becton Dickinson said Thursday sales rose 10 percent,
shy of Barber's 13 percent projection. Barber, who cut her
rating on the stock to "hold" from "buy," also pointed to a

I spoke with Stacey Carey today after the ISDA call.  I reiterated that we 
have been willing to support the process so far on the understanding that we 
would prefer a bill that gives us parity with financial products and, failing 
that, the minimum we can accept is a bill which exempts (preferably excludes) 
energy commodities and hopefully metals from the Act.   She confirmed that 
ISDA will continue to push for the exemption or exclusion.

The comments from Treasury to Chris Long recently underscore that our "Phil 
Graham card", to the extent we have one, is a significant political strength 
for us and we should not play the card until we need to.  Stacey agreed with 
a statement made by Don Moorehead on this morning's call that Graham will not 
start to move in the process until the House has produced a viable bill.  
Given that we should probably not seek his help until a bit later in the 
process - possibly mid September.

Do you think that a bill favorable to energy will be passed over the strong 
opposition of the CFTC?  What kind of odds do you put on it?  It is a 
significant change if Treasury is not longer against us -- but it is a little 
hard for me to believe that it is real.  Should I try to make a trip to 
Washington in September?  Let me know.

Hi Brent, I have been in contact with Dale Neuner regarding the creation of 
the Product Types for Argentina, by now he has all the necessary information. 
We will need your approval on the wording that was suggested for the long 
description and other legal sign-off. I have already gone through the product 
descriptions with Andrea and no mayor comments came up. Regarding Natural Gas 
products, her comments were that we are creating a Firm product with TOP 
100%, but that is OK. Then on the additional information like delivery 
points, term, currency and unit of measure, all those alternatives have been 
given to Dale for him to load into the system.
Please give me an update on your timetable for these issues.
Regards

Patrick

Thanks for your note and glad to hear you're feeling better.  Yes we are all 
very sad about Jim's baby.  Many years ago my sister had a child who was born 
two or three months early and lived for several days - long enough to be held 
and loved - but his lungs were apparently just not developed enough and they 
couldn't save him.   I know how painful that was for them.   And I have to 
admit that experience made me very anxious when things didn't go perfectly 
for you guys that first few days. 

I received papers from Julia regarding your options a week or so ago which I 
didn't send along because the next day Julia said HR had made a mistake in 
everybody's package and HR was sending replacement documents - I haven't 
received the replacements yet but will ask.

Stephanie has started and seems to be fitting in as far as I can tell at this 
stage.  We're all super busy but more or less keeping up with the critical 
stuff.  We'll look forward to seeing you soon.

Any progress on the EnronOnline front?  I'm getting questions from the EOL

this is probably adequate.  If you have a little more time, I can polish it

Campbell Soup Company (CPB) - $44.31 .25 (-.81)

Campbell Soup Company is a global manufacturer and marketer of
branded convenience food products operating in three business
segments: Soup and Sauces, Biscuits and Confectionery, and
Foodservice. Campbell Soup Company is the world's largest
maker and marketer of soup with fiscal 1998 sales of $6.7
billion.

Warm weather, flat sales, inefficient supply chain, and
company's ability to achieve costs savings and capacity
utilization are being called into question by analysts.
Increased marketing and selling expenses, increased store
level inventory levels, encroachment from private label (store
brand) products, reduced consumption levels and a recent
announce of new cost-cutting initiatives will cause fiscal
1999 earnings to fall short of analysts' estimates by 18 to
23 cents per share.  Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.,
which tracks such estimates, had expected the company to earn
$2.13 a share during the year, which ends July 31. Campbell
earned $1.90 a share in the prior year. Campbell Soup Co.
said it now expects U.S. soup consumption to rise by only 1
to 2 percent in the second quarter from the previous year,
not 4 to 5 percent.

Stock recently failed at $59 and then broke key support at
$54.00 on news of earnings shortfall. Excessive call buying
recently is bearish and may provide continued overhead
resistance.

Play: Earnings Warnings

Update:
Stock recovered some last week but still trading below gap
price of $45.  Could sell off more if broad market comes
under pressure.

DuPont de Nemours (DD) - $54.31 .25 (-2.69)

E.I. DuPont de Nemours and Company operates in fiveprincipal
industry segments: Chemicals, Fibers, Polymers,Life
Sciences, and Diversified Businesses.  For the 9 monthsended
9/30/98, total revenues rose 1% to $19.29B.  Netincome from
continuing operations before extraordinary itemand
applicable to Common fell 37% to $859M.  Revenuesbenefited
from acquisitions. Earnings were offset by a$651M
increase in purchased in-process R&D charges.

Pricing pressures from overcapacity continue to weigh on the
chemical group.  Street has been busy cutting the group's
earnings estimates for the next couple of quarters, as
troubled economies in Asia and Latin America suggest that
demand/pricing conditions won't improve any time soon.
Commodity chemicals such as ethylene hardest hit, with prices
falling by as much as 50% over past year.  Stocks have seen
some buying interest in recent weeks on hopes that lower
interest rates will jumpstart sagging global economy.  But
gains appear more a function of underlying market strength and
light bargain hunting than any sea change in expectations for
a sustained earnings recovery.  Chemical companies are
cutting jobs and reducing production to adjust to challenging
conditions.  Comparison periods will also become more
attractive by mid-CY99. However, until that time there is no
reason to suspect the group to do anything but underperform
the market.  Given existing oversupply, declining earnings
growth, slowing worldwide economic growth and the market's
preference for momentum over turnaround situations, DD could
be under pressure over the near-term.  After advancing $7
over the past couple of weeks, DuPont signaled a failed rally
at its declining 200-day moving average.  Target - $53.

Play: Failed Rally

Stock moved up fractionally during Friday's (1/22) broad sell

protective sell stop to $58.25.

Hershey Foods (HSY) - $59.00 1.00 (-2.25)

ershey Foods (HSY) manufactures, distributes, and sells a
broad line of chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery,
pasta and grocery products.  For the nine months ended
10/4/98, net sales rose 4% to $3.2 billion.  Net income rose
5% to $230.9 million.  Revenues reflect higher sales of core
confectionery brands and incremental sales from the
introduction of new confectionery products.  Earnings also
reflect reduced marketing costs for existing brands and lower
selling costs in foreign markets.

Play Description:
Stock continues to struggle following analyst downgrades and
Q4 weakness. Margins are likely to be under pressure with
increased costs. Stock simply seems to be out of favor and
relative strength is declining. Likely to test lows at $48.

Play: Failed Rally

Perkin-Elmer Corporation (PKN) - $91.31  -2.88 (-4.06)

Perkin-Elmer Corporation (PKN) develops, manufactures and
markets life science systems and analytical instruments for
the pharmaceutical, biotech, environmental, agricultural,
forensics and chemical industries. For the three months ended
9/98, revenues rose 16% to $375.8 billion. Net income fell
21% to $17 million. Revenues reflect higher sales of biotech
products in the U.S. and Europe. Earnings suffered from
higher R&D, merger charges, decreased interest income, a $3.1
million loss at Tecan and a higher tax rate.

PKN operates internationally, with manufacturing and
distribution facilities in various countries throughout the
world and derives approximately 53% of its revenues from
countries outside of the United States. Results continue to
be affected by market risk, including fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates and changes in economic conditions in

the Company's capital structure to help move Perkin-Elmer

information. They are currently evaluating strategic
alternatives for our analytical instruments business.

Warner Lambert (WLA) - $67.94 .94 (-1.88)

Warner Lambert is a manufacturer of ethical pharmaceuticals,
biologicals, capsules, consumer health care products and
confectionary products.

Shares of large U.S. drug companies are being hurt by profit
taking and concerns about proposed changes to the Medicare
payment system.  Recently, a Bipartisan Commission opened the
door for Medicare to cover prescription drugs for
beneficiaries, a recommendation that if adopted, could put
pressure on drug companies.  Recent inquiries regarding the
safety of Rezulin received nationally televised attention and
may give rise to  investor concern.   Also, it may be
difficult to sustain the growth rates for Lipitor, Rezulin
and Neurontin products that WLA has enjoyed this past year.

Top side consolidation since July may be difficult to overcome
in extended market conditions.  Given that the drug sector
has and will continue to be a strong performing sector, we
recommend a modest sell-off price targets of $55 to 60.

Play: Failed Rally

Update:
Top side consolidation since July may be difficult to overcome
in extended market conditions.  Still trading below key 100

COMBO PLAYS
***********
U.S. blue chips stocks fell sharply Friday as worries about the
Brazilian currency crisis and poor revenues at the world's biggest
computer maker drove traders to an aggressive sell-off. The DJIA
closed 143 points lower and has shed all of its gains for the year.
Concerns that Latin America's economic instability and Brazil's
currency devaluation could hurt other countries sent investors out
of stocks and into bonds, seeking safety in U.S. government assets.
To make matters worse, IBM's earnings were good, not spectacular,
and revenues were disappointing due to poor hardware sales. IBM
also failed to announce a generally expected stock split, making
investors even more unhappy. Analysts are saying the main problem
with our current market is that optimistic investors are expecting
earnings to come in better than what they're actually going to be
and this will probably cause a near-term market downturn. We shall
soon find out!

Our new spread positions were all available near the recommended
entry points. CTXS was the first candidate, and although the stock
price continued to slide, the play (MAR90C/FEB95C) was still
favorable at an initial debit of $4.87. RDRT was also lower at the
open and the debit for the MAR17C/FEB20C bullish diagonal spread
was $1.75. LVLT was a bull-call position with a conservative bias
and the price for the MAR37C/MAR45C spread was $4.62. SEPR is our
new long-term play and the volatile trading offered a couple of
opportunities to enter the position, (JAN00-100/FEB100C) at $19.25.

Other activities included a closing play on CIEN as the stock price
gapped-up $4 amid speculation it may again be a possible takeover
target and rumors it may land a large contract. PCS continues to
move higher in the "hot" telecom sector and we are monitoring the
positions closely. They are now both deeply ITM and there is always
the chance of early exercise. Good Luck!

The calendar (or time spread) is profitable if the value of the
position exceeds the initial debit (or cost-basis) at the end of
the expiration period for the long position. However, because we
track the plays based on the current closing cost/value, the gains
for time spreads will rarely be reflected until the play closes.
Each month, as we sell a new call against the long position, the
net cost should decline or the position value should increase.

A debit-spread is profitable if the value of the position exceeds
the initial cost of the spread when the play is closed. However,
because we track plays based on the current cost/value, potential
gains may not be reflected until both positions are closed.

NEW PLAYS
*********
MRK - Merck Company Inc.  $139.00     *** Earnings Slam ***

Merck is the #1 drugmaker in the US and is tied for first in the
world with Glaxo Wellcome in prescription drugs. They develop
products for both humans and animals; almost two-fifths of its
sales come from treating ailments associated with American eating
habits, (high cholesterol, hypertension, and heart failure). In
addition, Merck has the top-selling US drugs for hypertension
as well as newer, promising drugs for AIDS treatment, male balding
and migraine headaches. Also under development is a new arthritis
drug.

The drug developer fell $7.31 on Friday after it said it will stop
testing its MK-869 drug for use as an antidepressant. The company
hoped to develop the drug, which it will still test as a treatment
for nausea in cancer patients, as a hedge against the impending
loss of 4 major patents in 2001. The split run (2/16/98, 2-1) may
have some effect but the SOR date is Monday (after the close) and
we see this one falling short of the sold strike in mid-February.

EMC - EMC Corp.  $98.50     *** Technical/Disparity Play ***

EMC Corp. and its subsidiaries design, manufacture, market and
support a wide range of storage-related hardware, software and
service products for the open systems, mainframe and network
attached information storage and retrieval system market. The
company is the #1 maker of many of these components. EMC markets
its memory products under the name Symmetrix. Other products let
users manage remote data and share information across networks of
different computers. EMC continues to broaden its product line,
strengthen alliances, and expand its global presence to create
more platform-independent systems.

We just like the chart and the small disparity for a (relatively)
free-money play.

SKYT - Skytel  $26.38     *** Telecom ***

SkyTel Communications (formerly Mobile Telecom Tech.) is one of
the leading providers of worldwide wireless messaging services,
marketing primarily to business users. The company offers a wide
range of messaging services to its users. Subsidiary SkyTel Corp.
provides paging and messaging services including pagers, two-way
alphanumeric text messaging and two-way interactive messaging.
SkyTel also provides messaging services in in Central and South
America through its Mtel Latin America subsidiary. SKYT recently
added more specialized content to its information services with
the addition of Asian market updates, real-time stock quotes,
sports scores, company news, ski reports and horoscopes. Coverage
was initiated early this month by ABN AMRO with an "Outperform"
rating and we like the long-term outlook for the chart.

PLAY (conservative/long-term play):

BUY  CALL JUN-25 MMQ-FE OI=249  A=$4.75
SELL CALL FEB-25 MMQ-BE OI=3012 B=$2.38
NET DEBIT TARGET=$2.25 TARGET ROI=60%

SELL CALL FEB-25.00 MMQ-BE OI=3012 B=$2.38
NET DEBIT TARGET=$1.87 ROI(max)=33%

Note: In the long-term calendar spread, we are reducing the net
cost of the long option by the amount of credit from the sale of
the nearer-term option. If the near-term call expires worthless,
we will sell the MAR call to further reduce our debit. If your
short-term position is ITM on the last day of the strike, you
need to buy it back so that you DON'T have to exercise the long
term position. In that case, your long position is going up in
value also and on the last day of the strike period, the short
call will shrink down to intrinsic value so you should be ahead
in the play even after you buy it back.

PLCM - Polycom  $26.75     *** Telecom ***

Polycom makes long-distance teleconferencing products for use on
regular telephone networks. The ShowStation data-conferencing
system enables people in different locations to view and edit
documents on a simultaneous, interactive basis. Its SoundStation
audio-conferencing system, provides two-way voice communication
without typical speakerphone distortion. Subsidiary ViaVideo
Communications offers ViewStation, a Web-based videoconferencing
system that features a voice-tracking camera. Reported awesome
earnings last week, net revenues grew 140% for the year to over
$100 million. Technically, an outstanding chart with some recent
support around $21 but it may need to consolidate before moving
higher. That will be just the thing we need to benefit from this
time spread.

NRC - NAC RE Corp  $48.56     *** Technical Time Spread ***

NAC Re is a holding company whose subsidiaries offer property and
casualty reinsurance. Subsidiaries NAC Reinsurance, Greenwich
Insurance Company, Indian Harbor Company, and NAC Re International
Holdings provide both treaty reinsurance for categories of risk
and facultative individual risk reinsurance to primary insurers of
casualty risk. Most U.S. commercial property-casualty insurers,
battered by an unrelenting price war and increases in catastrophe
losses, were expected to post flat to lower earnings in the fourth
quarter. This may also be the case for NRC but we think the stock
price will hold near the current range for the next few weeks.
Technically, NRC is making feeble attempts to break-out of it's
stage III top but with little volume support. Its 150 dma is the
current resistance (around $49) with support around $45. It will
take some work to exit the current sideways trend and that's just
what we need to make this play profitable.

PLAY (conservative):

BUY  CALL MAR-50 NRC-CJ OI=160 A=$4.87

NET DEBIT TARGET=$1.00 TARGET ROI=50%

CNTO - Centocor  $39.93     *** Butterfly Spread ***

Centocor makes therapeutic, diagnostic drugs for cardiovascular
problems, cancer and other diseases. Three of their products are
approved for sale in the US: ReoPro prevents blood clots during
angioplasty, Remicade treats the bowel disorder Crohn's disease
(and is being tested for efficacy against rheumatoid arthritis),
and Panorex treats cancer. ReoPro is sold in the US and Europe by
Eli Lilly. Centocor's drug Avakine is in the final US testing
stages for treatment of Crohn's disease. The company owns the US
and Canadian marketing rights for Retavase, a cardiovascular drug
developed by Roche Holding. Centocor is also selling its oncology
diagnostics business to focus on therapeutics.

Recently, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter cut its rating on the firm
to "outperform" from "strong buy" and adjusted its 12-month price
target to $51 per share from $62 per share. We think that's a bit
optimistic as CNTO has been trading around $35 to $45 for almost
two years and has a very long term base with no immediate signs of
a significant character or trend change. The volatility of the
holiday bull-run seems to have dissipated and the sideways trend
is now resuming. We are going to start this play as a "butterfly"
but plan to roll-out of each spread as the stock price moves about
the $40 range.

PLAY (conservative/long-term):

BUY  CALL  APRIL-35 COQ-DG OI=364  A=$7.50
SELL CALLS APRIL-40 COQ-DH OI=507  B=$4.38
BUY  CALL  APRIL-45 COQ-DI OI=1227 A=$2.68
NET DEBIT TARGET=$1.00 TARGET ROI=50%

The butterfly spread is generally a neutral position that is
a combination of both a BULL spread and a BEAR spread. This
spread is designed primarily for the stock that will not
experience much of a net rise or decline by expiration. It
generally requires only a small investment and has a limited
risk but profits are limited as well. It can also be costly
in terms of commissions so you should consider playing these
combination strategies with a low cost (discount) broker.

There are three strike prices involved in a butterfly spread.
With calls, (and it can also be done with puts) the butterfly
spread consists of buying one call at the lowest strike price,
selling two calls at the middle strike price and buying one
call at the highest strike price. Next week, we will run the
complete strategy narrative again to help the beginning traders
with the technique.

INDEX OPTION SPREADS
********************
As a trader, you may be familiar with options on individual stocks
where you have the right to buy (call option) or the right to sell
(put option) a particular stock at some predetermined price within
some predetermined time. The buyer has the rights and the seller
the obligations. With index options the basic ideas are the same.
Index options allow you to make investment decisions on a specific
market industry or on the market as a whole. Spread strategies can
be made with index options similar to those made with individual
stock options. Many professional traders employ index spreads as a
hedge strategy. We favor debit positions on the SPX for momentum
and longer-term plays and OTM credit spreads on the OEX when the
risk/reward is favorable. Low ROI disparity spreads will be listed
(when available) for the conservative index trader.

OEX - S&P 100 Index  $610.38     OTM Credit-Spreads

The Standard & Poor's 100 Index is a capitalization-weighted index
of 100 stocks from a broad range of industries. The component
stocks are weighted according to the total market value of their
outstanding shares. The impact of a component's price change is
proportional to the issue's total market value, which is the share
price times the number of shares outstanding.

OBSERVATIONS:

For OTM credit spread trades, we like to use the actively-traded
S&P 100 Index options because they contain much more premium than
options on individual stocks and provide an underlying instrument
less prone to huge, gapping moves. Remember however, that you can
always be exercised early so monitor your positions daily.

TECHNICALS:

While the overall market seems likely to remain in a wide trading
range over the next few weeks, the probabilities are quite strong
that we have reached a short-term top and the current outlook is
somewhat unfavorable. The DOW has found some support just above a
key level around 9085 and a close below that number confirmed by
a S&P 500 close below 1205 would signal a more serious correction.
The long-term pattern is in a neutral but weakening condition with
the NYSE survey starting to slip and the NYSE momentum index at
its worst level in years. Review the Pinnacle Hedge-Section for
more specific technical information on the S&P 100 Index.

Mark: 

Implementation of the EOL project in Brazil had been postponed for a while 
because of regulatory matters. The Market Rules were still being discussed 
and had not been approved by ANEEL, making it impossible for us to implement 
EOL, from a regulatory standpoint. Recently (about a couple of weeks ago), 
ANEEL issued Resolution 290/00, approving the Market Rules, subject to 
certain amendments. The amendments will be implemented in stages over the 
course of the next few years. After Resolution 290 was issued and the 
regulatory issues were partially resolved, the EOL team decided to work on 
the project again. I am now in the course of adapting the ETA, GTC and 
Password Application for use in Brazil. I will probably have drafts for 
comments within the next 10 days. I am not sure about the time estimate for 
completion of the project as a whole. I believe Remi can give you a better 
idea of the schedule.

I will forward to you in a separate e-mail the legal opinion that we received 
from outside counsel, addressing the issues in the memo prepared by your 
team. Also, I take the opportunity to let you know that I am leaving Enron by 
the end of August. From September on, the contact people for the EOL project 
will be Remi and Ricardo on the commercial side, and Sami Arap on the legal. 
In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I can be of any further 
assistance.

Any progress on the EnronOnline front?  I'm getting questions from the EOL

COVERED CALL SECTION FOR JANUARY 24, 1999
******************************************************************
The Lesson Begins..

This week, we are going to begin a new educational series on basic
covered-call techniques. The first step is to explain our current
approach and the appropriate method for using this much maligned
strategy.

The objective of covered writing for most investors is increased
income though stock ownership. By definition, the ideal covered
call offers reduced risk and a good probability of making a profit.
In fact, our primary goal is to provide the subscriber with plays
that produce acceptable returns while still receiving an above
average amount of protection.

A mathematical basis...

The main factor that we focus on is called "return unchanged".
This is the return on investment that one would achieve if the
stock price were unchanged at option expiration. One can compare
potential plays more accurately using this approach since no
assumption is made about stock price movement. This method ignores
the relative price of the sold strike (ITM - OTM) and focuses
completely on the overall position.

A very simple concept...

With this conservative option writing strategy in mind, we look
for plays that return a minimum of 3%-5% per month and retain
downside protection of at least 10% (of the current stock price).
The overall position that is constructed using these guidelines
will be a relatively low risk play (regardless of the volatility
of the underlying stock) since the levels of protection will be
large and there is still the expectation of a reasonable return.

Other things to consider...

The amount of downside protection and the return on investment are
both very important considerations in determining which play to
choose but the technical and fundamental outlook of the underlying
stock must also be favorable.

The reason for ITM plays...

A minimally acceptable return is somewhat a matter of personal
preference but with the current market volatility, it would appear
that the advantages of the in-the-money position, (more consistent
profits and reduced risk) is more attractive to the majority of
our investors.

Next week, we'll discuss more covered-call strategies. Good Luck!

We suggest you consider closing the MWY position. Last week, the
stock price fell below technical support after the company said
its revenues and earnings in the second half of its fiscal year
will be below last year's results. The company was downgraded by
Hambrecht & Quist and Piper Jaffray to a "hold".

flat but revenues increased over 20% for the 8th straight quarter.
Our cost basis is below support and buying pressure has increased
over the last three trading days.

settled (undisclosed) with ex-director. Friday, INVX declared an
increase in its regular quarterly dividend to $.04 per share,
payable 2/24/99, to SOR as of 2/10. Stock has strong support at

Read-Rite Corporation designs, manufactures, and markets magnetic
recording heads for rigid disk drives. The tape always tells the
tale:  RDRT posted $0.02 profit (analyst predicted $0.17 loss) on
Wed. The key will be if the cost cutting and increased production
will work next quarter as current revenues did fall. Technically,
a very bullish chart with resistance around $25.

earnings due Jan 27. Recently upgraded/coverage initiated, as
RNWK announced alliances with AtHome and Enron Network.

Question: At what price would you mind owning RNWK? We think
$42.25 isn't that bad, right there at support, and just before
earnings (post earnings dip?). If we don't get it, a 6.5% ROI for
trying seems like just compensation.

focused on cardiorenal disorders and Alzheimer's disease.
Lilly and SCIO agreed to continue their alliance on Alzheimer
research. Excellent cost basis with room to climb as resistance

NAKED PUT SECTION FOR JANUARY 24, 1999
******************************************************************
Recently, we have had many questions about the margin requirements
for various option strategies. These new-subscriber requests also
contain questions about the necessary trading levels, margin, ROI
and collateral calculations for naked puts. We will try to cover
those subjects in the next few weeks. We start with definitions:

Writing a naked put...

A put writer assumes the obligation to buy the underlying security
at a specific price for a premium. There are two reasons for this
commitment; an investor unwilling to purchase stock at the current
price might write put options, hoping to take a position, (acquire
the stock) at a lower price. Another successful outcome is to just
receive the "premium" income if the stock remains above the sold
strike price. If the stock price finishes below the sold strike,
the seller (or writer) of the put option is obligated to purchase
the underlying stock (100 shares/contract) at the exercise price.
When this occurs, the cost of the stock (or the break-even) will
be the exercise price less the premium. When the sold strike price
goes "in-the-money", an investor must be ready to buy the stock at
any time because option contracts can be exercised early. The put
seller may also close the position by simply "buying-back" the
sold (short) put option.

The cost basis is simply the strike price minus premium received.
We list the cost basis of each play reference "owning the stock";
if it is PUT to you...

The collateral (or equity) required to sell a naked put varies for
different brokers. One of the most common formulas used by online
brokerages (Etrade for example) is:

The greater of :

40% of the current price of the stock plus the premium received,
minus the difference between the cost of the stock and the strike
price;

-or-

20% of the current price of the stock plus the premium received.

As you go deeper out of the money (OTM) the 20% requirement will
take precedence.

ROI is simply the premium received divided by the collateral (or
equity) required to open the position...

Example:
XYZ = 20.00, strike = 10.00, premium = 0.25
40% rule = 0.4*20 + 0.25 - ( 20-10) = -1.75
20% rule = 0.2*20 + 0.25 = 4.25
ROI = 0.25/4.25 =  5.88%

Next week, we will discuss the requirements for trading naked puts.

Good Luck!

If we can find an attorney in Houston, I would be all for moving forward with 
it.  The truth is that a 2 day delay will not ruin the relationship.  Since I 
am on vacation today and tomorrow, I would ask George to investigate Houston 
lawyers.  George I think we use Mark Taylor but please confirm this with

Thanks.

George and I agree that we should not consider signing the LOI now, but 
should sign the CA so that we can share information and hold further 
discussions to jointly develop the nature of the relationship.  In the LOI 
sent, they are making declarations that we have not fully flushed out, 
therefore, we are not prepared to sign that.

Hope that helps.

Thanks.

Before I get legal and PR to look at this could you give me a bit more 
background on the potential arrangement with NextSet. I dont understand where 
the need for training will come in. 

I know that generally Enron has a policy of not being seen to endorse a 
client's products. PR may therefore have a problem with giving NextSet the 
ability to put our logo on their site. How important is this likely to be ?

Gillian and George,

Thanks again for stopping by this morning.  Per our conversation, I am
attaching a mutual NDA and a standard LOI.  With the former in place, we
should both be able to get a little deeper into the technology to see if
there is a strong fit between our respective companies.  I would be very
interested to introduce our CTO with your technology counterpart the next
time he is in town.  Feel free to schedule that meeting through me.  All the
best.

Thanks for dealing with Tana on these issues.  It is not entirely clear to me 
what you want the policy to be regarding which counterparties have access to 
Australian power products.  You probably already know that the EnronOnline 
people want every counterparty everywhere in the world to have access to 
every product unless Credit or Legal can justify restricting their access.  
Credit already performs a financial test on each counterparty to determine if 
they meet the CFTC Eligible Swap Participant requirements.  Unfortunately, 
that test is not as restrictive as the Australian tangible assets test.  It 
sounds like there should be a US$6 million tangible assets test applied by 
Credit before we give any counterparty access to Australian Power (this would 
be a total pain but certainly possible).  On the other hand, if you feel 
comfortable giving access to non-Australian counterparties  without that test 
being performed, we can do that, too.  Pleas let me know if we should ask 
Credit to start performing this test on all counterparties or if it should be 
limited to Australian entities.

Congratulations!  We'll have to chat soon.

Mark:  (1)  Did you consider my voice mail about updating authorized trader 
lists and resolutions (by Samantha or Tana)?

(2)  Have you thought about electronic notice provisions?  Shouldn't 
default/termination notices be in writing to the appropriate counsel/Corp. 
secretary?  And, can we agree to "electronic notices" at all?  There is no 
electronic address for a Documentation Desk or Assistant General Counsel.  I 
am seeing this type of provision in electronic trading agreements.

Thanks.  Sara

The revised draft looks good to me.

I haven't seen any of the press reports (even though I am in London and I 
hear that's where they were) but I thought this was a well drafted response.  
The only additional rumours I have heard indicate that the police may have 
been rough in their handling of demonstrators outside the fence at the plant 
construction site.  I remember hearing that there were times that the 
construction workers feared for their lives because of the vehemence of the 
protesters.  I guess that didn't make it into the Human Rights Watch (ever 
heard of them?) report.

Mark
Over the next few days, you may see some press coverage of a report that was 
issued by the Human Rights Watch which alleges human rights abuses in 
relation to the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) project in India. As you know, 
Enron is a 50 percent owner of the Dabhol project, which should be 
operational next month.

We want each of you to know that this report is entirely without basis.  We 
are very disappointed that Human Rights Watch has chosen to listen to the 
perspectives of the people who have opposed the project since the beginning. 
As you are probably aware, project opponents filed more than 20 lawsuits 
against the project in the Indian courts over the past four years.  Every 
lawsuit was dismissed, withdrawn or ruled in DPC's favor.  The project is 
clearly above reproach.

Enron was advised of the Human Rights report just a few days before it was 
issued.  The Dabhol Power Company, the Government of Maharashtra and our many 
supporters were never even contacted.

DPC has worked hard to promote positive relations within the community.  A 
handful of people who oppose the project were interviewed for this report in 
great detail.  Unfortunately, the good relationships we have built with a 
large percentage of the community were not reflected.  Our community efforts 
have included building a school and a hospital, planting thousands of trees 
at the site, building wells for drinking water and conducting numerous job 
training programs for area residents. Last year, Enron made a $500,000 grant 
to CARE to be used for programs in the state of Maharashtra.

Our media statement on the issue is as follows:

Dabhol Power Company does not tolerate human rights abuses by its employees 
or contractors.  And, while we respect the work of Human Rights Watch and its 
mission, this report is out of context at best and dredges up allegations 
that have been put to rest over the past four years.  Much of the report 
deals with concerns over state police actions, over which we have no control, 
and it is misleading by Human Rights Watch to allege so.

Please refer any media inquiries to the Enron International public relations 
office at 713-646-6416.

Congratulations Jeff!  And great pictures - big brother looks a bit happier 
than the last time I saw him.

Mark

We should probably start thinking about an agenda for this meeting if only so

Hey guys - welcome home!  At least I assume you're home by now.  How was the 
trip?  I heard a bit about the departure but with any luck it must have 
gotten better.  Any hope you took digital pictures?

I have already told Linda but I wanted you both to know how great I thought 
your wedding was.  There is no doubt in my mind that it was the most special, 
beautiful, fun wedding I've ever been to.  Magical doesn't seem like too 
strong a word.  Thank you very much for letting me be part of it.  It's been 
about 30 years since I had been to that part of the world - it's easy to see 
why you enjoy it so much.  

I was serious about sailing in the Caribbean at Thanksgiving.  If you are 
still interested, we really need to start planning right away.  I tentatively 
booked a boat but the real difficulty may be in finding flights - it is a 
busy travel season.  Just let me know.

Mark

This was one of your competitors - at least from the legal side - that we 
looked at briefly about a year ago.

http://www.legalanywhere.com/legal/index.html

Glad to hear the rest of your trip went well.  

The 'normal' sailing trip is a week but that's not cast in stone.  In an 
effort to maximize days sailing and minimize days of vacation taken we 
usually fly down on a Saturday arriving in the afternoon or eve., pick up the 
boat on Sunday (you get the boat around noon) and bring it back the following 
Sunday (by noon), take a shower and head straight for the airport.  Because 
of the way the flight schedules work it's usually not possible to leave after 
work on a Friday and make it all of the way down there.  You could do a 
shorter trip, of course, but I never have.  I've gone for longer (we did a 10 
day one-way sail from St. Lucia down to the southern end of Grenada, stopping 
in Bequia and Mustique, among others, along the way) but that's a pretty long 
trip and certainly not necessary.  Most of the charter fleets are based where 
there is plenty to do right in the area for a week.  One of the reasons for 
aiming at Thanksgiving was to reduce the total number of vacation days 
spent.  I get both Thurs & Fri off so I only have to spend 3 days to get a 
whole week - I understand the gov't may not be so generous.  I haven't taken 
all of my days this year so I can always carry some over to 2001 if that 
works better for you guys.

My views on when to go:

January - March 
Very fun since you will be sick of winter, very popular so a lot more crowded 
(harder to find a place to anchor for the night and have to make arrangements 
farther ahead), everything is open for business, high season rates.

April - May
Less crowded (unless Easter or Spring breaks are late), shoulder season rates.

June - August
No crowds (you may have some anchorages to yourself), many places are closed 
for the season (think beach bars and meals on shore), low rates.

September - October
See June-August and add in highest risk of hurricanes 
(http://www.storm2000.com).  My guess is that people who planned their trips 
to the BVI for this week aren't having much fun right now but they got  GREAT 
deals and the Moorings will probably give them a refund.  I've chartered 
during this period several times and had a blast.  One time a tropical storm 
came through and we stayed on the boat in port - I still get mileage out of 
the stories.  You just have to be willing to live with the risk that it may 
not go according to plan (not seriously dangerous, though - you're always 
within easy reach of the base - if a bad one threatens you just take the boat 
back and let them deal with it).

November - December
Hurricane threat drops dramatically.  Crowds pick up around Christmas, 
everything opens up again, rates start to go up again.

Bottom line:  I love the trips so much it doesn't matter what time of year - 
just let me know what works best for you guys.  Keep in mind that you do have 
to make arrangements at least 2 months in advance (more is better) to make 
sure you get flights and the boat that you want.

One last thought - it is possible for the main group to pick up the boat on 
schedule and arrange to be near the airport on a later day in the trip to 
pick someone up.  This is definitely suboptimal.  You learn a lot about the 
boat and the sailing area from the briefings the charter company gives you at 
the start and it limits flexibility to have to be by the airport on a certain 
day when you might rather have the boat at the other end of the island chain 
or wherever.  I'd rather put the whole thing off until we can all go at once 
but if it's the only way, at least it's an option.

I think there should be a Master Swap Agreement in place between ECT and EI.  
I suggest you check in Lotus Notes but I'm pretty sure Lisa did one about a 
year ago.

Hi Heather,
There is no umbrella agreement between EI and ECT at present. We will need 
(i) an ISDA Master Agreement  and (ii) depending on the risk assessment of 
the transaction by ECT's Credit Group and the benefit allocation of such 
transaction, a risk allocation/assumption agreement, in each case, between 
the parties. I have left a message for Tanya Rohauer of the Credit Group and 
will keep you posted.

Hi Mark-

Hope all is well. 

Attached you will find an e-mail that I sent to Alan regarding ISDA 
documentation, for which I need approval from Houston.  Alan has informed me 
that he left you a voicemail on this subject and I was hoping you could 
provide me with guidance as to whom I should contact to obtain approval.

By separate e-mail, I will be forwarding weather derivative GTC's for use on 
EOL with Enron Japan Corp. as the Enron counterparty.  Please also advise who 
I should be in contact with to obtain the requisite approval for these GTC's, 
as well.

Best regards,

John

Attached hereto, are marked-up copies of the following ISDA documents (based 
on the US versions) which have been prepared using the credit worksheet for 
The Mitsui Marine & Fire Insurance Co., Limited, in conjunction with B&M:

ISDA Schedule,
CSA and
Enron Corp. Guarantee.

The footnotes will disappear when the changes to the document are accepted.  
It will be relatively straight forward to revise these for other 
counterparties
such as IBJ and Sanwa, which apparently have the same credit rating.  I note 
that we have not yet received the credit work sheet for IBJ or Sanwa.

Please note:

1.  There are still a number of "options" in the documents which I have not 
completed as I am unsure as to the desired outcome.  These are indicated in 
square
brackets.  Please let me know how you would like to deal with these;

2.   It will be important to make sure that the documents are carefully 
checked to ensure that we have properly incorporated the various elections in 
the documents;

3.   The agreements are governed by New York law and we should ensure that 
appropriate counsel reviews same;and

4.   A number of features in the agreements (particularly the requirement for 
a legal opinion and the use of L/Cs as form of collateral) are not common in
Japan and are likely to meet resistance from our counterparties.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

John

Laura:

I'm just a lawyer and as such still operating pretty much in the stone age.  
The easiest way for me to look at something that is primarily text (minimal 
graphics involved) is to have it in a form I can just print out.  If it 
exists as a Word document that would be great.  I have not yet actually been 
able to see the phase 2 site.

I am the writer that is developing the online help guide for the EnronOnIine 
system.  I work for Dave Forster.  Dave wanted to make sure that you have an 
opportunity to review the online help guide before we go live.  My 
understanding is that you have access to the test web.  The work in progress 
help guide is on the website but is by no means a finished product; it 
changes as screens and labels change.  Are you currently reviewing the online 
help or do I need to advise you when it is considered final?  Please let me 
know if you have a preferred way of reviewing this sort of thing. Thanks,

I didn't think we were confirming transactions between books, but maybe this 
is a first that crossed company lines - I would think we would confirm it 
through RMT as one ENA RMT trade and another RMT EPMI trade.  I'm assuming 
that the reference to EPMI Long Term Hedge is an EnronOnline reference to one 
of the EPMI trading desks and therefore it should be done as an EPMI trade.

Susan/Tana,

We have recently traded a deal on Enron Online in which the entity offering 
the trade was ENA and the entity entering the trade was EPMI Long Term Hedge 
(Power group hedging with ENA).  This is currently booked as RMT vs. EPMI 
Long Term Hedge.  Can we send out a confirmation based on ISDA terms since 
this is an Enron subsidiary per Global Counterparty?  I'm assuming this is 
just like doing a deal with Enron Global Exploration and Production, EES or 
ECT International, but let me know if I'm incorrect.

Thanks,
Joe

Dear John:

So sorry for the delay.  I hope it hasn't caused too much inconvenience.  I 
would have called to apologize in person but believe it or not I don't have 
your phone number!   Here are my comments to the draft documents you sent:

Part 1 (b)  In our other derivatives trading, the cross default test applies 
to Enron Corp. with a Threshold of US$100,000,000.  To accomplish this in the 
schedule, Threshold Amount for the Enron party would apply to our Credit 
Support Provider if there is going to be an Enron Corp. guaranty and the 
dollar figure adjusted accordingly.

Part 1 (d)  Has Baker & McKenzie recommended this?  We rely on local counsel 
advice for this provision but our preference is that the termination in a 
bankruptcy context not be automatic unless it needs to be.  The risk in the 
automatic situation is that the market moves significantly before we are even 
aware of the situation, i.e. the outstanding transactions terminate 
automatically, leaving us with an open, unhedged position which we are not 
able to protect since we are not aware of it.  In the U.S. the bankruptcy 
code allows us to terminate after the filing of a bankruptcy according to the 
terms of the agreement so we know exactly the time to rehedge.

Part 1 (e)  We usually choose Loss here as the method which gives the 
non-defaulting party the most flexibility.  Market Quotation is often 
suggested because of its apparent objective nature.  However, in many of the 
markets where we operate, quotations will not be available, where they are 
available they may well not be meaningful, and the Loss method gives 
flexibility (while still requiring commercial reasonableness).

Part 1 (h)(ix)  This Additional Event of Default only applies when there is 
no collateral annex.   When we have the ability to ask for (or be asked for) 
collateral in the case of a downgrading, we build that event into the 
Paragraph 13 to trigger a reduction of the threshold to zero which requires 
the posting of collateral to cover any open position.  If the party fails, it 
then becomes a default allowing termination.

Part 1 (h)(x)  Wouldn't the cross default be triggered before this could 
happen?

Part 2  Have our internal Tax people approved this?

Part 3  I am not familiar with the Representative Director concept or some of 
the corporate documents referred to.  Since Enron Corp. will be a Credit 
Support Provider, does it have a Representative Director, etc.?

The legal opinion requirement is one that we can waive if local counsel does 
not think it necessary.  In many non-US jurisdictions, local counsel have 
advised that an opinion be obtained - in some cases derivatives transactions 
are so uncommon that they might be outside the ordinary course of business 
and therefore require special board approval; in others, derivatives would 
not be permissible activities for a company unless express provision is made 
in the corporate documents, etc.

Part 5 (b) (g)&(h) These representations originate with CFTC rules in mind 
(although they may be helpful for other reasons as well).  If neither party 
is in the US, the CFTC reason may go away.  On the other hand, since we are 
choosing New York law to apply the argument might be made that US federal law 
applies as well.  If that is our theory, there are additional representations 
(the Eligible Swap Participant reps) that we should think about putting back 
in.

Part 5 (d)  We are currently evaluating whether we should revise this section 
to make reference to the ISDA 2000 definitions.  While I think we will get 
there, we haven't actually made the decision yet.  So far I guess we leave it 
the way it is.

Part 5 (j)  My only concern here is with the value of the Enron Corp. 
guaranty as a form for a guaranty from a Japanese entity.  Any differences in 
Japan from US practice we should be worried about?

Paragraph 13  I have to admit I'm not as familiar with the Paragraph 13 
provisions as the Schedule.  My only concern here is with the MAC clause and 
it looks like there's a glitch in the form.  It seems to me that if the 
counterparty is only rated by one of the 2 major agencies we shouldn't be 
pegged with a MAC if only one of our agencies stops rating us.  The way it is 
drafted now if either S&P or Moody's stops rating us, even if the remaining 
rating is very high we will have a MAC occur.  The counterparty doesn't have 
to worry about Moody's at all.  Just a thought.

On the guaranty, you will need to run the choice of law and jurisdiction 
changes past Clement Abrams at Corp. Legal.  My only comment is that we would 
usually have a cap that is a bit higher (in this case maybe an extra 
$5,000,000) than the threshold in the CSA - that gives the counterparty a 
little wiggle room if we fail to post collateral after the threshold is 
exceeded.

Tana is preparing a red-line for me that hopefully will show all of the 
changes between the US form and the Japan form.  I may have a few more 
comments after I see how that comes out but don't expect many.

I hope this is helpful.  Please feel free to call and we can walk through 
these over the phone if that would be useful.  We should also talk about the 
most efficient way to prepare these going forward.  It might make sense for 
Credit to send their worksheets to the paralegals here for a first draft 
which would then go to you for review before going to the counterparty.  It 
may slow things down by a day or two but it would free you up to work on 
other things.

We're looking forward to having you back.

Dave - my comments are below in red.  I'm assuming that "end of the day" is 
the end of the trading day, but this seems a bit ambiguous since the trader 
in Japan may be thinking about a different "day" than the trader in London, 
etc.  Will the orders be cancelled if our trader removes a product during the 
day and then reactivates it?

Mark,

Further to our conversation today; How is this?

You have offered a price limit order for aaa mmbtus of yyyyy at a price of 
xxx. If the price you specified becomes available on EnronOnline, the system 
will automatically try to fill your submission and a transaction may result.  
Your submission may be filled partially or completely depending on the volume 
available. This submission will remain active until for the earlier of (i) xx 
hours and yy minutes from your submission, or  (ii) until you cancel it (by 
highlighting it and pressing the cancel button on the main screen), or (iii) 
the end of the day. The submission  will not be withdrawn by your logout. 
Price limit orders are processed by price and then by timestamp. Therefore, 
if other price limit orders for the same price have been submitted before 
yours, then they will be filled before your submission is filled. This can 
result in other transactions completing at the same price as your price limit 
order, while your price limit order does not complete.

Hello Mark,

Justin Boyd told me that your can help me with questions regarding Chile.
We got a request for guest access through MG.
The company is called Escondida and is a subsidiary of BHP Australia.

Please advise if I can set up a guest account or not.
F.Y.I.: MG is planning to put a "in w/h Chile" contract for Copper on-line as 
soon as Enron has done the due diligence for this country.
Thanks !

Best regards

The Internets blew out and techs followed. The broader market
took all day to catch up.

After another night passed without a global meltdown the
market got off to a cautious start this morning. The Dow
traded in a narrow range until a small dip at noon but the
dip appeared to be the signal for buyers to come off the
sidelines.

The techs jumped out to a quick lead and the Nasdaq hovered
in the high +30 range for what seemed like forever but then
finally surged to another record close.

The combination of strong earnings reports and multiple
stock splits powered the market forward. As soon as traders
saw the market was not going down after the bump at the open
they jumped in not wanting to be left behind.

IBM surprised no one when they announced a 2:1 split.
MCD also announced a 2:1 and joined the recent ranks of
other splitters MSFT and XRX who announced yesterday.
The stock split craze is not over yet. BRCM and EBAY both
announced splits after the close. EBAY a 3:1 and BRCM 2:1.

It appears that nothing can stop MSFT as it added 9.69
today (they are over +15 for the week).  After such a
strong move, we are looking for some kind of pullback.
The rest of the Nasdaq 100's top four did well too.
INTC rose 6.31 while CSCO jumped up 3.69 and DELL leaped
up another 3.63.  Definitely a good day for the techs.

Not to be outdone, AOL added $9.00 in anticipation of
their own earnings announcement tomorrow.  Odds of a
split are strong but there is always an increased
risk associated with holding over earnings.  It wouldn't
surprise us to some profit taking before the close
tomorrow (quite similar to what happened to SUNW the
day of their earnings).

Compaq Computer announced today that they were going to
spin off Alta Vista as a separate company. This positive
news fired up the Internets early in the day.

As if they needed to add any fuel to the Internet explosion
Amazon announced earnings (or lack thereof) that beat the
street by +.04. That along with the EBAY and BRCM splits
had all the parties celebrating after the bell. EBAY was
up +18 and AMZN +7 in after hours. No numbers were available
for BRCM.

The market internals were negative until the last hour.
It just seemed that the buyers were holding back and only
reluctantly moving back into the market like swimmers in
the ocean after a shark sighting. Everyone KNEW they
should be buying but they wanted someone else to go first.

The fear of being Greenspamed on Thursday was probably
weighing on some and lingering Brazil/China worries on
others. The market is still a little top heavy here after
the big run in recent weeks. Yes we backed off -500 points
but some say this was not enough. We have always expected
the better than expected earnings would have traders
re-evaluating their estimates for 1999. Now it appears
that the current S&P average of companies reporting is
a +6.3% year over year increase in earnings. The historical
average is around +7% but due to the global slowdown the
current estimates had been for only +5% growth.

With almost 50% of the S&P-500 already reported we are
seeing a better than 2:1 ratio of positive surprises
compared to negative surprises.

We could have some profit taking again Wednesday night
as fear of Greenspan takes hold but we feel that he will
not harm the market intentionally. Almost nothing can harm
this market. Sure there will be some dips but for the next
two weeks the trend should be up. After the two up days
this week we could actually see some drop at the open again
tomorrow as minor profit taking occurs.

Good Luck

Jim Brown

The OEX Skybox is Back - New & Improved
***********************************************************

Based upon subscriber demand, the OEX Skybox is coming back.
OptionInvestor.com is please to announce that Pinnacle
Capital Advisors will be bringing its popular OEX Skybox back
to OI's advisory website this weekend and updating it DAILY.

And what better day to bring the OEX Skybox back than on
Superbowl Sunday, January 31st.  Unlike other OEX trading
systems, the OEX Skybox was designed to give subscribers a
"top down" view of this popular S&P 100 index option.  And in
a time of market volatility and uncertainty, sometimes one
needs to step away from the trading pit to see the big
picture from the "Skybox" and explore a broader range of
trading strategies and opportunities.

The OEX Skybox was first introduced by Pinnacle on November 1,
1998 and its team of experienced OEX traders generated an
impressive 292% over two short months.  The OEX Skybox will
supercede the OEX trading Pit and offer more ways for
subscribers to participate in the popular index option.

"We are excited to deliver the OEX Skybox to the number one
option advisory service on the Internet", says Austin Tanner,
Pinnacle's president.  According to Pinnacle, one of the
pitfalls of trading the OEX is getting caught up in the
intraday ticks and overtrading.  The focus of the OEX Skybox
is benchmark trading and gives OI subscribers winning trading
opportunities without all the noise.

What's unique about the OEX Skybox is Pinnacle's disciplined,
market-neutral trading approach that initiates trades at key
turning points in the market.  These turning points or
"benchmarks" are determined using time-tested technical and
sentiment indicators.

The new and improved DAILY OEX Skybox service will provide a
nightly OEX market wrap on the website that outlines
Pinnacle's OEX market posture and option strategies for the
next day.  During each trading day, the OEX Skybox will be
updated in realtime at three key time periods during the day.
The benefit of our fixed time period updates is that
subscribers can count on getting key trading instructions
when they login.

Nightly Strategy:
OEX Market Wrap           8:00 -  8:30pm EST

Daily Realtime Updates:
Before the Open           9:00 -  9:30am EST
After the Opening        11:00 - 11:30am EST
Before the Close          3:00 -  3:30pm EST

The nightly updates are designed for OEX traders who want to
trade the OEX but can't follow the OEX tick by tick during
the day.  The daily real-time updates give more active
day traders the ability to initiate and protect positions
quicker based upon fast developing news and events.

The change over will take place starting with Sunday's
newsletter and Mondays trading.

Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
******************************************************

Tuesday, January 26, 1999

Watch Option Call/Put Activity

Despite economic uncertainly in Brazil, we did not see an
increase in put activity over the past couple of days.  This
suggests that we DO NOT have strong underlying sentiment support
Next, we are focused on Call activity, particularly following
favorable earnings reports and stock splits.  If the options
speculators get ahead of themselves, it could presage a near
term top.

One positive development is the Market Volatility Index
(VIX) has closed BELOW 30.0% (29.35%).  This has Bullish overtones especially 
if the VIX resumes its declining trend which began back on October 8th.

Other sentiment indicators are still flashing BEARISH
overtones over the near-term including the Investors
Intelligence survey (60% Bullish) so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.  Any questions regarding
market sentiment can be directed at:

PICKS WE DROPPED
****************
When we drop a pick it doesn't mean we are recommending a sell
on that play. Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.
We drop a pick because something happened to change its
profile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we
don't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.
We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are
unfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we
want them to look at any current pick as a valid play.

CALLS:
******

AMGN $112.75 1.44 (-1.88) Amgen is an example of a stock that
should have been bought using the target shooting approach.
If you tried target shooting, you may have been filled in the
early morning and wound up with a profitable trade.  Amgen was
down nearly $4.00 in the first hour of trading Monday. In the
middle of the day, it climbed back to hover around $114.00
until the close. Today the trend was down again until late in
the day, when buyers moved in to buy the dip, but still left
it lower on the day. While the Nasdaq is up strong, Amgen is
not performing the way we had hoped, so we are dropping it.
However, there is the possibility of a split announcement
with earnings.  Unfortunately, there is more than one earnings
date available for AMGN.  Some sources say Jan. 27th others
say Jan. 28th.  AMGN last split 2:1 in August of 1995 in the
mid-90s.

T $86.88 -2.75 (-1.37)  Earnings announcement (met
expectations), share buyback, stock split, TCI merger --
the news is already out.  Right now, there's not much left
to move AT&T higher.  To be good plays, we think almost two
times a company's normal volume should produce nice gains.
Instead, over the last 2 days, AT&T went down in a strong
upward market.  In short, the play looks over for now so
we are dropping AT&T.

QWST $56.13 -2.56 (-4.00)  QWST has shown some weakness so
far this week.  It dove -$4.00 even in a market that seems
to be moving upwards.  On Tuesday, Lehman Brothers cut its
rating to outperform from their previous buy recommendation.
They think competition will increase from other companies
like MCI WorldCom Inc. and AT&T.  By taking a look at their
chart, it is easy to see that QWST is on the downside of the
hill. We are dropping Qwest as one of our plays until it
makes a definite turn-around and regains some upward
momentum.

PRIA $32.19 -.81 (-3.69) PRIA gave us a good, steady
momentum run.  But earnings are only 2 days away, and it
looks like it is rolling over and heading lower, so we are
dropping it.  Remember, we don't recommend holding over
earnings due to the increased risk.  Make your own decision
based on your risk/reward profile.

PUTS:
******

MCHP - $32.00 1.25 (1.81)  Stock recovered nearly $2 after
being downgraded by Alex Brown. Stock trading below
consolidation of $36-40 but above last Novembers break out
price of $30.00. Dropping after stock appears to holding at
retracement price of $30.

PKN - $96.31  5.44 (5.00) Advanced higher with broad market
off of 50 day moving average.  Dropping until stock rolls
over again.

PICK NEWS - CALLS
*******************************************************

EMC $101.75 -.25 (+3.25) EMC announced earnings today and beat
estimates by 2 cents per share.  Revenue for the quarter
increased 36% over the year ago period and net income increased
54% versus the same period last year.  EMC also projects
revenue growth in 1999 to be 30% or more and sales to pick up
in Asia.  Software revenues grew by 175%.  EMC traded down only
a little today, which is good news since they didn't blow away
the estimates.  EMC still has some room to move before it runs
into the 52 week high it set last week.

UTX $117.25 +1.44 (+2.69) UTX set a new 52 week high today at
$117.63.  The downgrade that UTX got after the close on Friday
really didn't impact it all that much.  UTX traded flat for the
first half of Monday and then started up.  We haven't had any
news on UTX so it is living off of its earnings release last
week and the upward movement of the Dow.  Remember when trading
UTX, it is a Dow 30 component and is very Dow sensitive.

ORCL $52.88 +1.81 (+3.00) We said ORCL might be a candidate for
some target shooting around its 10 day moving average, but it
hasn't been anywhere near it this week.  It was good to see
ORCL move through $52 today.  It had been having some trouble
with this level.  In the news, ORCL announced new software for
oil exploration and production companies.  It will allow oil
industry co-venture partners and newly merged oil companies to
share information and monitor asset performance asset
performance quickly, easily and collaboratively.  The oil
industry can use all the help they can get given the low price
of oil these days.  The new software uses ORCL's new Internet
database  Oracle8i.

DELL $88.50 +3.63 (+5.50)  Without news or
fanfare, Dell set a new all-time closing high today on
slightly less than average volume, indicating a lack of
sellers.  Dell is now sitting at its resistance of $88.50.
If Dell can push through this on more than 18 million
shares, the sky is the limit on its way to earnings
scheduled for February 16 after the close.  If volume
doesn't materialize, that's OK.  It just means that Dell
will be a little more susceptible to a pullback.  In
Technology Business Research's 4th Quarter Corporate IT
Buying Behavior and Customer Satisfaction Study, conducted
with 300 F1000 IT Managers, Dell continues as the number
one vendor for customer satisfaction across notebook,
desktop and server platforms.  Nice chart; its not too late
to scale into a position for earnings.  Dips are buyable,
but would rather confirm upward movement first.

CSCO $107.13 +3.69 (+4.32)  Thank goodness
for the last hour of trading.  Without it, CSCO would be up
only $2 this week; not very inspiring considering CSCO is
the third largest component of the NASDAQ 100, which set a
new high today.  Cisco's saving grace: genuine buying
interest (not just market sympathy) shows volume 11% above
average in today's trading.  We are playing CSCO as a split
candidate and earnings run.  CSCO has enough shares
authorized to announce a 3:2 split on February 2 after the
close, along with earnings, just 5 trading days away.  CSCO
continues receive new awards for building the new wave of
telecom technology.  Today, CSCO was selected as Sprint's
primary supplier of DSL technology for building out "last
mile" broadband access solutions to Sprint's next-
generation Sprint ION(SM), Integrated On-Demand Network,
and for DSL-based services for customers of Sprint's Local
Telecommunications Division (LTD), beginning in 1999
(Business Wire).  The run has begun.  Dips are buyable.
Confirm upward movement first and use stops to protect your
profits.

AOL $154.84 +8.84 (+14.40)  Whew!!  All we
can say is "It's about time".  In Sunday's letter, we noted
that we expected a bounce off the moving average, out of
consolidation running toward earnings.  We got it.  Volume
has been slightly below average this week causing us slight
anxiety.  But with a 14-point gain in 2 days, we'll get
over it.  Tomorrow, after 5:00 p.m. ET, AOL announces
earnings along with what we also hope to be a split
announcement; probably 2:1, although there are enough
shares outstanding to declare a 3:1.  We expect great
results from the record number of new subscribers and
surprising Holiday sales volumes. We don't normally
recommend holding over earnings so evaluate your risk
tolerance if you opt to hold through on this play.
Intestinal fortitude still required.

WCOM $77.94 +0.25 (+3.06)  WCOM should have
performed better today given the new NASDAQ record, but
we're still up $3 for the week under it's resistance level
of $80 on slightly higher than average volume.  To be safe,
wait for a pullback confirmed by reversal, or until WCOM
breaks $80 and holds.  The U.S Supreme Court's ruling
yesterday to force the baby bells to open their markets to
competition had little effect on moving the price up.  A
downgrade issued by Kauffman Bros. from "buy" to "hold"
didn't help.  Confirm sector movement before starting a new
play.

I definitely need to send Aspect a letter.  Per Fred Lagrasta, we would like 
to "cancel" this call until it is necessary in the future.  We are not

Mark:

Per our conversation I am attaching the Margin Call notification that was 
sent to Aspect Resources.  As I mentioned, Wayne Williamson has received this 
notice.   We do have someone looking further into Aspect's financials, but we 
do feel that there might br a need to send a letter to Aspect regarding a 
Margin Call cancellation.  Thanks in advance for your assistance.

Regards,

I think you can go straight to performance review - please let me know if it 
doesn't work.

Does this mean you have to resubmit or do I just go to the performance review 
page?

*******************************************************

MSFT $171.56 +9.69 (+15.31)  Wow!!  It doesn't
get much better than this.  MSFT announced their 2:1 stock
split (effective 3/26) prior to yesterday's market open and
immediately gapped-up at the opening.  Those of you still
in the play going into last weekend were richly rewarded
Monday Morning.  Everyone wants to own MSFT and nobody
wants to sell.  This sentiment on 2 times normal volume
produced a textbook run-up -- as if "astrodollar" earnings
aren't enough.  Price targets are now at $200.  Of note,
MSFT announced they would phase in Alta-Vista, Compaq's to-
be-spun-off-in-an-IPO search engine, and ease out Inktomi.
Use stops to protect your profits.  With so much money on
the table, we suggest waiting for a pullback before
starting a new play.  As always, confirm market direction
first.

DH $60.88 +0.63 (+0.94)  As we said Sunday,
not a fast mover, but a steady gainer. 1189 institutions
own 89.5% of the 395 million shares in float leaving about
40 million shares in daily float to trade.  On average
volume of 2 million shares, DH traded within $1.50 range
both days this week, sheltering investors from a tumultuous
market. Look for the rise to continue, market permitting.
Slow news week so far; nothing to move the price.  Just
hare-speed momentum.  Dayton Hudson is the parent company
of Target Stores

VIA.B $81.88 -1.13 (-0.68)  Profit taking has caused a slight
dip in Viacom.  But, it has been so small that it actually can
be interpreted as a positive sign for the stock.  VIA.B seems
to undergo an occasional consolidation.  Then it goes on its
merry way.  As always, wait for the signal to turn green
before hitting the gas.  Blockbuster Inc., a subsidiary of
Viacom, teamed up with Warner Home Video in a revenue sharing
agreement.   As a result, Blockbuster will be able to rent
more new releases and other videos to its customers.  Chyron
Corporation will deliver Liberty NT software to an affiliate
of Paramount which is partially owned by Viacom.  The new
system will allow access to paint and animation capabilities
on the Windows NT platform.

WAG $59.50 +1.13 (+1.06)  On Tuesday, Walgreen's flexed its
muscles in a display strength and closed at it's high for the
day.  Its only resistance is at it's all time high set back in
December at $60.44.  With its 2:1 stock split scheduled for
Feb. 12th, it appears WAG is getting in shape to make a nice
run.

LXK $108.00 +3.88 (+8.75) Well, we have good news and bad news
on LXK this week.  Let's start with the bad news.  LXK did
not announce a stock split with earnings.  Their annual
shareholder meeting isn't until April, so a stock split
announcement would have to come on an arbitrary day.  We
noticed that companies, like Microsoft, have held off a few
days before announcing their splits.  This might be a ploy
to take the price high on the earnings announcement and then
take it higher with the split announcement.  The good news
is that LXK announced earnings of $1.16 a share.  This was
$.05 above consensus estimates.  The company also stated
there is a high demand for printer components.  LXK is in
blue-sky territory as it has broken through any prior
resistance.

VOD $193.50 +2.88 (+5.12) VOD has come back to life the last
two trading days with gains of $2.88 and $2.24.  There isn't
any recent news on VOD, but there is one very positive
technical aspect.  The last three trading days have seen
VOD close right at the high of the day.  This shows a very
bullish tendency as the bulls seem to be winning the battle
on a daily basis.

XIRC $42.31 +.38 (+.31) XIRC seems to have entered a
consolidation phase.  The volatility was pretty high before
earnings, but the daily range has decreased substantially
the last three trading days.  We still feel this stock is a
good purchase.  Watch for a strong up-move on good volume.
XIRC's 52-week high is at $44.50.  A move through this level
should provide a nice rally.  XIRC did announce today that
they will provide wireless data support for Siemans handsets.

SNC $39.50 +.56 (+1.75) SNC continued to rise today, albeit
at a smaller pace.  No news on SNC, but earnings are around
the 10th of February and SNC has historically had nice
earnings surprises.  There isn't much of a chance of an
upgrade for this stock, being that the five analysts that
follow it all rank it a strong buy.  We guess there could be
a new analyst recommendation.  We could see a continued run
into earnings.  SNC's 52-week high is $54.18.

XLNX $82.56 +5.44 (+4.37) XLNX did the job on Tuesday with
over a 6% gain.  XLNX has done what a lot of stocks do after
announcing great earnings and a stock split and that is to
consolidate briefly and then continue up.  XLNX dropped on
Monday, but came back with a vengeance on Tuesday. XLNX's
resistance is at its 52-week high of $87.63.  Pullbacks
would be good buying opportunities.

MU $71.88 +2.88 (+1.38) Micron showed some weakness on Monday
in a mixed semi-conductor market. It was off $1.50 even as a
few of the other chip stocks moved up in sympathy with LSI
Logic.  LSI had received an upgrade from hold to strong buy.
Today, however, MU was up $2.88 in a generally strong semi-
conductor sector. Any upgrades and strong earnings from other
stocks in the sector, as well as from the hardware stocks,
should help MU.  Like Dell, it reports later in the earnings
season, so an earnings run would start a little later.
Earnings in February.

NOKA $145.38 +1.38 (+.82) After hitting $155.38 on Wednesday,
Jan. 20th, Nokia has gapped down at the open each of the last
four trading days. It has also CLOSED well above its opening
price the last few days, and today it managed to close $1.38
above yesterday's close. This company is located in Finland
and trades in Europe while we sleep. The Europeans seem to be
sending the stock lower while the Americans are sending it
back up each day on the NYSE. Only two days left for an
earnings run--earnings are due out before the bell on Friday.
We believe that there is a good possibility of a split
announcement with earnings. If you don't want to risk holding
over earnings, be sure to sell your options before the close
on Thursday.  You can pick them up again if a split is announced.
That is the conservative way to make this play. If you hold over,
you risk a loss of capital, should Nokia disappoint. For those
of you with high risk tolerance, please note that Nokia jumped
$9 the day it announced it's last split.  It then ran up another
$34 before the split.

ANF - Abercrombie & Fitch $73.94 +2.06 (+4.19 for the week)

Abercrombie & Fitch sells men's and women's casual clothes
and accessories in over 170 stores across America.  Their
comfortable styles of jeans and crews are especially popular
with teens and college students.  Check out this Volkswagen
hip-hop retailer the next time you are strolling through
the mall.

Abercrombie has established a nice upward trend since its
lows in October.  It has been virtually unstoppable with
only two minor bouts of profit taking along the way.  In
intraday trading on Tuesday, ANF set another all-time high
at the $75 level.  Look for ANF to continue its steady trend
into blue skies.  There hasn't been a lot of news as of late
for Abercrombie.  But, back on Jan 8th, an article in Reuters
commented that since American Eagle Outfitters had posted
nice sales figures, it was safe to assume that Abercrombie
could do the same.

SEPR - Sepracor Inc. $104.25 +2.50 (+4.75 for the week)

Sepracor Inc. is a company that researches, develops, and
sells chemicals that are new, patented forms of existing
pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical compounds.  These
products are made to reduce the side effects and increase
the safety of drugs already on the market today.  They are
used to treat several conditions that include asthma,
allergies, pain, and insomnia.  As an example, SEPR
developed Allegra as an alternative to Seldane which lost
FDA approval in 1997.

Sepracor Inc. has a stellar graph.  The company has been on
an uptrend since it was at the $40 level back in June and
in intraday trading Tuesday, SEPR set another all time high
at $105.50.  Last Friday, Jan. 22nd, BancBoston Robertson
Stephens initiated coverage of this steady stock with a
"long-term attractive rating."  They projected a 12-month
price target of $112.  They seem to favor this company which
has two approved drugs and six drugs in late phase clinical
development.  Look for SEPR to continue its upward trek if
current market conditions remain steady.

WMT - Wal-Mart $83.56 +1.56 (+1.56)

The king of retailers is back! Wal-Mart is the leading
discount retailer in the world, with a presence in all 50
states, as well as Canada, Mexico, Asia, Latin America, and
Europe. In addition to discount department stores, it
operates the #2 grocery chain, behind Kroger's, and Sam's
clubs, which is the #2 warehouse chain. This retail giant's
market capitalization is $182.3 billion.

We covered Wal-Mart recently, but dropped it when the stock
began pulling back. It appears to be moving out of a
consolidation phase and has been trending up for a week, with
only one slightly down day in that period. Wal-Mart had a
strong holiday season. It continues to grow at home and also
abroad, partly through acquisitions. It is now growing its
profits faster than its sales once again.

As an option play, WMT is a steady mover. While it lacks the
fast moves of the technology and Internet stocks, it is a
safer play, and has the added advantage of being a split
candidate. The stock last split in February 1993. Its last
three splits occurred when WMT traded in the mid-60s.
Earnings are due out in February.

COMBINATION PLAYS   - Split-O-Rama
*****************************************************

Monday, January 25

U.S. blue-chip stocks ended higher Monday after a volatile day of
trading amid a slew of mixed earnings results from multi-national
companies. The DJIA closed unofficially up 82 points at 9203.32.
The Dow shed 57 points early in the day but recovered as several
big-name companies including AT&T and 3M reported earnings. The
high-flying Nasdaq Index gained 30 points to 2369.11 primarily on
the shoulders of Microsoft shares after the company declared a 2:1
stock split. A report that analysts expect IBM to announce a stock
split after its board meets Tuesday helped Big-Blue reverse a $6
loss from early in the day and close slightly higher at $180.93.
Despite big gains in the Dow and the Nasdaq Composite, breadth on
both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq was negative as
decliners outpaced advancers on both exchanges.

Most of the Sunday plays were available near the recommended entry
points. MRK opened the day around $137 and traded slightly higher
just before 10 AM. The first prices listed for the FEB160C/155C
bear-call spread were around $0.75 credit. EMC was also slow to
start trading and opened slightly higher near $100. Our put-credit
spread; FEB75P/80P did not have any volume but the bid/ask quotes
were within $0.12 of our target entry of $0.50. SKYT was a pair of
plays; the calendar spread, JUN25C/FEB25C was easily opened for
$2.38 debit. The best we saw on the ITM debit spread, FEB22C/25C
was $2.00 (higher than our target) and that was a little slim on
the ROI potential so we decided to pass. PLCM fell hard in a post
earnings dip but that just brought the sold position nearer to ATM
and a higher time component. We decided to take advantage of the
lower entry price; $0.87 for the MAR25C/FEB25C time spread, and
hope the stock finishes around $25 in four weeks. NRC was very
interesting as the option quotes opened near the previous closing
prices but soon moved apart in the spread (MAR50C/FEB50C) even
though the stock price remained quiet and the volume was fairly
docile. Our initial price was $1.12. CNTO, the butterfly spread,
moved lower most of the day reducing our initial entry to $0.87
for the FEB35C/40C/45C position. Remember, there is a method of
legging out of a butterfly spread that is acceptable. If the
stock price moves significantly, early in the life of the
spread, the BULL spread portion or the BEAR spread portion can
be closed-out near their maximum profit potentials. The spreader
may want to take advantage of this situation in order to profit
more if the stock reverses direction and comes back into the
profit range. By increasing his risk slightly, he may be able to
improve his position significantly by converting the butterfly
spread to a vertical spread. Although the chances of such a trend
reversal cannot be considered great, it does not cost the trader
much to restructure himself into a position with a much broader
maximum profit. That's our plan, we'll see what happens...

In other portfolio activities; PCS just keeps climbing like there
is no gravity and we just wonder where it will end. If any of you
are exercised early on the short side of the spread, let us know.
SRCM is a source of pain as the stock price has fallen sharply
without any change in the buying pressure. We decided to pull the
plug and prevent any losses. The JAN17P was closed at $1.25 and
we would expect to sell the JAN15P at a minimum of $0.50 for a
break-even exit. The initial target will be $1.00 until the stock
reverses (upward) again.

Tuesday, January 26

On Tuesday, U.S. stocks rallied in afternoon trading to close near
session highs. Solid earnings reports, stock splits, and big tech
deals all boosted the market. The DJIA closed unofficially up 115
points at 9318.40. The Nasdaq index of technology issues finished
up almost 65 points at 2433.46, surpassing a record high close of
2415.49 set on January 20th. Big gains in shares of IBM, Xerox,
Microsoft and Yahoo accounted for much of the positive movement.

On Tuesday, our big movers were AOL, CPQ, LVLT and SUNW. AOL was
the only issue we acted on, closing half of our debit position at
$2.25 for a $0.75 profit. On the LVLT debit spread, we expect to
close at about a $6.50 credit for a $2.00 profit. SRCM continued
downward but did not reach our target exit for the FEB15P. Watch
for signs of a turn-around as the buying pressure is still very
healthy on this stock. PCS just keeps climbing, about 6 days in a
row. MRK had a surprise rebound today, climbing $6 on a positive
earnings announcement. More to discuss on Thursday...

    - NEW PLAYS -

Today we will focus on some of the common stocks in the blue-chip
technology group. We rarely play these issues because the main
section of the newsletter covers these stocks in-depth and we like
to bring you a wide array of candidates. These companies are in
the news everyday and the earnings/split-mania is just too much to
pass up...Good Luck!
******************************************************************
MSFT - Microsoft  $171.56     *** Disparity? ***

Microsoft Corp. develops, manufactures, licenses and supports a
range of software products, including scalable operating systems,
server applications, business and productivity applications,
software development tools and Internet software and technologies.

Microsoft rules! With a market value that far outstrips its sales,
Microsoft is the world's #1 software company. Softwares include
Windows, Excel, MS Word, PowerPoint, and Encarta. The Microsoft
Network provides online content, and its Internet Explorer is
still battling Netscape Navigator for market share. With NBC, the
company operates cable news channel MSNBC. They also provide email
with "Hotmail" and many other services.

Everybody is making deals with MSFT. To make AltaVista a premier
destination site on the Web, Compaq announced a partnership with
Microsoft in which AltaVista will offer a e-mail service based on
Microsoft's Hotmail service. In addition, AltaVista and Microsoft
agreed to make AltaVista's Web search the primary search vehicle
for the Microsoft Network Internet site.

The big news (of course) was the blow-out earnings and the 2:1
stock-split. On Monday, Microsoft said its stock split would
increase its shares outstanding to 5 billion and make its stock
more affordable. The split will take effect on 3/12/98 if it is
approved by shareholders.

We expect MSFT will consolidate somewhat after the news wears off
but there is no doubt it will return to the headlines shortly
thereafter. Sell the time premium now before it evaporates in
this small disparity play.

PLAY (conservative):

BUY  PUT MAR-155 OI=686  A=$4.00
SELL PUT MAR-160 OI=3842 B=$5.38
NET CREDIT TARGET=$1.50 ROI=42% (2 months)

******************************************************************
DELL - Dell Computer  $88.50     *** Almost Free Money ***

Dell Computer is one of the world's top PC makers and the world's
#1 direct-sale computer vendor. The company sells hardware and
markets third-party software and peripherals. Products include
notebooks, PCs, and network servers. Dell also markets a variety
of peripherals and software for other manufacturers. More than 90%
of its systems are sold to businesses and government entities. The
company continues to expand services such as its Web site, which
is expected to process half of it's transactions by the year 2000.

Dell recently announced that they have secured a share of the #1
position in the worldwide personal workstation market. They also
continue as the number one vendor for customer satisfaction and
their scores are significantly higher than most competitors in
price/performance, overall reliability, repair and delivery time.

Dell will post earnings sometime in mid-February and we expect
the stock to make the traditional run to the actual announcement.
In addition to buying calls, you might elect to make this play
with current portfolio collateral. This is a low return spread
based on another small disparity but the worst that could happen
is you choose to own DELL at $69.19.

PLAY (very conservative):

BUY  PUT MAR-65 DLQ-OM OI=766  A=$1.19
SELL PUT MAR-70 DLQ-ON OI=2341 B=$1.81

This week, Xerox delivered another record quarter, reflecting
strong double-digit earnings growth consistent with company
objectives, even though pre-currency revenue growth was clearly
affected by some weaker economies. Their fourth quarter diluted
earnings per share increased 16% to $1.69 and income increased
17% to $615 million, primarily as a result of outstanding growth
in digital product revenues, improved operating margins and
ongoing benefits from the worldwide restructuring program. Xerox
also announced an 11% increase in the quarterly cash dividend on
the company's common stock and a two-for-one stock split.

The stock split will be effective for shareholders of record on
2/4/99 and distributed on 2/23/98. The quarterly dividend will
increase 11% to 20 cents on a post-split basis, payable on 4/1/98
to shareholders of record on March 5. Today's gap-up and the
split date make perfect timing for a one month spread. Plan to
close the play near the February strike date on the pre-split run.

IBM - Intl. Business Machines  $185.50     *** Split Play ***

International Business Machines is the world's top provider of
computer hardware and it is #2 in software. The company makes a
broad range of computers, including PCs, mainframes, and network
servers. The company also makes software and peripherals, and has
an ever-expanding service arm. IBM owns software pioneer Lotus
Development, maker of the Lotus Notes messaging system. Almost 60%
of the company's sales are to foreign customers and IBM continues
to revamp its image, with a focus on Internet business.

As expected, IBM declared a two-for-one stock split, just one day
after software rival Microsoft did the same. IBM posted fourth
quarter earnings last week that exceeded street expectations but
saw its shares fall after failing to announce a split. Today, the
stock rebounded on the renewed interest. The new shares should be
distributed on or about May 26 to shareholders of record on May 10.
The IBM board also set a regular quarterly dividend of $0.22 per
share, payable March 10 to stockholders of record on Feb. 10.

Although the current technical (and earnings) outlook is somewhat
lackluster, we believe Big-Blue will rise to the occasion and
easily hold $185 on the strike date in March.

Mark:  Someone has put 5 boxes and a redwell of files that apparently 
belonged to Yao Apasu into the file room.  I'm sure you know that there is a 
process for sending purged files and completed transaction files to the file 
room through me so that I may enter them into the file room database. 

Where can those files be moved so that someone from the trading group can 
weed them?   I'm sorry to add this to your departmental duties, but they do 
need to be moved.  I'm going to send a memo that nothing is to be put into 
the file room without coming through my office for processing.

I am copying Julia with this note because we have been discussing file 
retention policies relating to the move and the availability of space on the 
floor.

Thanks, 
Kay

Dear Mark Taylor,

asap.

Thanks
John A. Peyton

Dear Mark Mey,

We appreciate your interest in our new dayrate financial products.  

For your consideration, we would like to indicatively propose a transaction 
The Commodity Reference Price would be the arithmetic mean of the high and 
low Rig Day Rates for JU-300'-IC as published by Offshore Data Services, 
Inc., or its successor, in the last issue of Gulf of Mexico Weekly Rig 
Locator, or any successor publication, published during the applicable 
Calculation Period, on the page entitled "Gulf of Mexico Rig Utilization and 
Day Rates".  The Payment Date(s) would be the fifth (5th) Business Day 
following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable.

We have authority to enter into the above this type of transaction and would 
be able to move quickly toward providing you with an executable contract.  
Because the market for dayrates is highly volatile [and because we may have 
made similar proposals to other counterparties] (is this true?), this 
indicative proposal is only good until August 31st, 2000.  We look forward to 
further discussions. 

This document contains indicative terms only and is not intended to create a 
binding or enforceable contract nor is it an offer or commitment to enter 
into any transaction.  All terms are subject to change until agreement as to 
a specific transaction has been reached.  ENA is not acting as a fiduciary or 
advisor and you should evaluate and understand the terms, conditions, and 
risks of all transactions in making your decisions with respect thereto.  The 
proposal described herein is subject to further review and approval by ENA 
and Counterparty and, among other matters, further review and approval of the 
board of directors of each party, and the negotiations, execution and 
delivery of definitive agreements containing all appropriate provisions, 
including those related to credit, limitations of damages and others.

Sincerely,

John A. Peyton
Director

Sparks Companies is an outside ag industry consultant that Gary and his group 
have retained.  Sparks has a Washington office, and two of the principals of 
that office are putting on a presentation for us in D.C. on Sept. 14.  The 
focus of the presentation is ag law and policy and where Sparks sees things 
going over the next two years.

In addition to Gary and Elsa, Chris Long and Lisa Yoho of the public affairs 
department will attend, and I think it would be helpful for me to attend as 
well.  The presentation is scheduled from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m., so I should be 
able to fly up that day and return that evening.

Please let me know your thoughts on this.  If you agree, I will have Brenda 
make travel arrangements for me.  Thanks -- Bob

Jeff:

That sounds like a great idea.  Are there limitations on such meetings?  I 
would think we need to be careful to avoid any appearance of impropriety.

Mark

   

The leading candidate to replace Brooksley Born as CFTC Chair seems to be 
Annette Nazareth (sp?), who is currently at the SEC.  She is a former Wall 
Street lawyer with a good knowledge of the capital markets/derivatives 
business, and others in the industry feel she would be sympathetic to our 
views on regulation of the OTC markets.   She apparantly has the backing of 
the White House and Treasury Department, and she fits the most important 
criteria -- she's willing to take the job.

As she emerges more formally as the nominee, we might think about an Enron or 
Energy Coalition meeting with Ms. Nazareth her to educate her to the 
specifics of our business.  I'll keep you posted on the process.

Jeff

Sounds reasonable to me.

Based upon discussions with Andrea Reed, the res of the swap will be the 
warrant itself, not the underlying stock.  The warrants are valued separately 
with a "warrant model" and carry a price of their own differentiated from, 
although affected by, the stock price.  I did not get into further detail on 
the specifics of the modeling.  The will provide us the number of warrants, 
the strike price as of August 3.  Otherwise they will work similarly to the 
stock based swap I think.  She said they do not plan to exercise them, but 
may sell them as warrants.  Let me know what you think.  Mary

John - While we can delete Part 6 it then becomes necessary to add additional 
language in each confirmation which is not part of the templates for 
transactions used by the back office.  Each transaction would therefore 
require significant additional time and effort to prepare making it more 
cumbersome to do business with that counterparty.  There is no down-side to 
having the language in the master - the whole point of the master is that we 
agree to these things now so we don't have to deal with them at the confirm 
stage.  You can say "it's enough if the terms are referred to in the 
confirmation" for ALL of the terms of the master.  Since we would insist on 
the appropriate provisions being in the confirm in any event, if they have a 
problem with this language we need to know now what the problem is.  With 
respect to the CSA, that is an issue for Credit.  It is certainly not 
necessary to have a valid agreement but it is necessary if you want to insist 
on collateral.  In this case, if IBJ is a stronger credit than Enron it may 
well be that the csa is more of a burden than a benefit.  It strikes me as 
disingenuous to say that they don't have the internal systems for csa's with 
nonfinancial counterparties - the same systems would work for nonfinancial 
parties as well as financial parties.

Dear Mr.Viverito

Thank you very much.
Now we start checking your draft and maybe we can return comment on this
Friday.

Please be advised following points at this time.
1)Part 6 on the schedule is needed to be deleted.
  We think that it's enough if the terms in Part 6 are referred in the
individual confirmation.
2)ISDA Credit support annex is not acceptable
  Unfortunately, we don't have internal system for concluding CSA with
non-financial entity.

Please keep support us for concluding ISDA ASAP for our business in near
future.
If any question, please feel free to contact me.

Please check it all and kindly reply ASAP.
(CSA is not acceptable as I mentioned you before, and we'll check your

Yes, Mary is still in 3807.  Is the printer you mentioned the 
smallest/cheapest one we can get?

It's not looking good for getting back to you today on this - shaping up to 
be a very bad day and we need to coordinate with Credit for their responses 
as well.  I have a call in to John Suttle and have forwarded the revised 
draft to him.  We'll do what we can.

I saw your reply to my previous note.  On this one point:

It strikes me as disingenuous to say that they don't have the internal 
systems for csa's with nonfinancial counterparties - the same systems would 
work for nonfinancial parties as well as financial parties.  IBJ is the most 
sophisticated Japanese player in the derivative market and one would believe 
that they could handle the documentation for both financial and non-financial 
entities.  I note, I have heard that it is not market practice for Japanese 
financial institutions to provide collateral to non-financial institutions, 
so it may be very difficult for them to alter their position. 

I understand.  My view is just that it is probably not a systems issue but a 
position and it irks me to have the point made as a systems issue when it is 
not.  As we both agree, the  issue may be moot depending on what Credit 
thinks.

I've chartered in the BVI a number of times and it is a great place to take 
beginners.  I only caught your post of yesterday so didn't see the earlier 
thread.  I'm assuming you're picking up the boat in Road Town or nearby.  The 
only problem with getting away from the dock by 12 or so is if the boat isn't 
quite ready.  I've always used the Moorings so they're the only outfit I 
know.  They don't usually let you get started on the boat until after the 
chart briefing which means you don't go aboard until 10.  If you use their 
provisioning service it eases that chore but sometimes the food isn't there 
right on time.  Having several people (but not too many) around this time is 
helpful to put food away, take inventory, attend boat briefing, etc.  Of 
course, if you get the boat the day before - maybe with a sleepaboard option 
or some such, you have that much more certainty that everything will be done 
on time.  Check with your charter company about attending the briefings 
before sending the last person off to the airport - some companies may 
require 2 people from your boat to attend.

As for first day - if you are away by 1 I suggest heading over to the Bight 
on Norman Island.  There are lots of moorings there and you'll get one as 
long as you're not in too late.  It shouldn't take more than a few hours to 
get there and if it looks like it might be close you can always fire up the 
engine.  There are a couple of places (a beach bar and a boat) to eat and 
drink there if you don't feel like cooking the first night and although you 
can't call it deserted or even secluded because of the number of boats there, 
there is at least very little ashore to bother you.  The caves are just 
around the corner and the Indians right outside for great snorkeling/diving 
either that afternoon or first thing the next day.

Whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise doesn't really matter.  My 
advice running roughly clockwise: 

skip Soppers Hole - just a commercial port with little of interest (unless 
you're clearing customs); 

skip the USVI - all the clearing out & in & out & in can take a lot of time 
and there's plenty to do in the BVI - if you just have to go, the northern 
shore of St. John is the best - nice anchorages (several of the 'secluded' 
variety) without the crime on St. Thomas and the resort at Caneel Bay will 
let you come ashore for a fancy dinner (but make reservations and leave your 
trash on board - there's nowhere to put it); 

Jost van Dyke is fun - anchor in Great Harbor or pick up a mooring in Little 
Harbor - Sydney's Peace & Love restaurant in Little Harbor still has an honor 
bar where you mix your own drinks & just keep track in his little black book 
while you're waiting for dinner, Foxie's in Great Harbor is a classic beach 
bar/rest. - lots of fun and good food & drinks;  

Sandy Cay is everyone's image of a desert island and perfect for a lunch stop 
and a swim; 

don't miss Cane Garden Bay (unless the northerly swell is too heavy) there's 
a wonderful swath of pure white beach with palm trees swaying overhead and 
steel drum bands serenade you into the evening - watch the reefs but the 
channel in is well marked; 

if there's a full moon be sure to be on Tortola somewhere that night (Cane 
Garden works fine) to get to Bomba's Shack for the party - there are lots of 
taxis there as the evening progresses to get you back; 

it's easy to pick people up (or drop them off) at the airport (close to the 
water with a dinghy dock) midweek if you need to and kind of fun to be met 
that way; 

the Baths are a must but VERY crowded (no anchoring allowed - must use a 
mooring) so I'd try to get there as early in the day as possible (Cooper 
Island, Marina Cay and area by Last Resort are nearby for the night before) - 
maybe get up early, motor or sail over and have breakfast once you're safely 
moored - and be careful to use the right color mooring and avoid the ones 
reserved for commercial craft;  

I usually skip Spanish Town (Virgin Gorda Yacht Harbor) since I'd rather be 
at anchor than stuck in a marina slip with no breeze, but if you stay there 
you can get a taxi to the Baths and top off with water in case your crew is 
not serious enough about fresh water conservation (and what crew ever is?); 

the Bitter End is great for a long hot shower (I think you pay at the resort 
front desk) and maybe a 'fancy' dinner and there is also a water dock there 
(10 cents a gal.?).   

Sometimes it seems like the distances are so short you don't get to sail 
enough - you shouldn't have any trouble getting a lot in (but you won't be 
able to see everything).  The only difficulty might be if you need to get the 
boat back in for an early flight but I've let people out at Cane Garden Bay 
to take a taxi to the early flight & then sailed around to have the boat back 
well before noon.  Having said that, I suggest Cooper Island or the Bight for 
your last night - it just makes that last morning a bit more leisurely.   And 
just as I mentioned for the first night, it makes sense to get into most 
anchorages early rather than late so you're sure to get a mooring (in those 
that have them) and don't have to worry about finding a spot for the boat - 
many of them can get quite crowded.  Of course, if you're going anytime 
between now and Thanksgiving there shouldn't be any trouble with crowds - 
just pay daily, close attention to the weather forecasts!

Don't expect much in the way of night life but there are places to eat at 
nearly every anchorage - many are closed in the low season.  A few of the 
islands have some good hiking but there's not much for the sight seers 
either.  But snorkeling and diving are everywhere.  Ask at your chart 
briefing for the best spots these days.  If you have divers along, don't miss 
the wreck of the Rhone - you can have a dive boat come and meet you there and 
bring along equipment and a guide for the divers.  The cruising guide will 
have lots of info on all these issues.

Wish I was going - it's always a blast!

I sent Amanda & Bill an e-mail a couple of weeks ago and here is Bill's 
reply.  I sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things 
and which were the best times of year, etc.  I haven't heard anything from 
Amanda and was beginning to assume they were not really interested in a 
November trip.  Have you heard anything firm from Virginia?  Bill's 
next-to-last paragraph tells me that he's getting to know Amanda - but I 
don't think she'll leave him alone for the holiday.  The real question is 
whether her uncanny ability will extend to his schedule, too.  If they still 
want to go we'd better make travel plans soon - that Thanksgiving Sunday is 
notoriously difficult to get seats.  If you'd rather wait until Jan. or Feb. 
that's fine with me too.  Just let me know.

Hey Mark, nice to hear from you.  I am glad you enjoyed the wedding.  It went
by so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time.  Apart from a few
travel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular.  Tahiti is a true
paradise.

I am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem is
that my honeymoon has put me firmly in "vacation deficit" at the SEC.
Barring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough days
available by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean.  Amanda has
told me how much fun it is and I want to do it but I may need to find another
time.  I'll check into it and let you guys know definitively very soon.  How
long to you go for?

Keep in mind though that I do not speak for Amanda.  She has an uncanny
ability to arrange her schedule so that she can participate in virtually
every vacation idea that people bring up.

I'll be in touch,  Bill.     

I have no idea since I never read the original - I just thought it was an 
interesting approach to take when making a modification.

Congratulations on your promotion!  Well deserved and long overdue.

I don't think I have any problems with this presentation - but can you give 
me an idea of the proposed audience?

Wow - too many choices.  Let's see, the day of the week charters start and 
end is not fixed - except that the boat has to be available on the days you 
want it.  We usually went Sunday to Sunday so we could get 2 weekends in and 
use the Saturday as a day to fly down.  It's much harder to get there from 
Houston than NYC (fewer flights) so it pretty much takes all day to get 
there.  The 3rd - 8th is a Friday through  Wed. - not optimal from the 
weekend point of view but doable I suppose  - it just means a 4 day instead 
of 7 day charter.  If you want to wait until Thanksgiving we could certainly 
manage with the 2 of us - particularly if we got one of the smaller boats - 
and it might make sense to go back to the BVI where we know the sailing won't 
be all that challenging (I hear the St. Martin area can get rougher).  Plan B 
sounds like fun too - and then we could all go together later (it seems mean 
to go without Bill) - New Years sounds like a blast to me!  What would you 
think about heading down the Friday or Saturday before (12/29 or 30) and 
spending the first week of January there?  That assumes Bill can get that 
week off and Amanda doesn't have to be back in school til later.  I have a 
couple of sailing friends here that might like to go then too if you're 
interested in a slightly larger  group.  They're a lot of fun, good cooks and 
reasonable sailors  too!

Amanda has a break from Nov 3-8th  ( and I don't think she has classes on 
Friday anyway).  Is that something the three of us can work with?  
Alternatively, do you think the two of us could manage over Thanksgiving - 
with amanda joining for the long weekend (fly down Thurs eve and back Mon).  
I can't remember what day of the week charters begin and end. - is it set in 
stone?   Plan B - we could met at the Greenbriar or DC for Thanksgiving.  I 
understand from Amanda that Bill is not going anywhere until 2001.  Of course 
that does make New Year's eve a possibility.  If all else fails, I did hear 
from Greg this week and he wants to know if we are still sailing.   And I am 
still looking for something to do over Christmas.

We were working on Brazil (Andrea Bertone in Sao Paolo was heading it up) but 
I think they have stopped for now.  I'll look for her latest e-mail and 
forward it to you.  The others are all new.  Tana can give you the form of

Mark: 

Implementation of the EOL project in Brazil had been postponed for a while 
because of regulatory matters. The Market Rules were still being discussed 
and had not been approved by ANEEL, making it impossible for us to implement 
EOL, from a regulatory standpoint. Recently (about a couple of weeks ago), 
ANEEL issued Resolution 290/00, approving the Market Rules, subject to 
certain amendments. The amendments will be implemented in stages over the 
course of the next few years. After Resolution 290 was issued and the 
regulatory issues were partially resolved, the EOL team decided to work on 
the project again. I am now in the course of adapting the ETA, GTC and 
Password Application for use in Brazil. I will probably have drafts for 
comments within the next 10 days. I am not sure about the time estimate for 
completion of the project as a whole. I believe Remi can give you a better 
idea of the schedule.

I will forward to you in a separate e-mail the legal opinion that we received 
from outside counsel, addressing the issues in the memo prepared by your 
team. Also, I take the opportunity to let you know that I am leaving Enron by 
the end of August. From September on, the contact people for the EOL project 
will be Remi and Ricardo on the commercial side, and Sami Arap on the legal. 
In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I can be of any further 
assistance.

Andrea

Any progress on the EnronOnline front?  I'm getting questions from the EOL 
team in Houston as to our time estimate to completion and wondered if you had 
heard back from outside counsel.

Attached is the last version of the memorandum from Pinheiro Neto addressing 
the questionnaire prepared by Mark Taylor. I suggest that we all take a look 
at it and identify questions and areas that we would like PN to expand or 
further explain. We could then schedule a conference call to share our 
thoughts and define next steps. I will be out of the office Monday through 
Wednesday next week. Thursday and Friday are holidays in Brazil. Please let 
me know how your schedule looks like from the 26th on so we can schedule 
something. Thanks.

Here is the confirm with my revisions:

Second choice: Another time (I guess in 2001) when everybody can be there.
Third choice: The week of Thanksgiving.
I guess I would prefer not to go for a long weekend because it takes me so 
long to get there, although the Thanksgiving weekend is pretty long & might 
work if nothing else does.

I sent an e-mail to Amanda to sound out her views.  My guess is that she will 
want to go several times.  Her usual response to a choice is to avoid it.

Since lots of things might work, do you have any preferences/choices.  Are 
you committed to an entire week?  Want to shorten it to a long weekend (or is 
the travel to much of a pain for you).I don't think there is any plan that 
will include Bill in 2000.  If we include Amanda, I think it is either Nov 
3-8 or it is Thanksgiving.  We could do a long weekend on either of those 
dates or if you want to take the whole week off, you and I could go for the 
week and Amanda could join us for part of it.  I don't know how much time you 
want to spend on this venture.  Do you want to wait until 2001?  Give me some 
idea what is your first, second, third choice.  And of course you can choose 
more than one ( I am sure Amanda will).

Hey Mark, nice to hear from you.  I am glad you enjoyed the wedding.  It
went
by so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time.  Apart from a
few
travel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular.  Tahiti is a

I am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem is
that my honeymoon has put me firmly in "vacation deficit" at the SEC.
Barring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough days
available by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean.  Amanda has
told me how much fun it is and I want to do it but I may need to find
another
time.  I'll check into it and let you guys know definitively very soon.
How
long to you go for?

Keep in mind though that I do not speak for Amanda.  She has an uncanny
ability to arrange her schedule so that she can participate in virtually
every vacation idea that people bring up.

I'll be in touch,  Bill.

Can you check and make sure Hector Ramirez is still with ECT?

   

I sent Brent an e: mail asking him what the scoop was on how they were 
trading for ECT so we don't create a presence.  His response is below.
Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
01/28/99 01:20 PM
The originators here occasionally come across a counterparty who wants to do 
a financial trade.  They discuss generally what ECT can offer and if the 
customer wants to do a deal they are told to contact Hector Ramirez in 
Houston who actually does the trade directly with the customer.  Neither EI 
Argentina nor any employee from this office should be mentioned in any 
document going to the customer since we are not technically involved in the 
trade.   As a relationship issue our people here are anxious to make sure the 
documentation and confirmation of trades goes smoothly.  There may be a 
finders fee paid by ECT to EI for customers directed to ECT depending on 
various factors which I am not privy to.  I hope this helps.

If you find a decent tickler program let me know.

I have resolved the Consent to Service of Process with CT Corporation and Mr. 
Blaquier and am going to send Mr. Blaquier the originals tonight for 
execution.  I don't know how to handle the check, he suggested dropping it 
off at your office.  I think I'm just going to have him include it back in 
the package to me and then send it on to CT along with their form.  CT will 
then issue a letter to DAPSA reflecting their acceptance of their role.  We 
need to get a copy of the letter that Mr. Blaquier receives, and then we're 
covered.

This will be renewed on an annual basis, with CT directly sending the bill to 
DAPSA.  If they do not receive a renewal check within a month they will 
cancel their agency relationship.  So, somehow, we need to followup on this 
on an annual basis.  Unfortunately, we do not have a tickler system to remind 
us annually to do something.  I'm going to talk to Mary Solomson, they have a 
tickler in Global Contracts and I'm going to see if we can get it added to 
it.  I can see this falling through the cracks.  Any suggestions?

One other thing, at the Legal/Credit meeting we discussed the DAPSA agreement 
and I was quizzed as to who the business people were and they only ones I 
know of are in Argentina, and won't that cause ECT to have a presence in 
Argentina if we transact the trades down there?  How is that going to work?  
Are the trades going to be entered into from Houston?  Can you let me know so 
I can report back.

Much thanks!

 I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle (Credit) and it=
=20
looks like he's going to insist on the CSA.  We are going to talk tomorrow=
=20
and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While =
we=20
have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20
master agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many=
=20
of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have=20
trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be=
=20
helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a=20
mark-up.

Following are my points responsive to their revisions:

Part 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the=
=20
possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for=20
example, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy=
=20
this agreement would be in default).

(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk=
=20
to the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=
=20
reason to remove it.

Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells=
=20
out exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar=
e=20
not acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=
=20
agree we will put it in the agreement.

Part 4 (f)  By deleting the word "not" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=
t=20
payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=
t=20
(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=
=20
make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=
ne=20
payment).  This is not acceptable.

(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=
NA.

Part 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20
receive payments due even though technically in default under another=20
provision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20
possible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=
=20
honored.

(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=
=20
city.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=
ot=20
impossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20

(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=
t=20
have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=
=20
as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20
practice.

(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=
o=20
multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=
=20
IBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=
=20
trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=
=20
will never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like=
=20
to restrict ourselves that way.

(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If=
=20
there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu=
t=20
wholesale deletion is out of the question.

(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while=
=20
maintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency=
=20
with which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is=
=20
important to us.

(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha=
t=20
went into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. =
=20
We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o=
ur=20
revision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe=
r=20
high rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate i=
s=20
more appropriate.

(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20
protects us both.

(n)  You know more about this than I.

Part 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20
individually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisio=
ns=20
are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a=
=20
significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)=
=20
and we need to know now if they object to any of them.

Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  =
I=20
hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discus=
s=20
any of these issues at greater length if you want.  It sounds to me like=20
IBJ's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given th=

volume and nature of their comments.

I am not concerned about the issues below because a) is no longer a feature 
of the game and b) we are only showing a small portion of the flags, and this 
seems to be fairly academic.

Please let me know if you feel these are issues that need to be addressed.

thanks
Dave

Dear All

Two issues/questions have been brought to my attention.  These relate to the
demo of the game I was sent a while back (i.e. a "Five Flags Down Under"
demo) and may therefore have been superceded (or the impact lessened) by
events.

a)  Under the "edit groups" section in the demo contetstants are told  "want
to have your own private Unamed Contest for friends, colleagues or
co-workers?  you can! it is simply a matter of choosing a group name,
entering a group password and telling your fellow contestants to go to this
page to join etc"

I assume that since fellow group members need to register, the "friends,
colleagues and co-workers" are all actually employees of Enron customers
anyway i.e. they can register in their own right if they want to?  Is this
the case?  If it is the case, perhaps it should be made a bit clearer that
an employee of an Enron customer can't  include friends who don't work for
Enron customers in their group.

b) Our Intellectual Property department have  "flagged" (excuse the pun!)
the issue of using national flags in a commercial setting.  Use of the UK
flag wouldn't seem to create problems - there is no copyright in the flag
because it is over 200 years old and it is widely used on, for example,
T-shirts as decoration.  However, they believe that there might be issues
associated with using the US flag -  this flag doesn't, for example,
routinely appear as a decoration on T-shirts etc.

Is this something that has already been thought of and dismissed in the US?

We believe that, in practice, national governments might not take action to
prevent the use of their flags in/on commercial products, as long as the use
is in good taste.  In addition, we believe that copyright provisions in
flags are normally only enforceable within those particular countries.
Flags are usually restricted under international copyright law from being
registered as trade marks, but consent can be obtained to waive these
restrictions, so there is a possibility that particular national flags could
be registered trade marks.

Given the particular circumstances of the game i.e. the flags are being used
in "good taste", for a limited audience, for a limited time,  and Enron is
presumably not seeking to obtain an unfair advantage from using the
reputation of the flags, problems do not seem particularly likely.   My
sense is tha,t if the use of flags is thought a "non-issue" in the US, then
it is probably even more of a "non-issue"/less of an issue  in Europe, but
if you would like me to take this further/check with the various EU
jurisdictions, please let me know?

Thanks

Rachel

Good catch.  NY law should apply throughout the Americas and in Japan.  We 
used UK law in Europe and Singapore on the theory the counterparties there 
would be more comfortable with Uk law.  I'm not sure which the Australians 
would prefer.  What do you think of the following:

On the Legal & Privacy Statement Page on the new website you have the 
following clause:

Could you please let me know if this holds for countries such as Mexico and

The legislation continues to move ahead.  The current schedule seeks to have 
the bill completed in the House next week and voted on the floor the week of 
the 18th.  That leaves two weeks for the Senate to act before a recess around 
October 6.  We have been working hard to push the House Commerce Committee 
version of the bill which exempts all physical commodities (other than ags) 
traded bilaterally or through an electronic trading facility from most CFTC 
jurisdiction.

Negotiations between the SEC and CFTC on single stock futures are ongoing.  
That issue represents the largest open area for resolution but both the 
participants and Congress are optimistic that it can be worked out.  We need 
to continue to work hard to persuade the members to follow the Commerce 
Committee approach.  We will keep you apprised.

Hi guys,

Louise was concerned that CommodityLogic might not have borrowed the latest 
edition of EOL documents for use on the CommodityLogic website.  Could I 
please ask you two to ensure that we are using the latest legal stuff.  I am 
not sure who actually holds the definitive copy of the latest EOL legal 
docs...

Thanks very much,

Tom

What happened to Brazil? Did Intel or Yahoo buy it?

From the 180 degree change in market sentiment we had today you
would think that Brazil was taken over by an Internet stock.
The Intel split announcement and the Yahoo announcement of it's
takeover of GeoCities energized the market and revitalized the
tech sector. Brazil was hardly even mentioned in the days news
after they reported on the maturity date changes before the
market opened.

On top of the blooming optimism at the open Alan Greenspan
actually blessed the Internet sector during a testimony in
Washington. He said basically that he thought investors were
viewing Internet stocks as "lottery ticket" plays were the
odds were much better. He pointed out that analysis of future
earnings and growth was actually culling the good plays from
the bad ones. He said that historically investors often buy
on faith companies that they anticipate to do well before any
actual earnings exist and the Internet sector is no different.

When you consider that there are 68,000 new Internet surfers
coming online every day it just makes sense that the only
five year old Internet will continue to grow at an exponential
rate. With that user growth the leaders will quickly amass
larger audiences while the smaller less efficient providers
will either fall by the wayside or be taken over. Free enterprise
is a wonderful thing and tends to continually prune itself of
excesses and reward hard work and innovation. Enough preaching
but did you know that of the 31 analysts that follow AOL, 28
either recommend a buy or strong buy, even at these prices!!

The Nasdaq was the clear winner again today, setting a new
closing high. The leaders were the four horsemen, MSFT +5.38,
INTC +4.44, DELL +5.38, CSCO +5.44. Most of the Internets
were up double digits again and show no signs of stopping.
I would remind you that Internets have been weak on Fridays
of late as traders take profits from the week.

The Dow was led today by the same stocks that took it down
yesterday. JPM +4.31, C +1.69, T +4.63, MO +2.25, GE +1.94.

Contrary to news hype the Dow traded in exactly the same range
as it traded yesterday only without the end of day drop.
The 9250-9300 range only provided a positive day today due
to the -70 drop at the close yesterday. The market did not
"get well" over night. It just recovered from the spike
caused by two sell programs at the close. Check out a chart!

I really hate to keep coming back to this but the advance/decline
ratio only barely broke even today. The NYSE adv/decl 1552/1423
was only positive by 129 and the Nasdaq 2067/1933 was positive
by 134. This is definitely not a major move and not a major
reversal of the down trend. This could be the start of a new
uptrend but the proof is in Friday's numbers.

I got some hate mail for being somewhat cautious (bearish) in
last nights commentary. When the market had fallen from a +90
high to only +30 at 2:30 this afternoon I was really worried
that the caution was justified and it looked like we could
close negative for the day. I don't feel like a word of
caution after a bad day is particularly bearish but until
Brazil resolves it's problems I believe it bears watching.
When your life savings is invested in the market it is sheer
stupidity not to watch anything that can cause problems. You
would not ignore a rattlesnake in your closet just because
you can't see it today. Eventually it will come out and
probably when you least expect it.

Friday is a wildcard. Futures are up +2.00 and it looks
bullet proof but I know Murphy's law is alive and well.
About the only thing you can count on for tomorrow is more
volatility. It would not surprise me to see techs suffer
from profit taking. Whenever a stock is up double digits
for the week it is a prime candidate.

Good Luck

Jim Brown

A positive showing from the equity market has firmed the

favorable economic data, and a stock split from AOL and
Intel.  After advancing and closing into record territory, we
have turned Bullish across the Retail.  We caution investors,
however, that the current rally has been driven by a few
blue-chip companies and that several key industry sectors are
still trading at or below their 50-day moving averages including
Banking, Insurance, Airlines and Oil & Gas.

Market Sentiment - By Pinnacle Capital Advisors
******************************************************
Percent Bearish Below 30%

According to Investors Intelligence readings, the percentage of
those who are bearish is now only 28.2%.  Investors Intelligence
publishes the percentage of newsletter writers who are "Bullish"
or "bearish" on a weekly basis.  When pessimism evaporates, the
market may be nearly a correction. This is significant because
such a low number of bears suggests that much of the available
capital is ALREADY invested and very little remains to fuel
additional market advances.

Just by way of benchmark, the percent of "bears" back on July 17,
1998 clocked in at 23.3% - just days before the start of a major
sell-off.

Other sentiment indicators are still flashing BEARISH
overtones over the near-term so we advise subscribers to
tightly protect their long positions.

PICKS WE DROPPED
****************
When we drop a pick it doesn't mean we are recommending a sell
on that play. Many dropped picks go on to be very profitable.
We drop a pick because something happened to change its
profile. News, price, direction, etc. We drop it because we
don't want anyone else starting a new play at that time.
We have hundreds of new readers with each issue who are
unfamiliar with the previous history for that pick and we
want them to look at any current pick as a valid play.

PICK NEWS - CALLS
*******************************************************
EMC $106.88 +5.06 (+8.38) EMC set a new high today and closed
near the high.  The positive press just continues to roll in.
There was an article by The Motely Fool yesterday that is worth
reading if you trade EMC.  Some of the highlights of the
article are that EMC's market share in the data storage market
has grown from 28% to 32% while IBM's has decreased from 24% to
20%.  The Internet and E-commerce should continue to drive
EMC's sales, as 8 of the 10 largest Internet service providers
already use EMC storage systems.  Also in the news today,
Gruntal & Co. started coverage on EMC with a buy rating.

ORCL $53.69 +2.69 (+3.81) ORCL set a new high today, and closed
slightly below its old high.  In the news, ORCL's Japanese
subsidiary priced it initial public offering today.  It is
expected to be one of Japan's hottest IPOs in many months.
Like many US IPOs, it is expected to soar on the day of its
debut.  ORCL's ownership in the company will fall from 91% to
85% after the public offering.  The other news item that is
probably helping ORCL a little is Informix, the No. 5 maker of
database software, announced better than expected earnings.
(which is likely to raise expectations for ORCL).

UTX $116.94 +1.06 (+2.38) UTX set a new 52 week high at $118.75
after the open on Wednesday, and has traded down since then.
As we have said on numerous occasions, with the lack of news,
UTX will mirror the Dow.  In fact, if you look at its daily
chart from today you will see what we mean.  UTX took a dip
shortly after noon and recovered towards the close.  We haven't
had any news on UTX, but the Street did like the announcement
last week about UTX deciding to sell its underperforming
automotive unit.

MU $75.13 +3.63 (+4.63) Micron was off slightly yesterday, but
today it gapped up at the open and kept on going.  We said on
Tuesday that while Micron's current quarter ends in February,
and earnings won't be released until sometime in March, the
stock will react to any news on other chip stocks in the
meantime.  Most of the sector is in the middle of earnings
releases.  A 2-for-1 stock split by chip sector leader Intel
can only be positive for the other chip stocks.  Look for MU
to continue moving higher in sympathy.

NOKA $152.75 +7.50 (+8.19) Nokia saw a nice jump in its stock
price today ahead of tomorrow morning's earnings report. If
you sold this afternoon, you locked in your profits and you
can jump back in tomorrow if the numbers look good and/or
they announce a split.  Those who held over should note that
earnings will be reported before the NYSE opening bell, so the
stock will gap up or down accordingly.  Rival Ericsson just
reported strong earnings and received an upgrade.  Nokia has
been looking even stronger than Ericsson in recent months, so
we are hoping for big news in the morning.

WMT $85.44 +.25 (+3.44) The King of retailers is back to its
old ways--a slow but steady climb in price, which is why we
picked them up again. WMT is sitting just below the intra-day
high it set on Tuesday of $85.94, which is it's only resistance.
WMT had a 389,000 share block trade Wednesday at $84.00. This
is both a momentum play and a split candidate (which we would
expect with earnings).

BBY $90.44 +1.81 (+11.19) Best Buy keeps powering ever higher,
today setting a new intra-day high of $91.94. BBY seems to have
found a successful retail formula, and they sell what consumers
want most these days: technology products. Everything is
increasing for this company: total number of stores, same store
sales, market share, profit margins, and stock price. Higher
selling and administrative costs also showed up on their last
quarterly report, but they were part of an effort to improve
performance and increase volume. The only thing that declined
was their interest expense, and that is very positive. Sales
for most of the holiday period will show up in the current
quarter, so there is probably still good news yet to come.

DELL Computer $94.19 +5.69 (+11.19)  We often note that
volume is critical to sustained price moves, and bemoan
Dell a bit on its lighter volume.  Fortunately, trading
volume swelled yesterday and today to 23 million and 21
million shares, respectively; average is 17.5 million.
Dell traded flat yesterday, but was up $5.69 today to a new
all-time high.  There is still room to run as Dell blasted
through resistance with no immediate end in site.  Protect
your profits with stops and confirm direction first before
playing. Earnings are scheduled after the close, February
16.

CSCO - Cisco Systems $108.88 +5.48 (+6.07)  Cisco was
wholloped yesterday into the $103 range, but made it all
back, and then some, today on strong volume.  NASDAQ is on
a tear with CSCO as the 3rd highest weighted stock in the
NASDAQ 100.  Market willing, expect further advances into
earnings.  CSCO is also a split candidate with enough
shares authorized to announce a 3:2 split along with
earnings scheduled for release on February 2.  The run has
begun.  Dips are buyable.  Confirm upward movement first
and use stops to protect your profits.

AOL - America Online $174.75 +9.25 (+34.27)  Same league as
Microsoft.  AOL announced $0.17 earnings yesterday, $0.03
better than estimates, and a 2:1 stock split (effective
February 22).  Volume swelled to almost 20 million shares,
both yesterday and today, sending AOL into orbit.  Buying
pressure is still on as AOL closed at a new all-time high.
Resistance is weak at $176, its all-time trading high set
today just before the close.  AOL's new target price is
$210 and now occupies a top 10 position in the Fidelity
Magellan Fund.  With so much profit built in, remember to
use stops.  Dips are buyable.  Market permitting, the sky
is the limit.

WCOM - MCIWorldCom $79.88 +2.31 (+5.00)  Here we are again;
WCOM just can't seem to break resistance at $80.  Market
willing, it looks like we'll get another chance to crack it
tomorrow.  Wait for penetration of $80 with strong volume
before making a play.  Still benefiting from Supreme Court
ruling against the Baby Bells, WCOM is rumored to soon be
announcing the start of a new consumer Internet service,
different from UUNET, its business ISP.  In its acquisition
of MCI, WCOM was required to shed its consumer ISP
division, Cable and Wireless, in order to gain Federal
approval for the merger.  Dips are buyable, but wait for a
clear reversal.

MSFT - Microsoft $174.00 +5.38 (+17.75)  A nice surprise,
MSFT still wants to run following it's stellar earnings and
Monday's 2:1 split announcement (effective 3/26),
contingent upon shareholder approval.  We expected a
pullback, but not as small as the one we got.  After losing
less than $3 yesterday, MSFT closed today at a new all-time
high, just $0.06 off its highest trade on 53% higher than
average volume -- extremely bullish.  If the market
continues up, MSFT will too since they are the largest
component of the NASDAQ 100.  As always, confirm market
direction first [don't forget to use stops]

DH - Dayton Hudson $63.06 +0.06 (+3.12)  Slow and steady;
that's the way the parent company of Target Stores moves.
Volume was a little light today -- only 1.3 million shares
traded.  Yesterday, DH gave us a nice $2+ pop on 2 million
shares (2 million average).  70,000 shares traded at the
close yesterday at a price of $63, lending some support at
this price.  No news this week.  Look for small rises to
continue if the market cooperates.  1189 institutions own
89.5% of the 395 million shares in float leaving about 40
million shares in daily float to trade.  Translation:  not
many sellers; extra volume will tend to goose the price.
Dips are buyable on a reversal.  DH is a more conservative
play.

ANF $73.00 -0.75 (+3.25)  After the $4.19 run it made on
Monday and Tuesday, ANF was due for some profit taking.
Wednesday, it lost $0.19 to humor us.  Thursday, ANF
teeter-tottered back and forth between green and red for most
of the day but then finally decided to finish negative.
ANF seems to be consolidating before resuming its course.
Just to be sure, wait for ANF to show upward movement again
before initiating new positions.

SEPR $111.75 +9.50 (+12.25)  Geez, when we initiated coverage
of this pharmaceutical company on Tuesday, we planned on
seeing the stock gradually increase.  Instead, the stock
pleasantly surprised us by spiking up +$11.25 during Thursday
trading.  It even broke above the new 12 month price target
of $112 set by BancBoston Robertson just last Friday.  However,
it couldn't hold on and finished the day at $111.75.  The
uphill spurt may in part be due to news of improved sales of
Eli Lilly's depression drug named Prozac.  Lilly and Sepracor
are currently working on an improved version of Prozac (which
loses its patent protection sometime after 2001).  Set your
stop losses tight to prepare for any subsequent profit taking.

Mark, I would like to attend an ENA orientation put on by the Development 
Center on the morning of Oct. 4 (that's the Wednesday before the Woodlands 
conference -- it doesn't conflict with the conference, but it would conflict 
with our bi-weekly swaps group meeting that week).

The orientation is simply an introduction to the various ENA departments 
(trading, origination, structured finance, etc.) and how they interact.  It 
sounds very basic but I think it would be very helpful to me -- especially in 
the Chinese wall context.  

I don't know whether there will be a charge to the department for this, but I 
can find out if you want.  Please let me know your thoughts -- thanks, Bob

manipulation that might affect our trading and marketing activities.

The two hour training sessions will be  held at the Doubletree, in the 
Dezavala Room on the second floor at the listed times.   Please feel free to

Here's the signed letter from BP..... unfortunately she has signed the North

You have received a new fax from 02075797778

The image contains 4 page(s).

Just FYI, I think the EnronOnline decision was to leave the User ID off of 
the Password Application as a security measure.  The User ID is sent 
separately (I think in a security envelope) so that the User ID and password 
are never written down in the same place.  And of course the system requires 
that the password be changed the first time the new user logs on so the Enron 
file copy of the PA won't give access to a user's valid password.

Tom:

The EOL Password Application form used to develop the CommodityLogic Password 
Application, except as set forth below, is identical to the latest version of 
the EOL available on the EOL website (N.A. Version 2, June 9, 2000). Mark 
also gave me a hard copy of the current EOL Application to compare.

The only difference is that Todd or Leslie, I believe, added a section for a 
"Required Initial User ID" number right above the "Required Initial Password" 
section. I do not know if we need the User ID Section any more. Todd, could 
you check with the EOL folks (Dale Neuner/Frank Davis) to determine the 
answer, and revert back so we can make a final decision for CL. Thanks.

Finally, attached is a revised version of the Password Application for CL 
that changes the reference at the bottom to "CommodityLogic LLC"  to "Enron 
Networks LLC" as CL is not yet a legal entity.  Tom, have any decisions been 
made with respect to that issue?

Hi guys,

Louise was concerned that CommodityLogic might not have borrowed the latest 
edition of EOL documents for use on the CommodityLogic website.  Could I 
please ask you two to ensure that we are using the latest legal stuff.  I am 
not sure who actually holds the definitive copy of the latest EOL legal 
docs...

Thanks very much,

Tom

Thanks for your note.  It looks to me like the schedule breaks down as 
follows:

Possible Date: October 12 - 15
My Reaction: I will be speaking at a conference in Sedona, AZ (not known for 
its great sailing)

Possible Date: November 3 - 8
My Reaction: I have another speaking engagement in NYC right after that 
(makes it sub-optimal for me) plus Bill can't go

Possible Date: Thanksgiving
My Reaction: You guys can't make it

Possible Date: New Years (travel Sat. 12/30, pick up boat 12/31, back in the 
office Mon. 1/8/01)
My Reaction: Everybody can go - and since Monday is a holiday only 4 vacation 
days used for a full week of sailing - Perfect in every way (if we can get 
flights and a boat - I haven't checked this yet)

Possible Date: Later in 2001
My Reaction: Works for me but I hate to put it off so long

So my preference is to try for New Years and fall back on early November as a 
second choice.  If you want to go for less than a week now and a full week in 
2001 when Bill can go we can do that, too.  What are you guys thinking?  
Since we won't be going at Thanksgiving, how are you going to talk your mom 
into dealing with the holiday?

Mark

*******************************************************

SUNW $109.31 +3.88 (+11.31) SUNW is having an incredible week.
On Monday and Tuesday it jumped $8.62.  Profit taking and
weakened markets set Sun back only -$1.19 on Wednesday.  On
Thursday, SUN heated up again and added $3.88 to finish just
off its high for the day.  Merrill Lynch raised its price
target to $130 and maintained its buy rating on the company.
In the news recently, Sun Microsystems, Lucent, Cisco, and
Network Associates have joined forces to form the Security
Research Alliance.  This Alliance will be committed to
helping organizations increase the security of their
desktops and networks.   Look for SUNW to head higher if
the markets can stay the color of money.

VIA.B $85.00 +2.13 (+2.44)  After profit taking took its toll
on the stock on Tuesday, VIA.B turned it right around.  It has
steam rolled ahead another +$2.88 since Wednesday.  Some more
articles have surfaced on the topic of VIA.B's earnings due
on February 25th.  The consensus seems to be that they will
be better than last year's loss of 29 cents a share.  One of
SG Cowen & Co's analysts thinks they could come in at +0.16
a share.  Some of Viacom's productions have been popular with
viewers.  The movie "Varsity Blues" and the TV programs
"Becker" and "Dilbert" are all getting nice ratings.  Watch
for VIA.B to keep up its forward progress.

WAG $60.25 +1.13 (+1.81)  WAG took advantage of the volatility
in the markets on Thursday and added +$1.31.  Walgreen's is
looking good and if the markets can positive, look for WAG's
uptrend to continue.  It is splitting it's stock 2:1 on
Feb. 12th.

LXK $110.31 +1.00 (+11.06) LXK continues to be a strong
performer.  A gain of $1.00 today in a good market is one
thing, but a gain of $1.13 on Wednesday was very impressive.
For the last three trading days LXK has reached an intraday
high.  The new high is now $111.88.  We still see a stock
split in LXK's future, but at this time a probable date is
not known.  Most likely an announcement would come as a
result of a special board of directors meeting.  We'll keep
you updated.

VOD $197.63 +4.00 (+10.25) VOD had a great day on Thursday.
For the 4th time in 5 days, VOD closed at its high of the
day.  The merger between ATI and VOD is still a go and to
insure the tax-free status of the merger, ATI has filed for
a private-letter ruling.  This is a ruling the IRS gives
ATI to insure the tax-free status of the merger.  Both
companies feel that even if a private letter ruling isn't
given in the positive, they can achieve the status they
desire.  This issue has been part of the cause for the
discrepancy of the offer and the current prices.

XIRC $45.00 +1.13 (+3.00) XIRC continues to move upward.  One
bullish sign on Thursday was the push and hold above the
prior high of $44.50.  We are in new high territory and see
no reason, other than profit taking, that should keep this
stock from heading higher.  No recent news on XIRC, but
the stock has outperformed the communications industry at
a nice margin over the last couple of weeks.  XIRC's PE
ratio is also lower than the industry average.

SNC $40.25 +.69 (+2.50) SNC continued to rise today, reaching
an intraday high of $40.63.  SNC is still $12 below its 52-
week high.  With a PE ratio below the industry average, SNC
still has room to move toward prior highs.  Earnings are in
a few weeks and, market permitting, should see an earnings
run.  The last 7 earning surprises have been: 4,9,11,6,15,33,
and 14%.

XLNX $83.50 +3.69 (+5.32) XLNX has been on a yo-yo the last
week or so.  The bottom line is that XLNX is yo-yoing its way
up.  On Wednesday, XLNX fell just under $3, but came back
strong with a gain of $3.69 on Thursday.  Even with all the
day up and day down movement, XLNX is still up over $5 on the
week.  With the stock split not until March, we are likely
to see times of consolidation.  This most likely occur when
the NASDAQ itself decides to rest.  Watch for pullbacks.
XLNX's CEO did state that the past quarter earnings did exceed
expectations.  This should lead to a nice continued uptrend.

products to the food service industry. The company's products
are sold in over 90 countries in addition to the United States.

CLX has been on a nice roll since its earnings announcement

above prior resistance at the $117.  CLX today announced that
it's buyout and merger with First Brands has been approved by
First Brands shareholders and will officially take place on
Friday the 29th.  This news went over well with CLX investors
as CLX traded as high as $124.38.  Profit taking could take
place on Friday, but pullbacks could be nice buying
opportunities.

The major news dealing with CLX of late has been the earnings
announcement and the merger with First Brands.  CLX also
announced recently a $.36 dividend.  CLX is a large company

CVC - Cablevision Systems Corp. $70.50 +2.63 (+7.62 for the week)

Like its name suggests, Cablevision Systems Corporation is a
cable company.  It has approximately three million subscribers
concentrated mostly in the northeast.  Through its subsidiary
Rainbow Media Holdings, CVC owns cable channels like American
Movie Classics, Bravo, and the Independent Film Channel.  It
also owns 60% of Regional Programming Partners and 80% of
Madison square Garden, the New York Knicks, and the New York

Cablevision is a steady mover.  Since mid-December it has

up +$7.62 this week alone and has shown strength under the
recent rocky and stable market conditions alike.  On Monday
Jan 25th, Merrill Lynch raised its price target for the stock
to $85 a share which should only help the stock.  Earnings
reports are due for the company on February 18th.  We are
looking for Cablevision Systems to continue its well

COMBINATION PLAYS
*****************************************************
The Bull's continue to run...

Stocks moved lower Wednesday as nervous investors braced for the
testimony on the economy by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan. The main
focus of the Thursday meeting could be the current high level of
stock prices. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 124
points at at 9,200. Technology stocks, the stalwart group in many
recent sessions despite softer prices in most other sectors of the
market, also faded and this despite a good morning session put in
by the Internet issues. The performance of the broader market has
also been a sore spot among market technicians for quite some time
and Wednesday's poor showing only added fuel to those concerns.

Our Tuesday plays were a raucious group. MSFT opened higher with
most of the technology stocks but eventually it fell back and just
a little patience allowed traders to achieve the suggested credit
of $1.50 for the (MAR155P/160P) bull-put spread. DELL was also
higher in the morning and some of you had to wait until a few
minutes after 10 AM for the correct entry price of $0.81 on the
MAR65P/70P credit spread. XRX was stable most of the day and the
the calendar position (MAR120C/FEB120C) was available more than
once at $2.87 debit and the lowest I saw was $2.75. IBM was the
big mover and although we expected a pull-back, $7 was a bit much.
We started the play (MAR175C/185C debit spread) with a reduced
entry price of $5.50 but by the end of the day the spread was down
to $4.50 so we decided to double-up, reducing our overall position
to a nice round number. Those of you playing the spread could
easily better our position, but that doesn't mean it won't fall
further tomorrow. Eventually, we think IBM will make the split run
to the $180-$190 range...Lets hope so!

BGP appears destined to fall well short of our long position in
February. After this week, we will no longer track the calendar
spread and just be thankful that the debit spread had a positive
outcome. SRCM continued lower but did not reach our target exit.
The goal is still $1.00 for the FEB15P but with time running out,
we make take the small profit soon. The JMED straddle started to
show some activity the last few days. Any continued downward
movement may help us exit the bearish side of the play shortly.

Thursday, January 28

U.S. stocks rallied Thursday as Internet mania propelled the tech
issues. Two mergers AOL's positive earnings helped the market move
higher. Yahoo!'s planned purchase of GeoCities and Intel's stock
split drove investors to a buying frenzy in the technology arena.
The incredible performance by the technology sector lifted broad
market averages to hearty gains in the process. The DJIA ended up
81 points at 9281.33. But the Nasdaq composite index was again the
story of the day, rising 70 points to a record 2477.33. Observers
continued to express concern over the deficient breadth of the
market's advance of late, but most weren't ready to turn outright
negative on U.S. shares and Greenspan may have put the icing on
the cake when he said that Internet stocks, despite their high
valuations, might have their place in the bull market.

AOL, CTXS, DELL, EMC and SEPR were our big movers and even IBM
finished positive. LVLT is now approaching the exit target but
SRCM continued to hang-on with today's rally. Stocks that are
approaching downside limits include RDRT and SCUR. We will keep
a close eye on these plays. Shares of Centocor climbed past $44
after the company said fourth-quarter profit rose to 14 cents a
share before charges, exceeding the average estimate of analysts.
For those of you interested in the butterfly roll-out, today's
move allowed an easy exit from the bullish part of the spread;
APR35C/45C for a credit of $3.50. Now the plan would require the
stock price to fall enough so that the APR45C/40C can be bought
for less than $2.62 (the current cost basis). Butterfly spreads
are an excellent neutral strategy and they have more flexibility
than a straddle.

INTC - Intel $137.19     *** More Splits ***

INTC designs, manufactures and markets microcomputer components
and related products at various levels of integration. INTC's
principal components consist of silicon-based semiconductors
etched with complex patterns of transistors. With about 85% of
the microprocessor market, Intel is definitely inside. Its chips
have been providing the brains for IBM-compatible PCs since 1981.
The company also makes computer flash memory; microcontrollers;
and networking, communications, and graphics products. Intel
continues to expand and upgrade its products and facilities to
maintain its dominance over rival chip makers such as Cyrix and
Advanced Micro Devices.

Intel is the most recent of several high tech companies that have
announced stock splits this month, including Microsoft, IBM, Sun
Microsystems, eBay and Yahoo. In a move widely anticipated by
financial analysts, they announced a 2-for-1 stock split to make
shares more affordable to investors. The split takes effect 4/11
and that gives us plenty of time for the stock to recover from
any short-term pullback. There should be a dip in tomorrow's
trading to help you improve the opening position.

DST Systems provides information processing services and computer

Janus Capital and T. Rowe Price Corp. DST's Emerging Business unit
consists of Argus Health Systems (prescription claims processing)

In 1998 DST, Boston EquiServe, and First Chicago Trust teamed up
to form EquiServe, a provider of corporate stock transfers, the
largest company of its kind in the US. The company has operations
worldwide and about 16% of its sales are outside the US.

WLP - Wellpoint Health Network  $72.62     *** Technicals Only ***

WellPoint Health Networks, the #2 health insurer in California
serves about 30 million members nationally through HMOs, PPOs, and
specialty networks such as dental and mental health plans. The
company operates as Blue Cross of California in its home state,
where some two-thirds of its medical care members reside, and as
UNICARE elsewhere. WellPoint also sells life insurance through
subsidiary WellPoint Life Insurance and workers' compensation
services through subsidiary UNICARE Financial. The company is a
care contractor for Medi-Cal, California's Medicaid program, and
provides third-party administration for self-insured companies.

With most losses accounted for in earlier quarters and a clear
sense of costs, HMOs are expected to post fourth quarter gains
in line with Wall Street's expectations. However, even with an
extremely positive report,(Wellpoint is expected to report an 18%
jump in earnings) the recent chart history reflects a somewhat
disappointing outlook. We think it will easily finish below the
sold strike in February.

simulation and modeling technologies.

On Wednesday, they reported favorable quarterly earnings, a very

I have just received the letter SFA promised us.  SFA have accepted our 
argument that our proprietary bond and equity trading can be carried on in 
London through an unregulated UK entity.  The letter also states that SFA 
will not be applying their consolidated capital supervision rules to the 
unregulated entity, which they have the discretion to do.

From a regulatory perspective this means we can move ahead at full speed to 
set up an appropriate Chinese Wall and then begin trading.

I thought I might try to sum up.  It seems to me that we both need to 
finalize the structure as well as co-ordinate across various groups such that 
we all know what each is doing with the view to funding on time by the end of 
next week.

1. As soon as possible next week (i.e. Monday) we need to finalize the swap 
structure including the credit and covenant package.

2. If there is not already a Term Sheet in place, it may be useful to have 
one prepared.  Frankly, it seems from my various discussions with Global 
Finance, Credit, Origination, Enron Corp., Royal Bank of Canada and its 
external counsel and our external counsel, that there are certain agreements, 
documents, deliverables and covenants that are being expected by, or 
exchanged between, the parties, but which are not being communicated among 
each other and we are therefore working at cross purposes.  Frankly, unless 
and until we know what the structure is to look like, what the credit and 
financial covenants are to look like, and what the documentation expectations 
are, it is difficult if not  impossible to prepare documentation.  For 
example:

 (a) I had a confusing conversation with the Bank as to the form of Guarantee 
they were expecting from Enron Corp.  I was trying to require the Bank to 
accept an Enron Corp. standard form Guarantee, whereas the Bank was looking 
for a long form Guarantee that includes the covenants, representations and 
warranties of Enron Corp. in its revolving credit facilities.  Based upon 
this disagreement, I left a message for Clement to the effect that we may 
have a problem to resolve.  However, Clement was kind enough to advise me by 
voice mail that in fact Enron Corp. does not have a problem with giving a 
long form Guarantee of this nature and that the form of Guarantee had in fact 
been provided (by whom I'm not sure) to the Bank.

 (b) The Bank was enquiring as to what would be the governing law of the 
Enron Corp. Guarantee, to which I advised it would be Texas law.  However, I 
now understand there may be some agreement (by whom I'm not sure) to have the 
Enron Corp. Guarantee governed by New York law.

 (c) In any event, I understand that the Bank will be looking for a form of 
enforceability opinion from Enron Corp.'s outside legal counsel with respect 
to the authorization, execution, delivery and enforceability of the Enron 
Corp. Guarantee, as well as certain conflicts of laws opinions with respect 
to the governing law of the Guarantee (Texas/New York) being enforceable.

 (d) In my discussions with the Bank this afternoon, it also became aware to 
me that the Bank is expecting external counsel legal opinions with respect to 
Enron Canada.  Blake, Cassels & Graydon is prepared to provide those legal 
opinions.

 (e) As noted above, I have discussed with the Bank that the governing law of 
the underlying swap documents would be Alberta, to which they seemed fine.  I 
suggested that Ontario law would also be acceptable.

 (f) I assume that Enron Canada ought to obtain legal opinions from the 
Bank's external counsel with respect to the documents and obligations of 
Swapco (and perhaps even the Bank), but I will need to have this confirmed.

 (g) It came to my attention during my conversations with the Bank this 
afternoon that Swapco (or financing SPV) is unaffiliated to the Bank.  This 
presents problems as, I understand for accounting purposes, the two swaps 
involving Enron Canada cannot be linked, for example by cross-defaults.  At 
the same time unaffiliated exposures under de-linked transactions may not be 
capable of being set-off.  We undertook to attempt to remedy this situation 
through broadening the set-off concepts under the ISDA Master Agreements.

 (h) I do not think the Bank frankly (nor anyone else) has a firm grasp on 
the credit/collateralization/margin requirements, which I think is dependent 
upon a final understanding of the swap structure.

 (i) From my discussions with the Bank, it seemed to me that they were not 
clear as to how their fees and costs would be repaid through the swap 
structure.  Although it might be as simple as adding these amounts to the 
principal amount of the swaps, I suggested that the Bank prepare a separate 
"fee letter" to recover its fees.  More problematically, the Bank was not 
clear as to how "increased costs" would be accounted for in the swap 
structure.  Generally speaking, a Bank credit agreement contains provisions 
that if there are increased costs of funding to the Bank as a result of a 
change in Bank regulations or lending or reserve requirements, those 
increased costs are flowed through.  They were not sure how this could be 
accommodated in a swap structure.  I suggested that there may be some way to 
fix this through a price adjustment mechanism in the fixed price or volumes 
or through a separate indemnification in the "fee letter".

 (j) The Bank is anxious to see paper, and I am not sure who is preparing the 
paper and consolidating it in a distribution package to the Bank.  For 
example, I think a package that includes all of the swap Master Agreements 
and related documentation (which I believe Mark T's group will prepare in 
Houston), the Enron Corp. Guarantee (which I've indicated above seems to have 
already been provided in draft to the Bank) and all other documentation needs 
to be sent to the Bank as soon as possible, as well as to Blake, Cassels & 
Graydon and Vinson and Elkins if they are to be giving legal opinions to the 
Bank in connection with the transaction.  Of course this depends on 
finalization of the structure as well as the credit and other covenants 
package.  In concept, I have told the Bank, and I believe the Bank agrees, 
that the form of the ISDA Master and related documentation would be the same 
as the form of ISDA Master which currently exists between ENA and Royal Bank 
of Canada, and the Bank asked that they at least be provided with that paper 
as soon as possible.  Perhaps Tana could look after delivering that as soon 
as possible, if not this afternoon, Monday morning.

Frankly, I think this project, if it is to get funded on time, needs a 
measure of co-ordination and communication of internal and external 
expectations.  It may be worthwhile to convene a conference call with all 
relevant groups (i.e. Legal/Global Finance/Credit/Origination) on Monday 
morning.

Peter

I have read about the Super Maramu 2000 and note from your website that you 
have a location on the Mediterranean in France.  I will be in Southern France 
September 23 through 25.  Would it be possible to visit you in Hyeres during 
that time?  Is an appointment necessary?

Since I will be leaving tomorrow, it might make sense to put reviewing this 
towards the top of your list so I can approve it in the computer before I 
leave.

 We received approval from Lavorato to do this transaction. Please check the  
attached confirm. I have removed the language which required COO approval and 
also changed the option premium to $150,000 from $140,000.  Also Pride signed 
the ISDA and faxed over the signature page. How do we or can we  assign a 
date to the ISDA for the confirm?
Thanks for you help!

SOME RECENT EMAILS
***************************************************************

First of all let me say that you have the best advisory service
I have ever seen, bar none.  You truly have an UNCANNY knack for
picking winning options.  About 8 of 10 of my recent plays have
been very profitable.  Of particular note, selling puts on the
bank stocks early one day netted about 400-500% gain on a trade
I closed out THE SAME DAY!  Thanks K.W.
*****

Just wanted you to know that the special update tonight is
appreciated and provides good insight. After a while one gets 
tired of the TV commentaries regarding disaster..disaster..disaster.
Thanks - Allan B.
*****

I seldom burst into print, but I feel the need to congratulate
you on an excellent newsletter supplemented often with very
welcome alerts.

I have been a subscriber for several months. I couldn't do
without your market views and the excellent background
information you give us on stock picks. Your humor is also a
great relief when the so-called experts have a different slant
or warning every time the slightest change occurs in the economy
or politics.

With very best wishes, Jack W.

I know ya'll must take a ton of grief daily, but I really
appreciate the job that you do.  You, alone, have tripled my
portfolio in my two week trial period.  Thanks for your insight!

you a line to tell you how much i appreciate your insight into
the market. you do an excellent job at trying to find good
trends in a volatile climate. don't get discouraged over the
last few days. it is hard to find value in a market that
probably needs to catch its breath. i really look forward to
your next letter. good luck!
very truly yours, dan

Hello Jim,

I still love the newsletter.  After not following my plan a
few times due to lack of discipline, my account suffered.
But now, I have been winning the "discipline battle" the
last 6 trades and my account is at an all-time high.
Thanks. Trey
*****

Jim, Thank you for your news letter.  I have always traded options,
but never with the confidence and success that I have since I
subscribed.  I have turned $5,000.00 into over $42,500.00 in three
weeks!  AOL and CSCO have been great. Keep up the great work.

Sincerely, Andrew

You guys are the best. No only do you help us make some bucks

Jim,  this is the first email I have sent to any newsletter and

some gains for the first time ever. Thanks for the good work. Kumar

I just wanted to let you know you have done a great job for me.

Once again, I just want to say how much I enjoy the newsletter.
You and your team do an outstanding job. I also subscribe to
other newsletters such as McMillan's "Option Strategist", so I
appreciate quality when I see it. Your newsletter is first rate!

Thanks, David
*****

Your newsletter is the best I have ever received.  Over the
past two years I have spent hundreds of dollars on newsletters.
This is by far the best and the only one I have made money from.
I am so excited about your newsletter that I am telling lots of
friends.  I also think you give conservative advise that I
appreciate.  I am very conservative and it has taken me two
years to realize that I could do options.  With your help I have
already been successful in one week!  We own lots of Dell stock
but the options are even more fun to watch go up.  I also follow
WLA, GPS, and CSCO very closely.  We also own those stocks.
Options make a lot of sense to me when I'm familiar with the
stocks and know how they act.  I guess earnings season is also
a very good time to own options.  I am nervous about doing
options after the earnings season.   Claudia
*****

The Option Investor has been an enormous help in my budding
trading career.  In fact, it is the first source of information
I've bought (and I've spent thousands on books, workshops, and
other website subscriptions)where I can demonstrate a direct
and nearly immediate link between the information and actual
financial success in trading.

More importantly than this perhaps is your forthright statement
about the importance of what I would call maintaining the
integrity of the relationship between you and your customers.
You are clearly a "straight shooter", and this is as apparent
in the no nonsense approach you are taking to the website
cheating problem as it is in the advice you provide in the
newsletter. Bruce
*****

I cannot tell you how much I support you in your actions.
The people who abuse the system are not only taking advantage
of you, but of all of us who are willing to pay the VERY
reasonable amount for what we get.  The return on my investment
has been several hundred times over the amount I give you
and personally I thank you for taking these steps.

Thank you, Lloyd

Jim: I want to thank you and compliment your service.  Please
feel free to post my unsolicited remarks below as a reference
to your Newsletter Service.
     Thanks for the followup on the Japan market sentiment.
It's great to know that when there is a big market event you
are on top of things for us.  I subscribed a few weeks ago and
want to say that I am most satisfied with the newsletter.
     I was experienced with stocks and options before I subscribed,
but I was kind of "trading in the dark," with a lack of self-
confidence in my strategies.  Now with the newsletter, I found
that I was pursuing the right strategies but didn't have the
confidence and trading skills to perform good executions.  The
confidence gained through the Option Investor Newsletter and the
time saved in searching for opportunities (great opportunity plays
already summarized by the newsletter) has helped me focus on "better
execution."  My results have improved dramatically.  Since early
June when I started the two-week-trial, my option brokerage account
net worth has increase from $20,000 to $70,000 today.  I also
believe that I am trading a lot smarter, actually incurring much
less risk than before.

Thanks, Tony
*****

Dear James: I would like to take a moment to thank you for the
job that you and the Option Investor staff do.  I am sure we
(subscribers) don't know half of what you guys must contend
with day in and day out to get the newletter to us.  However,
do know that you are appreciated.

    I must readily admit that I am totally addicted.  I look
forward to Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday nights.  I am like a
child at Christmas time.  When I first subscribed to your
newsletter I was somewhat unfamiliar with your format and
recommendations.   I would pick half hazardly and not plan my
execution strategy.  However, as I sat back and analyzed your
picks, paper traded for sometime, I then started actual trading.
I went from a negative portfolio to a positive within 3 weeks,
all the credit going to you guys!  I am still attempting to
concur the art of letting the profits run (I still tend to get
out a little too quick), but I am better at stopping out when
the trade hasn't gone as expected.

    Keep up the good work and I look forward to a long lasting
relationship.

Thank you, Darrel
*****

Jim:
    I just had to write you to tell you that during my first
two week free trial, your information made me $2,000 from a
$2,000 investment! Needless to say, I subscribed and since then
the website has made me an additional $2,500. All of this in less
than 30 days! I have been to Wade's WIN site free for a week
and your information is much easier to understand and use. I
haven't been this excited in years! Your site has literally
changed my life!
Steve
*****

I am just a lame rookie with options, but I profited nicely
($15K) in one week with one trade per your news letter, and it
was not from an Internet stock! I would have profited greater
from another transaction if I would have heeded "pigs get fat ,
hogs get slaughtered". I have more of your suggested options in
the works and am cautiously looking for similar returns! Thanks
for the great information. cb

HI, I have to tell you that "WE LOVE YOU GUYS"  Our life revolves
around Sun., Tue., and Thur. Thoughts, comments.  I know you work
hard to get the information out and you do a great job.

Thanks for everything,

Hello Jim, Thanks so much for the valuable information!

I have been trading stocks for many years, the last year I dug
myself an incredible hole, by investing in small caps.

I just started trading options with the encouragement, help and
guidance of your newsletter. I was able to recapture my 30 K loss
in three weeks!  and my Schwab account is back in  positive territory!

This is incredible! I am comfortable now with option trading,
using the stop loss and diversification principle coupled with
good research your suggested 'method'  works!

Thanks for the advise on the books too!   V.R.
*****

I got my first issue of your FREE two week trial and I can only
say... I AM EXCITED!!!!!

I took your Sunday recommendations and decided to find out the
results if one were to simply follow your suggestions without any
analysis of their own...

As of Wednesday... over 63% of your calls were in positive
territory with an overall gain of about 80%...
IN 2 DAYS....OUTSTANDING!!!!

This really excites me because I have some extensive knowledge in
technical analysis, so when I filter your recommendations with the
charts, I should come up with about as close as "SURE THING" trades
as I will probably ever get! :)

Thanks for the research and the recommendations... keep it up!

David G. - NEW subscriber :)

Dear Jim, Your trading rules saved me last week.  I've traded
options for years but my success has been twarted by not knowing
when to get out, staying too long, getting greedy, hoping it would
go back up, etc.

Well, a trade went the wrong way last week and normally I would have
hung on but you say so often, "If it goes down, sell it" that it
must have finally sunk in.  Though it was down by 5 for the day,
I got out with only losing the previous day's gain thanks to "The
Rules".

I love your site and newsletter. Thanks again.  BB
*****

Dear Jim:

Yours is the best I have seen bar none.  I just signed up last
week after my free trial.  I find your letter friendly and chatty,
but not condescending, as some others I won't mention.  And not
too technical!  Without trying to impress, you have done so.

Thanks so much for COF, and CSCO, both of which returned excellent
results for me.  I can't show you a new Jaguar yet, but I think you
will make me much richer. Don H.
*****

Dear Sirs, I've been VERY impressed with your service!  You do
excellent stock and market evaluations.  Your suggested plays are
obviously predominantly on target.  Your tutoring and explanations
of your thinking behind your suggestions are so clear and well
expressed ...AND APPRECIATED.
NOTHING else I've come across has helped me more in learning how
to go about trading options!  And you've helped me fine tune my
approach to stocks as well.

Thanks and keep up the good work!   Ann
*****

Hey!

Nice call on Cisco! I bought is at 2.75 as you suggested and
sold yesterday at 5 each, for a nice total return of about 80%.

Thanks!   Nelson
*****

Please charge my credit card for a quarterly subscription.
Thanks. I was about to give up on options having lost over
$3000 on my own. With your trial I was able to make that back.

Cordially, John

Jim and Crew:

I found your site by bouncing around the Internet and have been
impressed with the results you folks get. Much to my wonder here
was a special alert on Tuesday that just blew me away!
When I saw that the email was sent at 4am. I was super impressed.
Your crew had been at this all night!
I played your recommendations (bought 10 of everything -- no not
really) and made money while having a really great time.

I have tried many of the other services that are out there for
option traders BUT NO ONE has the results, refreshing commentary,
and right-on picks that your team does.

I am pleased to tell you that I am now and dues paying subscriber
and happy to be in your hands -- please keep up the good work.

Dear Sir,

Thank you for your email and for your interest. We do have a location in
HySres, in southern France, with a Super Maramu 2000 available for
inspection and sail trials. If you want, you can make a visit of the boat
or even test her at sea on Monday, 25th September. Please tell us how many
people will come with you and confirm whether you wish a detailed visit of
the Super Maramu 2000 or if you want to spend a whole day sailing aboard.

Looking forward to hearing from you,

Best regards,

Renaud BARATHON

Mark, how are you? Thanks again for taking the time to meet with us last 
week. While I am preparing information to send to you I thought you might 
like to know that yesterday I played golf with Bernie Purta of the NYMEX. He 
indicated to me that he is still a loyal employee of the NYMEX.

If you have any questions please let me know. 

regards,

Steve:

I have now heard back from both Louise and Andy and neither one will be 
available.  Unfortunately, Mark has now left again and I am on my way out on 
vacation for a couple of weeks.  It might make sense for you to contact Mark 
directly since you will be able to get to him before I can.

Sorry about that.

Mark

Mark, 

Just wanted to mention to you that if either Louise Kitchens, Andy Zipper or 
Mark Haedicke are interested in participating in the Energy Bar program but 
is not yet in a position to make a firm commitment, we can list the speaker 
as "invited" for the first mailing and then make any corrections that are 
necessary on a subsequent mailing that will be distributed.? Of course, the 
Bar Association would not list a speaker as "invited" without prior 
authorization.? Would it be possible to get back to me today on an 
EnronOnline speaker?? Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule 
to provide assistance.

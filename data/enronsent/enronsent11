I am happy to sign but I'm not technically in the ESA chain anymore.  My 
understanding is that Britaldo has assumed this role.  If it will expedite 
things and Ben will accept my signatrure then I can sign. I don't want to 
step on anyone's toes.

Well, it alerts people that we are coming UNLESS we change the name of our 
company (which gives us some protection)

Robert, how long would it take to change the name of Enron Brazil Power 
Holdings XII to say, "Holdings XII"?  Theresa, would that be much effort to 
change our name in our brokerage account?

If it does not take too long, lets change it.  And before we send out  this 
notice, please letJoe and I know the day that is going to be sent (ie, after 
we get the DASH signed etc).

Joe--I have more info coming your way pursuant to your voicemail.

After talking with Bruce about the filing that is required under Rule 144, he 
suggested that I remind you of this requirement as well.  This filing is made 
with the SEC and any exchange over which the shares are traded and is 
available to the public.  It must be filed concurrently with our sell order 
to our broker.  Among other things, the filing identifies, the seller, the 
issuer, the broker, and the number of shares to be sold.  I have gone back 
and confirmed that if we wait the full two years (ie, June 24, 2001), we do 
not have to make this filing.

This fine for me.

     as before we have converted the capital markets rate to a monthly pay
     actual/360 basis for comparison purposes.

     Capital markets spreads have narrowed since our last discussion and
     are now 125-130 over the ten-year.

     Thanks again for the project update and pls call me with any questions

Plz see a summary of the actions items from today's conf call as well as the 
updated version of the decision tree incorporating todays discussions:

Base case will continue to be obtaining project financing and retaining the 
PPA w/ furnas.  However, all parties agree on strategy of acting to keep our 
options open and to this end we will continue to pursue the required steps to 
maintain the default claim against Furnas.  The language for the termination 
letter will be circulated next week and is due to be officially delivered to 
Furnas on the 21st of December.
Owners will be meeting in Cuiaba during the beginning of January to revisit 
PPA and budget strategy and to implement process of monitoring budget on a 
monthly basis.

Plz advise if there are any questions...

What is the date of the law referening the Furnas right to contract for=20
energy and does it apply to their ability to contract for long term capacit=
y=20
without a bid?

Dear John,

We have discussed the issues raised in the conference call today with our=
=20
Litigation Department and we have come to the following conclusions:

In order to assure that EPE will not loose its right to terminate the PPA, =
we=20
suggest EPE to adopt one of the following solutions:

(i) send to Furnas the alternative letter, which says that, although the cu=
re=20
period is already over, EPE, based on the progress on the issues related to=
=20
the lender consent, extends the 90-day cure period by another 30 days; or

(ii) send to Furnas the Notice of Intent to Terminate tomorrow and, after t=
he=20
30-day consultation period, extend such consultation period by another 30=
=20
days.

We believe that EPE should not send the Notice of Intent to Terminate witho=
ut=20
extending either the cure or the consultation period, for the PPA and the=
=20
Brazilian legislation are not clear about the possibility of EPE to exercis=
e=20
its right to terminate the PPA after the 30-day consultation period.

Note that both solutions will only postpone the proceeding, for EPE will ha=
ve=20
to decide whether it intends to terminate the PPA or not.

On the other hand, we believe that there will be no termination process=20
without arbitration, as Furnas and Eletrobr?s have already denied the=20
occurrence of a "causa de inadimplemento" under the PPA.

Regarding the possibility for EPE to start the whole process again, based o=
n=20
the same "causa de inadimplemento", we believe that this proceeding would b=
e=20
very fragile and could be challenged by Furnas and Eletrobr?s. As a result,=
=20
we do not suggest you to adopt this alternative.

Finally, according to section 24 (XXII) of Federal Law No. 8,666/93, Furnas=
=20
may contract the supplying of electric energy without a previous bidding=20
process.

Pedro and Claudia-This letter is fine . As an alternative, I would like you
to prepare another letter today that extends the 90 day period of
inadimplemento by another 30 days. the tone of the letter should be " based
on the progress we have seen toward resolution of the issues related to the
lender consent we hereby agree to extend the period of inadimplemento
another 30 days to give the parties and opportunity to resolve these
matters prior to deliver of the notice of intent to terminate" . I would
like you to have this letter ready by  5p.m , today if possible so I can
clear it onmy global task list call tonite. Andreia -please contact Claudia
today and ask her to please try to comply with this request and ask her to
participate in today's global task list call for the first few minutes

Attached is a revised draft notice, which became more of a warning than a
notice, and which also was corrected as suggested by Guido Renno.

The PPA does not contain a provision stating the delay in enforcing a right
should not be deemed a waiver of that right.  But also, it does not require
that the notice of intent to terminate be served right after the 90-day
cure period.  Therefore, we can wait to send the actual notice of intent to
terminate.

A remark:  the cure period is of 90 days and not 120.  It expires in the
next couple of days if not already.  I am not sure what strength this
warning could have, maybe not much more than a threat.  I understand that
starting the termination process is a very serious step, with a lot of
implications, and I fully respect the decision of just sending the warning.
I would only ask whether this task would not be better achieved by informal
contacts rather than a formal letter.

A small correction:  notices may be served by courts or by notaries, but
that is not required by law unless in specific circumstances.  The PPA does
not provide for any formal notification procedure, and thus there would be
no need to do it by courts or notaries.

If you need to discuss any point on this document during Tuesday or
Wednesday, please look for Cl?udia Bonelli, as I will be out of town.
Again, the full text of the notice is pasted into this e-mail, in case you
have any problem opening the attached MS Word file.

Pedro

Rob,

Regarding items 1 and 2, please contact Lucio Reis in Sao Paulo office and he 
can explain.

Item 3 is incorrect. The 300 MW would be generated by the two gas turbines at 
about 100 MW each and the remaining 100 MW coming from the steam turbine. The 
steam turbine receives its energy from the exit gases from the gas turbines 
and they both contribute equally to the resulting steam turbine output 
(theoretically at least, in practice depending on optimization of machines)

Again, please talk with Lucio.

Regards,

Christiaan

Rob G Gay@ENRON

Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning:

1) We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for 300 MW on oil to 
meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve 
margin.  We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above 
220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?)

2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full 
time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the 
transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring. [ Please 
describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal 
detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how 
long this will take.  I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the 
corrective measures.]

3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate 
220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if 
dipatched above 220 MW.

If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they 
are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas 
is ready by April 01.  We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue 
Garvin flex months.

Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition 
about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem 
is cleared.  If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced 
fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or 
seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our 
availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.  
Any data you can provide will be helpful.

Have I successfully connected the dots here?

If you have previously sent these materials to Felipe or Tracee please simply 
grumble to yourself if you have to do an extra e-mail to me.  Remember, you 
don't have to be nice to a short timer unless you need them to get something 
done.

Regards,

Rob
 

Luis,

It may be important to substantiate officially Furnas' need to show 300MW 
available even if constrained.  Is there a way to demonstarte that from 
public records?

Secondly.  can you provide the technical description of the system 
constraints and what is involved in overcoming them.  For instance does a new 
transmission line have to be built or new transformer installed? How long 
would it take to obtain these or other items and correct the problem?

Rob:
Until now  FURNAS has not agreed to pay for the oil for 300MW. If ONS 
dispatch the power plant for 300MW we do not have reinburshment for the 
amount above 150 MW. We are asking and discussing with ANEEL to receive oil 
on combined cycle and when the power plant produces using two gas turbines at 
the same time. They asked for some data and they will be doing the analysis 
and giving the answers at beginning of the new year. About if there is any 
documents about this subject, the answer is no.

Second point: Under the FURNAS's point of view these constrains in the 
transmission system is good for both ( FURNAS and EPE ) because from the 
EPE's side we receive all invoice (  available capacity ), and even if the 
plant is in the merit order, it will  not be dispatched because these 
constrains. So in this case we do not consume oil more than 150 MW and FURNAS 
will not be exposed in the spot market because they will be "constrain off" 
in this market and will receive from the MAE by all this energy not 
dispatched .

attached are my comments on the dash

Blanca What is this all about.  The timing here is really bad for all of 
these folks, many are on vacation

It's getting pricey, especially on the fee side.  But what are the options at 
this point. Peter informs me that we  have been limited on talking to banks 
which pretty much dilutes our leverage.  I also think that the person doing 
the negotiating has no accountability to her clients.  I think you should 
scream bloody murder (perhaps to the new bosses of the region) This is going 
to be a huge drain on the P&L.

What are your thoughts?

Brett
Brett,
Below please find confirmation of what we verbally spoke of a few minutes ago 
relating to the pricing of this facility:

Underwriting Fees:  50bp on each bank's allocated underwritten commitment 
amount of the Tranche A amount of $430.75MM in total  
Spread:        18 bp facility fee irregardless of usage on the entire Tranche 
A facility size
                        82 bp Applicable margin on any borrowed amounts of 
the Tranche A facility

Up Front fees to the Syndicate banks:  expected to be in the 35bp - 45bp 
range at final syndication.

Did you forget me?

I will be in the Global Finance PRC all day tomorrow so can you present 
Guille in the ESA Directors/ GM PRC?

Thanks for the Book. I think I will enjoy it immensely in retirement. Merry 
Christmas and best of luck to you in the new year and the new job.

Regards,

Rob

This will be fine

For once I remembered.   Hope you have a good one and all is going well.  It 
was nice to see ya'll at Christmas.  Tell Terry that Mom and Laurie loved the 
trunks.  I was quite happy with the A&M cardholder as well so let Jason and 
Erin know for me.  Too bad the Aggie lost that wild one in Shreveport (could 
you believe that snow).  Conrats again on your appointment to the board of 
the KofC.  Hope 2001 is a superb year for you.

Rob

Hi Jamie,

Tried to call you today to keep in touch but the phone just rang. Hope you 
are enjoying Indosuez.  I have announced that I am leaving Enron at the end 
of February when my contract runs out.  With them getting out of 
international infrastructure it is time to move on.  I am going to retire for 
a while and see how the life of leisure suits me.   Give me a call when you 
have a minute (713-646-7582).

Regards,

Rob 

Hi guys,

To keep you au fait with my latest adventures, I decided to leave Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson as a result of I what I perceived to be increasing 
uncertainty
on the investment bank's future in the context of its' failed merger(s). So I
have now joined Credit Agricole Indosuez's project finance group here in 
London.
Not quite the outfit of a DrKB but a strong franchise in project finance and a
very talented, motivated team...plus I missed project finance!

My details are now:
Tel. (44) 20 7971 4029
Mob. (44) 7712 76 4343
e-mail: jamie.mabilat@indosuez.co.uk

Hope all is well with y'all. Keep in touch.

Jamie.

Rob,

Happy New Year!

How have you been doing? Last time when I talked to Blanca after the latest 
reorg, she said that it hadn't been announced how Southern Cone was going to 
be. How's it going now?

After nearly 3 years with Enron, I plan to go back to B school. I want to 
apply for Rice Executive MBA because this will be the most efficient way for 
me. Besides, I plan to apply two other full-time MBA programs. You have been 
my supervisor for one year. Although that was my first year with Enron, that 
assignment was quite important to me. I've learned a lot through that year 
and later I realize more and more the creativeness and greatness of the Debt 
Fund. The year with Debt Fund was an important phase of my professional 
history. May I ask you to be one of my evaluators? As you know, the 
competition for B school is always hard. A strong recommendation from you, a 
person in senior management will be crucial for my application. The deadline 
for Rice is Jan. 15. I'm sorry to give you such a short time. With the other 
two, I plan to finish them by the end of January or early Feburary. I 
appreciate it very much if you could spare me some time.

Thank you in advance for your generous help.

Regards,

Maggie

Why?

Tracee Bersani@ECT
01/05/2001 10:24 AM
Rob,

I just spoke with Rafael, and he has requested that certain assets be 
excluded from pledge items against the Cuiaba senior loans (EPE and GASMAT).

 All cars and vehicles;
 All furniture and IT equipment,
 All telephone lines 

(Please note that for EPE, the amounts related to those items is around 0.7% 
of the total permanent assets and for GASMAT is around 0.4%.)

 Inventories except spare parts ( 38% of the total inventories).  

(So, we should take out, fuel ( 55% of the total inventories), and  other 
items that are around 7% of the total inventories).

Regards,
Tracee

Jose, I think the supplemental info you have provided is outstanding and 
helpful to the lenders in understanding the overall picture and the history.  
However, its focus is not the central concern of the lenders at this point as 
I understand it.  The lenders and their counsel are concerned specifically 
about third party liability meaning, I believe, lawsuits or claims from 
parties who did not receive power because Cuiaba failed to generate.  
Therefore, I think the questions which Tozzinni needs to address are along 
the lines of:

1) If EPE is required to sign the agreements by ANEEl, What is the extent of 
damages that could be claimed in the context of such agreements?

2) Could any consequential damages be assessed?

3) Could EPE excuse itself from the legal proceedings on the basis of the bid 
documents, the PPA or other agreements with Furnas, Electronote or Eletrabras?

4) How would the economic equilibrium process work in the case of a judgement 
which was payable by EPE?  Could the process be expedited to avert a 
liquidity crisis?

5) Could EPE be denied access to the grid as a result of failure to cover a 
spot market price assessed by the MAE stemming from an unscheduled outage?  

6) Similarly, could EPE incur penalties or be denied transmission if they 
failed to contribute in accordance with the shared liability provisions of 
the agreements?

7) Will we need to sign the agreements for other reasons (such as access to 
back-up power) which would be excluded from the protections by Furnas under 
the PPA?

9) Could Furnas deny or delay reimbursement if the amount is not recoverable 
by them or while they are awaiting word on a claims recoverability?

10) A question for insurance - Does our Business Interuption insurance 
protect us in any of these instances?  (Note: the US$20MM Sponsor liquidity 
facility provides some comfort to the lenders)

John, stop me if you think I am off track.  If you have other questions which 
you think need to be addressed please continue .... 

Sorry, I've been in all day meetings Mon & Tues.  I'll get to it early 
tomorrow.

Randy,  Attached is a screen print from the Sitara audit report.  Are you the "rgay" who changed this price from $2.22 to $2.20 on deal 1021469?  I'm working on the Reliant Energy Services netout for September production and I'm getting a credit for them on this deal because of this price change.  Can you tell if it's valid?  If it is, I'll give them the credit.  If it's not, can you change the price back so this credit will go away?

Thanks
 
Tracy

He is interested in the technology track or the analyst program. Is there anyone you could introduce him to? I believe he specified this in his objectives on his resume. Thanks so much for your help! Why are you at work? I thought Enron shut down?????

Ask him to look at Enron job postings to see if there is anything he is interested in.
I will see what I can do.

Here is Cal's resume. We would appreciate any help you could give him. He is available to come by and meet anyone you would think appropriate in the intern process.

Are you going to take care of this?

Tracy,
Joe Darensbourg called me today asking about some invoices he received from Adaytum for Contributor Administrator and Advanced Analyst training that I am scheduled to take.  I told him that I had already expensed and sent a check to Adaytum for these two classes.
He, Joe, called me later to ask if I had coded this training to one of the Adaytum projects, namely an O&M project.  I told him I did not.  He said he would send me an email with the project(s) number(s).  I haven't received it as yet.
Lee wants to be sure that you are aware of this since we don't have any way of monitoring what is coming from Adaytum direct to Enron.
Thanks,
Pat

Pat,

Thanks for letting me know about the Adaytum invoice issue that Joe Darensbourg contacted you about.  I have not been involved in any of the invoicing with Adaytum, Tracy Geaccone is handling that for ETS. 

Would you please e-mail Tracy and let her know the particulars of this issue.   I assume Joe has taken care of it, but I would like to keep her in the loop on any cost or invoice issues.

After reviewing the budget yesterday, we noticed that goodwill was still being amortized in 2002.  We need to take that out of your numbers.  Jim and Kiri thought it was approximately $14 million.  Thus, PGG should have an IBIT of $270.  Please revise file and send back to me and copy Steve Schwarzbach thanks.

Tracy

Hi Tracy,

Please see attached for the Plan that Stan Horton will be looking at tomorrow
morning.  This version includes Intercompany interest expense that was not
previously budgeted.  It also has a more detail break-out of capital
expenditures.

For the O&M detail pages, we will not be able to give you the same break-out
for our cost as you have requested.  Our GL is build on FERC accounts and is
not condusive to SAP type sorting.

Also, note that all O&M are at this point still straight lined for the year. 
The quarterly shaping of earnings will not be available until mid to late
November.  There will be significant swing between quarters from these results
to the final one.

Let me know if you have any questions.

fyi

The attached spreadsheet shows the quarterly reclasses between O&M and COGS for Transwestern for the year 2000.  As we discussed, we are very supportive of making this 2000 reclass in order to avoid having to explain large year to year variances caused only by the re-mapping. It will also conform Enron's reporting to TW's stand-alone GAAP reporting for 2000.  Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks for helping us make this happen.

okey with me

Tracy,

I spoke with Fred and we have a resource available to assists with the remaining ETS modeling and development.  Dymetrix can be here this Wednesday and will be dedicated to ETS through the end of the year.  He will be responsible for the completion of the O&M model for home office.  He will also be responsible for the Marketing initiative.  

I spoke to Ben Humann about Omaha's resource needs.  They will require a resource for two weeks starting November 12th to implement the O&M contributor model.  If they should decide to move forward with development of a full financial system, they will require an additional six weeks of time at a minimum.  We will scope their financial system requirements during the initial two weeks to better determine what the actual recourse requirements will be.

As we discussed this morning I will be dedicated to ETS through the end of January.  I will address the remain issues with Operations.  I address data transfer issues between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse.  I will assist with and manage all of the above initiatives.

Please feel free to contact me if you have and questions or concerns.

Thanks
Hoang Vo

Here are the answers to questions 1, 2, & 4:

1.  What percent of TW's volumes transported during the 3rd Qtr 2000 and 3rd Qtr 2001 was firm
     vs. interruptible?

		   	       	            2000 			            2001
  				July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
IT Percentage			.09	.09	.09	 	.10	.08	.07
Firm Percentage		.91	.91	.91		.90	.92	.93

2.  What percent of TW's pipe capacity was used during  3rd Qtr 2000 and 3rd Qtr 2001? 
 
		   			2000 			            2001
West flow information		July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
Percentage flow vs. capacity	.90	.95	.97 	 	 100	 100	 .91

		   			2000 			            2001
East flow information		July	Aug	Sept		July	Aug	Sept
Percentage flow vs. capacity	.81	.85	.86	 	 100	 100	 .91

4.    On James Weitekamp's "ETS Selected Financial and Operating Highlights" schedule, transport 
      volumes are shown as being higher for 3rd Qtr 2001 as compared to 1st Qtr 2001.  This doesn't 
      really make sense considering 1st Qtr is a peak time and 3rd Qtr is not.  Why does this difference
      exist?
 
     July and August are peak times for TW.  However, during the 3rd quarter volumes flowing 
     East to West decreased due to pricing.  Volumes significantly increased from East to East because 
     pricing was better, increasing total throughput for the 3rd quarter.

Mark:

Can you please reply to the 4 questions per attached sheet.  Tony Jackson needs the answers by noon today.  Thanks.

Aurora

I would prefer the morning, but I am available in the afternoon.  ( I have a halloween party for the kids later)

I would like to have a meeting on October 31st (maybe later if that date won't work), either in the AM or the PM, but probably about 3 hours or so.    I would like to discuss organizations and how we are going to provide the support the EGS organization requires both at Stan's level and at each level in the organization.    I would also like to discuss the top 3-5 concerns you have for your business and your people.   You should decide if there are people in your organization that are needed to discuss basic functions of Planning, Accounting, Finance and Tax and feel free to include them in this process, but I would like to keep the group to Director level or above.    Please let Kathy know who they are.    I would like to know if you are available or have a preference for morning or afternoon.

Thanks.

Could we have a telephone call and discuss what our slides should look like for this presentation.  I assume we will try to make the presentation for the respective pipelines look similar -  as much as possible.  Let me know when you are available.   I have time today from 1:00 to 2:00 and about 4:30.  Tomorrow I am free most of the day. [Geaccone, Tracy]    I am working with Rod on this one.  LEts try Thursday afternoon? 

I also would like to know if our timeline has changed  -( 9/22 with Stan and 11/8 with Mr. Lay) [Geaccone, Tracy]  Do you mean 10/22.  I will put something out on this this afternoon. 

Lastly, is there an expectation for the Quarter Forecast?  Right now, NNG Commercial is showing a September upside as well as an October upside.  We plan to offset all but $500,000 in the November / December time frame.   While we would be up for the period from Sept-Dec by the $500,000, we would be down for the fourth quarter. [Geaccone, Tracy]    Are you sure you are ready to commit to this.  Can you make it up? 

Thanks

Please make sure your numbers go through me or Stan before we give them to Corp. Corp's request for these things should be coming through me in the future.   Rod and I are meeting with Stan on Monday, October 22.  We would like to discuss your 4th Q numbers then if possible.

Let me know.

Thanks

Tracy

Mark,

In response to your voicemail this morning, this is EGAS 4th Qtr per the 2nd CE.  It has been adjusted to pull out the items that have been transferred out of EGAS since the 2nd CE  ( Azurix International and South America Merchant ) and the transfer in of European Assets and the Middle East.   This does NOT include EPower which I understand will be transferred from Europe to EGAS in the 4th Qtr.   We are currently working on our 3rd CE and will send you those numbers when we are done.

Sommers  << File: EGAS4thqtr.xls >> 

I will be out of town.  Thanks for the invite.

Rod and Tracy,

I'm confirming who's planning to attend the Nutcracker Market Brunch on Friday, Nov. 9.

Attached are the latest revised Corporate Assessments for 2002.  There have been some minor changes but the major update is to the Click at Home program.  Remember that the Click at Home program assesses actual dollars so the numbers included in the spreadsheet are estimates for planning purposes.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

The 2002 Plan Review with Stan for Wessex will be from 8:30-11:00 in EB 5029 on Wednesday, October 3.

Thanks

Tracy

Congratulations.  Well deserved!!!!

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.
 
David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

I love you.

Where do we need to go for EREC?  It is better to fly commercial over and then take the Enron plane around when we get there?  Is this date ok with Adam?

Good morning, Tracy!   

Stan wants us to look at the week of May 6, 2002, to travel to Europe and meet with Colin's team(s) and Adam's team(s).   See if we can hit all the necessary sites within that one week time span.

I'll await to hear back from you.

Tracy, 

Do I need to turn in anything to Corporate for the plan presentation, due Oct 18?

Are there any cash issues surrounding this?  If so, who is going to handle?

FYI.    Is there any disagreement?

Stan,  I wanted to update you on the status of our efforts to implement trading activities and what steps remain.

Accomplished:
Trade system implemented (Caminus system)
Training completed for traders and support personnel
Trade Policy and limits approved
Financial / Risk controls in place thorugh Finance (Jerry Peters, Dan Fancler)
Brokerage contracts executed (Paribas, ABN Amro)
Trade strategies have been reviewed

Remaining:
Fund brokerage contracts with $500,000 margin requirement (we are paid 95% of the 30 day T-bill rates on the account)

We are working with Rod and his group as we continue to get this part of our business up to speed.  As we discussed with you before, both Dave and I have the accountability for the rewards to outweigh the risks for this buisiness component and fully expect this to contribute to our earnings objectives.  If you have any more questions about the commercial business plans please let me know and we'll get something set up, otherwise we'll fund the brokerage accounts and continue with our efforts.

Thanks,

Kent

Rod mentioned to me last week that we would only review Wessex on Wednesday.  Do we need to schedule something for the rest of Azurix?

Thanks

Tracy

Can we discuss?  Wha about next the first of next week?

The project can not be justified, if you have the capital cost of the pigging facilities.  On a stand alone basis without the pigging facilities we can justify the project.

James

Have you had a chance to run this?  If not, when do you think you will?

Thanks

Tracy,

Have you made any progress on the economic analysis?

Thanks,

John

Tracy,

10,000 MMBTU/D of incremental capacity from LaPlata to Gallup.

This is the working assumption from our initial conference call.  Like the +/- 30% cost figures below, it may vary with further evaluation, but I suggest it be used for this initial analysis.

Thanks,

John

How much additional capacity/volumes will I get?

Tracy,

Below are the rough cost estimates to apply drag reducing agent to the LaPlata to Bloomfield line.

	Facility modifications			$1,665,000

	Cleaning & application			   $165,000

	Re-application every 6 months		   $165,000

The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.

For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.  The re-application time period is also uncertain.  You may want to look at the economics of re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.

Please let me know of anything else you need.

Thanks,

John

It is actually $45 million.  I would need I revised 3rd CE and also reflect the change in the cash flow forecast.  I am sorry I did not get back to you sooner on this.
 
Tracy

Do you still need a revision of the 3rd current estimate? If so, should we update it for September actuals? Or should we revise the 3rd ce for the 43 mill revenue deferral to 2002 only, and report September actuals in the October monthly cash flow forecast? Let me know what you need, thanks.

The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

Actually, just the Corp planning requests.  Thanks.

Tracy,
Do you want all corp request to come thru to you?  We get many requests that are not earnings related from Corp Development, RAC, investors relations, etc.?  I can also just copy you on schedules that I'm sending out.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Thank you.  Stan and Rod are looking to me to coordinate all these new companies we picked up.  Its easier to track if it all comes through one place.

Okay.

I didn't send Mark anything new as the number I gave him came from our 2nd CE with adjustments for the things transferred in and out of EGAS.  

Agatha and I will coordinate with you in the future.

Sommers 

Please make sure your numbers go through me or Stan before we give them to Corp. Corp's request for these things should be coming through me in the future.   Rod and I are meeting with Stan on Monday, October 22.  We would like to discuss your 4th Q numbers then if possible.

Let me know.

Thanks

Sommers  << File: EGAS4thqtr.xls >> 

What are the Goodwill and FAS 133 adj?

Thanks, Tracy. The reclass turned out to be 43.3 mill, which is what I adjusted 3rd ce for. Is this the only adjustment you want us to make? We have a couple of other large items (goodwill, FAS 133), maybe at this point we should just include them in the current cash flow forecast. Let me know, thanks.

Stan needs to see before we turn into Corp. or Wholesale.  Lets wait before we turn into Corp.  What is the last number turned into Corp for the 4 Q?  We really need to run Corp planning requests through Rod and myself to make sure we have Stan's okey.  I would hate for him to be surprised.  Thanks.

We are turning into Corp today, (3CE), (34.9).  This is a variance of (8.3) to what you have below.

NEPCO = (8.5) - due to project profit adjustments on LS Power/Kendall, IL, Cogentrix/Jenks, OK, and E.Coast Power/Linden, NJ.
EEOS =      .2 - Puerto Rico 2.0, Bonus accrual (1.0), and misc. other (.8).

FYI,  We are currently looking at the NEPCO projects to see if they require further writedowns.

Are we reporting the 4Q through EGS and not Wholesale?  Please let me know.

I think you are right.  I will change the number.  Thanks

Tracy-

I will see if we have any updates, although I doubt we would change the number from last we met.  I believe the presentation of the numbers has caused some confusion.  We are forecasting a (5.2) recurring loss, plus a (13.8) loss on Marlin, totaling (19.0) loss.  I think you added the 19 and the 5.2 to get to the 24.2 you have listed below.  The correct total is (19.0).

I'm getting back to something, I left  you a message last week.  When Barney presented the ETS budget for the pipeline operations, he included amounts allocated from ETS for IT ($170k) and Accounting ($59k).  You left me a phone mail  message regarding the IT charge and suggested that I contact Caroline Barnes (which I did today).  Both of these appear to be new charges for 2002 and we'd like to get information on what they relate to.  Can you shed some light on the Accounting charge?

Thanks
Karl

When is Stan available?  Probably will take no more than 2 hours.

Yes we do.  We were thinking the week of the 15th.  Can you find us a time?

Rod mentioned to me last week that we would only review Wessex on Wednesday.  Do we need to schedule something for the rest of Azurix?

Thanks

Tracy

Please make sure that the Corp Planning requests come through me, Rod, or Stan before they go to Corp.  We need to make sure that Stan approves the numbers and is not surprised in Executive committee meetings, etc.. 

Thanks 

Tracy

Let me know once we have the final numbers and I will get with you on who is going to pay the bill.

EPPI Claim for 2000-2001

Enron Processing Properties, Inc (EPPI)  assignment of the GPM Agency Agreement committed EPPI to reimburse KN (now Oneok) for all-in transportation rates above 4.45%.  NNG's must bill minimum rates and those rates are sometimes above the 4.45% all-in rate, therefore Oneok has submitted invoices for transport excesses of $79,165 and $222,315 for the years 2000 and 2001.

The invoices are currently being checked by Gas Logistics and once a final determination has been made coding instructions will be needed for this EPPI commitment.

Prior Claim (1997-1999)

On 2/18/2000, KN submitted a claim for $363,211 covering 1997-1999, I checked the calculations and the claim was revised to $192,000.

During negotiations KN sold the agreements to Oneok and to my knowledge the prior claim was never paid nor were any more demands for payments made.  

We are scheduled to have a follow up meeting on the 2002 Plan with Stan on Thursday, Oct. 25 at 3:00.  I am not sure if you will call in for that or if Tod is handling the meeting.  We can go over Lay review ideas again then.  The agenda for November 1 has you at 4:30 Houston time.  Will that work for you?  If not, are you comfortable with Tod doing it.  Just let me know what I can do to help.

Thanks

Tracy

I am in Germany on Nov 1 but will call in.  Let me know what time Stan wants to do the dry run (I will be 7 hours ahead of Houston; it would be best for me if I could call after 8 pm German time).  I know we will only have 20 minutes with Ken per business unit.  After sitting through my presentation to Stan, I would appreciate your recommendations on what we should focus on for EREC.  Thanks.

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures. 

We will follow up next week with the breakout of each company. 

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments ("8xxxxxxx" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses ("52502000" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

Good morning sweatheart. Its really hard for me to be away from you.  I think about you all the time.  I love to sleep next to you and wake up with you in the morning.  I really wanted to stay with you Saturday night.  Maybe I can work something out for this weekend.  Love you.  
		

Hi beautiful. I had a hard time yesterday because I missed you so much (in case you couldn't tell). The more we are together the more I love you and want to spend all my time with you. I can't wait to see you.

Stan's staff meeting was cancelled so I am just trying to catch up on things this morning.

Love you sweetie.

Any idea when or if we will receive the money?

FYI, Kim.

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

I like the dinner group idea.  What about lunch on Monday, Oct 29?
Hey Tracy,
 
How are you?  It seems like ages since we've seen each other. 
 
Bunco?well, I know Pam Guidry was the October person, but we figured it wouldn't happen because she hasn't been to the last couple of Buncos.  Then the list ended and I haven't heard from anyone complaining.  I'm not sure if Christi Chickering is still having a Holiday Bunco or not. I'm surprised we haven't heard from Sandra or Debbie via e-mail. Mary Lynn probably won't join again, she wants to do a small dinner group with just you, me, Lisa, Stephanie?the five of us?unless I'm missing someone.
 
Let me know when you're free for lunch, I'm pretty flexible these days.

I believe so because she is working on individual execs compensation.

Thanks

Since Enron only picks up EOTT on an equity basis do you really need revenue from us and on another note I do not budget or estimate revenue only gross margin.  Let me know.

$2MM for what????

Tracy,

Thank you!  These meetings are very helpful in better understanding the business.  I'm currently scheduled to be in Korea, but may change plans and will let you know.  

By the way, Rod had suggested that I hold off on bothering you about my group's budget until after you complete this enormous endeavor.  However, FYI, I had submitted an approximately $2 million budget through Steve Kean's group and about $300,000 was submitted for Gina Taylor's group in the ETS budget.  I'm probably going to identify some reductions in these numbers.  Please let me know when you need details.

I like the dinner group idea.  What about lunch on Monday, Oct 29?
How are you?  It seems like ages since we've seen each other. 
 
Bunco?well, I know Pam Guidry was the October person, but we figured it wouldn't happen because she hasn't been to the last couple of Buncos.  Then the list ended and I haven't heard from anyone complaining.  I'm not sure if Christi Chickering is still having a Holiday Bunco or not. I'm surprised we haven't heard from Sandra or Debbie via e-mail. Mary Lynn probably won't join again, she wants to do a small dinner group with just you, me, Lisa, Stephanie?the five of us?unless I'm missing someone.
 
Let me know when you're free for lunch, I'm pretty flexible these days.

sure

Since I do not budget margin, do you want me to make my best guess since our revenue can fluctuate quite a bit depending on the price of crude oil.

I really miss you, too.  I hope you had a good lunch.  Mine was quite an experience.  I will tell you later.  Did you spill anything on your clothes today?

Love you,

Missing you and thinking of your sweet touch. Love you.

No problem on the reschedule. What about Thursday, Nov. 1?  Actually, Jackie is going to stay with her friend Claire.  But, Garret is very excited about staying with Jake.  Will that be ok?

Can we reschedule our glass of wine? I have been burning the candle at both ends and starting early and working late every night. We are still on for Saturday with the kids. Let me know when you want to bring them over. Also, lets pick a day next week for that glass of wine.
Marsha

Approved.  Please roll over November 1.  Please let me know if there is a problem.

Tracy, as the ETS overall planner, the Property Accounting Users Group requests that you instruct the ISC to roll over the current IM structure for 2002 for both ETS Consolidated and ETS Un-Consolidated.  This will allow for the setting up of 2002 projects (to be saved they must be attached to a 2002 Budget code)  and when the 2002 capital budget is approved, allow for the inputting of the 2002 budget.  No transfer of dollars is involved in the roll over.  This is strictly a structure roll over.   

Please email Marian Bryant with the ISC the approval for the roll over and the date you would like for this to happen.  The Users group is recommending for this to be done November 1st.   If you have specific questions or concerns, please contact Marian directly, x55944.

3. What was the percentage of capacity for each of the pipes for the first nine months of this year?

It would be very helpful if you or someone could respond this afternoon.

Company name should be replaced by your business unit name.
EGS in the page # should be replaced by the abbreviated name of your business unit, i.e. EGAS, EEOS, ETS, etc.  This works 	better if you do this in the View, Master, Slide Master area.
The O&M/G&A graph should include your direct business unit expenses, Corporate costs and other significant allocated costs.
  	Please break out the Corporate and allocated costs for the ones that have increased significantly.

We are suggesting that for comparison purposes for financial data we only show 2001 Third CE and 2002 Plan.  If that does not tell the story you are trying to present, then do what you need to and we can discuss with Stan on Nov. 1.

I will not need anything in advance of the Nov. 1 meeting with Stan.  However, I will need all presentations for the Lay Reviews at
9:00 a.m. on Monday, November 5, or sooner, if possible.  I will need to make books and have them copied prior to the Lay Reviews on November 8.

On Nov. 1, please bring a copy for Stan, Rod, myself and a few extras.

If you need any help or have any questions, please give me a call at 713-853-7372. 

 Tracy,
Attached is the 4th quarter forecast for EGAS.  It is essentially 4Q from 3CE.  This does not include gain/loss on assets sale which right now it would be Greenfield Shipping loss and EcoElectrica gain.  I'll find out the latest for those numbers  .  Please forward this to Steven Schwarzbach if everything looks OK.  Thank you.

ETS             102.0
PGG              54.7  Includes GW adjustment $5.2
EGAS           (29.8)  Includes tranfers in and out of other groups.  Do we need to go over this to make sure the other groups are 
			adjusted appropriately?
EEOS           (35.9)
EREC            51.2
AZURIX         (19.0)
Clean Fuels   (21.1)
                   ---------
                    103.6

Stan only mentioned Rod and myself.  You might ask him before I ask anyone else.

Absolutely!   I'll take care of it and keep you posted.  Do you know who else will be going on this trip with you and Stan?   Rod?   Tod?

I have to leave the office now.  I will call you around 11:00 and we can meet somewhere. OK.

Well, nothing in life is ever free. It will cost you!!!!!!!

I think it is stronger than that, however, we have never experienced anything like that and I was a little unsure of how you would react. Are you free for lunch?

Of course I do! Just because you are upset with me or see things differently doesn't make me not love you all of a sudden. Hopefully, our relationship is stronger than that.

I still love you.  I am not sure if you still love me?  I was a little confused after our conversation yesterday.

Missing you. Are you OK? Do you still love me? 

Can you verify please

One of the drivers for IT Infrastructure's allocation methodology is headcount.  At this time, Enron Net Works would like to verify 2002 plan headcount for your business units.  I have attached the 2002 headcount template that was completed for Corporate back in June.  Please update this template to reflect your latest 2002 headcount information.

The deadline to return this information to me is by the end of the day, Tuesday, October 2nd.  If you have any questions, please call.

Thanks,

Kevin

I will have Mary check into this when she gets back on Thursday.  I believe it should be part of the allocation.

Does this cost center get allocated or direct charged?  Please get back to Morris for me.

Rod - What is our policy of accepting direct charges for corporate assistance?   Should this remain in corporate and be a part of the allocation?

Mike - Was any agreement made up front with Brindle to cover Kyle's expenses?   Was the request to travel made by Dave Odneal or yourself?

Morris, can you look at this for us.  I kinda think that the Corp Allocation is the right place for this expense.

I appreciate Kyle's expertise and work, but do we always pay the direct expenses for Corp assistance?  

Mike:  In regard to Sharon's note below, please confirm the entities responsible for the cost of Kyle's trip.

Thank you,

Kim

Kyle Norosky who works in Enron Corp Business Controls, recently flew to Minneapolis with regard to security issues.  He has told me that his trip is to be charged to ETS/Northern Pipeline cost center or project code.

Please can you let me know what company number and code to charge this to.  The total cost of his trip was $1603.28

Many thanks.

We don't report this info separate.  I am afraid it will lead to alot more questions.   I would prefer system average.

Thanks

Tracy:

Talked with Kim Watson.  This is how she suggested we answer Investor Question 3:

	       West Market - 95% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD
	       East Market -  67% throughput utilization against contracted-for capacity for September YTD

The West and East are two separate markets for TW.  The majority of TW's business is the West market.  
The East market offers our shippers more flexibility.  The two percentages should stand alone and not be 
combined.

Kim felt like these needted to be separate as they are two distinct markets

Thanks!  Hope you have a good weekend and don't get any calls from the office.

I have some errands I need to run at lunch.  I can pick my things up then.  About Las Vegas,  I never received a confirm on Danny Gains last week.  I am not sure what happened, however, I called the Mirage directly and he is sold out that weekend.  Anything else you would like to see?  What about for dinner, any place special you would like to go? 

If you don't mind that would help out. Does that mean you would stay at my house tonight? Do you need to go home and get your things? I can't wait to see you again.

Thanks

The latest from a discussion with Rod, Mary Kay and Dave N. this morning:

FA&A will carry the depreciation - targets may be adjusted for yr to yr increase

IMP and FAS 106 will  be carried at FA&A ,Potential offsets to yr to yr increases are yet to be  determined.

Thus, the above items will not be put into the NNG Commercial Adaytum model.  

lets discuss

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

I am not sure if I will be able to be there the entire time.  I have an all afternoon meeting with Stan tomorrow that I will be preparing for.

This is for EREC not Azurix.  So, don't worry about it.

Sure, I'll give Kevin a call and see why there were charges without any services.   cvb

Can you help me with this?

Tracy-

I need some help on what this is.  Admittedly, it's only $117k, but we only have 3 employees, and will likely have less next year.  Can we discuss?

Michael

Attached is the updated version of the 2002 plan assessments from Enron Net Works (ENW) for your business unit.  We are sending revisions due to several changes, including increases in Corporate and other business unit allocations, and reductions in ENW expenditures.  

This intercompany billing invoice now includes pass throughs and capital for your information.  Consistent with 2001, pass through billings (long distance, market data, WAN, etc.) will not be included in the standard assessments ("8xxxxxxx" accounts).  They will be posted directly to direct expenses ("52502000" accounts) at the cost center level.  This pass through number is only a high level place holder and is not intended to replace the dollars already being budgeted for by each cost center owner.

If you have any questions, you can contact Kevin May at x52508 and he will answer any questions or direct you to the correct person.

If you are not the correct person to receive these assessments or if there is someone else that you would like to include in this process, please reply back to me with this information and I will add them to the contact list for future correspondence.

Thanks,

Jay

 << File: EREC IC 10-19.xls >> 

I have Steve's slides.  Eric do you have your slides revised including Transpecos?  I do not have that yet.

Thanks

Tracy and Dan,

Steve and I revised the business development slides for Stan's presentation.  I'm waiting for Kim Watson to update the TransPecos slide and will forward when complete.  Will forward final rendition when completed, probably on Monday.

 << File: 2002 Plan.ppt >> 

Stan is available October 18 from 1:00-3:00 in his office.  Will this work?

Please use the following e=mails, james.weitekamp@enron.com and tracy.geaccone@enron.com
I would like to discuss how you two are spending your time and where we are.

James and Hoang,

Here is a copy of the revised timeline.
Let me know if you have any questions.

 <<Timeline2.doc>> 

Demetrics Tyson
Adaytum Consulting Services
214.704.5329

WE are doing October.

For this week's forecast for your company, for the week ending November 2, are you going to be updating October one last time or are you going to be providing a forecast for November?

Please let me know what your plans are,

Thanks,
Henry

Yes.  James Centilli asked me to get this information.  Mark Walton supplied it to Gary Anderson yesterday and Gary forwarded the information to me.

I gave the information to James yesterday afternoon.

Jan

do you know anything about this?
Gary Anderson indicated you needed TW fuel numbers for last two years.

Gas Accounting has a data file of compressor useage by compressor by month.

We can provide the information if you let me know who to contact.

I need to reschedule this afternoons call.  What about Monday morning after 9:00?

Hello Tracy,

I wanted to share some conversations that I've had with both Demetrics and
Hoang this week related to the project.

On of the biggest issue seems to be with resources.  I know that you guys
have been quite busy with your planning process but it has been very
difficult to get the required information or time from the resources that
are committed to the project.  This is due to the fact that they currently
have a heavy workload and cannot dedicate the time necessary for the
project.  It is having an impact on the timeline.  The home office model
could be a lot further along if some of the required information was
delivered as requested.  Also, I am also getting a sense that there is a
lack of ownership with regards to the Adaytum application.  It is important
that the users have a comfort level with the application otherwise it will
become very difficult to transition it when the project is over.

We need to think about who will administer the system once it is in full
production.  This individual should be identified and running the
administration duties as soon as possible.  My fear is that without proper
ownership of the application and a dedicated administrator (at least in the
short run), it will be very difficult to transition the roles.

We've had some technical issues with the production and development
environment.  Although these issues have been resolved, it has had an impact
on the timeline.

There are times that the definition for the model is not clearly articulated
and it has resulted in the redesign of the model.  Much time has been spent
on gathering business process information from various people which has
caused a delay in the model development.

I hope that we can constructively talk through these issues tomorrow and
produce solutions that will rectify the situation, mitigate the risks, and
result in a successful implementation.

Our call is scheduled for 1:30 tomorrow but I can be available earlier if
you would like to discuss this.

I don't know if we have the Trailblazer info in house.  Mike McGowan in Omaha would be the only one who might know.  If he does not have it, we wii have to call Trailblazer directly.  I don't know how to get in touch with Mike outside of the office.  Can you wait until MOnday?  If not, I can try information in Omaha.

I want the payment from the final bill to go to the Corp account as well.  I do not need the bill to go to my home address.  I would like it paid through I Buy It.

Thanks

I need the August year to date actuals tied out ASAP.   I need to know what companies it includes as well.

Thanks

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

 

No problem

Are you sure?

Let me know if ICan do anything

What level of detail do you need?  I have a high level in my office.  Jan has a lot of detail.  Do you need today?  I can call Jan at home so I can get access.

IMight have something at the office.  I can be there within the hour.

Volumes for NNG:

2001 3CE - (1513.6 bcf total for year ) - Bcf / day = 4.147

2002 Plan - (1495.4 bcf total for year ) - Bcf / day = 4.097

I need average throughput for the above as soon as possibe.

Jan, I need total not just west.

Please copy Rod on your reply to me.

Transwestern:

2001 3CE -  1.8 Bcf 
2002 Plan - 1.8 Bcf 

I need average throughput for the above as soon as possibe.

Jan, I need total not just west.

Please copy Rod on your reply to me.

This question is for NNG? Any idea.  I will check and see what I have.

Tracy:

One more question:

Why did O&M increase in 1999 and 2000 when compared to 1997?  This shows you the level of detail they are now working with!

I thought she was asking about EIS charges?

Elaine,
I spoke with Pam Daily;  she said that due to all the recent moves & changes, it would probably be December before rent charges hit the cost centers directly, and that there would not be any 2001 true-ups.
Hope this answers your question.
Thanks, 
Nancy

She actually left me a voice mail.  Maybe we are talking about two different things?

Could you please forward her email?  Caroline told me it was about rent - EPSC.

I have vacation scheduled for Friday, November 9.  I will be back in the office on Monday, November 12.  I will have my cell phone (713-408-0929) and Blackberry with me if you need to reach me.  I will check voice mail a few times as well.

Thanks

There is fair value but no goodwill.

There is no fair value.

Tracy / Rod:

How much is TPC's current Fair Value balance?  The banks want to exclude "goodwill" from the tangible net worth computation - I realize goodwill and fair value are slightly different but they could make the argument to exclude.  I seem to recall a $300MM number.

?????

Banks want to exclude goodwill. How would you explain the difference between the two?

Corp has been showing a previos IBIT of  a positive $15MM for EEOS.  I am not sure what you will see today.  The attached file explains from the $15MM to the previous forecast of ($35.9).

After our meeting today Mike and I met with Pat about some of the recent Adaytum issues and I would like to update you on the progress.  

With regard to users loosing Contributor data previously entered, we believe they may not be waiting long enough after selecting Save, and closing the window before the save process is complete.  This afternoon Pat sent the detailed instructions below, stressing that users wait until they receive the Done message before closing the window.  She has asked users to let her know if they continue to have this problem.  Due to the size of our applications they do take several minutes to open and may take longer to save.

The second issue involves salary calculations in the base models in Adaytum Analyst.  Last week we corrected a formula to resolve this problem.  As it turns out the  changes made in Analyst last week are not there now.  Hoang Vo, who is in Omaha today, asked one of his Adaytum collogues, who is working on the Corporate project, to look into this.  He contacted Pat and indicated he had experienced this same problem and supplied her with a macro to run after making the changes in Analyst.  Pat updated several applications this evening and will check in the morning to see if it worked.  This issue with saving in Analyst is not related to the saving issue in Contributor.

Additionally, Contributor has not been available for several days recently.  This is due to problems with the server that is operated by Networks.  Hoang has worked with the Sunrise technical lead and Networks, and this problem is resolved.

If there any questions, please don't hesitate to call me or Pat.

SAVE WILL SAVE THE DATA BACK TO THE DATABASE.  THIS TAKES MORE TIME THAN WHEN YOU OPENED THE APPLICATON BECAUSE YOU ARE SENDING BACK MORE DATA.  YOU MUST WAIT UNTIL YOU SEE THE WORD "DONE" IN THE LOWER LEFT HAND CORNER BEFORE EXITING.  THE HOUR GLASS MAY STOP RUNNING, BUT UNTIL YOU SEE THE WORD "DONE", IT IS NOT FINISHED SAVING ALL THE DATA.

Tracy,
 
Amount of 2000 bonus' paid in 2001:  $16.74M
(The $16.61M reported by PGE employee Joyce Bell in HR was the recommended amount submitted to Corporate for approval.  The actual payouts differ by $130K due to upward adjustments made by Corporate to the recommended amounts.)
 
Accrual amount for 2001 bonus:  $13.0M

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Valerie

 Can you help with this one?

Tracy:

Sorry to bother you with this one again -

in 1999 and 2000, what were the revenues and costs associated with the base gas sales - the footnote disclosure indicates $53 million and $34 million in sales but not the cost.  In addition, going forward, how much of the 2001 and 2002 TG&S expense is solely related to this transaction (i.e. expenses that would not be incurred but for this transaction)? My question may be a bit confusing - call me if I am totally off base!

What about this bvalgri in NYC?  There is not a phone #.

 
Also, if you know someone at Harold Powell that would be a great one too!
 
Skip Mumsies - it is no longer in business, I believe, as the number has been disconnected and there is no other listing for it.

Do you think you will need me to come back into the office tonight?  I don't want to let my nanney go home if you think you need me

I thought this one was canceled. So I declined to get it off my calendar.

Why not?

Did you set up my Corporate.  account for me?  My mobile number is 7134080929.  Please transfer the balance from my personal to my corporate.

The 4th quarter forecast meetings with Stan scheduled for Tuesday, November 13 at 1:30 and Thursday, December 13 at 1:30 have been canceled.  Rod and I will meet with Stan separately.

Thanks

Tracy

Actually, you are a step ahead.  I am in the process of sending out an e-mail to cancel that for all parties and have rescheduled for you and I to meet with Stan at 8:30 on 10/18.  Will that work for you?

I thought we had a Qtr forecast review that time, guess I am behind time.

Stan is available October 18 from 1:00-3:00 in his office.  Will this work?

I still need to understand why we are at the 4.45% and what we can do in the future if anything to control it.   Can someone help me with this?

Thanks

I have attached a summary and schedules which indicate the following.

EPPI owes Oneok/GPM $339,158.69
Oneok owes NNG	$  92,774.99
Net amount due is	$246,383.70  Per Dan Fancler

Oneok invoices total $301,383.96.  Oneok has not recognized that some months they paid under the 4.45% and owe NNG.
 << File: GPM 101021  101073 Recalculation.xls >> Oneok is pushing hard for the money, so I am turning over the resolution of the differences to NNG marketing and the resolution of the cash payment to Tracy Geaccone and/or Jennifer Lev.

Can you take care of this.  Thanks

Have we talked to Jan Johnson about this any more?  I need to know the scope and estimated expense before we move ahead.  I would still like to talk to Jan.  I will give her a call next week.

Thanks

Tracy,

As you know Project Sunrise no longer has within its scope the development of a process for bi-directional data flow between Adaytum and the Data Warehouse, at a level sufficient for ETS.  Because of this the EST IT group is now exploring solutions that will achieve what is needed.  Considering we thought this was being worked on by Sunrise, until a few weeks ago, we have a great deal more work ahead of us than earlier expected.

In Operations we will need Hoang Vo working on our project until the end of April 2002 at a minimum.  He is currently scheduled to roll of the project at the end of January.  We need to get with Adaytum and reserve this additional time.  Do you want to do that or would you rather to go ahead and work with Fred Ali to make the arrangements.

Thanks, Lee

On its way

Working on it

I like it.  I would like to make sure we know the definition per group.

Is it over?

Are you getting all the info you need?  'ames should be in and I can tell him or Steve where to get schedules.  I will leave my Blackberry on.  Good luck!

Michael works for John and we have reviewed the 3rd CE with both.  I can forward to you, I am curious as to what the report is that you are preparing?

Thanks

Tracy

Tracy,
Can you send me whatever you got from Kenny/Michael for Azurix 3rd Current Estimate?  I have a report due to John Garrison that asks for that information.

Thanks,

One of my favorites!  Just tell me when and where.

I have been thinking I want to do exactly what we did on Saturday (same way, same everything). I really liked it.

I miss you, too.  What exactly have you been thinking?  Kim set lunch up for Palu.  I thought that was really nice.  I guess that means we will have to behave ourselves. I love you.

Tracy

Hey beautiful. I have been thinking about you all morning (and night). Can't wait to see you. I hear we are going to lunch tomorrow. Talk to you soon. Love you.

FYI

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

 

The 4th quarter forecast meetings with Stan scheduled for Tuesday, November 13 at 1:30 and Thursday, December 13 at 1:30 have been canceled.  Rod and I will meet with Stan separately.

	As we all know, this has been a diffcult time for Enron.  It may be a difficult time for you and your family members as well.  Therefore, Enron would like to remind you that the Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is available to provide you and your dependents with confidential access to a professional who can offer support and direction with personal or job-related issues.

	The EAP is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by calling 713.853.6057 or 1.800.345.1391.  You may see some additional information about EAP at the following Intranet site: http://hrweb.enron.com/employeeServices/workLife/resourcesReferrals.asp

We are still trying to work through this.  I should get back to you shortly.

Please see Debra Thompson's note below regarding not setting up FAR orders for floor space billing. I also received a message from Billie Akhave stating EPSC will not be billing to FAR orders -- only company/cost centers.

The last information I had was that all pipeline company employees' space should be billed to FAR orders. Has this changed?

Thanks for your help.

Last I heard we were not doing this at this time.  Please read below....

Maria - Please speak with Dave if you haven't already.  It will not be necessary for you to set these FAR orders up at this time.  I left a message with Tracy Geaccone to communicate this to Ruthann Frausto.

FYI

Maria,  See the attached.  I believe you will set up the co. 0062 and 0085 FAR orders.

Miriam, I believe you will set up the co. 1195 FAR orders but you need to check with Silvia first.  I think you will also set up the co. 0584 FAR orders but check with Barney first.

Ruthann,
Although there are people in the co. 0584 cost centers right now, they are in the process of being moved to other pipeline companies by 01/01/2002.  There will be no employees on co. 0584 after the first of the year.

Thanks to all,
Pat

We have been instructed to begin charging all floor space and related charges to FAR orders for all pipeline employees. I was advised that the FAR orders to be used should be xxxx20009999, which is "G&A Custom Variant - Asset Not Specific".

I've looked up all xxxx20009999 FAR orders in SAP and determined which cost centers for Houston employees need to have this FAR order set up. Attached is a spreadsheet showing the FAR orders which need to be created.

Please call me if you need any additional information, and let me know when the FAR orders are created.

Thanks for your help.

Did you have a good work out?  I enjoyed watching Soap Operas while the Vietnamese ladies worked on my hands and feet.
I really miss you.

Actually, I don't need your map inserted because I can't have Northern Border in it.  Can you center the one I already have in the presentations?

You are so good to me!  As long as we are together, it does not really matter where we stay.  I would prefer a king size bed as opposed to two double.  Although, if we mess up one, we can always use the other one.  The Lay Reviews are supposed to be over at 5:00, so any time after that.  I don't really have a preference on the return flight. 

Love you

Do you have a preference as to which hotel we stay in? I checked the Bellagio and they are very proud of their hotel that week ($380/night). The Venetian is kind of steep too but about $100/night cheaper. Other choices that I think would be nice would be the MGM Grand or the Mirage. Just let me know what you want. Also, I need to probably book the flights so let me know what time you want to leave and come back. Thanks. Love you babe.

	Steve 

I hope I am not too late.

I would use this along with the O & M schedules we sent you earlier.  If anyone wants more detail they need to go directly to Stan Horton or Brain Stanely.  Apparantly they have already worked up a plan.

Thanks

Tracy,

As discussed, the EEOS functions, including NEPCO, previously turned in to Corp are defined as follows:

Commercial  -  Includes Engineering, Project Management, Construction Management and Business Development.

Logistics  -  Includes Procurement.

Other Mid-Office  -  Includes Project Controls, Estimating, QA, Contracts and Administration.

Legal  -  Includes Legal.

Accounting/Audit/Finance/Treasury  -  Includes Accounting & Finance

Information Technology  -  Includes IT personnel

Human Resources  -  Includes HR personnel

Executive  -  Includes the Presidents of EEOS & NEPCO and other Nepco Executive staff.

Other  -  Includes Nepco rent and employees for Caxios, Nepco Europe, OEC & EPIC.

Do you need these defined further than this? I did not include the obvious functions Enron Property Services or severance.

Jan Moore
Erin Copeland
Steve Kleb
Mary Botello
James Weitekamp

I know its all of my employees, however, they are all really good employees and have been considered as such throughout the PRC process.  They are key to getting the plan/forecast/estimates done within ETS.

Thanks

Tracy

Lets see what Jim's group comes up with and then we can fill in unless you have something handy to help out.

"Acctg" has many recaps as part of yr end audit work. We will dig into our files and copy relevant yr to yr variations.  
Coordinate directly w me.

I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets.   I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again.   This is not a project that will be complete by friday, but it does need to get complete this year.

starting point, okay?
if possible, please indicate line items you woul like us to "drill down" on

Please see the three tabs for EGS and complete for your business unit.  I will need this back to me by 2:00 today so I can consolidate and give to Corp by 3:00.  The numbers should be the ones consolidated to Enron only.

Hello everyone.  I know that many, if not all of you, have worked on numerous requests/initiatives from the office of the chair and other teams lately.  That being said, we received a new request on Thursday night which is another look at some of the information your groups may have already provided, along with some other information.  Attached is a file, with the breakouts and formats as requested by management, containing four (for some of you, five) spreadsheets.  Please complete all of these sheets applicable to your business unit (note: dollars in millions).   The requested timing of the completion of this exercise is by 3pm Friday, November 15.  Please send the completed file back to me as soon as you are finished.  If you have any questions about the format or the contents of the file, please contact Michelle Nezi Marvin at 3-6848. For any other questions, please call Mark Lindsey at 3-1873.

Thanks,
Steve

Hello everyone.  I know that many, if not all of you, have worked on numerous requests/initiatives from the office of the chair and other teams lately.

In case there are any questions over the weekend regarding the information we are gathering today, please send me your home and cellular phone numbers.
Thank you

Tracy,

Here is the Azurix information you requested.  I have not sent it to Corp so you need to include it in your information.  

Let me know if you have questions.

Tracy,

Attached is the info request. I have populated 3 worksheets:

EGS IS
EGS Burn
EGS Exp

These are rough numbers and need polishing!

Blake

 

Tracy,

Attached is the file you requested.  I have made substantial assumptions regarding the requested content, and the content provided may not be what was intended to be requested.

Please note the following:

- The EREC earnings figures are from the Hyperion system as of Oct. 19th
- The 2001-02 Expenses are from the 3CE and 2002 Plan respectively.  The cost-type breakdown requested is not available.
- The cash burn rate is net and ties to the change in the Enron Working Capital line balance by period. I do not have visibility to the gross outflows due to format differences.

Please call with any questions.

Thanks.

What do you think?

Stan's day just opened up for this Thursday the 4th, or we could do 2:30 to 5:00PM on Monday, October 29, or 2:30 to 5:00PM on Tuesday, October 30.   Otherwise, that's it.   Please advise asap.

What else can we do?

John is on vacation from Thursday, October 18th and will return on Wednesday, October 24th.

This will work for me - I will check with John Garrison

Stan is available October 18 from 1:00-3:00 in his office.  Will this work?

I have revised it.  Steve, I hope you have time to look at all the other ones that were tuned in to make sure thy are right.

 

Tracy/Stephen,
The formula in the employee sensitive section for the total column is wrong.  The amount should be 46.3, not 19.3. The % should be 45% rather than 19%.  Our system is down and I cannot access the file to make this correction.  Just want to let you know.  Thank you.

Well, the stock price is down $1 and some change because of the 3Q 10Q.  I went over the 4Q numbers with Stan.  He was ok with them.  I am either sitting in for him or accompanying him to the Whalley meeting today.  Enron announced they are going to have layoffs next week.  I am sure you have seen the e-mail.  The office is quiet.  How are things going up there?  Are you leaving this afternoon?

What is going on?

It has been great to spend time with you.  I am really going to miss you this week.  I need a kiss before I leave. 
Don't forget to order your ham.

No PGG?

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

Can you e-mail me the latest and greatest 2002 presentation?

Thanks

Does this reflect what was in the TW Commercial 2002 Capital Budget that we reviewed with Stan?

Palu,

Two major items affected the cashflow since August:
1.)  Air permits have been delayed from August, 2001 to November, 2001.  The delay of the air permits impacts construction start dates and delays shipment of material.  Major payments of material, equipment and construction have slipped into 2002 because of the air permit delays.  
2.)  Our compressor vendor has had a few problems.  Their payments are tied to progress.  Our current forecast represents their current payment schedule, which has slipped  as their fabrication has been delayed.

Thanks,
Steve Kalmus

Steve,

The last forecast you sent the 2001 Red Rock cash flow was $40.7 million, the current forecast is $23.4 million. Please explain the difference of $ 17.3 million. This affects the TW Maketing Capital Plan for 2002.

Can you help me with this one?

Do you know how much capacity is available to sell in the plan for 2002 and is not sold, ie how much capacity is not being utilized?  TW of course.

yes. do you need something?

Is Kathy here?

It was a lady and we told her where you were.  I will call and check.

What happened to the guy with the paper to sign?

I have Rod's staff meeting, but I can miss it if that is the only time you have available.

Danny:
I was visiting with Tracy this morning about the NNG/TW Actual meeting scheduled for Wednesday, December 12th at 2:30 (note follows Stan's Half Staff meeting).  
Tracy inquired what material you want to cover.  Please consider and I will set up a meeting for you and Tracy to discuss in more detail.
Thanks.  

Tracy, I have Friday AM open.  Please advise.  

thanks

kevin, left me a note saying he was unavailable today, so i rescheduled to wed (better fits your original plan)

FYI.    This is my story for now, but I think it explains the volumes and the rates as well as the revenue projections.   Please note we have found a bust in 2002 revenue.   This yields a higher answer without any additional volumes being used.

9:00-10:00 okey?

Tracy: 
How about Thursday morning?  Danny is open from 8:30 - 11:00.

Tracy, I have Friday AM open.  Please advise.  

Red Rock capital spend estimated $72 million for the 120,000/d

I need you to sign something right away.  Where are you?

We can probably do this.  However, if Steve Harris has not approved by then, I will not be able to send.  Why so early?  Why not first thing Friday?

Henry Baker will email you no later than  each Thursday morning with the last "Summary" with the YTD and QTR info section titles adjusted accordingly.  This next one will be October month forecast.  The YTD will be September YTD with the Actual line reading Actual/Forecast since September is not yet finalized.  When we are at the end of a QTR (like now) and forecasting the first month of the next QTR I will add a section for the next QTR (in this case 4th QTR).

This week's template follows:
 << File: WeeklyWeb100501.XLS >> 
Please fill in your company's data on the template and return by email to Henry Baker no later than 3:00 pm on each Thursday.

The report will be titled "Weekly Commercial Net Contribution Summary" and will ultimately reside in the ETS Updates, Financial Forecasts section of the ETS Website.  Also, keep submitting and inputing into the Website the more detailed weekly reports as you have been.  We will not be publishing the Summary by email but watch for it on the Website.  The way the Website works, it might not show up until Friday morning.  If you need an advance copy, let Henry know and he can email it to you.

Also, when filling in your variances, watch for rounding issues where it might show up as zeroes but the totals would foot differently when adding the visual amounts.

I am not sure I understand what you need here?

What is in the plan?

Here are Peggy's slides.

Here are the slides you requested....a few talking points as  mentioned by Jim are on the 4th page....let me know, if you'd like more  information or a different format

Is the cost center in question allocated or direct charged?  The corporate Enron Corp Business Controls cost center.

Rod - What is our policy of accepting direct charges for corporate assistance?   Should this remain in corporate and be a part of the allocation?

Morris, can you look at this for us.  I kinda think that the Corp Allocation is the right place for this expense.

I appreciate Kyle's expertise and work, but do we always pay the direct expenses for Corp assistance?  

Mike:  In regard to Sharon's note below, please confirm the entities responsible for the cost of Kyle's trip.

Thank you,

Kyle Norosky who works in Enron Corp Business Controls, recently flew to Minneapolis with regard to security issues.  He has told me that his trip is to be charged to ETS/Northern Pipeline cost center or project code.

Can you e-mail me the latest and greatest 2002 presentation?

Thanks

How does this look?

 

Also, I did change some numbers in the excel spreadsheet:

	The Ignacio to Blanco subscription levels were pulling from the row excluding ROFR capacity in the supporting sheet.  I changed it to be consistent with the other 	capacities (which include ROFR capacity).

	Shelley had made some assumptions about East of Thoreau capacity subscription, such as, the USGT 400,000/d contract would remain subscribed (it doesn't 	have ROFR) and she had included the extension of 2-3 other contracts that don't have ROFR.  These contracts were then dropped after 2005.  I continued the 	extensions through 2006.

	I changed the East of Thoreau capacity to 750,000/d from 850,000/d.

 

I have a meeting with Stan on Dec. 13.  I will see if I can schedule for the following week.

Rod and Tracy-

We are trying to plan for the 4th current estimate, and are looking at when our monthly reports roll in (around the 15th of December).  Can you give me guidance as to when we are due to give you our 4CE??  Hopefully, after the 15th will work.

Michael

I am working on it.

Check and find out forme?  Is that EOTT or the company that owns it?

2002 is actually 15 million.  WE will reformat and send to you shortly.

For TW. Can you help me here?

Rod,

Would you please forward me the CAPEX numbers when Tracy e-mails them to you?  Jayshree indicated that she needs those numbers and it will be easier to send in soft form.

Also, to confirm the numbers in the information you gave me are 30.86 MM for 2001 (this does not include Red Rock) and $68.4 in 2002 (this includes $47 MM for Red Rock).  I am assuming that on page three of the 2001-2003 projections that really captures 2002-2004 the operations numbers are in 000s not millions as noted above.  If this is true you have 15 billion in operations CAPEX - which I don't believe is true.  Let me know.

Thanks
Sarah

tab one is for 2001 tab two is 2002.  Let me know if there is something else.

	 

Ok.  Did you tell Steve?  I Guess that's additive to my stretch?

I am in a due diligence meeting until 6:00.  I can review afterwards and get back to you tonight.  Is that ok?

I am okey with this.  

Thanks

Tracy

Tracy, here is the Agave letter.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  I would like to send this to Agave today if I can.

Many thanks, 

Kim.

Unfortunately, something has come up and Stan will not be able to meet Friday from 3:00-5:00.  He would like to me the morning of October 5 from 8:30-12:00 in EB 5029?  Please let me know as soon as possible if this will work.

Thanks

Cindy,

The attendees from EEOS to the review with Stan, on Friday, Oct. 5th from 3:00 - 5:00p.m, are:

Brian Stanley, Keith Dodson, Blake Walker, and myself.

The meeting is to be held at EB5029.

Erin x67916

This is due on October 4.  Tod and Valerie lets discuss.  Please call me.

Ok, I have corrected the latest bugs you guys have found.  Please use this file when you submit.  Thanks for your patience.

Steve

 

I passed out the Corp format last Friday at with some detail of O & M by legal entity.  I would like to have this by first thing by Monday.  Please let me know if you can't do this.

thanks

OK, let's try for submission to Henry early Friday mornings.  And we will shoot for it being available on the Web by Friday afternoon.

We can probably do this.  However, if Steve Harris has not approved by then, I will not be able to send.  Why so early?  Why not first thing Friday?

Henry Baker will email you no later than  each Thursday morning with the last "Summary" with the YTD and QTR info section titles adjusted accordingly.  This next one will be October month forecast.  The YTD will be September YTD with the Actual line reading Actual/Forecast since September is not yet finalized.  When we are at the end of a QTR (like now) and forecasting the first month of the next QTR I will add a section for the next QTR (in this case 4th QTR).

This week's template follows:
 << File: WeeklyWeb100501.XLS >> 
Please fill in your company's data on the template and return by email to Henry Baker no later than 3:00 pm on each Thursday.

The report will be titled "Weekly Commercial Net Contribution Summary" and will ultimately reside in the ETS Updates, Financial Forecasts section of the ETS Website.  Also, keep submitting and inputing into the Website the more detailed weekly reports as you have been.  We will not be publishing the Summary by email but watch for it on the Website.  The way the Website works, it might not show up until Friday morning.  If you need an advance copy, let Henry know and he can email it to you.

Also, when filling in your variances, watch for rounding issues where it might show up as zeroes but the totals would foot differently when adding the visual amounts.

	Tracy,
	This charge hit Danny's cc this month.  Do we want to reclass or just let it assess to the pipes?

Attached are revised EGF 2002 Plan Allocations.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you.

 

Tracy, we had some minor changes.  Thank you.

 

Attached are revised EGF 2002 Plan Allocations.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you.

 

fyi

 Here's our best estimate.  Please let me know if you have questions.

Hello everyone.  I know that most, if not all, of you are busy with quarter close, 2002 Plan, and possibly Board of Directors presentations and that this is not the ideal time to have more added to your plate.  However, in conjunction to with setting the 2002 Plan targets, the Office of the Chairman has asked to see an analysis of 2001 operating expenses by business unit, with some level of detail, and with quick turnaround.

To that end, and to expedite this request in an efficient manner (and hopefuly save you some work), corporate accounting has already prepared a summary of operating expenses by business unit by category for the eight months ended August 31, 2001.  These categories correlate very closely with the most often used accounts in SAP (cost element groups), i.e. salaries, benefits, outside services, etc.  This information ties to your rollup in CS.  Some categories have many accounts mapped to them, and we have provided the mapping employed by corporate for you to follow (column AO).

What we are asking you to do is as follows:

1. Review the attached schedule for the eight months ended 8/31/2001 (first sheet - Expenses-YTD August 2001).  Corporate has highlighted, in yellow, various amounts that warrant some additional explanation.  Please provide an explanation for these highlighted amounts.  You may do so in any format you choose (at the bottom with a footnote, additional schedule, etc.).

2. As you may remember doing earlier this year with the 2001 Plan, please take your total expenses YTD 8/31/01 and categorize them by function.  We have provided a list of the most common functions in this file, but if you need to add functions for clarity, please do so.  Corporate gave thought to using the SAP alternate hierarchies to do this, but concluded that each BU should have input on this as you will know the most appropriate hierarchies to use and any other adjustments to make, if needed.

3. Considering what has been incurred through August and what the remainder of the year holds for your BU, please project your total 2001 operating expenses by both category and by function.  Please fill in the second sheet in the file (Expenses-Sep-Dec 2001) with your projections and review the totals sheet (Total Year Estimate).  

Keep in mind that this exercise is meant to be your best estimate at this time of these items, given the quick turnaround time, and not an exhaustive project. We realize that this is the best estimate at this time and understand that these numbers may change for a variety of reasons.

If you have any questions, please call me at x33341 or Terry West at x36910.

And finally, this needs to be completed and returned to me by 1:00pm this Wednesday, October 3.

Thank you,
Steve

Actually, we are working with each group to see why their charges are up and we are trying to get them reduced.  We will discuss with Stan at our ETS review and do further follow up if necessary.  We actually met with Terry West and Dawn Derr last week to get their input and contacts.

Tracy,
Jim had wanted to meet with the business heads that charges us thru the corp charges to hear their business justifications and assumptions used in allocating costs to us.  I just want to check if you are doing this with Stan.  If you are, then maybe Jim can just sit in the same meeting.  Please let me know.  Thank you.

James will send out a file with the cost elements listed shortly.

I have categorized the the following O&M categories for the entity income statement as follows:
					Cost Element						
Employee Expenses			52002500
					52003000
					52003500
					52002000
					52004000
					52004500

Outside Services			52507400
					52507500
					52508000
					52507000

Technology Expense			52502000	
					52504500		

Also, NNG and TW IT both have non-payroll capital, which I am going to net against "Other Operating Expenses".  Please let me know if you agree with this.			

Thanks,
Nancy

I've got most of the contact person and have talked to some groups and they have reduced some costs but Jim wants to meet them anyway.  So does this mean that I can go ahead and coordinate these one on one meetings for Jim?  Thanks.

I love you.

What do you think?

Property tax liability, in a given tax year i.e. 2002, is directly related to the level of income and asset cost of the prior calendar year i.e. 2001.  As in the case of NNG & TW, income and asset cost are increasing. Therefore, property taxes also will increase.

In order to keep the property tax liability flat, three strategies are available (1) book any gain on the sale of an asset below the line (N.U.O.I.), (2) assets there are no longer in service should be retired from the books of records, and (3) items that can be expensed should be expensed and not capitalized to plant, property, & equipment.

If you have any other questions or comments, please advise.

The 2002 Plan reflects an annual property tax accrual increase for both companies of approximately $1.0 MM (NNG $.3 MM and TW $.7 MM) above what is presently being accrued on each company this year. Would you please respond to Tracy on the reasons for the increase between years and also provide a possible strategy for keeping the accrual flat. She will need your response by Friday to cover any question/concerns Stan may have after his review this weekend. Thanks in advance for your cooperation and support.

Tracy,  We will be increasing NNG Operations Capital Current Estimate by $4.0MM with the forecast coming up to cover the additional Cooper Pre-Buy Standby.  Morris indicated that there was a pot of Capital dollars somewhere in ETS that can be reduced so that we don't increase the total ETS Capital Budget.  Can you confirm this?

Thanks,  Elaine

I spoke with Morris, and we will increase NNG Operations for the $4.0MM and request that it be offset elsewhere within ETS.  I believe that Rod may have a pot at the ETS level.  We will need to work with Tracy on this.

If you have dollars that you will not spend, though, please let us know. 

Thanks,  Elaine

We're talking about $4.0m for 2001. Should I go ahead & increase our Curr Est to be sent out this week?  Diane

As far as I know, we are to adjust our C/E up for the amount of the pre-by bookings.

dc

$1,957,583 has hit the Blanket Standby WBS for the Cooper pre-buy inventory.  According to John Reese, another $2,010,921 will hit this year.  How are these dollars to be funded?  I am assuming that we will be adjusting our CE for the Cooper Pre-Buy dollars, but I would like confirmation on how you would like for us to handle.

If you could let us know ASAP it would be appreciated.

Thanks!

I ordered the pastries.  I will bring them on Saturday.  Don't forget to make the ice cream.  I can't wait to be with you tomorrow.
I love you.

Good morning beautiful. I can't stop thinking about being with you and holding you. All night long all I could think about was how wonderful it is to hold and kiss you. You are so sweet and affectionate. I love it!

I have a slight sinus headache this morning but I hope it will go away after I take something for it. Can't wait to see you and touch you.

	Love,

		Your Seetheart 

Greg Lewis sent me the user count I will try to look at it the week of Oct 15.  They do have several Corp credits, not billing stock options and lower MMF.

What can we do here?

Dee,

Rod and Tracy will not be in the office on Thursday, October 11.  The are attending a budget review in the Portland office. They can probably meet Friday morning before the budget meeting with Stan.  Let me know.

Thanks,
Kathy

Rod and Tracy:

Jerry Peters would like to meet with you on Thursday, October 11, upon his arrival in Houston.  Jerry is scheduled to land in Houston at 2:39 pm, so he suggested scheduling a meeting at 4:00 p.m.  Topic of discussion is Northern Border SAP Charges for 2001.

Please let me know if you would be available to meet with Jerry at 4:00 p.m. on Thursday, October 11.

Thank you.

Dee

Keith Dodson will be attending this meeting via telephone.  Please make sure he has any handouts ahead of time.

Thanks

Stan said last week that he would like to do a EGAS 2002 Capital Budget Review.  When do you think we can do this?

What do you think?

 

Cindy,

Please ask Stan if he is okey with the attached agenda for the Lay 2002 Plan Reviews.

 

okey.  I already responded that I could not meet on Friday.  Since we will be out of the office, I will need the extra time.

I think she is talking about friday am! 

We leave the Enron hanger to fly to Portland at 7:30 that morning.  

Rod and Tracy:

Would you be able to meet with Jerry before the Budget Meeting with Mr. Horton?  Jerry said that a breakfast meeting would work for him.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience.  FYI, Jerry will be staying at the Doubletree Hotel the night before (Oct. 11).

Thank you, both.

If they can split by business unit they must have by company.  The FERC nor the partnerships will accept these charges unless we have the data to send the costs to them.  I really need something like yesterday.  I thought we had this resolved a long time ago.

The ISC does not have this information below the business unit level.  HR may be able to match the p-numbers up to company in a semi-automated fashion.  Or, you could use the number of documents and master data as the bases and exclude the user counts in the weighting. 

	How much trouble would it be to have the list of users/licenses split by ETS company?

We should be able to use this to allocate SAP costs to companies.

fyi the first workbook below (isc allocation metrics) has a password on it........  owl

Tracy,

These are the statistics provided by Chris Schlaudraff.

 << File: ISC Allocation Metrics.xls >> This is a recap at the business unit level.  The business unit allocation is weighted as follows:
			29.27% based on how many licenses we have.
			53.41% based on how many documents we have on the system.
			17.32% based on the amount of CO data (or master data) we have on the system.

 << File: Stats by company for ETS.xls >> This is the detail of the documents (# of FI docs & # of PO docs columns) and the CO data (all other columns) ETS has on the system.....by company.

 << File: ISC ets licenses.xls >>   This is a list of the ETS users/licenses.  It is not by company.  

Let me know if you have any questions,
Greg

Thanks

Stan said this is fine!

Cindy,

Please ask Stan if he is okey with the attached agenda for the Lay 2002 Plan Reviews.

 << File: Lay Agenda.xls >> 

I love to make you happy.  I have been having hot flashes all afternoon!  I would really like for you to spoil me forever.

I love you,

Tracy

You make my legs weak!(it's a good thing). Mmmmm, love you babe. You are so good to me. I like you spoiling me the way you do. Hopefully, you will give me a chance to do that to you forever.
	Love,
	Steve 

I have attached examples from NNG presentation.  Lindy, you might want to use accountability slide format.

 

ETS  103
PGG  28
EREC 53.2
Azurix (not including Marlin) (5.2)
Clean Fuels (21.1)  I need to double check this one this morning.

We talked about EGAS yesterday.  Its their 2nd CE plus ( in this case minus) the assets we have picked up.  We will review updated 4Q with Stan on Tuesday afternoon.

I will have to check with EEOS unless you already have.

Sorry for the delay, I had to talk to Rod.

I do not have a copy.  Steve Harris sent to Danny directly.

Tracy,  can you send us a copy of what was submitted for TW-  thanks   MK
Per your request, attached is the 2002 "Worry list for NNG Commercial.

 << File: worry_list 2002.doc >> 

Danny, Tracy,

Please see revised slides.  Steve is talking about TransPecos, so I didn't include in my bit.

 

Eric,
     I think that TransPecos needs to show up here too.
Dan

Danny,

Please see the attached slides an Asset Dev.  Steve Dowd pulled the earlier slides that were included for Corp Dev. Let me know if you would like to make any modifications.  Tracey is working to a Monday deadline for Stan's book.

 << File: Budget Meeting 092401.ppt >> 

I would say expect to file to TW slide for Sun Devil.  I am checking on the connections to gas fired plants.

Comments	

Attached pls find drafts of the ETS slides for the 3Q Investor Presentation.  I would like to get your comments prior to giving to Stan.  Pls let me know if you would like to discuss.  Also is there anything of significance that I have left out?  Anything incorrect or needs revision?  Pls let me have your comments as soon as possible.  Thanks! 

 << File: gay.ppt >>  [Mayeux, Gay]  		 

ask her to let us know the outcome of the conversation tomorrow asap.

thanks

Mary - Regarding the 100883 and 1000222, Mike Terraso will be meeting with Mr. Horton tomorrow.  Regarding 140196, I've attached below the description of the group.  Additionally, John Brindle, the cost center owner, mentioned that both Mr. Horton and Phil Lowry are aware of the group's activities and costs.

Please let me know if you need anything further.

Regards, 
Elizabeth

Business Controls is responsible for corporate security, including personnel, physical and technical security matters.  This involves conducting investigations, setting policies and procedures and working with appropriate security elements within the business units.  The group also coordinates and facilitates Enron's crisis response efforts.  Finally, it provides business intelligence on selected issues to senior management.

	Elizabeth,
	In the Corp. allocations there are 410,000 dollars budgeted to ETS for cc 100883.  Mr. Horton has an agreement that none of the costs from this cc shall be assessed to any of the pipes in ETS.  Please have these costs removed from your allocation to ETS.  Thank you.

	Also, can you provide me some information regarding the costs for cc 100222, Gov't Affairs Environment and cc 140196, Business Controls.  We are meeting with Mr. Horton next week and would like to provide him some explanation of the work that makes up these costs.  If you could respond by Tuesday, Oct. 9, that would be very helpful.  Thank you.
	Mary

The SAP costs were included in the ETS overhead in Adaytum.  We have taken that out and added to each pipes Corporate Direct.  The cost of $6.0 million will be divided equally amongst the four pipes.  Mary will change all but NBP.  Cheryl please make change for NBP.  This is per Rod's instructions.  When we get the user list we will revise.

Thanks

Tracy

I believe in 2001 it was $5.5.  Clean Fuels and HPL received some in 2001 and not any in 2002.

Our budget for SAP was $700,000 for 2001.  Has it really gone up that much ($6,000,000 divided by four is $1,500,000)?

Sorry for the late notice, but here's the info on September capital charge:

As was done for the 2Q flash in June, we will be using an estimate for the September Capital Charge.  However, unlike last time, we will rely on each of you to estimate your September (and Q3) capital charge, since we will be truing up to actuals YTD in October.  Please send us (myself and Terry West) what you will be incorporating into your flash.  If you have any questions, please give one of us a call.

Thanks,

Please find below the agenda for the 2002 Plan Review with Stan on Friday, October 12 in 49C2.

Danny has requested that the following people attend from his group: Steve Harris, Bob Hayes, Dave Neubauer, Eric Gadd, Rob Kilmer, Mary Kay Miller, Shelley Corman, Joe Hartsoe and Kent Miller.  Please bring anyone else you think is appropriate.  You should plan on attending from 10:00-1:00.

Rod has requested that Jerry Peters, Jim Saunders, Steve Gilbert and John Keiser attend.  John and Steve need to sit in on their respective commercial group and may sit in on the other pipelines as well.

Stan's other direct reports are not required to attend.  We will primarily discuss the commercial groups' 2002 strategy.

I will need a headcount for breakfast and lunch.  Please let Kathy Campos know if you are attending, what time you will be there for and your location (Houston or Omaha) by the end of the day today.

 << OLE Object: Microsoft PowerPoint Slide >> 

I have attached the current estimate.  I am not sure it is right because I was confused on how they have been booking it.  I feel comfortable that the total year is right.  Its the line that totals $118 for the year.

 

Was this already estimated for the current estimate, or should I just estimate and include in flash?

We have a sale to CES on ANR on Jan 13th - deal 149430.  The volume is 34,248 
dts and the price is $2.22.  
I did not Bill CES for this deal.  According to Tom Donohoe, CES owed ANR the 
gas and we paid it back in January.  Tom said CES was going to pay us for 
this.  Should I bill the Retail group for this?  It looks more like a 
wholesale transaction.

There is a sale to CES for a volume of 34,248 dts, deal 149430.  It has your 
name on it.  My conterpart at CES does not recognize it.  According to Unify 
the downstream k# is 94946.  If you did this deal, do you remember who you 
did the deal with?

Thanks.

We parked gas (deal 240072) on the 8th and the 9th and we are pulling it out 
(deal 240073) on the 10th.  ENA will pay Transco $.055 times the daily 
balance.

This is more CNG fuel waiver stuff.  Thanks

I've talked to Jackie and am following up w/ an E-Mail as soon as I get the 
contract numbers from Gloria.  So there
!

There is a sale to CES for a volume of 34,248 dts, deal 149430.  It has your 
name on it.  My conterpart at CES does not recognize it.  According to Unify 
the downstream k# is 94946.  If you did this deal, do you remember who you 
did the deal with?

Thanks.

According to Kimat this is flash to actual stuff now.  I made these 
adjustments today for Nov 30th.

Joann, Alvin, the deals listed below are bookouts.

Terry, please call Jack Meyers (304-623-8811) at CNG Transmission and have 
these meters moved from CES/CEM pools to Enron's pools.  I think all you need 
to do is send CNG a letter  requesting;

   "Please move all meters flowing into contract 8G0A61 to contract 8G0011".

If CNG needs meter information, maybe you could send them the statement they 
send to Gloria,  I believe CES/CEM has 11 contracts.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

thanks

The CES/CEM CNG Appalachian production is still flowing into the CES/CEM 
gathering and transmission contracts.  Unless someone objects I would like to 
get this moved over to Enron's pool.  We don't need to have the gathering and 
transmission contracts moved over.

Comments/questions?

We received a prior period adjustment (December activity) on the 
JanuaryTransco invoices for CES.  Its a credit of $6,432.31.  Its releated to 
the Lilco capacity CES Retail receives each month.  This credit should be 
passed through to CES.  How is that being handled?

As always, they catch me at my most beautiful pose.

We have a 5,000 day purchase from Bay State that we can take at CNG/Trco 
Leidy or at CNG South pool meter 10002.  The deal number is 418282.  Could we 
put this deal number on the CNG and/or Trco sheet?
We currently have this deal baseloaded to CNG South Pool.  We need to call 
Bay State if we move it.

My contact at Bay State is Stacey Djukic 219-853-4320.  I gave Stacey Angie's 
number as a contact.  If we can't get in touch with Stacey, then talk to 
Robin.

FYI, I just wanted to make sure we had CES's approval.

I havn't worked on any of the April pricing in the system yet.  I'm working 
fast and furious on March.  I was going to do most of April next week with 
Molly.  Can I give it to you then?

Also, we can waive the 25% undertake limit on Texas Gas and Algonquin if you 
are ok with that.  Just let me know.  I also mentioned the intra day storage

Do we still need to be transporting Bridgeport CNG produciton gas through

I think the National Fuel is local production.  I'm don't know how you would

Hi campers.  Its that time of month again, I need all the transport

I do love chocolate malts though.  i guess that's what us low life forms live

and still are

Brian, I'm Fed Exing you copies of all the transport invoices today with the 
following exceptions:

Transco:  I missing some of the demand charges and all of the commodity 
charges.

I am still updating my transport capacity sheet with actuals and I will be 
making a billing adjustment this Friday.  I have not review all the invoices 
I am sending you.  And I have made copies for Don.  I will give him his 
copies on Friday or Monday.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I've gone through most of the CES stuff for Jan.  I'm missing several demand

Secondary non-recallable, you can use $.14 year round

OR

$.05 for Apr-Oct which is probably a little high and $.15 for the winter.

The non-recallable factor is the hard thing to figure in.

OK this is metered production on CNG.

Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with.
The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES 
production.

After Gloria lets us know which contract(s) to use, Angie will path this deal 
in Sitara with a zero volume.

through Aug00.

T&F Operating has sent ENA a "breach of contract" letter and is requesting to 
terminate the contract effective 4/1/2000.

Colleen, I will give you a copy of the letter that was faxed to John Singer.

CES did a buy/sale behind Penn Fuel on CGAS for 1 year starting Nov 1, 1999.  
T&F is the supplier and Glenn Gary was the market.   The market went away 
effective 4/1/2000 and ENA/EES has no other market behind this part of Penn 
Fuel's system.  We checked with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and 
according to Penn Fuel, they can't take it either.

T&F is looking for their payment for Jan, Feb, and Mar, and T&F will waive 
any and all "cover" cost that ENA would otherwise be liable for subsequent to 
April 1, 2000.

John Singer wants to make sure we address the hedges in the books - will this 
need to be included in the CES true-up?  Also, John wants to know if he 
should sign the letter?.  Colleen, I told John you would anwser that question.

The following info was provided to me by Leah Moss at Tetco.

Meters 71979 and 71980 are on non-contiguous laterals.  Tetco doesn't know 
how this gas flows.  They are still checking into this one.  It may actually 
flow into CNG.,

Meters 72554 and 72803 are "normal" Tetco M2 meters.  This gas is a backhaul 
to Winridge and Hooker [make sure you use the backhaul contract] and a 
forwardhaul to Delmont and Oakford.  The forwardhaul fuel is 4.11%.

Hey dudes, we need someone to attend this.  I'm thinking Scott Goodell should

Notice to all Appalachian Pool Operators:           Received 3/29/00  2:00 pm
Reclassification Notice                            Posted 3/29/00  2:00 pm

On February 10, 1999, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549, granting CNG 
Transmission's (CNGT's) request for reclassification of various transmission 
lines to gathering lines.  As part of that Docket, several transmission lines 
were denied to gathering.  On March 12, 1999, CNGT filed for rehearing to 
further support the reclassification of the lines denied reclassification.   
On March 21, 2000, the FERC approved Docket No. CP97-549-001, granting 
reclassification of five lines from transmission lines to gathering lines.  
The newly reclassified gathering lines include: D-2149, H-19921, LN-943, 
H-124 and H-21777 south of Bradley Compressor Station.  On March 22, 2000, 
CNGT filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective 
April 1, 2000.  Although the FERC has not yet granted approval of the tariff 
sheets, CNGT is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff 
sheets, CNGT will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/Dt. and a fuel 
retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above.  If you have 
questions regarding this notice, please contact Nancy Aucremanne at 
(304) 623-8698 or Celesta Miracle at (304) 623-8262.

Dear Pool Operator:

 CNG Transmission Corporation (CNGT) plans to take its Hastings 
Extraction Plant (H.E.P.) out of service to perform annual maintenance 
starting at 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, September 12, 2000.  This requires 
that the "wet gas" system behind the H.E.P. in West Virginia be shut in.  
The plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no 
unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.  Normal plant operations 
are scheduled to resume on Tuesday, October 3, 2000.  All questions 
concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed 
to CNGT's local operations supervisor in the production area.

 Unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets 
other than on CNGT, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. 
on Monday, September 11, 2000.  This will allow our compressor stations 
to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight 
and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.  As per 
CNGT's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in CNGT 
considering 
the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your 
pool.

 As the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult 
to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your 
pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with CNGT's 
local operations supervisor. We are also asking that all pool operators 
notify producers in their pool of this shut in.  CNGT will not notify 
producers individually.

 We appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.  I also wanted 
to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us 
to avoid shutting down the plant next year.  The next regularly scheduled 
shut       down will not be until 2002.

 If you have any questions about this letter, please feel free to

 Note:  Throughout the spring and fall, we will be conducting various shut-in 
tests,
 maintenance, and repairs on our storage pools.  While we will make every 
effort 
to mitigate the effect of these tests, they could have some effect on our 
overall operations.

I segmented the rest of our Tetco capacity this morning effective the 4th.  
Please update your morning sheet with new AN52's.

Thanks

Scott Goodell thinks this might be wholesale capacity for April and May.  
This is the first time I've heard about this.  I believe Joanie said this 
capacity is primary to Op 3 which doesn't do much for us.  

I need to know if we have to take this space.  I would prefer not to take the 
space if we don't have to.

Joanie will send us an email after she checks with the CES asset management 
group.

I need to check on this.  I need to make sure we are not paying for this.  If 
it turns out to be retail, I will make sure I give CES credit for the 
transport.

Just found out that we have acces to 15,000 of Aritech's capacity on TCO for
Apr & May, for $0.01, primary COH 3-15. Can we replace capacity ENA bought for
4/1 and would there be any cost?

Hey guys.  I was in surgery Friday, everything went OK.  I'm only here 1/2 
day today and it's pretty much caos today because the whole gas department 
changed floors over the weekend.  Let me know if there are any issues we need 
to address right away.

Charlie, I would like to talk about the daily pricing if you get a chance.

Thanks.

Hey, you should see us up here.  We are real nice and close.  I was out 
Friday and we moved from 31 to 32.  The schedulers are up here with us, 
although we are so far apart, you still need to use the squawk box to chat 
with 'em.

I have an appointment to get fitted for a suit tonite and then I;m going 
drinkin after that.  Is it ok we leave tomorrow?

Transco
Beverly has all the numbers.  Either Scott or Beavy needs to go into Transit 
Dan, next week we can probably create at least another 40,000 effective next 
Wed.

Tetco
We ran out of credit on ECT.  Scott will talk to Trish Meigs about that in 
the morning.  Kathy has a list of all the offer numbers that need to be 
executed.  AFTER the all offers have been executed, have Meredith check 
screen AN52 effective 4/1/2000.  Kathy, you might be able to do this too.  

Dan, I think you will be hurting for Tetco capacity.  Remember, we did 
release 3500 dts of Ela to M2 to IGS.

CNG
We have no fuel waivers from Canajoharie for April.  I just never got around 
to requesting them.  

Scott, Call Cindy McGinnis at 304-623-8854 and ask for fuel waivers on 
contract 5A2500 from Iroq/Canojaharie (meter 41101) to the following meters
NIMO East 20550, NIMO West 20500, East Ohio 20100, NYSEG 20700, RG&E 20600, 
and Hanley & Bird 21100.  I left her a voicemail to call you.  Ask her if we 
can send in the paperwork next week.  Let Scott Hendrickson, Robin, and Dick 
know what fuel waivers CNG approves.  I have all the CNG contracts on the 
worksheet.

I will be calling in the morining.

Hi Team!  I will be out of the office on Friday, March 31st.  Please call 
Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 with any questions you may have.

Later

Dynergi released the CGAS capcity to us for one month so we could do it non 
bidable.  Scott, it looks recallable.  Its parcel number 28464.  Vol=7500, 
receipt point is Leach, delivery point is City of Richmond.  The rate is 
$2.40 = $.08.

Everything looks good except the recallable factor.

Also, there is a small NYSEG release for 24 dt's at max rate, offer #28446.  
I can't get my machine to print out the forms.

Good Luck.

Glad to hear things are going well.  talk to you later,.

Chris,
I am turning the Hunt Petroleum deals for the East desk over to Tricia 
Truong.  When you find out who we are suppose to pay for the deals below, you 
can let her know.

Tricia,
Pam will get with you about the Koch piece.

Megan
	
	

I am told that you are the one to ask about CES deals.  I have some CES deals 
for Hunt Petroleum that Hunt says they should not be paid for.  The details 
are below.  I am trying to find out who to pay.

Megan
	
	

There are three deals entered under Hunter Petroleum which Hunt says should 
not be paid to them.  Deal 136863 they say should be paid to Aviare Energy.  
Deal 136835 and deal 136845 they say should be paid to Hassie Hunt.  Can you 
tell me who we are suppose to pay for these meters?  Their payment is due on 
Monday, so whatever you can tell me today would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Megan

Hey team!  I probably won't be here when these are due.  After you finish 
working on the sheet, print one copy for Kim Brown.  

Thanks :)

I have some suggested Gas Daily pricing on the attached.  I will discuss this 
with Charlie.

FYI
Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2:  The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month 
changes does appear to be an issue.  Since the contract didn't spell out in 
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we 
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly 
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location.  I know Chris 
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not 
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie.  I will ask that he forward 
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP.  Let me know if 
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3.  Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms 
here.   Here is what is happening:  Your people are nominating this 
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations), 
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction.  That 
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.   We are 
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between 
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual 
contract prices with the producers.  So, this is one issue we will have to 
address as indemnification items.  That's problem one.  Problem two is that I 
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all 
the nominations.  We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is 
what you want).  For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the 
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from 
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.   I'll 
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4.  Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like 
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the 
pipeline invoices on to you.  Maybe we should change this process to one 
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his 
confirmation and review of all the charges.  This means you may see quite a 
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something.  Let us know what 
you would prefer.  Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that 
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to 
your office yesterday, March 29.  Chris will get all remaining demand charge 
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is 
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7.  I apologize for the delay.

5.  Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a 
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on 
Monday.  Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you?  If not, please 
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory 
balances.

I forgot the storage attachment ...
Melissa Flewellyn
03/28/2000 01:32 PM

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

The following info was provided to me by Leah Moss at Tetco.

Meters 71979 and 71980 are on non-contiguous laterals.  Tetco doesn't know 
how this gas flows.  They are still checking into this one.  It may actually 
flow into CNG.,

Meters 72554 and 72803 are "normal" Tetco M2 meters.  This gas is a backhaul 
to Winridge and Hooker [make sure you use the backhaul contract] and a 
forwardhaul to Delmont and Oakford.  The forwardhaul fuel is 4.11%.

We have decided to make Texas Gas Zone 4 an "East" desk pipe as oppossed to 
"Market East".  Please let me know if you think there might be any problems.

Your back!!!  I almost called Spencer to chat.

Opps!

Hi gang.  I'm fairly certain I entered this parking deal wrong for Feb.  We 
will have to look at it next week.

Deal 162283 and 162282.  We parked gas at S. Commack on Iroq and I think the 
counterparty should be CPR Exchange as opposed to Iroquois. 

we will chat.

You are most welcome even though you are too much of a tight wade to buy my 
capacity.

There were pretty good.  Thanks, I needed that!  md

Mr. Monroy entered deal 218918 in Sitara on 3/15/2000 with a Tagg # NC3056.

please.

in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

Chris is the CES expert .

The contract for Hunt Petroleum has been assigned from CES to Enron.  I need 
someone to change the names on deals 136863, 135898 and 136845 from CES-Hunt 
Petroleum to Hunt Petroleum (without CES).  All of the deals are on the East 
desk.  Let me know if this request is to go to one of you or if I need to 
forward this to someone else.

Thanks,

Hi team.  FYI - I just received the CALP invoice for Feb today in my inbox.  
I mailed it to Mark just so he could have a non-faxed copy for his files.

FYI.  Effective 4/1/2000, ENA will no longer have the Rubin Resources gas at 
Hastings.  He had about 10,000 dths a month at Hastings.  However, we will 
continue to get his gas at Bridgeport, which was only one meter.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Heidi

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for
and          .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with today's 
date
contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points indicated.
The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed at 
a
specific point.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

this exact setup on several contracts today.

Sylvia A Campos

Chris,
Will you have the same contract # and the same Pipeline under Market East
and East in the same month?  If so, this would mean 2 different Global Nos.
and that would create a problem downstream.  Please advise.

Sylvia

Chris Germany

Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up 
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, 
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.  
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes 
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same 
contract under both desk.

show up in Unify on the right desk?  Also how do we assure flash is on right 
desk or is this not going to be an issue if we are using the Service P & l to 
flash?  If we use the Service P & L to flash, will the transport info in 
Unify and the flash amts. be the same and on the same desk?  How this makes 
sense!

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

Brenda H Fletcher

This contract number appears twice on the Service List in Path Manager with 
different deal numbers ( 151880 & 156569). Is this duplication in error and 
should one be killed  ?  The rate schedule is FSS.  I couldn't find demand 
expense for this contract on the invoice. Is this a pipeline error ?

Since we now feel certain ENA bought this gas on Jan 21st, please path the 
supply deal from COH (deal 153863) to one of those large CES deal tickets.

I'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from CES.

Joanne, to the best of your recollection, this gas did go to CES, correct?

deal. I will keep you posted. Thanks, Rob

that this was Buy/Sell or incremental. CES or EES? I have a supply but no 
market. Thanks

Victor Lamadrid
03/10/2000 03:21 PM
Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an 
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and 
replace with this purchase.

Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, purchase.

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he 
needs to get this pathed in the system.

Thanks all.

Robert/Victor,

Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)...

Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen 
contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party 
gives 90 day written notice to end the contract.  

I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.  Which one of 
you is it?

I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk.  Susan, you can toss this.

We borrowed (deal227922) about 22,000 dt from CNG for the 28th and we will 
pay it back (deal 227926) on the 29th.  ENA will pay CNG $.03 times the daily 
balance on the 28th.  This gets confusing because we already have a parking 
deal from the weekend that comes out in April.

Mary Theresa Franklin will be working on all the gathering stuff.  She and I 
will be getting together tomorrow afternoon at 12:30.  Actually, you could 
set the priorities for us.  What should we work on first?

Brenda H Fletcher

going to enter?

I would change it to an IT gathering contract.  I didn't know we had any firm 
gathering in the Market area.  And currently, I am not working on the other 
gathering contracts.  

Brenda H Fletcher
03/27/2000 11:53 AM
The invoiced rate on this contract is for  interruptible gathering but the 
information on the deal reflects a Firm contract. How do you suggest handling 
so the contract type, rate schedule and firmness are consistent with the 
pipeline?

Also, there are 10 contracts that we were invoiced for processing charges 
that are not on the Service List in Path Manager for Feb.
Are you working on getting contracts and deals added?

Thanks,
Brenda

Chris--Attached is the spreadsheet that we spoke of earlier today.  I have 
made
the correction to TCO Op 2, Mkt Area 20 into NYSEG (i.e. +854 dth/day).   I
will make the necessary changes to the AGL volumes over the next few minutes.
As we discussed, we'll need to resolve the question about Central Hudson off
Iroquois (we may not need any volumes there since Duke is the supplier), and 
as
I said, we'll be discussing our needs into southern Connecticut on a firm 
basis
with other suppliers.   I am also attaching the spreadsheet with the storage
injections for assigned storage.   I believe that we need to negotiate the
price for all of the  April storage injections.

Since we now feel certain ENA bought this gas on Jan 21st, please path the 
supply deal from COH (deal 153863) to one of those large CES deal tickets.

I'm still checking the tapes to see if we can recoup the cost from CES.

Joanne, to the best of your recollection, this gas did go to CES, correct?

Chris, Deal # 153683, Please take a look at this and see if you can confirm 
that this was Buy/Sell or incremental. CES or EES? I have a supply but no 
market. Thanks

Victor Lamadrid
03/10/2000 03:21 PM
Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an 
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and 
replace with this purchase.

Stephanie,
Can you change the year from 2001 to 2000 on the deal, please. 
Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, purchase.

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he 
needs to get this pathed in the system.

Thanks all.

Robert/Victor,

Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)...

Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

I am told that you are the one to ask about CES deals.  I have some CES deals 
for Hunt Petroleum that Hunt says they should not be paid for.  The details 
are below.  I am trying to find out who to pay.

Megan
	
	

There are three deals entered under Hunter Petroleum which Hunt says should 
not be paid to them.  Deal 136863 they say should be paid to Aviare Energy.  
Deal 136835 and deal 136845 they say should be paid to Hassie Hunt.  Can you 
tell me who we are suppose to pay for these meters?  Their payment is due on 
Monday, so whatever you can tell me today would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Hey Jennifer and Dale,
I checked with Scott Neal and Dick Jenkins and they're on board with having 
all 4 trading locations available for our customers starting April on EOL (if 
possible with you guys of course).  The 2 existing locations are CNG SABINE 
NORTH POINT & CNG SABINE SOUTH POINT and the two new proposed locations will 
be CNG TRANSMISSION TTT SOUTH POOL & CNG TRANSMISSION TTT NORTH POOL.   There 
may be some confusion among our EOL customers with the similar names to these 
points so we have to be careful how we differentiate the names of the 4 
points.    The Enron trader responsible for the 2 new CNG Transmission 
locations will be Scott Hendrickson.  The business systems director at CNG  
Transmission who requested this of me is Iris King.  Her phone number is 
304-623-8213 and her e-mail is iris_g._king@cngt.cng.com.  She is also 
onboard with having the locations available to trade on EOL as soon as 
possible.

If I can provide any more info.to you, please let me know.   THANKS AGAIN IN 
ADVANCE!!!!!! 
  

	
	                           
	

Victor,
Thanks for the information. It is good to know people outside of the company 
are wanting additional locations to trade on EOL.
Can you let me know which trader will be trading this location? Dale Neuner, 
in our group, will coordinate adding these locations
for EOL trading.
Thanks!

Victor Lamadrid
03/23/2000 04:26 PM
Hey Jennifer,  How are you?

We had a meeting with CNG Transmission today.  They have rolled out a new 
pooling service for their customers called CNG Transmission North pool and 
CNG Transmission South pool.  It's different than CNG South Point and CNG 
North Point.  These last two pertain to CNG Sabine Hub Services.  As they 
have presented these new services to their customers, all of their customers 
are inquiring as to whether or not EOL will be trading these two new 
locations in the future.  These new services on CNG Transmission have the 
benefit over CNG Sabine Hub Services pools of being free for the time being 
(until October at least)....How do we go about adding these two new trading 
locations on EOL.  Volumes can be transferred from CNG Sabine Hub Services 
points over to CNG Transmission pools at no cost and we are actually starting 
to set up our supplies and markets in this manner to save on pooling costs 
for April.   I have a contact that you can talk to at CNG Transmission if you 
would like.. Please let me know and thanks in advance!!!!

That stuff will just make you fat!  You keep that up and you will never have 
a slim & trim figure like I do!!

Right.  Price for 24th is $2.88 - .005= $2.875

jwhited@columbiaenergygroup.com on 03/24/2000 07:43:34 AM
Just to verify, this is Gas Daily Columbia App Midpoint for 3/23/2000 -$0.005.
Correct.

We are parking gas in Egan on the 30th (deal 508572) and taking it out 
rateably in January (deal 508582).  ENA will pay EGAN $.22 x total volume 
parked.

These deals are seperate form the Nov-Dec parking deals.

Currently, I show we are parking a total of 145,052 (to be taken out in 
December) and a whopping 48,025 (to be taken out in January).

Lia, please make sure these volumes show up on Texas Gas - let me know if you 
have questions.

Thanks

Right.  Price for 24th is $2.88 - .005= $2.875

jwhited@columbiaenergygroup.com on 03/24/2000 07:43:34 AM
Just to verify, this is Gas Daily Columbia App Midpoint for 3/23/2000 -$0.005.
Correct.

I changed the volume on the deal to 15,324 dts.

Charlie, this is a deal Dick Jenkins did with John.  ENA is buying this gas 
from CES at GD - $.005

Let me know if you have questions.

Joan Veselack@ENRON
03/23/2000 05:32 PM
This is the true amount that Enron is buying back from Allied.

mainline to leach to allied = 12809/12426/12163
tco pool to allied  = 2898/2837

Total delivery cut  = 12163+2837 = 15,000
Total at pool  = 12426+2898 = 15,324

By golly.... the 15,000 grossed up is 15,324. Chris, thinking you want the 
15,324 on the ticket for the 5 days. John ... do you agree too?!?!  The deal 
ticket is 225366.

Thanks

Joan Veselack
03/23/2000 03:56 PM
In case anyone cares.... did the SIT withdrawal nom's to Allied Plant on the 
FTS idle capacity. Effective 3/24 to 3/29. This will better help match the 
burns for Allied.

39095/84 was = 0  now = 12163
62672/13 was = 0   now = 2837

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Joan Veselack
03/23/2000 11:50 AM
John, per voicemail. Reduced deliveries to Allied Plant by 90,000 or 
15,000/day, effective 3/24 to 3/29.

39095/124  was = 12809/12426/12163 now = 0  (super nom from mainline pool to 
Allied plant)
37862/14  was = 0    now = 12809/12426 (mainline to leach)
37147/2478 was = 0   now = 12426/12426 (leach to TCO)
62672/12  was = 3405/3333  now = 507/496 (TCO agg to Allied plant)

Total reduced to Allied Plant:

39095/14  12163 reduction
62672/12  2837  reduction

Total  15,000 reduction

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Joanie's email to me about the Roanoke  pricing has me curious.  Do I need to 
check the pricing on all the wholesale CES deals?

I do have some reports which Paul Drexelius gave me in January out of CES's 
GMS system.  Dick had asked me to sit with Paul one afternoon and talk about 
the deals.  I have not done any price verification or auditing of the deals 
in Sitara.

Let me know if you want me to audit Sitara.

According to the CES Data Room book, the price on this deal is IF CGAS + 
.015.  I changed it in Sitara effective Jan 1, 2000 - Nov 30, 2001.

Joan Veselack@ENRON
03/23/2000 05:56 PM
Robin, Tom Clark at PG&E called and is not taking the 4400/day for April 2000.

Chris and Scott, please check deal ticket 145312 for correct pricing. The CES 
deal term date  is 12/1/98 to 12/1/2001 and gms # is s-roanoke-2746.

I extended the Enron deal ticket to match the CES deal term. Not sure what 
the pricing should be. 

Thanks.

Yuck!  Some of this looked spooky.  Baseball tickets:  you and your buddy 
Maureen go to the game on Tuesday, June 6th.  I believe the Astro's play MIN.

Actually, my preference would be to have the contract released to ENA year 
round.  This means Robin would have to bill CALP for the commodity and demand 
during the summer.  Depending on the relationship you would like to have with 
the customer, I think it is easier to bill the customer for the demand and 
the commodity as opposed to reimbursing them for when we use the transport 
(at least with the way things work in our systems).

Joan.Veselack@enron.com on 03/23/2000 06:35:15 PM
Paulette,

It's not Enron's intention to have Calp fund the OPT 60 payment. Enron
would like for Calp to release the capacity in Enron's name during the
winter period, and this would send the bills directly to Enron and
eliminate funding by Calp and reimbursement of Enron to Calp. We can look
at this again next winter. I'm not sure why there was a delayed payment
once Calp gave Enron the bill a month ago. I'll ask Mark Feldman about wire
transfers.

Thanks again for your patience.

pheuer@EdisonMission.Com on 03/23/2000 05:45:18 PM

Joan,

The deal with CES was that the invoice would be paid upon receipt.  It was
never
CALP's intent to fund the OPT 60 payment.  As requested, I will faxed
February's
bill to Robin.  Since the January payment is so late, could you have
January and
February's payments wire transferred to CALP's account?

Thanks!

Paulette

Joan.Veselack@enron.com on 03/23/2000 06:08:57 PM

Roman and Paulette,

Sorry for the delay. January's check will be sent out tomorrow, Friday
March 24th. As soon as Mark Feldman (Enron payment God) receives February's
bill, he can pay this one too.

Thank you for your patience during this transition.

I'm running a temp today and threw up a bunch last night.   If I don't shake
this stuff before tomorrow, I'm not coming for the Dr. meeting.   I really do

According to Mr. Goodell, Tetco has Teal Lodge on the seller's block.  I 
think you should buy it.

 - EVOLUT~1.GIF

I entered the sale to Allegheny in Sitara (deal 224977) effective 4/1/200 
thru 10/31/2000.

Dick, Scott, the sales price is trigger deal priced at  NX1 + $.22.  
Allegheny holds the trigger and the daily volume is 1,532 day at Leach or the 
CGAS pool.

My contact at Allegheny is Nat Miljus (phone 412-394-2953).

David is going to make me fill out a term ticket and I'm running it through 
Dick's book.

This is ok for March.

CES is swinging on Tennessee deliveries at Brookshire.  We have sale 207146

Scott

Is Dayton showing the price to be 
 1.  $2.47 and $2.455

 2.  $2.47 +.17 and $2.455 + .17?

To me it looks like options 2.

Under contract 96029523, deal 145321, ENA billed at rate of IF.CGAS.APPAL-MI 
= $2.76.  The rate customer is showing is tiered as follows: 145,000 mmbtu @ 
$2.47 and 145,000 mmbtu @ $2.455.  Please verify if volumes should be at 
tiered pricing.

Thank you,

I need to pull my tapes for Jan 21st.  Would you take care of that please?

What's this - according to Navigator, we only have this contract for 1 day on 
Feb 23rd?  I just entered it in the ces retail sheet.  MDQ = 5000 and the 
rate is $.01?  Who did this deal?

The receipt points are Exxon-Chalkley, NGPL, and Tenn-Egan.   The delivery 
point is Rayne.  It looks like we nominated gas on this contract.  I'm 
setting up this up in Sitara and on our 2000tran02.xls worksheet and I 
entered it in Sitara deal 223022.

Jesse, this will need to be scheduled in Unify.

pulled up deal 158501 and added a demand charge for k#66394

i added deal 223021, cglf k#66281 for feb to sitara.  what is this capacity 
for?  its FTS 1 at rate $1.1600

Cindy/CNG is looking at the park and loan deal.  She laughed when I said gave 
her the volume of 100,000.  The most she will consider is 50,000.  So I told 
her to look at a total storage volume of 50,000 and ENA would pay $4500.00 in 
demand charges each month.  She needs to think about it.  I'm out tomorrow 
but I will call her.

Also, we are actually looking at -25,000 to 25,000 and we would be billed 
fuel if the deal rolls from 1 month to the next.  

Steve will find out what the pricing is and will let me know.

Take a look at the "Spot Deals" tab in this worksheet and let me know if I'm 
missing anything.  My comments are on row 5.  Everything else on this sheet 
is a work in progress.

That's ok.  I need to buy back  the gas CES is not taking.  I think that will 
be easier to do after the month is over.  I will calculate the volume and 
pricing in a worksheet and just enter a buy and a sale with CES on the last 
day of the month.

DPL has issued an OFO for Thursday the 23rd and Friday the 24th.  I will need
to adjust my volumes as follows:

23rd - cut volume of 1203 to 883 dth on TGT K# 6057

24th - cut volume of 1203 to 823 dth on TGT K# 6057

Effective the 25th - 31st, please keep my volumes at 1203 dth per day.

DPL may revise the OFO - in the event of a revision, Marianne Stiles is aware
of the changes that need to be made.  I will be out of the office Wed.
afternoon and all day Friday.

I'm out tomorrow and if I win the Lotto tomorrow nite, Mr. Goodell will be a

jporte1@columbiaenergygroup.com on 03/21/2000 03:22:27 PM
how about we try this tomorrow when I have a clue?

For Jan, the difference between volumetric and demand was less than $200.00

   

How does this compare with the charges shown to us by CES?

I don't think 3rd times a charm.  Did you go to scholl at a&m buddy???

The far right column is winter and next to that is summer

I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find.

CGLF k#64502 ;  This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West 
Cam Devon production.  The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dts 
and the commodity is $.0024.  According to my notes; this is a volumetric 
demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648

I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the 
worksheet.

Comments/Questions?

That's all good and well buy where is my Diet Coke???

This deal is starting to get confusing.... so here is the whole deal 
effective 3/21 to 3/31.

  gulf / leach/coh 22-3

38011/46 8979/8711/8527
51875/25 3657/3548/3473
60599/7  3159/3065/3000
63895/6  3686/3576/3500
63895/8  0/1917/1876  This piece from TCO pool.

No contracts are currently overrun.

Cindy/Kathy/Jesse - we are pulling 19481 from your p20 pool on contract 
63895, which max's out the contract. Any additional Aristech coh 22-3 sale 
will  have to be from TCO pool.

Kara - we are delivering to coh 22-3 as follows:
38011 = 8527
51875 = 3473
60599 = 3000
63895 = 5376

John - I have 550,154 being pulled from p20 for the month. I hope that ties 
to your number. I cannot pull any additional gas from p20, because this would 
overrun your FTS1 contract. The 1 dkt SIT can be made up from Enron's TCO 
pool. Please verify that this is okay. I'll schedule it for 3/23 gas day.

Thank you everyone for your patience!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I sold CES 2727dt of CGLF mainline gas (deal 221731) effective 21st-31st.  
Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt.  I changed 
the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool 
(deal 222359) for a volume of 1917 dt.

 2727 - 751 = 1976 at mainline.  
1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool.

Price = $2.77
 .1045  variable cost mainline to Leach
 .0250  demand charge 
Please let me know if you have any questions.

Looks pretty empty so far.

Chris, if you'll make time for me, show me what you are expecting me to take 
over for you and how to do it... I would be thrilled to get some of this 
stuff off your hands!

For the balance of March, CNG has granted ENA fuel waivers from 
Iroq/Canajoharie to the following CNG citygates; NIMO (East & West), NYSEG, 
and Hanley & Bird.  According to this morning's sheet, we are delivering 
about 11,000 dt to these 4 delivery points.

Following are 2 ways of getting the gas into CNG at Canajoharie.

1.  Idle some of our Tenn Z6 capacity and flow Iroquois in to CNG.  At 
today's prices we save:
 
 Savings
 Tenn Variable $.0491   at $3.00
 CNG Fuel $.0672  at  $2.88
                                               ------------
 Total Savings $.1151
 
 At these prices, if the Tenn Z6 and CNG pool spread is inside $.1100, we 
should idle Tenn capacity and deliver Iroq to Canajoharie

2.  Buy Waddington, get an IT discount from Wadd to Canajoharie.  We save the 
CNG fuel cost.  This usually only works when Iroq shows a discounted rate of 
$.04 to $.06.
 

Last year, CNG granted most of these fuel waivers all summer.

I sold CES 2727dt of CGLF mainline gas (deal 221731) effective 21st-31st.  
Aristech only had enough mainline capacity to pull away 751 dt.  I changed 
the volume on this deal and created another sale to CES at the CGAS pool 
(deal 222359) for a volume of 1917 dt.

 2727 - 751 = 1976 at mainline.  
1976 at mainline less fuel of 2.988% = 1917 at the CGAS pool.

Price = $2.77
 .1045  variable cost mainline to Leach
 .0250  demand charge 
Please let me know if you have any questions.

9:30 and 10:00

What time did you call?  I was playing on the computer about 9:30 on.  I 
didn't get any capacity either!  Turkeys!

Robin called NYPA.  The transport contract has been amended and the only 2 
receipt points on the contract are Mamou and Henry.  

Bummer.

Chris Germany
11/28/2000 10:44 AM
Unofficially, according to Transco, NYPA has 4 receipt points on their FT-NT 
contract.  Transco gave me the receipt volumes in MCF's and I used a 1.035 
Btu factor.  I can't 

Point  Volume MCF  dts 
Henry  12,336   12,768
Mamou  7,849   8,124
Carthage 4,934   5,107
Ada  7,401   7,660  (at the east end on the north LA lateral leg in TGT Zone 
1) 

   Total  33,659

My numbers must be off a little somewhere because NYPA's MDQ is 30,840 dts, 
grossed up for fuel of 7.62%, the receipt volume is 33,384 dts.  To my 
knowledge, we have never used ADA (which I know nothing about) or Carthage.

Currently we are giving NYPA half their volume at Mamou (off TGT) and half at 
Henry.  At the very least we should be able to switch these volumes around to 
better suit our needs.

Please note, I have not mentioned any of this to Stacey at NYPA.  The only 
information Stacey was able to provide was her delivered MDQ and her grossed 
up receipt volume.  She relies on us to tell her how much gas she is getting 
at each point.

I sold 30,000 for the balance of the month starting tomorrow to CES 
(Aristech) at CGLF/Mainline (deal 210987).

Who schedules this gas?

The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen 
contract which will automatically renew for 12 months unless either party 
gives 90 day written notice to end the contract.  

I believe it will probably be one of you three looking at this.  Which one of 
you is it?

I left a copy of the contract on Susan's desk.  Susan, you can toss this.

I don't know if you ever got copies of the invoices.  Everything given to me 
for you guys was actually wholesale stuff.  However, I getting copies as I 
work on actualizing the demand charge sheet for Jan.  I will make copies an 
send them to Brian.

Brian, what is your mailing address?

I just  changed the demand charge on the Penn Fuel capacity from 6.53 to 
6.423 (deal 205687).  I changed the price on the Penn Fuel released demand 
from 6.449 to 6.423 (deal 205672).  We were billed 6.423 in January.  That's 
an odd rate when everthing else was 6.50.

I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like 
to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several 
pipelines.  Who should I talk to?

On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and 
sell the gas to CES on injections.

On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection 
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal 
decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what 
actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how 
to do it.

Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?

I extended Sitara deal 143323 thru march.  This is a Boston Gas release to 
CES SS-1 contract.  Should we release this to ENA?

I made a mistake the Borrowed deal is 220270
the payback deal is 220254

I don't want anyone to feel left out and please let me know if you don't want 
to see emails of this type in the future.  There is a beginning hang gliding 
class this weekend.  The class is offered through Leisure Learning 
Unlimited.  Go to web site http://llu.com/  select Adventure Unlimited, click 
on the line beginning with Gun Safety (that's next by the way).  Then scroll 
down, it's in there somewhere.  Or you could just give me a call to find out 
more.

Here is the schedule;
Lecture:  Sat  10am-noon, outdoors Sat 1-4pm and Sun 10am-4pm, March 4th & 
5th.

The lecture is at the LLU office on Richmond close to Kirby, I think.  The 
outdoors session is in Addicks, I'm sure that's outside the loop somewhere.

Cost:  $85.00 for the class and a $6.00 or $12.00 registration fee depending 
on which option you select.

Oh yeah, I may need to borrow a hacksaw if Dan Junek signs up!

I understand.  I'm involved because it may have been used to serve CES.  If 
we used it to serve CES, I should have called CES to negotiate a price and 
thats what I don't see in my records.

Jeff Porter at CES said in a 3/16 email...

 as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have
 submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for
 the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
 made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
 Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
 3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

Which means we will not have the volumes until 3/17.  Is it a problem that it 
wasn't March 15?
Scott

Colleen Sullivan@ECT
03/08/2000 08:43 AM
The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our 
agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our 
storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're 
coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call 
them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it 
together.

To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

that this was Buy/Sell or incremental. CES or EES? I have a supply but no 
market. Thanks

Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an 
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and 
replace with this purchase.

Can you change the year from 2001 to 2000 on the deal, please. 
Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, purchase.

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he 
needs to get this pathed in the system.

Thanks all.

Robert/Victor,

Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)...

Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

Brenda was able to obtain a copy of the CES Egan storage contract.  We don't 
have a copy of the letter assigning the contract to ENA though.  We do have 
copies of the invoices for Jan and Feb.  The invoices are addressed to ENA 
which is good enough for me.

I am going to set the contract up as an ENA contract effective Jan 1, unless 
someone has an objection.  Brenda will give a copy of the contract to 
Sylvia.  

Egan does not have a contract number so Brenda will determine that.  Also, 
the contract has an evergreen provision but I don't think we should set it up 
that way.
Let me know if you have questions.

thanks

I want to make sure Joni sees everyting on CGAS as well. 

jporte1@columbiaenergygroup.com on 03/16/2000 08:39:28 AM
Just a note that as of 4/1/00, CES' SST capacity on TCO will decrease. We have
submitted a request to COH for Storage Capacity and Transport (FSS & SST) for
the 00-01 season. COH should have the actual numbers late Friday, but I have
made a guesstimate below. You only get 50% of your Oct-Mar WD capacity for
Apr-Sep Inj, which could be around 50,000 dth/d. The numbers below are from
3/00, so 4/00 should be smaller, but I will forward to you as soon as I can.

I know we have not been treating storage correctly in Sitara.  I would like 
to disscuss the best way to handle the CES storage.  It involves several 
pipelines.  Who should I talk to?

On some storage contracts, ENA will buy the gas from CES on withdrawals and 
sell the gas to CES on injections.

On other storage contracts, CES will give ENA a predetermined injection 
schedule.  However, ENA will make the acutal injection and withdrawal 
decisions.  Which means, what we bill CES will be different from what 
actually happens.  I know this is what we did with BUG, I just don't know how 
to do it.

Who do I need to meet with to discuss CES storage?

Yo!  Give Aaron his gift!

I'm busy washing my hair.

where you give the total volume delivered by day on ENA, CALP, and Dayton 
transport.

Thanks

Angie, please send any CNG EBB postings pertaining to Appalachian production 
to John, Jim, Heidi, Scott, Dick and myself.  I don't think Dick knows what

My CES buddy is starting to focus on local production now.  What's bad is CES 
has seen some of the pricing for the local production, I was going to bill 
them a lot more for it.  That does not mean they agree to the pricing.

bperron@columbiaenergygroup.com on 03/15/2000 05:21:33 PM

Find that local production list when you have a chance and forward it to me.

AND you are a good cook and you smell good too!

Brian Perrone with CES is asking me if they should pay the invoice for CNG 
Field Services for January.  The volume is 13,113 MMBtu at a price of $2.61.  
The delivery point is Caragie/CPA at Jefferson.  I'm not sure what to tell 
him.

I would have charged them $2.78 for this gas (CGAS IF plus max IT transport).

In order to determine if any of this LDC production was sent to us with the 
Wholesale package, I need to know who the producers are for each of the 
deals, the volumes of the deals, and the term (which I can get from John 
Singer).  Then we will take that information and try to match it up with the 
list of deals given to us by CES with the wholesale package.  I'm assuming 
that, if these deals were not entered into Sitara by Mark Friedman and the 
TAGG people (meaning you had to enter them in yourself at some later point, 
which it sounds like we did), they were probably not included in the 
Wholesale package.  If this is the case, then the deals are not really ours 
and are, presumably, CES Retail.  If CES-Retail does not want the deals, then 
we will value the transactions, get together and discuss the best way to 
handle them (i.e., us or EES), then propose a transfer of the deals to 
Enron.  

In summary, if you can get the information noted above to me, I'll take it 
from there and find out if the deals have already been assigned to us or 
not.  Thanks.

Joan Veselack@ENRON
03/13/2000 01:06 PM
Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

   
	
	

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

	
	

I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.  

Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on 
vacation.  

Chris Germany

I took the Egan Storage demand charge to 0 in the CES Wholesale worksheet 
until David can determine it we have accounted for the charge someplace 
else.  The monthly demand charge is $125,000.00.

Attached is the storage schedule for CES.

Scott, according to Colleen, this will take up a significant amount of 
someone's time to track.

week. I would like to get this matter resolved this week. 

Thanks
Darla

Effective 04/1/2000, Columbia Gas Transmission will be transferring certain 
facilities to Gatherco, Inc.  There should have been a message in Columbia 
Navigator stating that there were certain meters that were going out of your 
IPP pool 37147 effective 4/2000.  The subject for this e-mail message was 
"Appalachian Meter Allocation".  The meters listed in this e-mail will now be 
on Gatherco's gathering lines and are going to be subject to the $.25 
gathering rate.  Per Dave Fusek at Gatherco, our final estimates for 04/2000 
SHOULD reflect these meters that were changed from Columbia Gas Transmission 
to Gatherco.  He said he is not 100% positive that they will get this 
finished in time, but they are hoping to have everything complete by the time 
they release our nominations.

Gloria and Wade,

You will need to make sure you have the correct charges associated with these 
meters.  Some of these meters were previously subject to Columbia's $.27 
gathering and some were straight transmission, which did not have any 
gathering.  Again, these meters will now have a $.25 gathering charge.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Heidi Griffith

I'm a bad person.  I forgot to tell you I sold CES 880 to 1000 day at the 
pool starting tomorrow on deal 217775

Also, I just sold CES 2500/day at CGLF Mainline starting the 16th-31st, deal 
217854.  This gas is for Atistech.  I assume we schedule that.

Joan Veselack@ENRON
03/14/2000 12:58 PM
Brian said the deal was done with Chris to use Enron's IPP. This has been 
scheduled.

TCO cannot attached Enron's FSS (storage) to Orwell and Lakesides GTS 
contracts. TCO could do an inground storage transfer between Enron and these 
accounts, however storage withdrawal and injection fees would be charged.

Per my other e-mail... we are on target in getting the total gas withdrawn 
from storage for  March. There is no need to do outside deals to get 
additional storage gas out of the ground. If you do outside deals, this just 
changes the amount of storage that goes to Choice.

Thanks.

CES for the month of Feb.  The "2000ces02.xls" file is where Goodell and I 
keep track of the CES transport demand charges and all the transport 
pricing.  There is also a tab in this file called CGAS.  I use the data in 
this tab to calculate the sale to CES on CGAS.  It is a completly manual 
process.

I believe it would be benificial for all of you to at least understand the 
pricing (excellent performance review stuff).  I do want to go over the data 
in the CGAS tab just to make sure I'm looking at the data correctly.

Thanks.

Jeff, I believe the manual billing items are in the "febsaleinv2.xls" file.  
I will be out for the rest of the afternoon.  I will try to touch base with 
you later today.

Brian, all of the support for the billing is in the "2000ces02.xls" worksheet.

Kim is taking care of that invoice.

Thanks

Is your Gain ID "ONX1666"?

Occasionally, when I have a question, I call my little EES buddies to get a 
better understanding of a specific LDC.  I don't mention CES and I assume 
that's ok.  

   
	
	

This is just a reminder that there is a confidentiality agreement between ENA 
and CES regarding the retail business that prohibits ENA wholesale from 
discussing any aspect of the CES Retail business with EES.  If you receive 
any calls from EES people about the CES retail business, please inform them 
of this prohibition on discussions. If we receive consent from CEG/Nisource 
at some point in time, I will let you know.  Thank you.

I have confirmed after talking with Jeff Hodge that ENA and EES cannot 
discuss anything regarding the CES retail business.  Both the CA and the 
Retail Agreement have sections that explicity mention that  ENA has to keep 
information confidential.   I talked with Jeff Golden, who is working on the 
EES side and mentioned that there can be no discussions between EES and ENA 
regarding the CES Retail business without first gaining the written consent 
of Nisource/CEG.

Jeff - If I have misstated anything, please let me know.

Patrick

How did it go?

CGLF
I created deal 530445 (purchase from New Power at CGLF + $.06) to bookout 
with deal 380571.

CGAS
I created deal 503451 (sale to New Power  at CGLF + $.06 + Variable from CGLF 
M/L to Leach).  Volume = 1,278
Deal 380492 is a sale to New Power, price = NX1 + .28, Volume = 2,683 day
Please bookout the 2 sale deals with deal 503453 (purchase from New Power at 
CGAS IF + $.0125).  Volume = 3,961 day.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Chris

I'm going to respond to everyone on the email with my comments but I just 
wanted to make sure I undersand the blue highlighted comments below.  Please  
call me when you get a chance.

Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate 
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES 
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals 
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate 
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for 
CES?  This could be a can of worms. 

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production 
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this? 
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES. 
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the 
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate 
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to 
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the 
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently 
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The 
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to 
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be 
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany 
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot 
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

   
	
	

Hey guys, I wanted ya'll to see the below messages as well since these are 
TCO deals.  I'm little confused now, because Wade had informed me that these 
were all deals behind the citygate that John Singer had been doing and that 
CES retail was pulling gas directly from these points.  We found a few like 
this on CNG last week.  The way we have been handling this is to show a buy 
from whomever at the citygate and hook it up as a buy/sell with CES retail.  
Chris has been setting up the tickets for the sell to CES retail, but right 
now he's priorities are just a bit different.  I guess why I'm a little 
confused on these is that when I pulled up the Phoenix Dominion it has the 
pool attached to the deal and not one of the CPA's.  

Wade - Do you know whether deal 142669 is pool or a citygate deal?  If it's 
pool, I don't know how we could have missed this all month because we would 
have had to nominate it in Navigator.

Joanie - Do you have any insight into this?

	
	

I'm sorry Wade, but there definitely seems to be a problem with manpower 
around here.  Chris is in charge of handling all of the CES retail, so he 
needs to set up the corresponding sales and price them.  My hands are kind of 
tied on the pathing until he is able to complete his end.  

Also, I will try to follow up on these, but since these are TCO points, 
please feel free to send further TCO issues to Robert Allwein.  I have only 
been so heavily involved in the CNG because Molly LaFuze has been out on 
vacation.

Sorry guys.  I'm still working on the February invoice to CES.  I estimate 
that everyday this invoice does not get out cost Enron about $4,000 a day.  
Feel free to call my boss Scott Neal about the problems you are having.

John Singer told me these two producers' deals expired 12/31/99.  We will not 
need these set up.

Producer   Pipe  Status

Burkland, Richard  CPA  Deal expired 12/31/99 No need to set up

Burkland, WIlliam S  CPA  Deal expired 12/31/99 No need to set up

What is the status on these producers ?  I have invoices and I need to pay 
these ASAP, especially Questa (they are calling).

Questa Petroleum  CPA   Deal  213088 set up with meter number per 9911 pay 
statement.  Production statement for volumes

information

T & F Operating  PennFuel Invoice in. Deal not set up. Not able to identify 
which Penn Fuel (56 or 56W) on CGAS

Nope.  It probably should.  It would also be flashed as a reimbursement.

Scott Goodell@ENRON
03/13/2000 02:41 PM
Does the 2000ces01, 2000ces02, 2000ces03 transport get flashed?
Should the Sonat capacity appear on CES or 2000trans?
Scott

1.  The index premium of $.032 is correct.

2.  Kimat Singla entered this deal in the system and it shows Maureen Smith 
as the ENA trader and Tim Ray as the EES trader.  You should ask one of those 
3 people.

   

Chris,

1-  According to EES, the price on deal #116090 should be CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I 
+0.014.  However, Sitara shows the price index is CNG.APPAL.IF.M.I +0.032.  
Could you please verify which rate should I be using in billing EES?

2-  On deal #156406, I was told by Judy Barn that this is an internal 
(financial) deal, therefore, it did not get downloaded into Settlement.  
However, per Patricia Downey at EES, this is a financial deal that was turned 
physical.  Would you please also confirm this wherether we should bill EES 
for this deal or not?

Thank you in advance for your help.
Vivien
X3-9558 

Vivien:  I have spoken with the EES scheduler on two CNGP deals and on the 
40,281 volume (Sabine 702US) - this is a term deal that has always been 
IF+.014.  It appears that ENA has changed the adder.  Please check as to why 
this rate has changed.

Also on the CNGP deal where we (EES) has 186,180 at 3.406 - this is a 
financial deal that was turned physical.  You may need to check with a Chris 
Germany on both of these deals.  ENA doesn't even have this 186,180 entered.

Let me know.

I think we are good to go.

	
	

We have WV produced TCo.  To my knowledge we have no Mountaineer.  CES never 
wanted to buy Mountaineer production because of the daily balancing for both 
the production and the end-user side.

I will be out this afternoon.  Please call Brian Perrone (703-561-6486) or 
Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711.

Thanks

Robert, I changed the volumes on the CES buy/sale deals 204462 and 204471.  I 
just entered a volume for the last day of the month.  You don't need to do 
this right away, when you get a chance go into Unify for Feb and show an 
actual volume of 0 for the 25th - 28th and a volume of 991014 for the 28th.  
Then retrack and balance.  

Jeff, I will include these deals on my manual billing worksheet to you.  You 
should be able to apply the payments to these deals.

Brian, we have  a deal we can't identify.  Do you show anything in your 
records about purchasing 3,575 dt's on Jan 20th or 21st?  It looks like a 1 
day deal and we bought the gas delivered from CGAS of Ohio.  The delivery 
point in our system is 23N but that may be wrong.  The price would be 
somewhere around $16.00.

Do we have an invoice from CGAS of Ohio?  I would like to see it if we do.  I 
don't show any record of a deal like this.  I'm going to send an email to my 
CES contact to see if he shows anything in his notes about this.
Robert Allwein
03/13/2000 08:22 AM
Sandra, I just have to get with Chris Germany to see if he can confirm this 
deal. I will keep you posted. Thanks, Rob

Chris, Deal # 153683, Please take a look at this and see if you can confirm 
that this was Buy/Sell or incremental. CES or EES? I have a supply but no 
market. Thanks

Victor Lamadrid
03/10/2000 03:21 PM
Most likely this is an offset to our term sale to CES on CGAS. Chris prepares 
CES invoices.  I don't know if he is aware of this. Most likely, there is an 
offsetting sale that is not in or we need to back off an existing path and 
replace with this purchase.

Can you change the year from 2001 to 2000 on the deal, please. 
Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, purchase.

Mark, If you happen to have any info on who Enron sold the gas to (since 
we're buying from Col Gas of OH), let  Robert know--meanwhile he's checking 
with Robin and Chris on his end so he can path it.

Vic--this is only FYI. Robert's taking the lead on finding out the info he 
needs to get this pathed in the system.

Thanks all.

Robert/Victor,

Can one of you check into this for me, please (you may also be getting a call 
from Mark Feldman from Volume)...

Columbia Gas of Ohio, sitara #153863, flow date 1/21/00, 3,575 mm's. The deal 
is in sitara; however, I do not see anything nommed, etc in Unify (like the 
deal doesn't exist). Can you check on your end to see if there was some sort 
of glitch/error. According to Dick Jenkins, he agrees with the counterparty. 
Let me know what you find/fix so I can redraft and pay them. Could it be 
booked under another pipe? Call me later. Thanks.

     As of  March 8, 2000,  the Storage Gas Balance for Contract 530586 was
2,944 dekatherms or 21%  full.

     CNG Transmission Corporation

?s (CNGT) Rate Schedule GSS,  Section 8.4
provides that if Storage Gas Balance is less than or equal to 16%, then CNGT?s
obligation to make deliveries from storage shall be reduced by 30%.  
Therefore,
when Storage Gas Balance falls below 16% or 2,236 dekatherms,  CNGT?s 
obligation
to make deliveries from this storage account shall be reduced from 210
dekatherms to 160 dekatherms.

     Please review,  monitor, and if necessary, adjust the storage withdrawals
to avoid overruns and the resulting penalties as provided in Section 35.3B of
the General Terms and Conditions.  If you have any questions, please feel free
to contact me at 304-623-8546.

Hey.  What is your professional opinion about this?  This was sent to me by 
my scheduler.  I assume this just means that if you don't have primary NIMO 
capacity on CNG, NIMO will continue to assign CNG capacity to you each 
month.  True?

March 10, 2000

SENT VIA FAX, E-MAIL & WEBSITE

NOTICE TO ALL MARKETERS PARTICIPATING IN BALANCED AGGREGATION:

In accordance with P.S.C. No. 218 Gas Tariff, Leaf No. 184.2, Niagara Mohawk
will continue to assign CNG capacity unless a final determination in the gas
rate case precludes Niagara Mohawk from such assignment.

If you filed an Affidavit of Firm Transportation Capacity with Niagara Mohawk
last fall and the contract number for the capacity is still valid, Niagara
Mohawk will continue to honor that contract and will not release CNG capacity 
to
you.  However, if the contract has expired, you must either re-submit an
Affidavit with a valid contract number or Niagara Mohawk will assign CNG
capacity to you.   The Affidavits are due Niagara Mohawk by the 25th of March,
2000.  Capacity will be assigned the week of March 20th for the month of 
April.

Just a note to let you know Columbia Gas has some capacity postings on the 
EBB for next winter.  BIDS ARE DUE 3/15 AT 9AM.
Attached is a spreadsheet showing the parcel numbers.  I highlighted the 
meters that you did not have enough capacity to serve your load this winter.
I would be happy to bid on this as your agent, but let me know what rate 
works based on your economics.  This is a bid process, so the current low bid 
is just an indication of the market value of the capacity.

Jeff Porter and I have discussed this several times over the last week.

The Choice program storage is to be negotiated by CES-Retail.  In fact, our 
agreement with CES Retail says that they will give us actual volumes for our 
storage schedule by March 15.   Chris, have you called CES to see how they're 
coming along with the schedule?  It would be a nice, gentle reminder to call 
them a week in advance (which is today), so they can start putting it 
together.

To ensure we are all on the same page... how does the renewal of this 
contract work for April 1?

If I remember correctly, the injection contract is from April 1st to October 
31st. Who negotiates this with the CDC??? 

John Hodge thought it was Doug Mckinney in Herndon. However, the storage 
becomes Enron's on April 1st. So... does Enron negotiate?

Chris, Scott, and Doug... please determine how this will be coordinated. 
Don't want this to fall through the cracks.... due to the transition.

Thanks for your help!!!

Angie, this is not anything to worry about right now.  When you estimate your 
flowing volumes for May, you need to decrease the total volume at Hastings by 
3000 dth.  I will try to remind you.  

Kim, please send me an AMTEL at 1:00pm on 4/24/2000  "REMIND ANGIE TO REDUCE 
HASTINGS BY 3,000 FOR MAY"

These meters were all at Hastings agg point.

Can you tell me which pools this impacts and how much by pool (hastings, 
Bridgeport ...)

FYI.  I received a letter today from Ed Arnold with Kriscott Inc. stating 
that they will be terminating their CNG gas contract effective 5/1/2000.  For 
volume purposes, his four meters produced about 3,000 dths a month.  Let me 
know if anyone wants a copy of the letter.

Thanks,
HG

Is contract 62164 a valid contract on CGAS?  It was highlighted in red in the 
2000ces02.xls sheet.  I updated the info based on what I see in Navigator and 
highlighted it in yellow.  And, if this is a valid deal, we need to add it to 
Sitara.

Hi Stephanie,
According to CES, Sitara #146788 is an exchange deal and the rate should be  
$0.65/mmbtu.  
Could you please add this fee to the said sitara # ?  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.

Thank you,
TT   3-9852

Hey!

CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas 
Eastern.  CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is 
giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.  According to my new 
best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the 
January transaction is complete.

Here are my questions/comments;

1.  David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal 
146788).  The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange.  
I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC.  
If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the 
new deal.  Please let me know ASAP.

2.  Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?  I would like to 
see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment 
was due.

3.  David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it 
above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?

4.  Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES 
Please forward this email to others that may need to see it.

Thanks

Your primary contact for Central Desk activities is Kevin Ruscitti.  His

I recommend that you still use me as your primary contact to email bidweek 
numbers (with Scott Goodell as my backup).  I will forward the bid week 
numbers to all the East Desk schedulers and the Central Desk schedulers.  
After bidweek, you should contact Kevin with all Central Desk issues and 
myself for all East Desk issues.

Chris, we are not going to be able to repair this problem in the next few
days.  We need to do some programming work.  If you guys would go ahead and
pay the bill, it'll be washed out in an adjustment hopefully next month.
The bill itself is correct, it's just on the wrong contract.
Let me know if this is ok with you.   Thanks, ii

Kate left us a bid form for NYSEG capacity.  For CNG, I would prefer to have 
the Cornwell space.  I think the South Webster goes with Tenn Z4.

Dick, other than CES, do you know what our CNG citygate positions are 
starting April?

How does this deal work - deal 165385?

Meredith, I see both of the Bay States deals in Unify on the 31st.  I 
remember chatting with deal clearing about it yesterday.  Could you path 
those deals and email Mark when you are done.

Mark, I'm expecting you to see the amount of the invoice come across in Unify 
after Meredith paths the gas.  Just a note, we will probably be billed 
interest because the payment is late.  I think it was due on 2/26/2000.

Personally, I think you should buy a F150 extended cab 4x4 with the 17" 
wheels.  To heck with gas mileage when you look so cool.

I'm not wild about Dodge either only because it is a Chrysler product.  Kevin 
is actually the one that mentioned that one.

I was running down a hill during my hanggliding class, lost my balance, 
stepped in a hole and dislocated my ankle.  Jerry was taking the class with 
me.  He was laughing really hard until he saw my foot..  If I was sitting in 
a chair holding my leg straight out and facing North, the bottom of my foot 
was facing North East.

I got to ride in an ambulance to the hospital.  I didn't hear this but the 
Dr. told them to take me to "a very quiet room".   He popped my foot back in 
place and sent me to x-ray.  I don't have any broken bones but the ligaments 
are probably all torn up.  I go to an orthopedic surgeon tomorrow.  Right 
now, I have an ace bandage wrapped around a fiberglass support.

Do you know if anyone in my office is using this on a daily basis?

dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 03/07/2000 09:01:46 AM
Chris--The attached spreadsheet contains our Daily volume requirements for 3/7
and 3/8 (except for the AGL numbers).   For 3/7 you will see two 'NOM'
Columns--one labelled '9AM' and one labelled 'Intraday' which is an update of
the requirements reported in the 9AM column.   The two columns will be
identical in instances where no change has been made.   Where the two numbers
differ, the Intraday value is the latest requriement.  In some cases where
there is storage (i.e., COH Choice) , you will see negative values for the
'PRIMARY' requirement.  This represents a situation where gas is being
withdrawn from storage and sold at the pool, along with the first-of-the-month
baseload daily 'PRIMARY' volume.

Please call if you have questions, etc.

This is just about my intelluctual speed.

  Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue 
  and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. 
  Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, 
  Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. 
  You move like the bass which excite me in May. 
  You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. 
  Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. 
  Ye're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can. 
  You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; 
  I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. 
  On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, 
  well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. 
  Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, 
  What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. 
  Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, 
  To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. 
  Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. 
  Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. 
  Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, 
  You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. 
  When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, 
  My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. 
  Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. 
  Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'. 

  Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, 
  We two go together like a skunk goes with stank. 

  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; 
  They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way. 

  Some men, they git roses fer that special day, 
  From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say. 

  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. 
  "Diamonds is ferever," they explains, suave and couth. 

  But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. 
  Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you. 

  I got you a gift,without taste or odor, 
  More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor! 

I wrote this poem for you because of all the work you guys do.

Good Afternoon.

Just a heads up so that you may contact Chris Germany.  We have one customer 
at
PSNC.  Effective April 1st, CES will no longer be supplying gas to this
customer as their expires.  I just do not want to have a mix up for April and
have Chris contract with PSNC for capacity when none will be needed.  I am in
the process of notifing PSNC.  Just wanted to keep you in the loop and give 
you
the option to inform Chris.

I have a few questions about CES Retail's firm capacity. I am trying to
determine what capacity CES had that was assigned to ENA, with contract
details. I combined a few spreadsheets but still have questions. Mostly I am
looking for some of the following; contract #, RP, DP, MDQ or term. Also not
sure if capacity K#s I have were CES's, then assigned or ENA's own. Can you
please assist?

1. TCO K#64651-is it CES' or ENA's? delivers to CMD4-25
2. TCO COH7-1, Exhibit 1 shows 20,000 of capacity for C&I. I have no details 
on
this K.
3. TCO K#62164- I believe it delivers to COH7-4, but I have no details.
4. TCO K#65403- believe it delivers 19,000+ to BGE, but need all detail.
5.  CNG NORTH- K#'s 5A2291/5A2181 and 5A2292/5A2182; deliveries to NIMO, CES's
or ENA's?
6.  Have a bunch of contracts to TETCO M3, CES or ENA? see below

7.  TRANSCO Z5-Ex 1 shows 150 capacity, I have no details.
8.  TRANSCO Z6- for LILCO, is this released monthly to ENA?
9.   Texas Gas Z-4 to DP&L- monthly also?
10. Did CES have any ColGulf capacity that was assigned?

Call me if you have questions.

I listed one of the CES issues down below.  The other issue I have is 
pricing.  I'm not familiar enough with the Central Region to check the 
pricing.  I will try to get with you this afternoon.  Just a note, I bet I 
spent at least 2.5 hours on the phone with CES last Friday.

Chris Germany
03/02/2000 03:08 PM
I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point 
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.

CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon 
citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one 
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it 
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.

Comments?

I wish I could write such sweet words.  There are starting to be way to many 
Driscoll's, I think there was a Mark and Mike that I came close to sending 
this to.

  Collards is green, my dog's name is Blue 
  and I'm so lucky to have a sweet thang like you. 
  Yer hair is like cornsilk a-flappin in the breeze, 
  Softer than Blue's and without all them fleas. 
  You move like the bass which excite me in May. 
  You ain't got no scales but I luv you anyway. 
  Ye're as satisfy'n as okry jist a-fry'n in the pan. 
  Ye're as fragrant as "snuff" right out of the can. 
  You got some a yer teeth, for which I am proud; 
  I hold my head high when we're in a crowd. 
  On special occasions, when you shave under yer arms, 
  well, I'm in hawg heaven, and awed by yer charms. 
  Still them fellers at work,they all want to know, 
  What I did to deserve such a purdy, young doe. 
  Like a good roll of duct tape ye're there fer yer man, 
  To patch up life's troubles and to fix what you can. 
  Ye're as cute as a junebug a-buzzin' overhead. 
  Not like them mean far ants dun found in my bed. 
  Cut from the best cloth like a plaid flannel shirt, 
  You spark up my life like a load of fresh dirt. 
  When you hold me real tight like a padded gunrack, 
  My life is complete;there ain't nuthin' I lack. 
  Yer complexion is perfect like the best vinyl sidin'. 
  Cuz despite all them years,yer age, yup it keeps hidin'. 

  Me 'n' you's like a Moon Pie with a RC cold drank, 
  We two go together like a skunk goes with stank. 

  Some men, they buy chocolate fer Valentine's Day; 
  They git it at Wal-Mart, it's romantic that way. 

  Some men, they git roses fer that special day, 
  From the cooler at Kroger. "That's impressive," I say. 

  Some men buy fine diamonds from a flea market booth. 
  "Diamonds is ferever," they explains, suave and couth. 

  But fer this man, honey,these just won't do. 
  Cuz ye're way too special,you sweet thang you. 

  I got you a gift,without taste or odor, 
  More useful than diamonds...it's a new trollin' motor! 

You left 2 TRCO invoice questions on my desk.

1.  Contract 3.3558 - this is a volumetric release from PSNC for CES Retail.  
The demand and commodity invoice come in together I believe.

2.  Contract 3.3509 - ???  I don't understand this one.  Take a look at 
k#1.3473.  Did we receive a demand charge on 1.3473 and not have the demand 
estimated in Sitara?  I may need to add 1.3473 and 0 3.3509.  Let me know 
what you find.

I think this is a Central Desk contract or its one of our agency contract.  
We have so many.  Do you have a Sitara deal number?

Please see below and advise on the effective date for contract #1000103 or
should this contract not be used for January business?
Thanks,

ENA nominated Reliant Energy Field Services contract 96034155 on the third 
party pipe for January business.  This contract is set up with an effective 
date of 02/01/2000 rather than 01/01/2000 in the Global Contracts system.  Is 
it possible to change the date in the Global Contracts system, or should we 
not have used this contract for January business?

Thanks for your help.

Cathy

Let's see.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought I heard Jeff say "let me 
know if there is anything I can do to help" get those invoices out.

Run that through the Chris translator and I would interpret that to mean "I 
welcome the opportunity to learn more about the CES sales/purchase contract 
and would be overjoyed at pricing the 30 plus 1st of the month pricing 
scenarios."

Chris, lets meet next Tuesday at 2:00 p.m. (Conference Room EB-3745) to 
discuss the status of the January 2000 invoice billing (sales & purchase). 
There is still a substantial amount that is not showing up  in Unify. 
Customer is paying Enron $28 million on Monday and we only have $11 million 
in the system that is showing up. We sent Columbia a manual invoice for 
$16,972,671.72 and a system generated invoice of $11,477,340.49 on Friday 
February 18th.

Send me an e-mail back to confirm.

Thanks, Jeff

A few more questions --
What about for the Central Desk volumes?  Who is going to estimate those ??  
Who is going to compare March noms with the booked volume on Exhibit ?
Who is going to physically be the one to enter the deals in Sitara / TAGG, 
both for Central and East for the remaining term April 2000 through March 
2001???
When will it go into the books ??

   

I discussed CES retail with Chris. He is going to work with Dick on 
estimating a good retail volume to book. 

Mark

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term 
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible.  For your information, 
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and 
prices in it.  I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10% 
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to 
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided 
to us by CES.  

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he 
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of 
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.  Anyway, 
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in 
by your group (I think you're the right one).  Again, those deals should be 
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.  In addition, I 
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass, 
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to 
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things 
are matching up.  I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please 
advise.

I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my 
knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at 
Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we 
were not aware of.

Laurie Ellis@ENRON
11/01/2000 02:55 PM
Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG 
Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient 
awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria 
Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.

Bryan, it doesn't line up very well but this shows that we received 150 dth 
at St 85 and delivered 145 to PSNC.

Hi.  Got a problem on PSNC for March 1st.  I had requested 145 dth per day on
Doug's spreadsheet and notified my Transco scheduler.  For some reason Chris
Germany told PSNC to release capacity for 190 dth and not 145 dth.  PSNC 
called
me and asked if I wanted to have the capacity recalled.  I instructed PSNC to
contact Chris.  Per PSNC and my transco scheduler, I was to schedule 190 dth 
on
the first and then drop nom down to 145 effective the second.  I did this.
This morning I got a call from PSNC telling me we have a problem with March
1st, that only 145 dth could be confirmed.  I called my transco scheduler and
she told me that Chris told her that CES had the capacity recalled.
(impossible as capacity was released to Enron).  All I wanted was 145 dth per
day for March.  Can someone please call Chris at Enron to confirm what should
and did get scheduled?  Thank you.

Robin did a buy/sale on algo for tomorrow only.  Match deal 211356 with 
211359.

thanks

we need to determine if he will be the point person.  need to check with 
scott, but it appears that someone should attend.

I sold 30,000 for the balance of the month starting tomorrow to CES 
(Aristech) at CGLF/Mainline (deal 210987).

Who schedules this gas?

She's still a porker as of this morning.

I just plugged/fugged/guessed at the demand charge.  When Dana does her

Hey Chris, CES/CNR Contract 515. Can you set this up just like the other CNR 
contracts that you have set up in the past.. Please set up for Jan 1 start 
date. Deal # 77283 is a CNR contract that you can copy. If this is something 
you can get me to do, let me know. I have approximately 70 contracts that 
need to be set up very soon for CNR. Wade is starting to pay the Jan 
invoices. Thank you, Rob

Do you think Scott should go to this??

I believe we need to assign someone from the Central Desk to be the point 
person for CES Central Desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues.

CES currently has issues with the BTU conversions at the different Michcon 
citygates.  ENA delivers the gas to different Michcon citygates and each one 
has a different BTU factor.  This causes CES to be long or short depending on 
the conversion factor.  I'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it 
but I would prefer to have someone from the Central Desk address this issue.

Comments?

Please add the following person.

I am pleased to announce that Terry Franklin will be joining the 
Transportation Rates team in a newly created position-the Appalachian 
Coordinator role.  Terry brings years of transportation, wellhead, and Enron 
experience to the position, and we are excited to have her join the team.

In her new position, Terry will be responsible for the following:

? Understand the Appalachian contracts/agreements
? Understand the gas flow methods and desired commercial results
? Facilitate set-up of transport/gathering contracts
? Facilitate set-up of facilities/meters
? Create purchase deals in SITARA
? Maintain transport rates coordination role for CGAS, CNG, CNR, etc.
? Review calc sheets
? Maintain purchase pricing
? Maintain intra-month volumetric estimates on CNR/Gather co

Terry will make every effort to trouble shoot and problem solve for both the 
commercial and operations teams.  In doing so, she will be looking to partner 
with the members of the Trading, Origination, Client Services, Volume 
Management, and Logistics teams to improve our processes in this very 
important area.   

Terry will be replaced on the Operational Analysis team, but we may choose to 
realign individual responsibilities to creatively manage the  current 
workload.  Terry will begin to transition over the next several days, but we 
must be very careful to maintain the current Volume Mgmt. OA process during 
this transition time.

Please join me in congratulating Terry in her new role!

Meredith, please path deal 209359 with 209371 for Jan 31.  This should

nuthing but retail stuff.  Why would anyone do retail stuff?

check it out

Here is what Vickie told me about capacity on your pipeline after you 
eliminate segmenting.

Example #1

Assumtion: PECO has 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity with a primary 
delivery point of PECO in Z6.
What will Enron and PECO be able to schedule Iff PECO releases 10,000 dt/day 
of St 65 to PECO citygate under the following scenarios;

PECO schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and Enron schedules gas from 
Tetco/Ragley to Z6?

PECO schedules gas from St 30 to St 65, and Enron schedules gas from St 65 to 
Z6?

Assumtion #2: PECO released Enron 10,000 dt/day of telescoped capacity.

Enron schedules gas from St 30 to WSS, and from Tetco/Ragley to Z6?

Would you get me all the contract details on this capacity and email it to me?

thanks

Angel,

Steve Gillespie is managing the day to day operations of the VNG asset mgt. 
deal for our logistics group.  Please include him with your queries.  It is 
my understanding that we are agents for all of their contracts and we pay all 
their transport costs.  In turn, we invoice them and they re-imburse us for 
that transport. 

Chris Germany and Scott Goodell in the Transportation Trading Group  are 
responsible for setting these contracts in UNIFY.  All of these contracts in 
question are storage or transportation tied to storage. Chris/Scott please 
set up the 5 valid contracts below in UNIFY as soon as possible....Contract 
37634 is terminated effective 8/31/1999.

If you have any questions please let us know.

Dear Producers and Shippers,

 In January, you were notified that the Schultz Gas Processing Plant 
would be permanently shut down on February 29, 2000.   We heard from many 
of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause Schultz 
area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed.  
Given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen 
sufficiently to allow operations at Schultz to be marginally profitable, 
CNG Transmission will continue to operate the Schultz facility until:

 1. it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or, 

 2. CNG develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and
         processing the Schultz area gas elsewhere on its system. 

 We remain committed to serving producers throughout the Appalachian 
Basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you.  
If you have any questions regarding this notice, please contact Joe Thompson 
at (304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705.

        Sincerely,

        H. Dale Rexrode
        Director, Producer Services
        and Business Development

I love Chic Fe Le.

Good news, even better when it happens.  My contract at CES, Brian Perrone, 
just told me CES will pay the invoice we billed them.  They still need to 
reconstruct January.

I still need to work on January capacity and sales to CES.
I found a significant amount of transport I left out of January.  I want to 
fix the Feb capacity sheet and bill CES tomorrow or Fri for capacity and the 
scheduling fee.
The Feb invoicing should be much cleaner and ready to go out by the 10th.

Jeff Porter is the CES person responsible for looking at their transport.  
Last week, he said he was working on their transport numbers.  Also, 
yesterday I informed Jeff about some transport CGAS had listed on the EBB.

Most of these are the wrong people, but they should be able to get you to the 
right person.  I need to chat with the other desk to get the rest of the 
names.

Man what a busy day.  I guess Ingrid is ok.  I have not spoke to her for 
awhile - since Peter Vint's wedding I think.

I'm mooching off my brother's in-law's for turkey day, then going to my Dad's 
place this weekend.  What are you doing?

See... Joni knows best.

I bought three pair (black, blue, olive) and have worn them all. That was my
best investment ever.

Are you doing okay??? How is Ingrid???

I LOVE MY SWEATS!

It appears that the volume on the sale to CES-Woodward Marketing is 4000/day 
for March.  Tammi called Woodward to verify.

Please create a new CPR index report and have it sort 1st byPub Code, 2 nd by 
pipe, 3rd by zone.    Also, please subtotal by Pub Code.

We need to add Sonat to our CES retail demand charge sheet.

Let's chat.

What have I heard - just a bunch of complaining.  She's hugh and she is about 
to go for a walk ON THE 29TH?????  What is she thinking?

I didn't even know Bob was out.

You behave yourself.

Scott--My March '00 first-of-the-month numbers for AGL assumed that the total
daily firm load across all 9 pools would average 36,774 dth/day.  This would 
be
met by a combination of maximizing the daily withdrawals from IBSS as well as
the Directly assigned storage supplies with the remainder served by flowing
gas.   On days when the firm requirement falls below the 36,774 (for March 1,
our combined DSR is currently 23,758dth), I don't want to reduce IBSS
withdrawals because we need to maximize those thru March in order to have that
inventory down to the 35% level by March 31.  Otherwise, we could be liable 
for
penalties.   Instead, I would prefer to swing on the flowing gas, if necessary
and keep drawing the gas out of storage.

Please call me if you have questions or wish to discuss further.

Scott.Goodell@enron.com on 02/28/2000 04:46:35 PM
Please respond to Scott.Goodell@enron.com

Doug- Based on these numbers David's w/d from IBSS would be zero, due to
the AGL DSR.

Chris--The attached file contains updated needs requirements for March'00.
There are a couple of changes as compared to the update that I sent you
yesterday.  Please note that if you have been looking at the Total Monthly
requirements in the previous versions (in lieu of the daily dth volumes),
the
spreadsheet formula for summing the daily values to a monthly total were
only
picking up the first 29 days of March.  (This spreadsheet was originally
designed for February, which has 29 days.)   This has been corrected in the
attached version.

Sorry for any confusion.

I'm looking for gas delivered to two Tetco M2 interconnects with TCo.

At the minimum, I'm looking for an offer for a flat baseload volume for

from December through March.  The points and volumes are:
 Delmont {Volume:  3,712/day}
 Windrifge {Volume:  2,859/day}

Can I get a nymex plus offer?

Thanks.

You have 5 days to execute CNG offer #s 013125 West,  013126 East.

Let's see, got a freebie at the Blue Agave last night (Mexican food), they 
fed us Curmley's (crossaint sandwiches and tortilla soup) yesterday, 
breakfast yesterday and today and tomorrow and Monday.  I wonder what's for 
lunch tomorrow?  And I wonder why I have such a hard time loosing weight.

My techy's going to help me buy a computer.  I'm thinking of buying a Dell 
Pent III 600 Mhz with a bunch of other stuff I know nothing about and an 
HP8?? color printer.  I was also going to buy a digital camera and start 
taking a lot more family photo's and save them to disk.  What do you think?

I was also going to try and create a home page and keep track of the stuff I 
plan on doing.  1st up is Hang Gliding the first weekend in March.  I have 
not registered yet.  Cool huh?  Time for my free meal  :o)

SEE YA!

Comments/ suggestions?

I entered this deal in the system with the wrong term date.  I entered this 
as a Dec-00 deal.  The term is 11/23 - 11/30/2000.

My fault.  I corrected Sitara.

Hey.  It's international  friend week.  I'm sending Natasha an international

I have built for her: 29 yr old, Teaches a children's Sunday School class, 
excellent piano player, believes in recycling, helps little old ladies across 
the street, loves arts and crafts shows, and bakes cookies!  What do you 
think.

What's your wife's name?  I'm going to mention you and your wife in my email.

Hey!  Did you ever chat with my buddy Ishi?  Are you going to work for 
Enron?  We get discounted deal tickets to Astroworld every April - you don't 
want to miss that!!

CES has decided to take 600 dth/day of their Texas Gas Zone 4 length into 
CGAS at Lebanon for the 24th-29th.  To keep the deal tickets simple, I am 
showing a purchase from CES at Lebanon for 600 dth/day at the first of the 
month CGAS price. 

Joe, I created a purchase from CES (deal 202576).  Match this up with 600dth 
of deal 159319.

We will effectively be using 600 dth less of Dayton space for CES starting on 
the 24th.

I will let you know if things change.

bperron@columbiaenergygroup.com on 02/22/2000 10:34:30 AM
Chris,

 We are going to redirect 3600 dths off of Texas Gas from CG&E to TCO
Pool.  600 dths/day will be delivered at Lebanon starting Thursday, February
24.
Please let me know if there are any questions or problems.

dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 02/22/2000 09:06:55 AM
Chris--At this date, CES has a large overhang of storage inventory on AGL.
To address this situation, I have asked David Scott to increase our IBSS
withdrawals to the maximum daily withdrawal quantities for the rest of
February.   Moreover, we also want to maximize our daily withdrawals on the
directly assigned storage services for the rest February.    We don't want gas
injected into storage unless it is necessary to avoid a penalty.   David will
contact Scott about the Directly Assigned storage withdrawals.

To the extent that maximizing our storage withdrawals requires us to cut back
on flowing gas, the cuts in flowing gas will be sold back to ENA  per our
contract.

Please call me if you have questions, etc.

Thanks.

I knew we would have to address this eventually.

CES is long 3600/month in TGT Z4 at CG&E.  I showed them a $2.66 bid for 
tomorrow.  Before I had worked up the price, CES decided to take the gas into 
CGAS at Lebanon.

This gets real messy.  Is there any way we can refuse this?  At first, I was 
thinking we would have to do this.  Now, I don't like the idea because it 
will be really messy in the summer.

I sold 7000 to CES at the Allied meter for tomorrow - deal 169576.  

Joann, let the Tenn schedulers know what additional volumes you need at Broad 
Run.

I don't have any of the contract information.  I will have to get the info, 
get Marlene to set these up in global contracts and then set them up in 
unify.  It probably won't happen today.  I'll keep you posted.

Angel,

Steve Gillespie is managing the day to day operations of the VNG asset mgt. 
deal for our logistics group.  Please include him with your queries.  It is 
my understanding that we are agents for all of their contracts and we pay all 
their transport costs.  In turn, we invoice them and they re-imburse us for 
that transport. 

Chris Germany and Scott Goodell in the Transportation Trading Group  are 
responsible for setting these contracts in UNIFY.  All of these contracts in 
question are storage or transportation tied to storage. Chris/Scott please 
set up the 5 valid contracts below in UNIFY as soon as possible....Contract 
37634 is terminated effective 8/31/1999.

Hi Joann and Alvin,

As you know, effective October 1, ENA became agent for Virginia Natural Gas.  
Here in Volume Management, as I try to load beginning balances and actualize 
volumes (so that I can pay VNG's transportation charges) for 10/2000, it 
appears that the following contracts for VNG/Cgas are not in Unify.

Contract Number  Type    
38079    FSS...Master Contract
35889    x-133 LNG Storage
60536    SST
37634    ISS
53004    FSS

I would appreciate any help you can give me in getting these contracts in 
Unify as soon as possible.  If you have any questions or need additional 
information, please let me know.

Thanks,
Angel

I just created "2000bug03.xls" and "2000tran03.xls".  

Joe, we will continue to use the CES Wholesale tab in the 2000tran03 
worksheet.

My worksheet has a lot of support for the pricing we billed for January.

Take a look at the worksheet and give me a call.  We probably will not be 
able to cover everything at once.  

We still have a few items to bill.  I will let you know what those items are 
and when we expect to bill them.

Does any of this impact the Central Desk?

Chris,

As I indicated on our call about a week ago, CES Retail is attempting to exit 
a
number of current markets for Major Accounts business only.  The list that
we're contemplating includes CKY, CG&E, DP&L, East Ohio, Indiana Gas, Western
Kentucky, CVA, COH, and BGE.  Again, for those LDCs where we participate in
Choice programs, we will continue to serve those customers.

We are trying to have this accomplished prior to March flow so that we can 
take
March 2000 forward out of our physical requirements from Enron.

I'll keep you apprised as additional information becomes available.

Thanks,

Melissa

FYI, not the markets I was hoping to see.

The reason you don't see the contracts on the SG assignment screen or the CP 
name on the SG maintenance screen is because the contracts originally rep'd 
over to Unify with Amreican Refining And Exploration as the provider. Global 
Contracts can help you with touching and re-releasing the contracts. Then try 
it again and call me if you have questions.  Trang x36996

I believe this works.  I'm entering all sales to New Power at Broad Run on 
deal 498019.  I created a purchase deal 498022 priced at FOM Index price.  We 
should bookout these two deals.  The delivery to the citygate should be on

11/18-20     4,108/d     $5.85    TGP/TCO Broadruncobb  DJ

I think its just the demand charge.  Algon only has 2 firm commodities that 
we have worked with and both are fairly cheap.  Most of the Algon expense is 
in the demand charge.

Here is what I have so far.   One of the floor tech's I chat with is Ishi 
Carter.  His number is 713-853-5580.

I learned some things today.  Ishi said Enron hires techies through 2 
companies New Boston Technologies (713-626-4900) and Comsys (713-547-0700).  
Techies work for these companies for 6 months and then Enron may or may not 
make them an offer.

Ishi said it would be ok for you to call him.

But, I'm thinking I should at least know your name first.  

Also, we have a ton of other IT type people in the company I'm going to chat 
with.

I get you more scoop later.

Bay States will be sending us an invoice for an Algonquin meter bounce fee.  
I would like to see when it gets here.  It's not in the system, but Meredith 
and I will take care of after I get the invoice.

Please call me if any of you come accross it.

you're a 38 year-old man, and you're talking about serious issues- marriage 
and a family. hey, i'm the biggest kid you'll ever meet, but we're talking 
about my wife's best friend here, so pretend like she's my sister or 
something.

One more ?- how do Sonat's zones work, in general? Is Zone 0 South Louisiana? 
Where (approximately) are the cutoffs for Zones 1, 2, and 3? Thanks

Clay

What zone on Tennessee are the Gas Daily prices in LA (500 and 800 legs, 
respectively) in?

Clay

Sold 7000 to CES at meter 30AL for tomorrow - deal 169576.  The meter is not 
set up in Sitara.  I sent a meter request to Faye Ellis.

Hey Chris,

Ken told me you called.  He thinks it was about some "deal".  But I know
better.

I haven't heard anything back yet, from the Enron NA group, but Tom Hermanic
sp? from HR
called me as I was walking out for lunch (I think in regards to EES).  I'll
be calling him back later today.

I'll keep you posted Chris.

March 2000 or March 2001?

One correction:  It is our understanding that we will nominate this contract 
until March 2000, not until the fuel management responsibilities expire in 
2002, unless we are successful in negotiating an extension of the ENA/CES 
Retail alliance beyond March 2000.

Joan Veselack@ENRON
02/16/2000 02:36 PM
To ensure everyone is on the same page. International Paper/Union Camp 
contract expires with CES Retail to perform the Fuel Management Duties in 
2002. Fred Lombardo has been handling the fuel management responsibilities 
from Pittsburgh and will leave CES at the end of February. CES is outsourcing 
these management responsibilities to Alliance Energy Services. CES has a term 
supply contract with Enron for 6900 delivered to Union Camp and this expires 
at the end of March 2000. CES is in agreement that Enron will continue to 
nominate this gas until the end of March 2000.

The Contract signed between CES and Enron, states that ENA has the agency 
rights for the International Paper Contract. 

Enron's understanding is that Enron will continue to nominate this contract 
until CES's fuel management responsibilities expire in 2002. Colleen and 
Melissa, please ensure both companies are on the same page. Fred Lomabardo 
and his boss, Don Deal, were going to outsource the nomination rights of this 
contract to Alliance Energy. This is not allowed per the Contract language.

In addition, Union Camp does not want to sign the agency agreement required 
by TCO, because it is vague. Enron needs this agreement signed so we can 
nominate the gas under Enron's accounts on TCO. We need CES's help in getting 
this matter resolved ASAP.

Thanks

(It's Clayton, on my UT account from home)

I may have the perfect girl for you; she's a 29-year old *beauty* in
Ukraine, one of my wife's best-friends, about 5'2" in height, slim,
smart but a bit quiet and introspective, who really wants to meet a
quality guy and get married and have children. She had her heart broken
by her first love, a guy who dumped her for a girl in Kiev whose father
gave the guy a good job. It seems the quality guys, as few as they are,
all want to marry a rich girl and want only money andnot children.

I'll bring a picture of her by your office tomorrow.

One hang-up- she doesn't speak English very well (yet). But, where
there's a will, there's a way.

You're probably gone anyway.  I'll think of this as "my note in a bottle".

Stumpy and his wife Martha went to the state fair every year. Every year
Stumpy would say, "Martha, I'd like to ride in that there airplane." And
every year Martha would say, "I know Stumpy, but that airplane ride costs
ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."

One year Stumpy and Martha went to the fair and Stumpy said, "Martha, I'm
71 years old. If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get
another chance." Martha replied, "Stumpy that there airplane ride costs ten
dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."

The pilot overheard them and said, "Folks, I'll make you a deal. I'll take
you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not
say one word, I won't charge you, but if you say one word it's ten
dollars."

Stumpy and Martha agreed and up they go. The pilot does all kinds of twists
and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word is heard. He does all his tricks
over again, but still not a word.

They land and the pilot turns to Stumpy, "By golly, I did everything I
could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn't." Stumpy replied,
"Well, I was gonna say something when Martha fell out, but ten dollars is
ten dollars."

Jim asked me to forward this to you.  We should probably discuss this.  

	
	

Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the 
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as 
possible.  This means using as few "formula based" curves as possible and as 
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible.  I'm not sure how you or 
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but 
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating 
transport p&l.  In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are 
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas.  These could 
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates.  The 
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index 
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue 
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES 
business in our portfolio, the times have changed.  Currently we are using 
"formula based" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport 
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and 
how we are marking the curves.  For example, today's Gas Daily postings 
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY   GAS DAILY SPREAD   SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985   $1.565     $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39   $  .585     $.16
CNG South $3.305   $  .670     $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong.  There are 
two solutions that I see.  One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which 
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other 
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more 
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace.  That's up to you.  
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads 
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know 
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it), 
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work 
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

  

	
	

Colleen,

Mark wanted me to let you know where a few city gate points are settling 
daily:

CNG North City Gate = GD CNG North +.16
CNG South City Gate = Settles at what the intra-month trader sets their 
intra-month curve at.
TECO Citygate = GD CGT/App +.10

Please note that CNG North City and TECO City settle prices come in at a one 
day lag.  After we receive gas daily settles, we reload prices for any 
derived curves.
If you have any questions please let me know.

Robin only bought 2074 dt's for the 2nd.  According to the sheet, the Tenn Z6 
volumes were 2220 dt's.  I told Brian at CES we were going to short Energy 
North by 146 dt's (the requested 1227 dt's but we only have 1081 dt's).  

Please let me know how you sourced the gas.

We bought 8000 (deal 160324) and sold it to CES in CPA 4-25 (deal 160327) for 
the 2nd.

My mistake - we are talking about the 2nd.  

Brian, do we need to do anything for the 1st?

Hey Chris,

Sorry about the phone call -- kinda difficult being discreet around here --
you know!

Yes! I'd definitely like to meet anytime this week.  Lunchtime might be
kinda rough for

you and me both, eh?  So,....maybe dinner one or more nights this week??
I'm available

any evening this week.  Just let me know!

I also spoke with Marde @ EES.  She says that "Tom Hermanic" from her group
will

be calling me soon as well.  It appears that they could use a good
Northeast/CNG

scheduler in the Commodity Risk Management group ASAP.  I applied for the
position via

Marde and the Job# as is posted on the Enron company job site (online).
Just reading

over the qualifications and pre-reqs,.....I like the position and feel that
I could contribute

immediately.

 Let's keep in touch, Chris!  Thanks for calling me!

   Sincerely,......Alain

I'm almost positive I approved of this deal and I didn't tell you.  Do you 
have any comments to add?  I'm going to forward this to Scott and Dick and 
ask them how they would like for me to handle this.   Do not share any of 
this with CES.  Thanks.

Possible penalty for Saturday's gas is below.
Marianne Stiles

if
they will invoke this until after they close the month.

Brian Perrone
01/31/2000 03:11 PM

What are the penalties for Saturday?

Marianne Stiles
01/31/2000 07:47 AM

Over the weekend we requested 767 dth additional (just rolled the deal from 
the
27th and 28th) to bring up the deliveries to match the MDQ.   However, Enron
did not realize the deal was through the whole weekend.   They only did it for
the 27th and 28th even though there are plenty of e-mails.     When I ran my
TCO reports on Friday afternoon the noms were not there.   I called Joann
(Enron scheduler) and she said she did not have time to put them in yet and
that she would get to it later as she was extremely busy with February.   I 
did
not find out that the 29th did not get scheduled until Sunday morning.   I ran
my TCO reports and it was not on there.   I then paged Joann (Enron scheduler)
to find out why.    She did question the deal with Chris on Friday after I
called stating the weekend was missing.   She said she was told the deal was
only for two days (27th and 28th).   I told her that was incorrect as it was
through the entire weekend.   However, she did agree to put in the noms for
Sunday and Monday with the understanding that Chris G. would call Brian this
morning to negotiate price.   I told her the price would have calculated last
week.

To make a long story short,  we were cut 767 dth going to CKY on the 29th
(during and OFO/OMO).   Any penalties should be passed along to Enron.   
Brian,
expect a call from Chris this morning.

It's ok to increase.  I spoke with Kate about it.  Increase your Emporia 
volumes.

Per Sherry, Global Counterparty is recognizing CES - Cove Point as the

Has CES global contract  96030669 / 65071 been transferred from CES to ENA?

We bought 1800 from CES/Allied Signal (deal 158112) and sold to EES (deal 
158120) for the 29th-31st.  This gas is coming from Allied Signal.  Lee 
Tippet thought the contract number was 62672.

Joany, would you verify that, thanks.

https://www.columbianavigator.com/Ebb/Default.asp

Just wanted to make sure you received this.

	
	

Kara/Heidi, please give this to Brian and Melissa.

Because the burns significantly increased on 1/24 from the forecasted amount 
(+16749). Contract #63281 was over-run and Storage #51407 was over-withdrawn. 
Contract over-run is $.21 per dkt and storage over-withdrawls are $10 per dkt.

Because the forecast was lower, I let Joann use the extra space for CES 
Enduser Market. TCO will let me cut gas to CES Enduser Markets as a retro. 
Not sure if you want this gas to flow or try to make it up over the weekend. 
If you need the gas to flow because of OFO penalties, maybe the storage 
over-withdrawal is cheaper than incurring OFO penalties. Please tell me what 
you want me to do. Need to do the retro's ASAP while TCO is still feeling 
generous.

FYI, the traders at Enron talked to Noel Bartlo on Tuesday. Noel said any 
costs over the space that retail had (134,710 for choice), Enron had the 
right to pass on the costs. I really hope the Noel communicated that to CES 
Retail. I would hate to have a huge misunderstanding between Enron and CES 
Retail. Remember, we schedulers are caught in the middle... and don't try to 
cause unnecessary pain.

the sale to FirstEnergy.

I'm sure I asked this question before - ENA will be paying all transport cost

Brenda H Fletcher
01/26/2000 08:24 AM
Per Sherry, Global Counterparty is recognizing CES - Cove Point as the 
counterparty  instead of Cove Point for the January payment.  
The reason is lack of the appropriate paperwork executed by the 
counterparty.

Here is the phone number for the kennel 281-449-3027.  Here's how you get 
there.  Take JFK (South - away from the airport) accross Beltway 8 to 
Aldine-Bender (next major intersection after the beltway).  Take a right on 
Aldine-Bender and go to the 2nd street which is Milner.  There are no lights 
at Milner and Aldine - you just have to watch for the road.  Go 1 block to 
Renton.  Take a left on Renton and its the 2nd or 3rd house down.

Hey!!  Where are you?  I'm about to go get my Dad a chocolate malt.  Today is 
his long day at the hospital.  He's probably still there.

How about Monday, Jan 31st for dinner??

Do we dare start this again.

let me know some dates.

thanks

If it ever comes up, I do call Susan's number first - i get no anwser then I 
call Steve.

I thought you were taking care of all that Tiger??
	
	

Colleen has signed the letter and it has been FedX for arrival at TCO 
tomorrow.

Susan Wade is presently upset that we are using Team 3 and not her  Team. She 
overheard Chris Germany talking to Steve Stonestreet today. She overheard 
Cindy Burnette working on Union Camp for me yesterday. We need someone from 
Enron to smooth this over with her.

Please decide who will be giving Susan Wade the courtesy call about the 
change. Not sure what timing is best... today or tomorrow.

Thank you.

Do the emails help??  Is this the way you guys want ot see this?

We bought 500 from COH (deal 155197) and sold it to CES (deal 155195) for the

Yes, just go ahead and ignore all those emails, and lets start over, ok....

1) What is the status of CNG Producing Company  - Deal #77755?  The contract  
was called Trag 110, 
and I see that in the service list on CNG Transmission, but it needs to be 
pathed starting 07/99 through current.
Also, the rates are showing up as:
Transportation       $.19910     but should be $.06
ACA                           $.00220     Should not be paying ACA
Compression          $.00000    Should be $.22

2)   What is the status of CNG Field Services - Deal #125711 (Marco Pipeline) 
- Coronado Pipeline  Enterprises?

I have more, but do you think that we could get these 2  taken care of 
today?  Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

To summarize the policy set forth below. . .

1.  We are going to discontinue correcting rates in Unify/Sitara for for 
production months older than 12/1999.  This allows us to focus our efforts on 
current month.  Per Bryce, applaud here! 

2.  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled directly in UNIFY using manual line items and will not be corrected 
in SITARA tickets or UNIFY rate tables.

3.  Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected 
within the SITARA transport tickets and the UNIFY rate tables.

4.  Do not adjust Unify/Sitara rates issues for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by Volume Management coordinator.  Changes should be made 
effective 12/1999 production forward.  

Please let me or rates coordinator know if you have any questions.  If 
necessary, please forward to your teams.
Thanks,
Carrie

	
	

Per our discussion this morning, we are going to discontinue correcting rates 
in Unify/Sitara for for production months older than 12/1999.  (Applause 
here!)  Any adjustments that are required prior to 12/1999 production will be 
handled via a manual line item.  

Manual line items must be entered in the correct contract, production date, 
etc. and must reflect the correct fee type.  For example, if you are 
correcting demand, the fee type should be demand, not commodity.  Same 
applies to cashouts and commodity.
All Service invoices for all production months through 11/1999 must be 
corrected manually and finaled by the end of 1/2000 accounting.  Any 
exceptions need to be discussed with me before we close.  The Rates team will 
also not make any adjustments on Monday, 1/31.  This should allow you time to 
redraft and see if any additional manual need to be entered to insure that we 
close with everything finaled.
Beginning with 12/1999 production, all rate issues must be corrected within 
Unify/Sitara.  Any line items booked because the adjustment wasn't made by 
the Rates team in time to pay the invoice must be corrected in the system and 
reversed by the end of the same accounting month.  For items that have been 
identified as manuals that won't be reversed, an explanation needs to be 
provided to me at the end of the month.
The rates team will not adjust Unify/Sitara for periods prior to 12/1999 
unless agreed upon by the Rates coordinator and the Volume Management 
coordinator.  They will make their changes effective dated 12/1999 production 
forward.  

Upcoming goal -- we will be working to clear all 1999 tranport OA issues by 
the end of 2/2000 accounting...  Once the numbers booked in Unify are final, 
we should be able to resolve the PMA issues we have had outstanding.

We sold Cove Point gas to CES, the volume is 228 dth - deal 155139.

I deleted 2 meters from deal 418282 for 12/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  Please make 
sure the risk assignment is still ok.

Thanks

I'm forgot, what do you need at Tenn O&R for tomorrow?

We will deliver 46 dth to Tenn NYSEG meter 020221on contract 31533 at first 
of the month prices.

Also, we are selingl you the 600 dth of CNG delivered at $5.00 for the rest 
of the month.

How many days do you need this CNG Nimo gas?

We also sold CES 5000 dth at BG&E, I am entering this deal as a Transco 
sale.  However, we may move it to CGAS.  I'll keep you posted.

I'd like to set up a meeting with the two of you (and whoever else you think 
needs to be there) to go over the booking of various deals.  For example, 
Dayton P&L--we pay out to them a big demand charge each month, but the desk 
should be getting an annuity payment back.  Where will they see this in their 
p&l?
CALP is another example.  Are you two available Tuesday around 12:00 to 
discuss?

I will make sure someone from the East Desk is there as well.  If there are 
any in the Central Region that are like this, let me know and I'll round up 
someone from that desk, too (unless you think they already know how theirs is 
working).

Thanks.

I can't remember, should the VNG demand charges be on I'm VNG or East and 
Market East?

NOTICE TO ALL SHIPPERS:

There will be a mandatory E-SCRIPT upgrade on Tuesday, February 8, 2000.

This upgrade will take approximately 45 min. to download via the Internet
using a 33.6 Kb modem connection (which is typical for dialup customers).
Please note that Altra customers will require additional time to upgrade.
If you prefer, you may call the E-SCRIPT Help Line at 1-800-895-8899 to 
request
software for this upgrade. We will need you to leave your company
name, contact person, mailing address and whether you need a set of diskettes
or a CD.

The upgrade will include the following E-SCRIPT modification:

Users will be able to enter volumes in Nominations via the Daily Volumes Tab
for nominations in normal mode.  This will allow nominations for different 
days
of the month on an activity, rather than 'retrieving' data for each day from 
the
main tab.

As always, please call the E-SCRIPT Help Line with any problems, questions
or suggestions.

Thank you,

I think we chatted about this the other day.  I'm waiting to see if we 
actually get the retail deal before I send any notification.

Hopefully we will know the first or second week in Feb.  I wouldn't tell 
Steve its not a done deal yet.  Just tell him we are still working things out.

   
	
	

Since you never work anymore.... ha.. ha..... decided to e-mail you.

Where are we at in this process? Steve Stonestreet was asking me. He just 
doesn't want to upset the apple cart. Steve said that you've been calling him 
directly about questions, but he has not heard the official word fromTCO yet.

Thanks.

You must have put a lot of thought in this.  P   

Would you send me an amtel at 3:00pm Wed, Jan 26 about my review?

Thanks

   
	
	

Your review will be Wednesday, Jan. 26 at 4:00, in EB 3084.

What did we do about this?  I'm thinking we let it flow.

Joann,

WGL (Shenandoah Gas) is under gas in/gas out restrictions through Monday.

Please bring in an extra 128 dth/day for 1/20 through 1/24 to CES EU.  For
today I've talked to WGL and we can bring the extra in on Cove Point.

Per my voice mail please let me know that today's increase will flow as soon 
as
possible as I have a customer that is waiting to see if he has to burn 
propane.

Thank you!

I'm at work, where are you??

I made a couple of changes.  This worksheet will be your top priority for 
Friday.

Hi guys.  We need to add the CES demand charges to the East Desk P&L.  The 
impact to the desk is ($694,399).  This includes the demand charge paid to 
CALP and the reimbursements for the Penn Fuel capacity.  It does not include 
any demand charges paid to Dayton Power & Light.  How are we accounting for 
that?

The file is under o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls  Use tab 
CES WHOLESALE.  All the demand charges under CES RETAIL are reimbursed.

I sure we are missing some things.  Scott Goodell will be going through this 
worksheet tomorrow.

Please check on the actual storage capacity volume on FSS contract 63304.  
I'm showing 7,503,838 dth and I'm thinking it might be closer to 7,000,000.

Thanks

I forgot about this deal.

Hey, I'm too tired to think so I started going thru my emails.  Here is what 
your buddy wrote up and its not exactly correct.

Chris-

Here's my paraphrase of our meeting I sent to Vince and Vasant, VP's of 
Research. I hope it's basically accurate.

Clayton
Clayton Vernon
12/16/99 01:59 PM
Vince and Vasant:

Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at 
the East Desk, related to gas transmission:

Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example 
might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay 
$12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed 
payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs ("shrinkage") and 6.5% for 
overhead expenses.  A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a 
delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 ("basis"), and might call Brooklyn 
and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 .  The trader's spread is 
$0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would 
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.  
As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have 
an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity. 
Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum 
("it's not worth their time to haggle") (There is a further issue of 
"secondary markets" not important to the model yet).  For South Texas and 
Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take 
(pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc).  And, once the trade is in the 
system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline, 
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

Clayton

Sorry it took so long.  I believe this was the last email I sent out.

Mark, David;
Enron Corp is expecting 590,609.20 ($463,609.20 + $127,000.00) from ECT.  
Scott Neal wants to see what impact, if any, this will have on the East Desk 
P&L.  I'm hoping we didn't show any of this as East Desk revenue.

Summary
Earlier this year, ECT received a credit from Transco in the amount of 
$463,609.20.  This credit was the result of reallocations on Enron 
Louisiana's PVR replacement contract for 9612 and 9701 production months.  
ECT nominated the replacement gas and paid all transport expense associated 
with this contract.  Scott Neal has agreed to pass this money on to 
corporate.  The net effect to ECT is $0.00.  Enron Corp is also expecting 
$127,000.00.  This is for a similar adjustment ECT received in 1997 that was 
written off on 1998 (see below).  The actual amount for the 1997 adjustment 
is $121,080.16.  

Enron Corp has had a $600,000.00 receivable (from Transcanada) on their books 
since Enron Louisiana was sold to Transcanada.  Enron Corp and Transcanada 
thought Transco was going to send the credits to Transcanada instead of ECT. 

Chris,

In order for the I/C imbalance between ECT and ELEC be resolved by August 
month-end close,  a wire or check made payable to Co.366 needs to be prepared 
by the end of this week.  

Please advise me the amount that needs to be made so that I can prepare a 
manual wire/check this week.  I'll contact Inez Haberl regarding the payee's 
bank information.

Thanks,
Vivien
X3-9558   

The offsetting dollar amount for the 9612 production adjustment 
(K#016-21045-306C) was $121,080.16.  This adjustment however was reversed 
from Enron Louisiana's account and reclassed to Enron Liquid Services in 
11/97 GL and subsequently written off in 01/98 GL at the time the company was 
sold.  I do have a copy of the write off entry at my desk should you need it.

I've discussed with Darron regarding the difference between the amount we are 
going to make to Co.366 ($463,609.20) and the actual dollars in the system 
($498,824.82).  He thought it would be better for audit trail purpose to 
write off this difference since the volume in the system is correct.  

Chris, please let me know when to prepare the wire/check to Co.366 and what 
the amount would be.  Thanks,

Vivien

The 9612 production adjustment received from Transco was a reduction in 
volume of (33,517).  There was a ($2,734.99) Commodity adjustment and a 
($124,582.69) Cash Out adjustment for a total credit from Transco of 
($127,317.68).  ECT took this credit.  This volume adjustment was entered in 
the sales system in 10/97 reducing the sales volume to Enron Louisiana from 
284,890 to 251,373 on K#016-21045-306C.  I don't know what the offsetting 
dollar amount would be for the sales adjustment but someone in Client 
Services should be able to get this info.  

Chris Germany
08/04/99 03:01 PM
I spoke with Tracy Geaccone after our meeting yesterday.  Tracy is expecting 
to receive about $590,000.00, the $463,609.20 we discussed in yesterday's 
meeting plus a $127,000.00 adjustment we processed  in mid to late 1997.

Melba told me this morning that  the $127,000.00 was for a 9612 production 
month adjustment.  What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to 
Enron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2)  pass it through to 
some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3) 
cut a check to Trans Canada?  Who do I talk to about this?

Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 366.  
Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez.  
Her extension is 3-7720.

Next question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait 
until we find out what happened to the $127,000.00?  I believe it depends on 
how long it will take to research the $127,000.00.

Comments, Questions?

At the request of Melba Bowen the following meeting has been set:

To discuss the handling of funds due Enron Louisiana as the result of 
reallocations on Transco.
Date:  Tuesday, August 3rd
Time:  3 p.m.
Location:  EB37C1

If you have a scheduling conflict , you can reach me at X36890.  If you have 
a question regarding this meeting you can reach Melba at X35004.

Thanks,
Cecilia

This is the way I show the Dayton Power exchange deal starting 1/21/2000, 
please let me know if this is incorrect.

ENA delivered gas to Dayton's TGT citygate.  In return, Dayton is giving ENA 
gas at various CGAS citygates.  There are no fees for this transaction.  The 
TGT deal is 152766, the CGAS deal is 153213.  The volumes on these deals 
should match.  Also, Dayton should not be using any ENA supply (pool gas or 
ENA storage) to supply the CGAS citygate volume.

Comments/questions?

Victor, I did not put a meter number on the CGAS deal.  

Also, it's time to introduce Steve Gillespie to Sitara.

Here are the buy/sells we did after lunch.

Supply Deal Market Deal
153071  153057
153096  153135
153109  153109

The purchases are from CPA and the sells are to CES.  Originally these deals 
were done for the 21st, I just extended the date and the volumes through the 
24th.

Let me know if you have any questions.

My good buddy Scott set up contract .9047 in Sitara.  Please note:  do  not 
schedule gas on this contract.  This contract was set up for accounting 
purposes only.

I'm throwing away anything on my desk with Gatherco.  I'm assuming you and 
Ms. Jordan are taking care of everthing on that.  Also, if you ever need to 
send transport contracts to Houston, its best to send it to Sylvia Campos.  
She is the transport contract Queen and she absolutly loves paper.  So send 
her allllll of your paper.

I believe this was suppossed to be a much bigger deal.  There was some 
confusion between CES and Eagle Point and it ended up just being more or less 
and exchange deal on ANR and a transport deal on CGAS.

Chris,

Everything looks fine with the deal except the volumes.  The information that 
CES gave us had at least twice as much volume on both of those tickets.  Do 
they have the right to swing like that?

FYI - You may already be aware of this but I'm passing this on in case you 
didn't know this.

Storage deals require a meter on both the injection side and the withdrawal 
side in order to bridge - even if there is only a demand charge.
A zone is not enough, it must have a meter.  Let me know if that works.

d.n.

   

The deal was entered on friday 1/7,  and your right it never bridged over to 
Unify.  I don't understand the location question,
the deal was set up like all other storage tickets.  I'm just trying to get 
the demand to download so VM can draft it.

 - Alain Diza resume.doc

Per John Grass - CES sold Eagle Point gas on ANR (deal 136749) at ANR IF 
+.01.  and bought Eagle Point gas on CGAS (deal 149838) at CGAS IF +.005.

The sale to Eagle Point is in Sitara.  I just added the purchase deal on 
CGAS, it was not in Sitara.  Per John - Eagle Point is guaranteed to recover 
the ANR variable cost plus $.02.

I created a purchase from CES (deal 149778) to replace the CPR STORAGE deal.  

Victor, please move the daily volumes to deal 149778.  As far as I can tell, 
ENA should not be billing CES for their storage gas.  So, we should show a 
purchase from CES for the storage gas.  Of course it will get much more 
complicated once we resolve all of the retail issues.

I have more info on this deal - according to Colleen Sullivan, this is a CES 
Retail fuel management deal.  ENA has the right to use the capacity and does 
all the nominations on the CALP contract.  I still need the counterpart set 
up.  Thanks

Victor,  for January, I have set this up as and exchange deal (deals 149775 & 
149776).  We may need to create 2 delivery exchange deals for constrained and 
unconstrained citygates.

Scott, this is the deal we spoke about this morning.  For January, we will 
treat this as an exchange.  We need to chat about Feb and March.

Mary downloaded the purchases and the sales to excel.  I spot checked some of 
the deals and they look good to me.  There are 2 small deals that are 
missing, deals 480324 and 480325.  These deals are related to the CGLF NYMX 
purchase.  I had the buy/sale on CGLF.  I didn't enter the buy/sale on CGAS 
until this afternoon.  Alvin should have these tracked and balance early next 
week.  The dollar impact should be very small.

Why Exercise???

1) My grandmother started walking five miles a day
 when she was 60.
 She's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she
 is.

 2) The only reason I would take up jogging is so
 that I could hear
 heavy breathing again.

 3) I joined a health club last year, spent about 400
 bucks. Haven't
 lost a pound. Apparently you have to show up.

 4) I have to exercise in the morning before my brain
 figures out what
 I'm doing.

 5) I don't exercise at all. If God meant us to touch
 our toes, he
 would have put them further up our body.

 6) I like long walks, especially when they are taken
 by people who
 annoy me.

 7) I have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach
 covers them.

 8) The advantage of exercising every day is that you
 die healthier.

 9) If you are going to try cross-country skiing,
 start with a small
 country.

 10) I don't jog. It makes the ice jump right out of
 my glass.

CES has a synthetic storage deal with Equitable Gas Company on Texas 
Eastern.  CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April 1999 and Equitable is 
giving CES the gas back in January 2000 in Tetco M2.  According to my new 
best buddy Fred at Equitable, CES will pay Equitable $.65 /dth after the 
January transaction is complete.

Here are my questions/comments;

1.  David - please look at the new deal I created for this exchange (deal 
146788).  The existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange.  
I believe the counterparty should be Equitable Gas Company which is the LDC.  
If it looks OK to you, I will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the 
new deal.  Please let me know ASAP.

2.  Linda/David - do we have CES's contract with Equitable?  I would like to 
see a) what CES was paying Equitable for this deal and b) when the payment 
was due.

3.  David/Stephanie - if the deal is structured the way Fred described it 
above, where do we put the $.65 fee at?

4.  Linda - Fred has not received any assignment notices regarding CES 
Please forward this email to others that may need to see it.

Thanks

Attached is my demand charge worksheet for October.

Jeff, we should probably chat about the pricing.  I'll explain it to you when 
I get back.  On TCO, I averaged everything together and entered a fixed price 
on the big citygate deal.

I think we can change the ranks pretty easily.  As far as the business party 
Ids go, I think we need to have you, Diane and the Transco rep (Bharati?) 
discuss what needs to come across in the proprietary file.  Transco was 
making some changes on their side for the BUG stuff that we may not be taking 
advantage of.  We will see how the CES stuff fits in there as well.

Thanks, d.n.

   
	
	

Dave,

As we discussed over the telephone, we will have a problem with the CES 
contracts as well
as the one we have with Brooklyn Union.  Our proprietary file contacts the 
business party id, rather
than the DUNS number.  Currently, all of our activities default to Enron's 
business party id.  These
are the valid business parties we use:

ENA    5304
Brooklyn Union   21995 
Columbia Energy Services 5092
Columbia Energy Marketing 7772

As we become agents for other parties, which CES is agent for various 
producers, we will
need to include their business parties as well.  For now, this is all we 
need.  In the meantime,
should I code the activities CES has already nominated that I will insert 
into Unify as do not
send??

Also, another continuing problem is the 899 default ranking.  We spend a 
great deal of time 
overriding this rank to 850 as a default and use 899 as the swing activity to 
be cut as we need
it.  Is there a way to default to 850 so we only have to change the one swing 
activity to 899??

Thanks for you help.

CES is buying 2500 dth/day from Equitable in Tenn Z4.  CES is selling 2500 
dth/day to FirstEnergy in Tenn Z4.  Looks like a match to me.  I told Fred 
with Equitable the information John Singer gave to Phil below.  For future 
reference Fred's number is 412-395-3295.  A backup contact at Equitable is 
Steve Rafferty, 412-395-3268.

Per John, FirstEnergy bought the meter (??) from Beldon & Blake effective 
12/1/99.  On CNG, we are showing a purchase (deal 141688) and a sale (deal 
141952) for 2500 dth/day with Beldon & Blake.  I don't see a sale anywhere to 
FirstEnergy.  

Also, I still see an Equitable supply (deal 135956) on CNG for 3226 dth/day.  
I believe this is a duplicate of deal 138741 in Tetco M2.

Comments?

pvillag@columbiaenergygroup.com on 12/29/99 03:29:10 PM
Chris,

This has to do with that TENN zone 4 deal that you e-mailed me about this
morning. Like I mentioned earlier, we never scheduled this gas, it was handled
on a back to back basis.

Phil

John Singer
12/29/99 03:05 PM

Phil,
FirstEnergy called to change the contract number for the sale I made to them
(originally to Belden & Blake) to be delivered to the Carroll Co Meter.  The
new contract number is 32082.
If you receive this email before you page me, that's what the page is about.
Call or email me with any questions.
Thanks,
John

We are agent for Enterprise, Petsec, and Pennzoil (Devon) on Stingray.  Petsec
and Pennzoil (Devon) are filling out the appropriate forms and should send to
you for your signature today.  There in nobody at Enterprise to sign the
form.   I am still working with Stingray regarding the agency between Enron 
and
CES.  I thought this was taken care of but maybe not.  I am working with a
backup that is confusing.  I will follow up.  In summary, I think Enron will
have to nominate on CES contracts because I do not feel all this will get done
today.  Especially, Enterprise Oil.

Fred with Equitable said he has 2 deals with CES.

1.  Tennessee - Equitable is selling CES 2,500 day delivered to Zone 4 at 
NYMX + .35.  Equitable has the trigger and this deal goes through March 
2000.  CES is currently receiving this gas at Beldon & Blake.

2.  Tetco - CES gave Equitable 100,000 dth in April and Equitable is giving 
CES 100,000 dth in January 2000 delivered to Tetco M2.  CES has(or will) pay 
Equitable $.65 for the exchange.  We call this a synthetic storage deal.

Do you know anything about these deals?

Could you see if the retail people could use this worksheet format? We may 
not be able to do this for everything but I believe we could use this format 
for Tennessee, CNG, Tennessee, Tetco and Texas Gas (excluding AGL).  What do 
you think?

Here is a more updated volume breakdown.   We swing down on weekends (and
sometimes during the week if the customers shut down).   These volumes are 
good
except for Boston Gas and S. Ct.   We are waiting for the ldc demand curves 
and
Algorithms.   Those two ldc volumes represent our estimates.

Please let me know when you have a contract number.   Thanks.

Is the TCO capacity from Eagle Point considered Retail or Wholesale?

Karen - All but S. Ct. and Boston Gas are good to nom.   Please let me know
k#'s.   Scott called me earlier and told me we are expecting a capacity piece
of 1000 dth and we bought the remaining delivered.   Whom did we purchase the
delivered from?   (I would like to call the supplier and give them the
breakdown so that I can get a contract number).

Noel - Also as per our earlier conversation, Yankee is giving me until 4:30
p.m. to turn in a contract # for their noms.   They are quoting their tariff 
as
we have never turned our contract number in to them on time.    I need a
contract number for Tennesse and AGT for Yankee.   It is urgent.

Done, I think.

   
	
	

FYI -The first four deals below are in need of meters in order to bridge to 
Unify.  Ignore the bottom two deals.  Sylvia is adding the contracts now

SRM (x33548)

CNG SAbine contact is Alain Diza 713-752-7690.

Richard Pinion
12/28/99 03:54 PM
Actually, the service is called "Parkfolio" by the hub.  Sylvia just needs to 
verify that this is a point based service like the IHT service to finish.  If 
you could call sylvia ASAP and all will be finished by today.

Richard Pinion
12/20/99 04:31 PM
As per our conversation today, we will set up a new service for contract 
I00059 that will be "Park and Lend".

I talked with Scott Mills regarding the Sitara end; he said two tickets were 
necessary:

 1.  An Exchange ticket with the counterparty "CPR PIPELINE EXCHANGE" (when 
done with the pipeline) and
 2.  A Storage Capacity Ticket with the pipeline (CNG Sabine Hub Services) as 
the counterparty.  This is where you
  will set up the rate you have negotiated with the pipeline and the service 
that Molly can path on so as to
  get the correct rate for the service.

I will check with Kirk Lenart to confirm the correct way for Global to set 
this up and I will let you know so you may select it on your deal ticket.

Final Final numbers??

How much of this capacity do we have for the first?

pdrexel@columbiaenergygroup.com on 12/27/99 03:15:16 PM
Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport.  We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered)  NIMO would not allow us 
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.

Chris_Germany@enron.com on 12/27/99 02:52:40 PM
Please respond to Chris_Germany@enron.com

How much of the NIMO capacity (about 15,000 day of North to North) was 
dedicated
to retail?

From what I'm seeing, the retail volumes are looking fairly small.

Just received notification from ConAgra Energy Services.   The volume required

(meter # 020028 stays @ 596 dth).

Per the sales reps and GMS I will need the following:

100 dth per day to meter # 020030
596 dth per day to meter # 020028

I will receive a final number for these next week but this is an estimate.
(should not be that far off).

Hey team, I entered a sale of 10,659 in M3 for the 1st (deal 144104).  This

Hi Lori,

I believe we are still pulling our Local Production from you behind NYSEG,
please let me know ASAP if you disagree.

I am going to pull    1620 dth's/day  , again, let me know if this creates a
problem for you.

Thanks!

Hey, you're back.  Did you have fun?

jerry and I are taking a motorcycle trip next week.

Did you guys execute the PSNC contract?? And if so - as CES or CEM??  Also, 
I'd like to have the offer number.

I think Transco is done except for PSNC.

Transco Stuff
I set up several Atlanta contracts and 2 storages - all CES
I set up 3 small Boston Gas contracts - all CES.
I set up the S Jersey capacity - CEM.

I think thats it.

I have all the CES and CEM capacity releases in Sitara  We have; 
 several contracts for Atlanta Gas Light - all CES, 
 we have 3 small Boston Gas deals on 1 contract in Z6 - all CES
 we have 1 z3 to Z6 deal from S. Jersey - on CEM

I still need to enter the PSNC capacity from St 85 to PSNC - real low on my 
priority list right now.

I sent Janet Edwards at CES a request to get ENA set up as agent for CEM - 
this has not been done yet.  

Please show this email to the CES Transco scheduler for confirmation.

ta da  :)

Dick bought some Agg gas from CNG Field Services Company - deal 143278.  
Kimat entered this as TCO pool deal.  The volume is currently 2187 dth per 
day.  Dick said this volume should increase tomorrow.

Robert, could you call CNG Field Services and get the upstream info?  They 
should give you an agg point - not the IPP pool.

Thanks

FYI - I believe this is important.  According to Morgan (CES's CNG scheduler) 
CES currently has about 7,000 dth of idle capacity.  I've had 3 people call 
me today looking for CNG capacity for Jan 2000.

pdrexel@columbiaenergygroup.com on 12/27/99 03:15:16 PM
Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport.  We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered)  NIMO would not allow us 
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.

Chris_Germany@enron.com on 12/27/99 02:52:40 PM
Please respond to Chris_Germany@enron.com

How much of the NIMO capacity (about 15,000 day of North to North) was 
dedicated
to retail?

From what I'm seeing, the retail volumes are looking fairly small.

According to Morgan at CES, the 5,000 dth purchase from Sempra is off ANR.  
Morgan is in our office today and will be here tomorrow afternoon.  You may 
already know about this deal.  Morgan handles all the nominations at East

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio.  I will be using most of the
Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4771 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 196 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible

This schedule just covers agencies with CES and CEM.  For most pipelines, It 
does not cover contracts where CES is acting as agent for another

Here are the January daily volumes for each of the gates.    I know you wanted
an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not have that for all Tennessee Zn 6 
markets
until Thursday as Boston Gas and S. Ct. Algorithms will be available then.   I
have estimates in on those gates.  We will need a range from 2700 dth to 3600
dth per day.   This large swing is normal for these types of markets due to
weekends, weather, and customer situations.

Here are the January daily volumes for each of the gates.    This is the
breakdown for 1/1.   For Boston Gas and S. Ct.  we are told what to deliver 
and
we will know that on Thursday.   The number on the attached spreadsheet is our
estimate of what Boston Gas and S.Ct. should be.    We will fine tune those 
two
ldc's on Thursday.    For the month of January we will need a range from 3200
dth to 4300 dth per day.   This large swing is normal for these types of

I took the volumes on deal 472520 (CPR Storage) to 0 and moved them to the 
following deals.  
Crystal, deal 472520 was valued at CGLF IF.

Deal  Comment
473178  Exchange sell for the November Injections
473190  Exchange buy for the December withdrawals.

Susan wants the withdrawal volumes to go into Texas Gas.  

Tricia, deal 473190 has the daily withdrawal volumes.  Please set up the Egan 
to Texas Gas ticket.

All of my information is on the following worksheet  
0:/logistics/capacity/east/NE/Egan_strg_NOV2000.xls if any is interested.

We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas 
and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I 
will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.

Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR 
Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone 
know the deal tickets by the end of the day.

Attached is the master list of contracts.  I save this file as

Per the sales reps and GMS I will need the following:

100 dth per day to meter # 020030
596 dth per day to meter # 020028

I will receive a final number for these next week but this is an estimate.
(should not be that far off).

Hi Morgan, Noel, and Paul,

I just received my daily volume for Jan 2000 from RG&E.  That number is a CNG
requirement of 83 dth's/day.

Thanks and will be sending you more soon.

I bet everything we did in June, July and August is wrong in Unify as well.  
I wonder if we should go back to June 1st on setting up this contract?

We don't have that much activity on this contract.  Let me know.

Here are the approximate January daily volumes for each of the gates.   Please
do not forget that January 1 and January 2 will be lower because of the
weekend/holiday.    I know you wanted an exact volume for 1/1 but I will not
have that for all of the Algonquin markets until Monday, 12/27.      We will
need a range from 3200 dth to 4200 dth per day.   This large swing is normal
for these types of markets due to weekends, weather, and customer situations.

Hope - approximately 1224 dth per day (this does not include Bayer and Eagle
Glass will swing)

EOG - I will not need any CNG gas for East Ohio.  I will be using most of the
Sempra (5000 dth per day ) gas 4585 dth for my FRPS pool #11344 and 33 dth for
my GRPS pool #10478.    This will leave 382 dth of the Sempra gas for you to
sell.    Please let me know to whom we are selling that to as soon as possible
as I need to release the gate space.

Please let me know if you need any additional info.    Thanks.

Hi.

For the month of January 2000, UGI will pull from the ELA Tabs #600494 and
deliver to UGI's citygate for CES' endusers.  The daily volumes I have listed
below are delivered volumes.

January 1 - January 6 = 1214 dth per day
January 7 - January 31 = 1489 dth per day

It is not definite that the increase will occur on January 7th or the volume 
of
the increase.  That is an estimate.  Bayer will give us a better idea at the
beginning of January.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
Thank you.

Are you ready for some FOOTBALL!!!  Sorry - that was just running thru my 
head.  I am about to start sending everything I have to all you fine people.

Transport
I have the CES transport split between Wholesale and Retail.  For the 1st, 
all CES transport will be in a file all to itself.  The file is located 
at o:/logistics/capacity/east/ne/ces/2000ces01.xls.   We have most of the 
retail contacts in Sitara, there should be a deal number in column U.

Most of our transport problems for the 1st will come from the asset 
management deals. Ex.  Tennessee MUNi's.  How many of these are there??  Good 
question.

Good Luck

Have fun ;)

I just spoke with John Hodge about Dayton's PEPL storage (see items in BLUE

about the Dayton Storage.

Attached is the latest file on capacity.  I have updated the C&I list for
releases from O&R on Columbia Gulf and TCO, from BUG on TETCO and from LILCO 
on
Transco.  I have updated the Choice list for releases from Atlanta on CNG,
Sonat, South Georgia and Transco.   On the Wholesale list, I have reflected 
the
releases that we have made on Columbia Gulf, TCO and TETCO from capacity
associated with the Penn Fuel asset management deal and for the release from
South Jersey on Transco.  All of these changes are highlighted in blue.  The
following releases have not yet taken place for 1/2000, but should happen on
Monday or Tuesday:

C&I

CNG - Release from Hope for sale to Bayer
CNG - NiMo customers
TCO - Release from Eagle Point for sale to COH customers
TETCO - Dayton Power & Light customers
Texas Gas - Dayton Power & Light customers
Transco - PSNC customers
Trunkline - Dayton Power & Light customers

Choice

East Tennessee - Atlanta customers
Midwestern - NIPSCO customers
NGPL - NIPSCO customers
Tennessee - Atlanta customers

If you have any questions, please call Scott Goodell or myself.

Here are the answers to your questions:

1.  Cove Point LNG is a peaking facility.  There are three 10-day peaking
contracts for 50,000 Dthd each or a total of 150,000 Dthd of peaking 
capability
by delivery from the Cove Point pipeline into the east side of TCO's system.
The gas can also go directly into Washington Gas Light or into PEPCO's Chalk
Point electric generation facility.  The variable transport cost on Cove Point
LNG is less than $0.005/Dth.  This gas was hedged by CES as baseload 
withdrawal
during the January 1999, but can be withdrawn any time before the end of the
contracts which is 2/29/2000.

2.  The TCO storage is the CES retail storage.  Enron's contract with CES
retail contains the withdrawal schedule for this storage.  I would work with 
Ed
McMichael's group who should be getting this schedule from CES Retail.

cgerman@ect.enron.com on 12/23/99 08:22:40 AM
Please respond to cgerman@ect.enron.com

I have 2 storage questions for now.

1.  Cove Point LNG - it's my understanding that this is a LNG peaking 
facility.
The current balance is 1,500,000 dth.  Did you have a withdrawal schedule or
were you going to use this as peaking gas?

2.  TCO contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 BCF, and I think your current 
storage
balance is about 5 BCF.  What is your withdrawal schedule for Jan??

thanks

I entered deal 477669 in Sitara as a purchase from New Power at the FOM index 
pricing.

Jeff, I believe this works out because we should be increasing our citygate 
sale to you, also at the FOM price.

Jeff, I'm out all next week, just call Joann and she will get the pricing and 
enter the deals.

Also, just so I don't forget, I sold 5000 dth day of TCO Pool to New Power 
for the 10th-30th at $5.68.  I won't enter a deal for this, I just need to 
incorporate it into my citygate pricing.

Don't worry about getting me a Diet Coke.  I just got one. 

Greetings,

Thanks for the TV. and Jaime also said Thanks for the bed room suite.
Chris, I found Dad's old pistol.  It was under the dresser in his bed room.
I placed it in the linen closet third shelf from the top, back left.  It is
captured in a pistol storage case.  I stuck it in behind the sheets and
things.  I saw Chad and Angela on my way out.  They are a great couple.
Jerry, I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work.  I am going
to get in touch with Gerald and you and him can work out the agreement if he
wants to lease Dad's pasture.
As I stated he will pay $20/acre per year.  You had said we do not want to
pay for a fence along the creek.  When I have leased places in the past I
have had to build new fence at my own expense.  Most folk's base their
cow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation.  If I built fence
and that particular piece of property sold before the five years was up,
then I was reinversed the balance of my initial fence/material investment,
excluding my labor.  Something to think about.  I hope we do not own that
place for five more years.  Gerald also said he would mow the grass around
the house and sort of keep the place tuned up.

Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead.  They placed her in
Angleton/Danbury for overnight observation.  I think she required about
seven stitches in her head.  There were x-rays taken and her lungs are
pretty much gone.  Of course, that depends on how well the x-ray tech can
read his prints.

Stopped by and saw Bernie Max.  Now where did they come up with a name like
that?  They removed the lymph glands from his neck.  Starting down the torso
just at the left collar bone, a width of about three inches go down the
torso about six or seven inches.  A triangle shape about the size of a piece
of large pizza.  The incision must have been about 1.5/1.75 inches deep into
his body.  The doctor told him it was only fatty tissue.  They took a pretty
big chunk out of his chest.  He had a six " x eight " piece of skin removed
from his left thing for a skin graft.  It looked pretty painful.  He was in
good spirits and bull corning around.

I guess that is about it.  I would like to have a timber appraisal performed
on the Dad's place.  I'll be chatting with you guys.  Oh, I forgot the dang
remote to the TV.  I really was not for sure which one it was.  I think I
need it to program the darn thing.  Keep your powder dry.

Y'all be safe,

don

Things are always crazy around you, even when the rest of the world is 
sitting still.

not a one.  i don't even have a phone yet.  We moved into a new office today
(my first day) so things are a little crazy around here.

How many deals have you done????

How many deals have you done????

Chris
 This in my new email address

A man was stopped by a game-warden in Northern Michigan recently with
two
buckets of fish leaving a lake well known for its fishing. The game
warden
asked the man, "Do you have a license to catch those fish?"

The man replied to the game warden, "No, sir. These are my pet fish."

"Pet fish?!" the warden asked.

"Yes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let
them
swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their
buckets,
and I take em home."

"That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that!"

The man looked at the game warden for a moment, and then said, "Here,
I'll
show you. It really works."

"O.K. I've GOT to see this!." The game warden was curious, now.

The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited.

After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said,
"Well?"

"Well, What?" the man responded.

"When are you going to call them back?" The game warden prompted.

"Call who back?" The man asked.

"The fish." replied the warden.

"What fish?" The man asked.

We are still together.  But you just wait, there is still time, especially 
since I went to church twice yesterday and she didn't want to go at all.  
She's a heathen like you.

Have you an your Woman broke up yet.  Normally takes about 2 days after dinner
with us.  Man the meal and company was excellent.  I enjoyed myself greatly.
Especially after you picked up the tab.

Looks like we are getting another $5,000.00 from the asbestos settlement.
Maybe I should just keep this to myself.  I'm so poor and I need so much.

Don, why don't I mail this other ag exemption to you and you can fill it
out just like the first one you sent in?  What mailing address should I
use?

I'm going to the doctor this afternoon for my allergies.  I hate getting
old.

Sounds like they are having fun!  I lucked out, I have a doctor appointment 
at 2:15 PM today.  This is with my specialist up on 1960.

Hey buddy, this is out of a Duke Energy newsletter.  I'll just give you the 
highlights.

Duke Energy acquired Market Hub Partners Storage (MHP) from subsidiaries of 
NiSource, INC.  MHP currently operates 2 facilities.  The Moss Bluff facility 
in Liberty County, Texas, and the Egan facility in Acadia Parish, La.

I have never used Moss Bluff, I know it interconnects with Tetco in Stx.  I 
like Egan - it hooks up with ANR, Tex Gas, Tenn, CGLF, and Trunkline.

YOU BET.  I'm going to work out after work, go home, get comfy clothes, go by 
Walgreen's for drugs, pick up a "guy" movie, then drop by the immer palace.

Can I make you soup for dinner tonight, if I promise it has meat in it? 

We may be dining with my brother and Sister in law tomorrow around 6:30 PM.  
Comments ???? Questions????? 

It is over with.  The addendum may or may not be signed and its a seperate 
document and I will personally pay for all legal cost incurred regarding the 
addendum.  But the other documents are in route to me, i get it, i sign it, 
you and donny sign it, i send it back, waaaala!!  The lawyer told that once 
the documents are filed with the courthouse then everything becomes ours (I 
don't call the lawyer anymore because her time is "billable")  I don't think 
its that simple though.  What do you think?

So what are you doing this weekend?

Jerry W Germany <germanj@basf-corp.com> on 05/11/2001 07:16:21 AM
Hey,

If some where down the line they want to excerise this right, then we worry
about it.  I say we worry about it for the next  five years then let whom ever
has  a problem with this hire a lawyer for the rest.   What you say BUB.  Lets
just get this over with and move on with life.   See Ya.

Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed

The sale to PSE&G is in the New York book.  Judy is trying to get Transco to 
bill PSE&G directly for the demand charge.  We are still waiting to hear from 
Transco.

Brenda H Fletcher

A physical forward deal with the reimbursement amount entered as an external 
fee in Sitara.  PSE&G would be buyer and TP-2 is seller (assuming this is a 
TP-2 deal).    What is the term of this deal?  Is commodity reimbursed also? 
Please confirm desk , provide details and I will enter the deal.  

Thanks,
Brenda

   
	
	

I just added the PSE&G demand charges on Transco to our capacity worksheet.  
The net impact is $0 because I'm also showing this as a reimbursement.  How 
should we put this in Sitara.  I'm showing a transport demand charge on the 
capacity deal ticket.  How do we get the money back from PSE&G?

We sold the National Fuel back to the Canadian desk for June at NX1 + $.235.  
The volume is 9189 per day, deal ticket 782980.

Kimat, please forward to the Canadian Book Admin.

05/10/2001 10:45 AM
I'll handle it from here on the volume.  Thanks!  I assume that after that, 
it's ready to go?

   

Demand charges are showing up now.  We still have a problem with the 9th 
(4500 @ $5.445), this should not be on the invoice.  My Transco scheduler has 
informed me that they have taken the volume to 0 in Unify and that this item 
will need to be "actualized" 0 by volume management.  I don't know how that 
part works.

Dara, are you volume manangement??

On the 8th TP2 sold VNG 10,000 dth at st 65.  This volume was entered on deal 
760980, which is a VNG buy from Gulf 1.  I took the volume on this deal to 0 
for the 8th and created deal 780794 (VNG buy from TP2 at St 65).  Please make 
a note in you files.

Meredith, you will need to repath these deals on the 8th.

Thanks

We are having a happy hour for Dan tomorrow.  Would you like to come?  I have

Thanks

Darla Saucier@ENRON
05/09/2001 11:14 AM

remove the volumes "actualized" on the 9th.

Natural Gas Futures End Higher

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX closed higher yesterday as traders
sought to cover their short positions due to a feeling that the market was
oversold following the steep decline of the last several days. The June
contract climbed
$0.04 to $4.279 per MMBtu. June rose $0.039 to $4.353 per MMBtu. The market
was basically just marking time until the AGA releases the latest storage
injection figures this afternoon. The AGA is expected to announce an
addition to storage of about 100 Bcf. A somewhat lower injection could spark
a rally because the market has already discounted a triple digit build.
However, an injection of over 115 Bcf could send the market to $4.00 in a
hurry. A year ago, stocks for the same week rose 58 Bcf, and the five-year
average injection is 61 Bcf. Since the AGA began reporting storage data, the
highest ever recorded was 78 Bcf in 1998. If current weather models hold up,
the Midwest and Texas will escape much of the summer's hottest temperatures,
and right now, temperatures are mild across most of the nation. Look for
technical support at the $4.20 level, and resistance is expected at $4.40.
Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada generally slipped
$0.10  $0.15 per MMBtu yesterday, except in the west where most spot prices
rose due to hot weather. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hub
dropped $0.12 to $4.21 per MMBtu.

Enron's Lay Calls for Open Access to Transmission Grid

    Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, says that generators should have easier
access to the power grid. Lay spoke after receiving the US Energy
Association's 2001 US Energy Award, saying that today we don't have open
access to the transmission grid, and we could get more power into the West
if we had open access. He says the FERC should open up the power grid
throughout the nation so generators no longer have to pay a series of
separate fees to move electricity from one region to another. He also says
FERC has the authority to open up the power grid in the same way that
natural gas pipeline transmissions work. It's clear we've under-invested in
energy infrastructure in the last 10 to 15 years, and it's going to take a
few years to correct that.

Kinder Morgan and Calpine Offer 2 Open Seasons
for Sonoran Pipeline

    Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Calpine have announced that two open
seasons have begun and will continue through June 1st on the recently
announced Sonoran Pipeline.  A binding open season is being held on Phase
One of Sonoran - which would run from the San Juan Basin in New Mexico to
the California border - to give shippers the opportunity to commit to firm
capacity on the pipeline.  A non-binding open season is being held
simultaneously on Phase Two of the project - which would extend the pipeline
from the California border to the San Francisco Bay area - to give potential
shippers the opportunity to express their interest in obtaining firm
capacity to California delivery points.  Sonoran has received a binding
commitment from Calpine Energy Services for 400,000 Dth per day on Phase One
and a non-binding commitment for 500,000 Dth per day for Phase Two. The
proposed pipeline will be a 1,030-mile, high-pressure interstate natural gas
pipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets in
California and is projected to be in-service date by the summer of 2003.

Power Suppliers to Meet with California Governor

    Executives from energy suppliers are meeting with Californias governor
today, and several are willing to discuss concessions that include price
limits on power sold within the state. Last week the governor said he would
seek to force the suppliers to accept reduced payment for billions of
dollars owed by the states utilities. In the face of a state investigation
into alleged market manipulation, some generators are willing to discuss
limits on prices for some electricity sold to the state. Williams says it is
prepared to support temporary price controls that would extend through the
summer of 2002. Williams is also willing to discuss a range of possible
alternatives for repayment of past debts owed to it. Reliant will reiterate
an earlier offer to sell some electricity to the state at $20 per MWh if the
buyer will pay for the natural gas to generate the power. Duke Energy has
proposed accepting less than full payment for power sold to the state in
return for an end to state and federal investigations into the prices they
charged. Duke, Enron, AES, Dynegy, Mirant, El Paso Energy, Reliant, and
Williams will all send executives to Sacramento to the meeting.

BULLS CAUTIOUS
In spite of slip sliding natural gas prices, analysts are still cautiously
bullish. There seems to be little incentive to abandon the bullish cause
with the prospects of hot summer weather looming."This is a weak market, but
I think that below $4.60 you have to anticipate the return of industrial
demand. It's really a wild card as to whether that demand will take the edge
off the current large injections. Over the past month, the market has gone
through a major change. Production has increased, storage  is higher, and
the injection last week at 102 BCF was the largest since June of 1998,' says
George Ellis, broker analyst with BNP Paribas, New York. "I was skeptical of
 the whole concept of demand erosion, but it's obviously real and when you
combine that with an increase in production, the supply demand balance
becomes clear. There is potentially more room to the downside, but the wild
card is weather and if that kicks in, prices could move sharply higher. If
prices fell to $4.38 then that would be a reason to put on another 25%
hedge. As long as we're holding these prices I think there's a good chance
prices will rally higher. I'm cautiously bullish. I would not be an
aggressive seller," he said.

Blackouts Hit California Again

    California residents suffered through a second day of rolling blackouts
yesterday as temperatures soared, driving demand ahead of supply. The
California ordered that as of 3:10 PM the state's utilities must cut 400 MW.
Blackouts had been forecast by the ISO since early in the morning with the
heat coming at a time when many power plants are still off-line for
maintenance. The Los Angeles Department and Power, was as usual was excluded
from the blackouts. The LADWP is not under the ISO's control and has more
than enough generation to meet its demand. The ISO said demand was running
about 1,000 MW above Monday's levels. Earlier Tuesday, the ISO had projected
blackouts could be ordered before noon, but the return to service of two
500-kilovolt lines operated by BC Hydro meant more power was able to flow
south. About 700 MW produced by small suppliers, known as Qualifying
Facilities, are currently offline because they have not been paid. The hot
temperatures are likely to continue today, with the threat of more
blackouts.

Thanks

I entered ($4.9951) x 12dt which should give them a credit on the invoice.  I 
also entered a demand of $93835.00.  These items should show up seperate on 
the invoice.

I added the demand charges but I still need one of my Transco schedulers to 
remove the volumes "actualized" on the 9th.

Mr. Germany - following are my notes per info Darla sent me:
Invoice corrections:
 Purchases on 4/9 should be zero.
 Transport charge is OK =  $11,274.31
 I do not see the demand charge in the invoice...
 Also need to add a credit cashout for 12dt's at cashout price.
I will be back in on Wednesday. 

Thanks Darla for sending this - don't let Mr Germany - slack off next week.

Yep.  Guess I'll leave Monday to get there.

You should know better. You could do a road trip... you're good at driving!!

No chic - business trip.  May not go because tickets are $900.  I waited
toooooooo late doggoneit.

Which chick are you taking with you???

We'll chat later.  I'm trying to get an invite to Florida for a CNG thingy
next week.  Leave Wed come back Friday.  May not happen.

Why doesn't Enron promote from within.... same old story. It just took a
long time before EOL had the markets out there.

I leave Tuesday evening. There is a dinner Monday night... you should get
an
invite... since Goodell has to do the family thing... as always.

What happen to Dick??

Scott is your main man - I guess.  I don't know if he is going to keep
doing it or if he's going to hire an analyst.  I think Susan will be doing
Texas Eastern.  Mr. Goodell will be going to the CGAS/TCO meeting on
Tuesday.  I may be going Tues afternoon.

When do you leave Houston?

Vickey told me yesterday was her last day. I see Scott Neal is on Tenn Z0.

There are no quotes out there... just for Enron's info.

I'll be in town this weekend.. going to TCO/Gulf meeting Monday and
Tuesday.
Hope to see you.

Hope your back and other aches are okay.

AND, I want to hold back $79,000 of revenue on deal #401601.

The customer price is $5.7025 which is based on the following

Sales Price  $5.4850
Transport to Stoi $.1526  (I included $.0147 too much by accident)
Storge Injection  $.0249
Capacity Demand $.0400

Total Price  $5.7025

We will overinject in October by about 362,000 dth to max out storage by Oct 
31.  Since we will not estimate the transport expense until Oct, I want to 
hold back roughly 362,000 dth x $.2175 = $79,000.00  (close enough).

Thanks

Hey.  I went on a company outing to Aransas Pass last week.  Left Wed 
afternoon and got back Friday afternoon.  One of the pipelines I deal with 
has a hunting and fishing lodge down there.  It was nice.  I caught 2 redfish 
- both keepers too!  The guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water.  
All I had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting.  
I could really get used to that sort of thing.

The fishing guide said I should expect to pay about $1,000/ft for my fishing 
boat.  I guess my boat will only be about 4 ft long.   Keep looking for my 
BOAT.

Let's see - the ex wife came in from Denver for a wedding Friday night.  She 
stayed with me all weekend.  I took her to the airport this morining.  Things 
went pretty well - no romance, just good friends.  I introduced her to my 
girlfriend - we all had lunch together.  That was a little odd.

Nothing else going on.  I'll try to have an update on the legal stuff by Wed.

Later Gator.

We would have been around $.39 to $.42.

   
	
	

Dominion was able to buy TETCO M2 delivered for NYMEX plus 32 cents.

Little correction going forward

The higher of
St 65 Offer plus $.27
TCO Offer plus $.19

	
	

Currently, we are unable to use IT to serve Ogy at Doyle on Transco.  I have 
devised a super scientific method for pricing VNG space for Ogy.  Poke all 
the holes in it you want.

Use the following formulas to determine the price to Ogy

The higher of
St 65 Offer plus $.35
TCO Offer plus $.14

Good Luck

Re:     Market Area IT Availability  May 1, 2001

The available interruptible transportation service (IT and

2001 and continuing until further notice is summarized as
follows:

Tier I and Tier II (only Sta. 90 through
Sta. 180 affected)                                      0 MDt/day

South Virginia Lateral Compressor Station 167           144 MDt/day

Tier III (Station 180 through East)                     0 MDt/day

Leidy at Centerville Regulator Station
(Only deliveries downstream of Centerville
regulator affected)                                     OPEN

Linden Regulator Station
(Located in Union County, New Jersey)                   50 MDt/day

Mobile Bay Lateral                                      162 MDt/day

DTI will not be charging for TTT service through June 01, they will probably 
not start to charge any time soon, however they still have the ability to 
charge.  My feeling is that they will find it difficult to charge after 
providing the service for free for some time.  If they do start to charge by 
nom is there a way we can provide that service?  I will think about that one. 

I'm going to a Unitariean church on Sunday.  Not happy about it either.

May.  On NFUL - I created deal 749380.

I figure buying stuff for me and making myself happy is just like making you 
happy  :)

When is that very last one going to kick in? 

The truth is out there!

Computer Gender 

An English teacher was explaining to the students 
the 
concept of gender 
association in the English language; noting how 
hurricanes at one time were 
given only female names, and how ships and planes 
were 
usually referred to 
as "she." One of the students raised her hand and 
asked, 
"What gender is a 
computer?" 

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class 
into two 
groups:? males 
in one, females in the other, and asked them to 
decide if 
a computer should 
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked 
to give 
four reasons for 
their recommendations. 

??? The group of women concluded that computers 
should be 
referred to as 
masculine because: 

1. In order to get their attention, you have to 
turn them 
on. 

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless. 

3. They are supposed to help you solve your 
problems, but 
half the time, 
they ARE the problem. 

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, 
if you 
had waited a 
little longer, you could have had a better model. 

??? The men, on the other hand, decided that 
computers 
should definitely be 
referred to as feminine because: 

1. No one but their creator understands their 
internal 
logic. 

2. The native language they use to communicate 
with other 
computers is 
incomprehensible to everyone else. 

3.? Even your smallest mistakes are stored in 
long-term 
memory for later 
retrieval. 

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you 
find 
yourself spending half 
your paycheck on accessories for it.

Should we start terminating CES as a shipper on the interstate pipelines?

Ernie, this is what I think.  ENA sold CES gas delivered to the NIMO 
citygate.  I don't think we ever had supply behind the citygate like we did 
with Peoples and East Ohio.  Heidi probably did the imbalance trades because 
it was after the gas flow day and we were unable to do anything about it.

Comments, questions?

	
	

Ernie's on the team now.

	
	

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade 
behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go 
away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 
2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
 Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria 
Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.

Laurie Ellis

She has a mostly white one - at least those are the color of the kitty hairs 
on my clothes.  She left his front claws in because she said it was mean to 
take them out.  Of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws 
on the couch.  I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be 
said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one.

I guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are 
kinda tough.  Good luck.

What kind of kitty does Ingrid have??

Rob is fine... we had a little tiff and didn't talk for a week. He went to
the LDC forum in Boston. We made up over e-mail today... or at least
exchanged apologies. I'm not sure when I'll see him again. Gloria is
visiting me next weekend... girls night out. The following weekend Cindy is
visiting me. The weekend after that I'll be in Houston for TCO shipper
meeting. It has been two weeks since I've seen him. We have a great time
when we are together, it just hasn't been very often latetly.

I'll ask my woman her opinion about my rock hard stomach.  I'm sure she
will agree after I tell her what to see.  I guess women can be sensitive.

Ingrid's fine - and you?  How's your man?

My last response didn't make sense... now that I re-read it. I meant to see
I like a cat personality better.

I'm sorry about the cushy remark... I'm guessing you have worked out a
lot... since I last saw you. It's probably rock hard now.

So how is ingrid??

You like (cat) attitude don't you?  And what makes you think my stomach is
cushy??????

I'm guessing your stomach is nice and cushy.... not rock hard. Your
women...
ingrid???

I'm not getting a hamster!!! They have no personality like a cat.

Why don't you get a hamster or something like that.   You know my woman has
a cat - he likes sleeping on my firm, rockhard stomach when I watch TV.

I planted 50 plus flowers this weekend in my flower boxes. They look so
pretty. I hope I don't kill them. I'm going to find me some kittens in the
next few weeks. I'm lonely without Miss Muffy. Cindy Vachuska is coming to
visit me in two weekends. I'm taking May 4th off.. we are going to do some
museums, day to the eastern shore, and baltimore's inner harbor.

Bidweek is such a joy!!! We are suppose to be back online with y'all... so
they say.

How sweet.  Its doing ok.  A better question is "how's the lovelife?".
That's doing ok too - although I wish I could find the perfect woman.  Mine
is wanting to take some trips - Maine, New York, EUROPE!!!!!

What's up with you girl?

See.... I'm being nice and not asking any other questions.

Hope you're doing okay.

U forgot to copy you brother.  I don't think he did it.  I think it just 
kicked in somehow.

Ya'll reckon the old Coot had all this planned so if there was any problem 
form
marriage, family etc, this automatically happened.   He probably did this back
when he was swapping land with Bertha and did not plan on us having to do this
again in the future.  MMMM, interesting.   Hey did he leave any of the land to
me or just you guys???

Chris.Germany@enron.com on 04/23/2001 01:13:03 PM
Spoke to Mary last night.  She's doing well and I know you both care.  She
said Bernie Max was in surgery for 4 hours on Friday to have a melanoma
spot removed from his collar bone - not good.  She found out about it
indirectly somehow.  Gerald and Shirley didn't know about the surgery
either.

I should have an update on our legal issues by the end of the day.

I just spoke with "Wendy" in the Cherokee County Appraisal District.  She
said all of Dad's property was transferred to us back in August of 2000.  I
told her that seemed odd since the property was still in probate.  She said
that there was a special warranty deed transferring the property to us and
that Mary Esquivel had agreed to transfer the property.  Don't know how
that happened and don't care.  She also said that we need to fill out the
ag expemtion on both pieces of property.  The one I have is for the 31
acres.  Don, she will mail the other application to you at P.O. Box 532,
Brazoria  77422.  She will also mail a copy of the last application Dad
filled out.  We need to get the completed applications back to them in May
(does not have to be May 1).

Love you MAN!!

I'll ask my woman her opinion about my rock hard stomach.  I'm sure she will 
agree after I tell her what to see.  I guess women can be sensitive.

I include Darla on anything dealing with New Power or CES.  Maybe CES should 
just be you??  AND Wade can tell me what producer activity is going on or if 
he is aware of any items not in Sitara.  But Ernie should have the whole CES 
picture nailed down.  I'm thinking this Statoil should just go to Ernie and 
we not be involved.  I spoke to him on the phone before I sent the email.

I took the volumes on deal 472520 (CPR Storage) to 0 and moved them to the 
following deals.  
Crystal, deal 472520 was valued at CGLF IF.

Deal  Comment
473178  Exchange sell for the November Injections
473190  Exchange buy for the December withdrawals.

Susan wants the withdrawal volumes to go into Texas Gas.  

Tricia, deal 473190 has the daily withdrawal volumes.  Please set up the Egan 
to Texas Gas ticket.

All of my information is on the following worksheet  
0:/logistics/capacity/east/NE/Egan_strg_NOV2000.xls if any is interested.

We are injecting gas into EGAN storage today through Monday, off of Texas Gas 
and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I 
will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.

Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR 
Storage deal ticket and I believe that is incorrect.  I will let everyone 
know the deal tickets by the end of the day.

Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.

This is what I want, at 17 to 18 footer with a 70-100 HP motor.  I prefer a 
shallow draft center console for bay or bayou fishing.

Make it happen buddy - and remember, I'm not made of money.

I am glad to hear the both of you are o.k.  How does the grass look up at
Dad's.  I am thinking we should maybe bale the hay.  I have intentions of
going up there this coming weekend.  You should have bought a boat during
the boat show.  I have a friend who is always fishing and I will ask him
about a boat.  Do you want a ski boat or a fishing boat?  Freshwater or
Saltwater.  I do know the best motors are made by Yamaha.  A friend of mine
at Demi Jon had a Gulf Coast which is basically a chopped down Boston
Whaler.  I think the boat was around 21/23 '.  The sides were approximately
6/8" tall with a center console and a very large ice chest mounted directly
behind that which served as a seat.  It also had what I call a jack plate on
the motor for vertical lift prop clearance between boat and bay bottom.  He
could run in about 8" of h2o.  If I remember correctly it was a V 6 150
horse Yamaha.  That baby would fly.  They are bay boats but Aubrey took his
out in the Gulf frequently.  You should call Duane Davis.  I bet he can find
you exactly what you want.

Buddy, did the Easter Bunny come to see you?

Be Safe!

Well I guess you know by now that Jerry and I survived Florida.  I had fun
at Disney.  The airshow was a bit of a let down though.  AND NO, I didn't
buy an airplane.  Now I'm thinking ... boat... yeah that sounds real good.
See what you can find me.

I'm tired of my Ford Explorer.  However, I checked new car prices on the
internet and I think I'll keep my Explorer for a little while longer.  New
cars are so expensive.  So just go find me a boat and I'll be happy.

Just came in to work for a few min.  Later.

Did she show you her tatoo?

I need to be back in Houston by 2:00 PM.  I'm thinking about driving myself.  
Your the boss, what do you think?

I am so glad you are going.  Here is the scoop.  Think about your flights
and let me know.  If you would rather drive w/ Berk and I and another guy
that works here, you are welcome!!!
But, you know you will never catch as many fish as Judy.  She is just
amazing.  No one can touch her!

May 2-4 -       Fly to the lodge (Corpus) on Wednesday afternoon or evening
(May 2nd).

                         There is fishing  on Thursday  (all day)  and
Friday morning.   Everyone leaves the lodge around noon on Friday to fly
back.

My contact at new power has not been returning my phone calls for the past 
two weeks. I am trying to resolve some of those prior period issues and tie 
out for this month as well.  I don't know if he's out on vacation or what.  I 
usually talk to Cris Miceli, do you know someone else I can talk to over 
there?

According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show 
below.  We have 3 options on serving this deal: 
1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone 
SL Pool
2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead
3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65

Most of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after 
paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the 
prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone 
SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02 
(including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with 
Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this 
is a term firm sale to NYPA.

Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid 
price  and the transport expense?

I did vote for the new sports arena.  

AND, I'm sending the latest schedule to the lawyer today.  I will wait till 
after lunch to send it in case you guys have any more input.

Then try AEP in Columbus.  They have a big shop and you should know some of 
the people there. 

Thank you for the leads, but I am going to stay here in "the land of grey 
winter", until Todd is ready to move south.  That will hopefully be in 2 or 3 
years.

Congratulations on the good news.  Sorry to hear about the bad news.  There 
seem to be lots of scheduling jobs around here but I don't know if you want 
to do that.  Bob Superty is the best person to chat with their.  Also, you 
might chat with AEP.  They just bought some Houston assets and they might be 
keeping those assets in Houston.

Hello Chris!

I was writing to give you some good news and bad news.

Good news:  I got engaged last weekend.  I am very excited!  Todd is a very 
wonderful person.  This is the person I met on MM last year who lives in 
Columbus.

Bad news:  I am getting laid off.  I transferred to Columbus with Clinton.  
They are laying off half their staff.

I am not real fond of Columbus and hope to move back to Houston one day.  
Hopefully we can work together again one day.

Hope all is well with you!

Take care!

Susan

Please give Judy Townsend, Scott Goodell, and myself  the ability to trade 
the physical Canadian products.  We need to be able to see them on EOL.  

Thanks

Hey there.  I was on vacation on the 9th.  I guess its ok to send out the 
invoice now.

Darla Saucier@ENRON
04/09/2001 03:15 PM
Please let me know when this invoice is good to go.  I need to send it out by 
tomorrow (04/10) at the latest.  

Thanks!

Very funny!

You really don't care about my back do you?????   Its doing ok.  Went to 
Florida with my brother last week.  Spent 2 days at the airshow and 2 days at 
Disney.  Enjoyed both very much.  That was my first Disney trip and it was 
pretty cool.  Need to go with a Chic next time though.

Mr.  Hodge is trading CGAS and his number is 713-853-7276.   And YOU ARE 
CORRECT AGAIN - he's the old CES dude.

Behave yourself girl.

Hey.. how's it going??

How's your back??? How was Easter???

I may come down for the TCO/Gulf meeting in May. Have to get the blessing of
my boss first.

Who is doing TCO pool??? The screen says John Hodge... he is really a nice
guy.

Is John (can't remember last name)... TCO appalachian guy from CES... still
at Enron?? Do you have his number?? I've been given the order to start
finding appal gas... what a joy. I thought I would give Jim Javins a call
too.

Hope all is well for you.

Just came in to work for a few min.  Later.

This is how I priced the deal

Sandra's May-Oct physical Ela Basis offer was about ($.0725)
The screen was aroung $5.30

NYMX   $5.30
Ela Bas is  (.0725)

Ela Price  5.2275
Variable   .4500

M2 Price  5.6775

M2 less NYMX  .3775
TP2 demand  .1000

Price to Customer .48

We would do this to the extent Judy could get the capacity.

	
	

I'm out next week.  Chat with Mr. Goodell if this comes up again.

   
	
	

I offered May/Oct to Dominion @ +48 cents for 3,000-5,000/day.  Neil said the 
number was within reason. He is to let me know today or in the AM if he wants 
to do the deal.

We should probably look at this sounds like a Hattiesburgh type deal to me.

Gas Storage Facility to Be Sold Immediately

A natural gas storage facility in Monroe County, Mississippi which is ready
to be built out is being offered to be sold immediately. It will be
connected to Tennessee Gas Pipeline and Texas Eastern and others. It has 12

deliverability. This project is worth considerably more than the $4.2
million asked by the owners, who need to sell it quickly.

The deadline for offers or serious interest is April 13, 2001. For more
information on this gas storage facility please call (985) 893-9225.

Thanks for the card.  It was very nice.

Please bookout the following deals that I entered for 3/31/2001.

Match purchase deal 718081 with sales deal 718078.

I think this is my last New Power deal forever.

Getting short means I'm selling now - expecting the price to go down - and 
then buying.
Getting long means buying now - expecting the price to go up - and then 
selling.
I think you should be doing this with cattle futures.  

Right now I down $290,000.00 for the day.

Buddy,

Surely you jest!  Oh, don't buy Lucent either.  I think they are preparing
to file Chapter 11.  Yea, I'll bet if I had not let Ma fall out of the truck
she would have really bragged on me.  I know.  Terrible.  I do recall her
spanking me a long time ago!!!  Today is Friday and I am happy.  Hey, what
is getting short mean?  I hear people speaking of this thing all the time
but I don't know.  Dow is kicking tail today.
I saw that mortgage rates rose today.  Did you really lose that much
money???  I would be climbing upon top of my DWS(dow work station) to jump
off.  That's my latest saying.  I am not making new paragraphs just
rambling.  Have a good weekend.

You are a good gradson.  I got a quilt out of Dad's closet and took to Ma
Monday night.  I was only there for 15 min and I bet she asked me 5 times
if I had a girlfriend.  By the 5th time I think I was telling her I was
married with 6 kids.  She only metioned you taking her for a ride 20 times.

I seemed to have gotten in on the wrong side of NYMX today.  I got short
around a $5.24 and the offer is now $5.395.  Let's see - I've only lost
$185,000.00 today.  Oh well, its just money I guess.  Its funny how unhappy
that makes me.

I'm gonna go pout now.

I can't see what you have in the 5th column.  Buy, if the all meters on the 
pipe are marked at TGT/ZSL then that tells me what I need to know.

Is this  the mapping you were looking for?

I just left Cingy a message  - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance 
trades that we intiated.  However, it could have been done by CES or EES.  I 
asked her to call me back.

Chris, I am still trying to get these imbalance trades resolved.  John Bieltz 
is no longer with Amereda Hess but Cindy Wernecke has been working this 
issue.  She can be reached at (703) 317-2293.  Can you please get back to me 
as soon as possible as they would like to resolve.

Thanks

No, I still haven't gotten anywhere on this.  My contact at Amereda Hess

is jbieltz@hess.com.  Thanks for your help.

I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my 
knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at 
Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we 
were not aware of.

Laurie Ellis@ENRON
11/01/2000 02:55 PM
Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG 
Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient 
awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria 
Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.

Hey Buddy!!!!  Wrong worksheet.

   
	
	

Rate effective 4/1/2001

No back surgery yet.  Second opinion Dr. said "let's just wait for 3 months 
and see what happens.  We can always do the surgery." I liked that idea.  

Give Mom and Dad a big hug for me.

You are the best!!! Did you have your back surgery yet??? I forgot about
that... I hope you're okay. I'm going on vacation too... April 11 to 16...
see Mom and Dad in Colorado!!!

Have a splendid day!!!

If you nom from Onshore straigt to Leach, you pay Comm (meaning without ACA
or GRI) and ACA, the ship Leach to TCO Citygate and pay Comm + ACA + GRI.
If you go from Leach to your TCO pool, you pay the same CGLF stuff and no
charge on TCO at all.

Next question, you have SST and you go from the pool to STOI, you pay the
SST Comm + ACA + GRI into storage.  When you use SST to go from STOW to the
Citygate, you only pay Comm, no ACA or GRI (i think).

Backs doing ok.  Going on vacation on the 9th and I can't wait.  And yes it
has been a stressfull bid week.  But you r probably making tons of dough.

I need a correct answer to my question... I know you will not lead me a
stray.

If I buy onshore, take it through mainline, take it through leach, and take
it to a delivered gate on TCO. Do I just pay GRI  once at TCO delivered
point. If I drop it off in TCO pool, then I pay the GRI there?? I can't
seem
to get a straight answer from my accountants and TCO. It looks like our
model is adding the GRI at each leg... opps.

Thank you sweetie!!!!

How's your bidweek... mine sucks!!!

I just sent in a request for a new CGAS/NFUL interconnect - request #2410.  I 
entered meter number 6000065 for NFUL, it should be 600065.

Opps.

Donna explained how everything is working so Victor has killed the following 
deal tickets

Deal  Comment
470563  New Power Exchange buy
470568  New Power Exchange sell
470582  CPR Storage Sell
470587  CPR Storage Buy

We will be using deal 456379 (purchase from New Power) through March 31st.  
Also, we need to make sure we do not recognize the storage balance in 
Sitara.  Joann has the storage contract number if anyone has questions.

I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract 
for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end 
effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  

I entered the following deals at a zero commodity
470563  Buy exchange
470582  Sell Cpr Storage

470587 Buy CPR Storage
470568 Sell exchange

I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through 
March 31.  

I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.  

According to Nelson this deal should be on GULF3, not GULF1.  Woul you plea=

Well, the time has finally arrived............after purchasing some bean bag 
and inflatable 'Southpark' chairs, I'm officially ready for a party.  Won't 
you please come  over and share in a few cocktails.   This Saturday, March 31 
at 7:30,  1314 Utah St.  (corner of Truro and Utah, near Memorial Park)   I 
will have beverages and snacks, but as in the past, no jello shots or Busch 
beer.  (sorry Matt and Mike)

Most of you aren't aware of where I live, but parking could be a problem. 
(sorry, no valet)   In the 'hood', people tend to park wherever they can, 
this being along all the streets surrounding the house as well as the 
volleyball courts at Bubbas.  Park wherever you can.

Please see the attached map or go to Yahoo Maps for assistance.  It works 
well if you use 1380 Utah St.  (Don't ask why)    Please pass this on to 
others that I may have overlooked.  Call if you have any questions.

Lunch was terrible today.  I don't know who it was though.

FYI
Based on a request by Dennis Bond, a new report has been added that allows
external customers to see the group, name, and description for all reports 
that
they can run.  The report is called RPT_GROUPS_EX (group Reports), and can be
run by internal users as well.  Only reports that are available to all 
external
customers are included, so company specific reports will not be displayed.
Currently the report is 10 pages, and does not include a data file 
(description
can be up to 200 characters, and doesn't fit well into a spreadsheet).  Dennis
wanted to be able to give new customers something to help them get started 
with
the various billing report options.  Since showing all reports didn't require
that many pages, thought it might be helpful to include everything.  Good 
idea!

Robin Barbe did a long term sale to EES.  The volume is 1200 dt/day.  EES has 
the option of taking delivery at Tenn Zone 5, meter #20816 or on CNG 
(Dominion), meter DOMSP.  The contract price to EES is the same at both 
locations.

Deal 624140 is the sale on Tenn.  EES requested the volumes on CNG effective 
3/23/2001.  I created deal 686905 for the sale on EES.  

Kimat, I assume the CNG will need to hedged.

Let me know if you guys are receiving the Transco postings.

Re: Offers for Permanent Relinquishment of Firm Capacity in
Conjunction with the Momentum Expansion Project

As a part of the Momentum Expansion Project ("Momentum"),
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation ("Transco") is
soliciting offers for the permanent relinquishment of firm
transportation capacity on the Transco system from Station 65 in
Zone 3 or mainline receipt points in Zone 4 to delivery points
in Zone 4 or Zone 5 at or upstream of Station 165. Subject to
certain conditions, Transco intends to combine such relinquished
capacity with newly constructed capacity in order to render
service under Momentum. Offers for capacity relinquishment may
be made only for existing transportation services provided under
Part 284(G) of the FERC's regulations.

Valid offers must meet the following criteria:

1. The capacity offered must result in a reduction of the
facilities otherwise required to serve the subscribing
shippers under Momentum;

2. Inclusion of relinquished capacity in the project must result
in a lower cost of service for the project than if additional
facilities were constructed;

3. The remaining contract term for the relinquished capacity must
not extend beyond the 15-year primary contract term of the
Momentum service agreements;

4. Offers for permanent relinquishment will not be accepted from
shippers who nominate for service under Momentum;

5. Offers must identify the specific contract(s), MDQ, receipt
and delivery point(s) in each contract at which delivery point
entitlements (DPEs) will be reduced as a result of the
relinquishment of firm capacity to those points.  Shippers
will not be permitted to relinquish a geographic portion of
any contract; and

6. Offers must be unconditional, binding and irrevocable.

Such offers must be received by Transco no later than 5:00 PM
CST on Friday, March 30, 2001.  After receipt of offers to
relinquish capacity, Transco will finalize the design of the
facilities to be constructed to render service under Momentum.

Parties that submit offers to relinquish capacity will be
notified as to whether the offer complied with the
specifications set forth herein and whether the capacity will be
accepted and utilized to render service under Momentum.  If more
capacity is offered than is needed under Momentum, preference
will be given to those offers that reduce the cost of Momentum
to the greatest degree. In the event of a tie, preference will
next be given to those offers that have the shortest remaining
term for the capacity relinquished.

Shippers with relinquished capacity that is included in Momentum
will retain all rights and responsibilities set forth in their
Service Agreement(s), Rate Schedule FT and the General Terms and
Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff until Momentum firm
transportation service commences through the relinquished
capacity.  The relinquishing shipper's service agreements will
be terminated or reduced effective on that day. Transco's
acceptance of relinquished capacity is and will be subject to
the following:

1. Execution and delivery by the shipper to Transco of an
agreement to permanently relinquish such firm transportation
capacity (such agreement to be provided by Transco);

2. Execution and delivery of an amendment to the shipper's firm
transportation contract reflecting any modifications resulting
from the relinquishment of a portion of the service related to
such capacity, if applicable;

3. Execution and delivery of firm service agreements by shippers
subscribing to all capacity to be made available under
Momentum;

4. Shippers relinquishing capacity will file in support of
Transco's applications for a certificate of public convenience
and necessity authorizing Momentum;

5. Receipt of a FERC certificate authorizing the proposed
Momentum facilities and service (including approval of
shipper's capacity relinquishment) in a form acceptable to
Transco in its sole opinion; and

6. Placing the entire Momentum project into service.  In the
event that Momentum does not go forward for any reason,
including, without limitation, the FERC authorizations being
granted in a form unacceptable to Transco, the capacity
relinquishment shall not be effectuated and all related
agreements shall be null and void.

Parties desiring more information regarding this announcement
should contact Helen Laughlin at 713/215-3773 or Orlando
Alvarado at 713/215-3378.

and CGLF.  We will be withdrawing this gas ratably in Dec into Texas Gas.  I 
will probably make a mistake or two on my deals because I'm kinda sleepy.

Crystal will help me set up the deals on EGAN.  I am currently using a CPR

Would you check on the status of meter request 02325 and let me know where it 
stands?  We need to deliver gas to this point.

What curves are assigned to the following Transco meters

Meter 6540 & 6923

Thanks

FUNNNNNY!~!!!   No thanks on the recliner.  I think I want to get rid of my 
living furniture first and I may wait until I move to a bigger apartment.  My 
last electric bill was $22.00 - that's hard to beat.  I'm so pooooooor now.   
Let's see 1700 options witht the stock dropping $20 per share means no big 
down payment on a house.

Hey, would you like for me to bring your recliner home next time I go up?  I
think Debbie and I can get it into your apartment.  Thought it might be
comfortable for you to kick back in after you have recuperated from the
surgery.  I have to go and get a haircut.  I still have my fifteen chin
whiskers!  I just keep them trimmed short and neat.  Takes about ten seconds
to do that.  Baby likes them though.  She does not want me to ever shave
them fifteen little rascals off ever!!!

Bye,
me

Thanks.  He's one of the few people i do remember.  I always like him and
man could he weld.

Hey  Buddy,

I am not for sure  if you remember Leon Simple.? He was the black man which
worked for Dad at  Dow Track Maint.? Leon lived over by McNeil Bridge on
the Brazoria side of  the San Bernard.? He has been over to the house in
Shady Acres  before.? At any rate, he died this past Sunday morning with a
massive heart  attack.? I sent a Flower Basket on behalf of the Sons Of
Wheeler Germany,  Don, Jerry and Chris.

Take  Care,

Don

Chris,

As you and I both know and discussed, New Power will manage what used to be 
the old CES TCo and Gulf capacity starting in April, 2001.  We have talked to 
the CDC's (COH, CPA, CMD, & CVA) have worked out the following with them:

CMD & CVA
CMD and CVA will recall all of the CES capacity on Gulf and TCo from you.  
They will subsequently re-release it to New Power effective April 1, 2001.  
New Power will execute it at that time.  This should happen late this week or 
early next week.

CPA
CPA will not recall it form ENA and re-release to New Power.  Can you 
permanently release all of that capacity at max rates to New Power as soon as 
possible effective April, 2001?

COH
For COH, the biggest pieces of capacity on TCo are FSS storage and 
corresponding SST contracts.  They both expire in March 2001.  Therefore 
nothing is required of ENA in terms of releasing them to New Power.

There is a contract with an mdq of 1,000/day primary from Leach to COH 8-35 
Pittsburgh (K#:  67694) that should be permanently released to New Power at 
max rates effective April, 2001.  

There are, I believe, about seven contracts (K#'s:  68918, 68915, 69148, 
69693, 68916, 68917, 69149) with primary receipt point(s) in the Toledo agg 
area.  The primary delivery points are 5-2 Parma, 5-7 Sandusky, and 7-4 
Alliance.  These contracts need to be permanently released to New Power at 
the following rates:
 68918 - $5.171
 68915 - $5.171
 69148 - $5.171
 69693 - $5.171
 68916 - $5.181
 68917 - $5.181
 69149 - $5.181

Let me know that this okay.

Chris,

I could probably do a quick dinner downtown.  With a small child and graduate 
school I have trouble squeezing normal duties into a day, but would like to 
try to squeeze in a dinner...if nothing less maybe just an appetizer.

Lia

Uhhhhh - Stacey with NYPA is coming in on Tuesday and wants to come over and 
visit with all of us.  Would you like to do an early dinner with Stacey, 
myself and 2 or 3 other Enron folks???  OR you and Rose could take her out 
Tuesday nite and I could go do something else entirely!!!!!!!!!

This is what I have.

I've entered a mother load of comments on all the deals.  please let me know 
when you validate these or what else you need.

Kimat, the exchange deals were not validated yesterday.  Did this have a big 
p&l impact?  My TCO schedulers said there volumes were off by about 6 BCF.

Chris Germany
11/06/2000 01:04 PM
I just set up all the deal tickets for the CGAS New Power storage contract 
for Nov-Mar.  We believe our agency relationship with New Power will end 
effective March 31, 2001.  The deal numbers are on the attached worksheet.  

I entered the following deals at a zero commodity
470563  Buy exchange
470582  Sell Cpr Storage

470587 Buy CPR Storage
470568 Sell exchange

I added about 7500 dth to deal 456379 for November and I extended it through 
March 31.  

I'm kinda sleepy so I probably made a few mistakes.  

I be gittin a couple of BIG HUGS!!

I'm in... thank you Chris for your hel!!!

sounds like she has no plans Tuesday evening (hint hint).  Let me know if you 
are interested in doing anything.  She will probably be coming over to the 
Enron building that afternoon.

Jerry is working on his house and I think its raining in East Texas so I 
probably won't go to either.

$.33.

Kimat, I told them to use IM ME CNG as the desk selling the gas.

Hey, I'm getting a mental image here ( of you pawing the ground that is)!!

Backs doing ok right now.  I'm getting a second opinion next Monday.  If the 
second opinion comes in with the same verdict, then I will probably have the 
surgery in April or May.  Jerry said a friend of his told him it took a whole 
month to recover.  I'm thinking a week max then I can go back to work, we 
shall see.  I can't make money if I'm not at work, and my p&l is a big part 
of my evaluation next year.

AND I'm afraid to buy a new truck with the stock market situation.  Who knows 
- I may be out of work sometime soon.

Why are you going to Florida?

Hi Everyone-  

Well, as most of you know, I am moving to Florida on Thursday.   I want to 
have one last happy hour with my Houstonian friends....

Where: The Flying Saucer  (Capital & Main)
When: Tuesday after work until whenever
Why: So that I can say Good Bye 

I'll be there as early as anyone else can go.  Call me if you can go over 
there early with me.  
I hope to see you there,
Alicia

You are welcome.  I'm glad you enjoyed them.

I just wanted to drop you a line to thank you so very much for the Rockets
tickets last Thursday.  My family and I had a great time.  My daughters
were saying that we were so close that they could see the sweat on Moochie
Norris' head.  Their school's basketball team played that afternoon in the
Compaq Center, so they were able to see a lot of their friends.  Their
friends were very jealous of the great seats that we had.

Thanks again ...

I updated the transport demand charges on Tetco and Trco for March.  Please 
get those in the P&L sometime this week.  Also note:  I think I had Trco at 
TP1 instead of TP2.

thanks

Judy also bought 10,000 dt of long haul from you.

Whats the term and the demand on that?

thanks

My appointment is next Monday at 2:00Pm

I'm glad Beverly's coming to Transco.? I bet she'll do fine.? We can use some 
good people! 

Someone told me once before that they got that message from my phone.? While 
it is true that I usually don't pick up when caller id sez "unknown," I've 
never called the phone co. and asked them to attach that message to my line.? 
Go figure.? Next thing you know it'll be telling people something else about 
me like, "Sorry that number does not accept calls while the lady of the house 
is taking a d---."

Still haven't heard from mom on that Dr.?? I'll let you know.?? ??????? :)? 
ii 

Beverly just announced her resignation too. 

Maybe you should just send an email request and see what you get for the 
Transco party.

Thanks.

I would like to RSVP for the Houston Energy Expo Customer Celebration in

I'll give you an inviye to our party.  I don't know when or where or if I'm 
gonna go but I'll give you an invite anyway.

Is the invite only party? I have not received a personal invitation.... and
this one is usually hard to crash. I'm putting my list together of all the
parties. I talked to Victor... he said I could stop by the floor and train
with you for about on hour... you're such a sweetie!!! Seriously... Victor
said I could stop by and see everyone... since PG&E is not a threat to
y'all. I'll either do it Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.

Transco party on the 21st.  I'm going, how about you?

How's my chrisssssssssssyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy doing???

I'm coming down to Energy Expo next week. Where are the parties????

Hope to see you!!!

this via capacity release.

I'm here for you - NOT.

   

Hey there!!!!

I need your help.

Can you tell me the distribution of VNG's TX Eastern contract?

How much is from WLA, ELA, STX, ect.  I know we no longer have the capacity
past Oct., but I still need the breakout.

Thanks,

I forgot to tell you - I tried to call you from my cellular when I was coming 
back from Jerry's yesterday.  I kept getting a message like "We're sorry, 
this number does not accept calls from unidentified numbers"  or something 
like that.  I had that same problem with Mr. Homco's home phone number a 
couple of weeks ago.

I created deal 665150, TP2 buy from Gulf 1 at St 30 priced at GD.  We did 
this on the 7th because we didn't sell the St 30.  

On the 8th, we went short on TP2 at St 65.  I created deal 665147 as a TP2 
buy from Gulf 1 at St 65.  I entered the price as Z3 GD.  Please let me know 
if you want to adjust it.

thanks

TP2 is buying Spinnaker gas (deal 632998) from Gulf 1 at Zone 2 IF (deal 
657407).  TP2 is selling the gas back to Gulf1 at IF plus variable cost (deal 
657409) at St 45.  It is my understanding that the transport commodity rate 
for gas from this well is $.02 plus fuel.  SO, I just changed the price on 
deal 657409 from Z2 IF + .09 to Z2 IF + .045.  We should see about $68,000.00 
move from TP2 to Gulf 1.

I would like to RSVP for the Houston Energy Expo Customer Celebration in The 
Crystal Ballroom in the Rice Hotel on Wed, March 21, 2001.

Please call me at 713-853-4743 if you have any questions.

thanks

Didn't know I could do this.

I need the summer and winter fuel retention for zone 1 to zone sl.

Thanks buddy.

It's Circle Bible Study Time Again!.......and I sure hope you will be there.

Join us tomorrow night for another exciting episode of "As the Relationships
Turn".
This week we will investigate one of the keys to building strong
relationships.....learning to serve.

Join us for live jazz!, coffee, table fellowship, Bible study, and more!

Bring some friends with you.

"So Jesus called them to Him and said, 'As you know, the kings and great men
of the earth lord it over the people; but among you it is different.
WHOEVER WANTS TO BE GREAT AMONG YOU MUST BE YOUR SERVANT and whoever wants
to be greatest of all must be the slave of all.  For even I, the Messiah, am
not here to be served, but to help others, and to give My life as a ransom
for many.'"  Mark 10:42-45.

"The greatest among you will be your servant.  For whoever exalts himself
will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted."  Matthew
23:11-12

"Now came an argument among them as to which of them would be greatest (in
the coming Kingdom)!  But Jesus knew their  thoughts, so He stood a
little child beside Him and said to them, 'Anyone who takes care of a little
child like this is caring for  Me!  And whoever cares for Me is caring for
God who sent Me.  Your care for others is the measure of your greatness.'"
Luke 9:46-48 (TLB)

See you Saturday night!

Do you need anything else from me regarding Sea Robin ?     I will be in the 
office tomorrow morning - let me know if I should bring anything with me that 
you need to see on Sea Robin.

   

I need to get our most recent bills for Sea Robin.  I show a contract #FSRP3, 
MDQ = 25,000, and a demand of $56,498

I'm thinking about a Nissan Pathfinder.  Then I think about just keeping my 
money and driving what I have.

How am I suppossed to determine a good back doctor from a bad back doctor??

Numbers still look good after inputting the 27th and the 28th.

This is good to go.  How about a new New Power download - I've been tweaking 
here and there.

Darla Saucier@ENRON
03/07/2001 03:57 PM

Good to hear from you.  Man I guess I'm just falling apart, physically and 
mentally.  Can't invest worth a crap either.  I'm going to start burying my 
money in a tin can somewhere.  I also keep thinking about buying a place 
and/or a new car.  But then I look at my $20.00 utility bill - thats a hard 
thing to ingnore.

Someones waiting for me here.  Chat with you later.

I changed the price on deal 636796 back to TRCO Z6 Non Ny.

Kimat Singla
03/08/2001 11:56 AM
Chris, remember we discussed this on Tuesday aftenoon - When we came in 
Sunday (after physical deals were transfered over to new books) we 
recaculated individual P&L's. Your book which had Friday's P&L of ($2,240) 
was making $131,808 due to physical deals movement. So we had  to tranfer the 
difference of $134,048 from your book to Scott Neal's to bring you back at 
Friday's P&L.  This hit came in your Nymex book in March causing you to lose 
more than you think in Nymex.

On Monday you would have recovered that physical loss but several deals  
Sitara 636796, 636821, 646038 were changed on Monday  resulting in taking the 
Sunday's gain away from your book.

I think you have my NYMX value in backwards.

	
	

For the year

My NYMX book is a positive $138410.00 with the trade I did today.  This 
morining it should have been $123035.00.

I still have only 3 physical deals (all desk to desk) in my book, all valued 
at CNG IF flat.  I still don't see how I can have negative P&L of $128,818.

7th straight record quarter...
 TMR out of tax deferrals so revenue  was 'only ' $.24 per share / $1.07 for 
year.
This does not include the 25 % of shares they took off market - that will be 
factored
 into first qtr '01.  No reduction  in production for year - and looking for 
increase
in gas production for '01.
   Still looks good for long term...we'll see what it does the rest of this 
week....

Would you send me an Oglethorpe invoice for Feb please?

Article about CHK - company is very similar to TMR - I'm in both heavily....

Chesapeake Energy stock being sorely undervalued 
2001-02-25
By Melissa Davis
Business Writer

Ask the experts. Chesapeake Energy is more than a $9 stock. 
Forget that Chesapeake is up more than 200 percent from a year ago -- and up 
more than 1,000 percent from its lowest days, not long ago, when it traded 
for less than $1. Chesapeake still appears sorely undervalued. 
Last week, Chesapeake announced record fourth-quarter earnings that were 
1,736 percent higher than earnings for the same quarter in 1999. The company 
also reported a 2000 net income of $3.52 a share -- which means you can buy 
Chesapeake for a price that is less than three times the company's earnings. 
"No stock trades for three times earnings," said Mickey Thompson, executive 
vice president of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association. "The 
independent producers are all undervalued right now. Chesapeake is just the 
most undervalued." 
Chesapeake is the 10th-largest independent producer of natural gas in the 
country. And natural gas, because of low supply and high demand, is one of 
the hottest commodities on the market. It's a huge money maker. 
So Chesapeake is in the right business at the right time -- and it's into it 
heavily. Natural gas accounts for almost 90 percent of all the business that 
Chesapeake does. 
This has already caught the attention of some prominent investment experts. 
Chuck Clough has picked Chesapeake as one of his favorite companies in his 
current favorite sector -- natural gas. And Clough isn't just anybody. Until 
a year ago, he was chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch. Shortly 
after he left, he established a hedge fund that returned 17 percent, after 
fees and costs, during an 11-month time period when the rest of the market 
slid -- and the Nasdaq tumbled 44 percent. 
Clough's young hedge fund now boasts $150 million in assets. 
He's not too worried about falling natural gas prices. He's invested 32 
percent of his portfolio in energy stocks and most of that in natural gas. 
He's convinced that companies like Chesapeake will begin trading for much 
more than two or three times their earnings -- and soon. 
Stephen Smith, a Houston analyst for Dain Rauscher Wessels, considers 
Chesapeake to be a top performer among the energy companies he covers. He is 
convinced the stock is undervalued and that -- even after gaining 326 percent 
last year -- Chesapeake will have another banner year in 2001. 
"Natural gas prices don't have to stay at $7, $8, $9 or $10 for them to have 
a good year," Smith said. "The prices could drop to $4 or $5, and that would 
still be a wonderful doubling of what they used to be. If we can continue to 
see $4 gas prices, then I think that energy stocks -- and particularly 
Chesapeake -- will start to respond a bit more." 
Thompson, who moves within local energy circles, is very optimistic. 
"The natural gas prices we lived with for most of the '90s will never come 
back," he said. "I can see a scenario with $4 and $5 gas prices for a long, 
long time." 

This is what I have for Feb.  I still need to update the 27th and 28th 
volumes.  Let me know if you have questions.

Could you get me the Gas Daily's for Columbia Gas Appalachian for Feb 2001?

It shows up as Columbia, App in Gas Daily.

I'm still working on Feb.  This is March.  First 6 days look good.

	
	

TMR earnings report tomorrow...

I've been watching this sector -  ie small cap oil&gas.
Most companies have risen prior to earnings, but then have a pretty good 
sell-off
after announcing record earnings.

Examples: 
 CHK earnings report on 2/20 stock price=$10.80, by 2/24 stock price = $9.10.
 GW earnings report on 2/12 price = $6.70, by 3/1 price $5.05.
 OEI earnings 1/25 price $18.05, then 1/30 $16.75 but today $19.00
 DNR earnings 2/23 price + $11.00 by 3/1 $9.70
 CRK earnings 2/14 price = $13.80 by 2/20 $10.20
 
So...buy the rumor, sell the fact ????
I still want to hold TMR long term, but maybe take a little profit tomorrow

I just fixed contract B00693026471 again.  This contract ended 10/31/2000.

I moved deal 601925 (sale to South Jersey at Broad Run) from CGAS to Tenn.

Take a look at deal 168996.  I took the expected volumes to 0.  This goes 
with deal 643761.

	
	

Effective March 1st, I moved the volumes on deal 377268 (Non NY sale to New 
Power) to deal 643754 (sale to New Power at WGL on CGAS).  Please correct the 
hedge information.

I also created deal 643761 (sale to New Power at WGL on CGAS).  I believe 
this deal is in the index book but does not show up in Sitara.  I believe it 
was originally a Z6 Non Ny sale to New Power also.

Let me know if you have any questions.

thanks

Have I told you how wonderful you are?  I actually the Gas Daily prices for 
every day.  If you could just enter them in Column S I would be so gratefull.

I would like to be able to run "Facilitation By Location" with the following 
criteria
1.  I want to pick the counterparty or leave it blank.
2.  I want to enter a date range ==> 02/01/2001 to 02/11/2001
3.  I want to be able to select one or more pipelines without choosing a desk.

   
	
	

Ok, looks like we got some attention.  Please let me know which ones you 
think and I'll consolidate and forward to Felicia.
Katherine,

Could you give me a list of reports you need on a particular pipe regardless 
of desks? 

Thanks,
Felicia

Felicia,

Would you please look into this.

Thank You,

Terry

Terry, 

Unless I'm missing something, it does not appear that there is a way for us 
to run a CPR report that shows all business done on a particular pipe 
regardless of desks.  For example, if I want to see all business that is 
being done on Transco, I must run the report for both the Northeast desk and 
the Market East desk.  This next weekend, the east is to be split into 12 
different desks, which will only complicate the issue even more.  

Russ Severson has the position screen set so that all business will roll into 
one position manager.  Is there any way that we get something similar from 
the reporting environment.  I'm thinking that the easiest way might be to 
have the ability to select just a pipe without being forced to select a desk 
first when submitting a report.  

Please let me know your thoughts on this.

Thanks!

Kathy

Could I get a copy of Trco cashout and the detail for Jan please.  Judy and I

Transco Z6 cashout buy is 5.5393, and I think it traded around $5.52.  We 
will use the $5.5393 and I'll send you and email.

FYI
St. Mary's gas flows on Texas Gas [TGT].  

On January 26th, TGT issued a Critical Notice, that in essence states that 
they will not accept a nom to flow gas if it doesn't meet certain pipeline 
spec criteria - they will not accept gas over 1050 Btu content.  St. Mary's 
gas is around 1085 Btu.  Thus, this gas will have to be processed at the 
downstream Eunice Plant, or it will be shut in, starting either Monday the 
26th, or March 1st - this is uncertain right now.  I am working with Charlie 
Otto [Fred's group] and Jay Hartman/Brad Strong to put a processing contract 
together.  Charlie has/or is working on a processing contract with Hunt 
[operator] and this contract will be pretty much the same as Hunt's 
processing contract.  Since gas HAS TO be processed in order to flow, there 
is not much negotiating that will be done.

Since the price of gas is high [and producers do not want to process] , in 
the last couple months, there have been several pipelines to issue OFO's re 
Btu content.  This is the first time that I know of that this has ever been 
such an issue.

Terms of the processing contract:  $0.10 fee, shrink/PVR will be about 12%, 
producer keeps 100% of the NGL's.  Per Charlie, he thinks that this 12% 
shrink/100% liquids equates to a $0.05 or $0.06 loss.  Thus, the cost of 
processing is expected to be around $0.15 to $0.16.  The processing contract 
will be month to month and used only when it is mandatory under the OFO.

St. Mary's will be responsible for all fees, and shrink.  As an example, if 
100 is flowing at the wellhead, and 60 is VPP.  then, there will be 60 as 
VPP, 12 as PVR/PTR [shrink], and 28 as excess gas.  

St. Mary's would like the processing contract in ENA's name, since ENA should 
have title to the gas as it goes thru Eunice, and would just reimburse ENA 
for the 10 cent fee, or any other actual applicable fees.  Teresa - can you 
put something together re this reimbursement.  Charlie sees no problem in 
putting this in ENA's name, if someone sees an issue with this, please let me 
know ASAP.

George, Melissa, Lia - we will need to start nom'ing PVR/PTR.

Chris Germany - do we need a PTR contract on TGT?

Teresa - per the Production & Delivery Agrmt, it states that St. Mary's 
cannot process their gas.  We will need a waiver to this section 4, for the 
time period that processing is mandatory.  

Lia, George, John - the OFO notice came out on January 26, and I heard about 
this via Charlie today, is there some way in the future we can be notified 
more quickly about possible issues re the flow of any of our VPP gas?

Charlie will get his first draft of the contract on Friday and will work with 
myself and Jay/Brad to get this put together on Friday, in case this OFO does 
go into effect on Monday.

Anyone with any questions or concerns, please contact me immediately.

1.  New super duper computer
2.  More memory, my computer has 128meg of ram
3.  Run my applications on 2 cmputers like mine instead of one.

I fixed the volumes on deals 456638 and 456630 for the 31st.  Please take all 
other volumes on these deals to 0.  Thanks

I will be out the afternoon of Friday, March 2 for my MRI.  And I have a Dr.

Chris,
 Did you find any dailies that would have gone with this invoice from Egan?  
Unify volumes do not tie and I called Jenny Nguyen yesterday and left her a 
voice mail, but have not heard back yet.  

Please, let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo

Chris--

We WILL be doing this one way or the other in the next six months--at least I 
am told that we absolutely will get resources dedicated and make a final 
decision on the "build or buy" of a capacity system.....We'll see

				[IMAGE]				Markets Responding to Order 637 Price Cap Removal. 
								
								CapacityCenter.com research results show that the pipeline capacity release 
marketplace is responding positively to the price cap removal provisions of 
Order 637. 
								
								A look at the past few months reveals an increase of almost 500% in the 
number of over-max-rate deals since the months just after the ruling went 
into effect. Traders and contract owners alike are taking advantage of new 
opportunities.
								
								The research shows an overall increase in the size, duration and pricing of 
the release deals, indicating that many sellers prefer to be paid directly 
for their contracts rather than incur the risk involved in the purchase, 
transport and delivery of gas in order to generate margin.
								
								Capacity release trading is starting to mirror the more competitive 
marketplace, which is what the FERC hoped for in countering the "bundled 
deal" gray market.

Can you get the deal ticket for me on this deal please?
	
	

Chris,

I just wanted to follow up on this.  We must settle this by Friday for 
correct payment on Monday.

Thanks.

Chris,

Bill Murray of Columbia Gas of Ohio called and stated that the Demand Charge 
that is a part of deal #213360 has already been paid by Enron as a put or 
option premium in Apr-00.  He is stating that it should not be part of this 
month's charges.  Please advise and/or change this deal to reflect your 
understanding as to the correct charges on this invoice to Columbia.  

Please respond to both Janine Cashin and I.  She is the new coordinator for 
this account and will ultimately settle with Columbia.

Thank you,
Scott Dozier

Please recall the following contracts effective 2/24/2001

VNG  k# Offer #  ENA k#
100007  15002  523666
100104  15003  523664
200088  15004  523667
700005  15008  571492

I think this is all.

I ended deal 340210 effective 2/28/01 and created deal 630810 effective 
3/1/2001.  But, I see both deals active un Unify on contract 2891 on 
3/1/2001.  I don't know what impact this will have, if any.

We should have included the ACA, GRI, and Great Plains in our sales price to 
Midcoast.  You should still use the $.0792 in your calculation.  Just a note, 
we could have shipped this gas to a zone 4 market, resulting in a much higher 
transport cost, OR we could have sold the gas at the wellhead, giving us a $0 
transport cost.  Most of the time you will use the IT feeder cost ($.0792 in 
this case) regardless of what we do with the gas.

By the way, Transco's rates changed just a bit effective 2/1/2001.  The IT 
feeder for Zone 3 goes from $.0792 to $.0769 effective 2/1/2001, fuel remains 
unchanged at .45%.

First, let me start by saying I miss seeing your happy face every day!! Now, 
that being said, I have a question!!!

Juniper Energy is one of the producers we are marketing consultants for.  I 
have the pleasure of preparing their invoices for them every months on the 
EI57 meter that is nominated on Transco, Zn3WH (ticket 547342).

The agreed upon purchase price from Enron is Transco Sta 65 less transport 
and fuel.  In the past months, we have nominated this gas on one of our IT 
contracts and the transport fee reflects the max IT rate of .0792 plus .45% 
fuel.  That is what I subtract as a fee from the Gas Daily price to reflect 
what Enron owes Juniper for purchasing the gas...

In January, from the 13th - 16th, we nominated 2009/day from EI57 and 
transported it on IT contract .2774 for delivery to Midcoast Marketing, Inc. 
(ticket 568318) @ Z3-Ethel Midla meter 6083.
This path incurred a higher fee than the other two paths that were nominated 
either to our pool or to Mamou.  

The Ethel Midla delivery fees included:
ACA .0022
EP3 .0013 
GP .0097 (great plains surcharge ??)
GRI .0070
VC .0448 
ZN3 .0331
total .0981

The pool and Mamou delivery fees only included:
EP3 .0013
VC .0448
ZN3 .0331
total .0792

My question is....are any of the Ethel Midla fees passed on to the delivery 
counterparty, Midcoast Marketing, Inc. ? 
Or, is Juniper responsible for paying for the extra fees?

Thanks for your help 

Trish

I would like to see the Gas Daily's for the following, no rush.

A friendly reminder.

You were going to give us a list to let us know which transport capacity 
tickets would have to be set up on which business units

Also, you were interested in the ability to create multiple transport 
capacity tickets when you get a new contract.  In the short term,
could the generation of the additional tickets be created on a nightly 
basis?    

Russ.

I'll be gone but I will leave it on top of my desk.  The backpack is dark 
blue and is has "CRUX by Gregory" written on it.  There is a yellow cooler 
inside and 2 flashlights.

   
	
	

I'll be down in a little while, probably around 5ish if that's okay..........

I wuzn't invited to the wedding.  AND when you sit down and think about the 
hedges and transport stuff, you will be surprised at how much stuff you 
remember.

The quickest way to learn transport???  Get copies of the invoices.

And guess what, I got another compliment on my sweat pants  on Saturday!!!

Hey.... what's going on??? Are you going to Clarissa's wedding????

Boy... I sure wish I would have listen to you when you were teaching me
storage, hedges, transport.... all the crap. Have no clue what I'm doing
now... but its fun trying to figure it out!!!!

The meeting will be on Thursday, February 15 at 3pm in Room 3268. It should 
last around 30 minutes.  

Thank you,
East Desk

We have set up this VNG contract in Sitara twice, as   6507  (see deal 512077)
      and  .6507

Currently all Transco contracts have the decimal preceding the number.  
Please terminate 6507 effective 12/31/2000.

Thanks

The East Desk is having a meeting tomorrow at the same time to discuss the 
split out of the East Desk into 11 new books.  I need to attend the East Desk

         REDNECK VALENTINE!

    Collards are green,
    my dog's name is Blue
    and I'm so lucky
    to have a sweet thang like you.

    Yore hair is like cornsilk
    a-flappin in the breeze.
    Softer than Blue's
    and without all them fleas.

    You move like the bass,
    which excite me in May.
    You ain't got no scales
    but I luv you anyway.

    Yo're as satisfy'n as okry
    jist a-fry'n in the pan.
    Yo're as fragrant as &quot;snuff&quot;
    right out of the can.

    You have some'a yore teeth
    for which I am proud.
    I hold my head high
    when we're in a crowd.

    On special occasions,
    when you shave under yore arms,
    well, I'm in hawg heaven
    and awed by yore charms.

    Still them fellers at work,
    they all want to know,
    what I did to deserve
    such a purdy, young doe.

    Like a good roll of duct tape
    yo're there fer yore man,
    to patch up life's troubles
    and fix what you can.

    Yo're as cute as a junebug
    a-buzzin' overhead.
 You ain't mean like those far ants
    I found in my bed.
    Cut from the best cloth
    like a plaid flannel shirt,
    you spark up my life
    more than a fresh load of dirt.

    When you hold me real tight
    like a padded gunrack,
    my life is complete.
    Ain't nuttin' I lack.

    Yore complexion, it's perfection,
    like the best vinyl sidin'
    despite all the years,
    yore age, it keeps hidin'.

    Me &quot;n&quot; you's like a moon pie
    with a RC cold drank,
    we go together
    like a skunk goes with stank.

    Some men, they buy chocolate
    for a Valentine's Day,
    they git it at Wal-Mart,
    it's romantic that way.

    Some men git roses
    on that special day
 from the cooler at Krogers,
    that's impressive, I say.

 Some men buy fine diamonds
    from a flea market booth.
    &quot;Diamonds are forever&quot;,
    they explain, suave and couth.

    But for this man, honey,
    these won't do.
    Cause yo're too special,
    you sweet thang you.

    I got you a gift,
    without taste nor odor,
    more useful than diamonds....
    IT'S A NEW TROLL'N MOTOR!!!

Per navigator, this is the only New Power pool activity for the 1st.  

This is everything scheduled on CGAS except the pool for the 1st.  I'm 
working on that now.

Would you send me the Gas Daily's for Henry Hub, Transco St 65, Transco St 
45, Tetco Wla, Tetco Stx, and Tetco Ela for the last year please.

Thanks

chance.

I made some changes to New Power.  Would you please send me a new purchase 
and sales worksheet for Jan?

thanks

This is what's in Unify.  The only odd item is how I entered the cashout, as 
a negative demand charge.  I used 1618 dts x $7.611 (It buy in Zone 6).

Let me know what you think.  Maybe we should add the IT transport to the 
cashout from Z6 to Z4.  I would certainly want to do that if they were short.

Darla Saucier@ENRON
02/09/2001 11:19 AM

I'm looking for the following demand charges

$93835.00
(12.314.60)

Do you see those anywhere?  They are on deal 554846.

Please send me a download of the Oglethorpe info for January.  We might be 
able to do the billing from Unify this month.  If not, I should be able to 
make the dollars match.

thanks

Sounds good.

Doesn't look too good right now.  I forgot about the HPL people.  I think we 
already have too many people and management may be waiting to see how many 
HPL people are staying with Enron on the trading side.  I'll keep you posted.

If you are bud's with Scott Hendrickson, he would be a good one to talk to.  
I don't want to mention your name unless I hear of something.

From the Birmingham Sunday Mercury (7th Jan 2001)
  Worker dead at desk for 5 days

  Bosses of a publishing  firm are trying to work out why no one
  noticed that one of their employees had been sitting dead at
  his desk for FIVE DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling
  okay.  George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a
  proof-reader at a New York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack
  in the open-plan office he shared with 23 other workers.  He
  quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody noticed until
  Saturday morning when an office cleaner  asked why he was
  still working during the weekend.  His boss Elliot Wachiaski
  said "George was always the first guy in each morning and the
  last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that he was in
  the same position all that time and didn't say anything.  He was
  always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself.  "A post
  mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five
  days after suffering a coronary.  Ironically, George was
  proofreading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.

  You may want to give your co-workers a nudge or kick

My leg hurts still.  This is what I'm taking

Lodine XL Tab 600MG - take 1 tab in the morning after my breakfeast snack
Cyclobenzaprine Tab 10MG - take 1 tab before going to bed

Same thing for Trco k#.7537, deals 232576 and 271489
	
	

I changed the end date to 12/31/2000 on Trco k#2.2390, deals 77157 and 
320086.  I had it set up as evergreen.

be flat and her yeart to date P&L is about ($146,000.00).  Would you just 
verify that for me please.

Sean Boyle@ENRON

I met with Jeff Kiester of DTI yesterday regarding the storage offering they 
have on the market.  They have 3 Bcf storage capacity and 30,000dt/d of 
FT-GSS up for bid by 2/12/01. However there will be up to an additional 10 
Bcf of storage capcity available before 4/1/01 depending on additional 
turnback.  All of this capacity is utility turnback mainly, East Ohio, 
National Fuel and RG&E.
Potential uses for DTI storage:
1.  Desk use - If we buy the storage without the transportation we would 
inject and withdraw at SP.  If we do submit a bid, I would recommend that we 
try to incorporate free intramonth injection capability, effectivly giving us 
a no-notice type service that we could use to take physical positions in the 
cash market.  The current park/loan rate is $0.07 /dt/d, it seems we utilize 
this 2-3 times a month.
2.  VNG - AGL could want to look into adding storage to the VNG portfolio,  
the drawback is that the PL1 line has no excess deliverability, VNG's need is 
more a peak day issue.
3.  Partner with EES - Paul Tate from EES also sat in on our meeting, he 
expressed an interest in looking into potential partnering oppourtunities 
with the East desk regarding markets on TCO and DTI.  This storage offering 
for example could be something we partner on.  I plan to meet with Paul at 
the beggining of next week to discuss further (Dick I will check with you on 
your availability).

Jeff also indicated there will be more transportation capacity turned back in 
the near future.  There will be a posting for 75,000 dt/d of Lebanon - Leidy 
capacity coming out in the next few weeks.  

Market view on capacity release:
With the utilities turning back transportation, the economics of the capacity 
release market will change.  The utilities have historically released 
transportation in the summer months for $0.05 or less (as low as $0.01) in 
order to recover something from their asset.  DTI will now be the marketer of 
the turned back capacity.  Historically the pipeline has been very reluctant 
to sell capacity below max rate in the winter and less than 50% ($0.12 at 
current rates) in the summer.   Jeff indicated that his view is that capacity 
values will increase slighly this summer and significantly next summer due to 
the new power gen load coming online 2002.  As part of DTI's last rate case 
settlement FT-GSS holders can no longer release transportation in the summer, 
that went into effect last summer-00.  Although the capacity release market 
was a little tighter last summer it did not significantly drive up capacity 
release prices in the summer-00.  My view is that two of the three power gen 
loads will be interuptible and therfore will not sigificantly increase the 
overall load factor of the system.  The bottom line is that DTI is competing 
with capacity release and I feel there will be enough capacity release 
available on the market this summer to force DTI to sell it's capacity below 
50% of max rate.  However capacity release prices may increase next year as 
more utilities turnback capacity and the new power generation may be in the 
capacity release market.

Market View on Basis on CNG for Summer 01 & Summer 02:
With the increased load and potentially low storage inventory level going 
into this summer, basis could be strong vs historical prices. However, with 
the inception of M&NEP delivering 400,000dt/d into the Northeast last year 
CNG basis (summer strip) was less than $0.20 in Jan-00 and Feb-00,  even 
though the April 1 storage inventory level was the lowest since 1996.  In 
1996 CNG Apr-Oct strip traded as high as high as $0.31 in Feb-96 and dropped 
as low as $0.21 by May-96.  DTI summer load is averages 2.5 - 3.0 Bcf, I 
don't think the 100,000dt/d load of the new power gen load will be 
significant this summer considering the additional supply coming in from 
Dracut.   However with American National Power Inc (34,000Dth/d) and El Paso 
Gas Services Co (139,000dt/d) both coming online in 2001, that have 
contracted for around half of the Dracut supply, this may cause sumer basis 
prices to increase from current levels (Apr-01-Oct-01 strip $0.33) this 
summer and depending on storage inventories 4/1/02,  Apr-Oct-02 basis may be 
also get stronger.

as primary?  I'm not used to getting discounts so I'm curious!

I'g going to have Judy work Tansco over for a backhaul discount for the 
summer.

Chris-

This rate change implements a rate settlement reached in 1999, so we don't 
have grounds for protest.  I'll bookmark the issue for review when Transco 
files it's next Section 4 on March 1st.  We can argue that the backhaul rates 
should be cost based, as opposed tothe full forward haul rate that's being 
charged.

Suzanne

   

Transco confirmed that effective 2/1/2001, the forward haul and back haul 
commodity rates will be the same on both IT and FT. 
	
	

I left a message for the manager of Transco's Rates Department to call me.  
If I'm reading this correctly, the forwardhaul and the backhaul commodities 
are the same now.  In Jan, the "true backhaul" rate from Zone 6 to Zone 4 was 
$.0448 plus surcharges, today its $.3037 plus surcharges.  We actually did 
some deals based on the backhaul rate of $.0448 for the summer.

I suppose its too late, is there anyway this could be postponed until 
October, after the summer period?

Hey-

Are you available to go to a meeeting with me at Transco on Thursday at 
12:30?  It's a special meeting,separate from the OneLine/637 meetings, that 
was set up to discuss the operational control notices, and associated 
penalties, they've proposed and issues relating to pooling.  I made the 
request to be able to rank w/in a business party from a pool on the disag nom 
which they seem to think they'll be able to accomplish.  

I'll send out a summary of the Tetco and Transco meetings this afternoon.

Please let me know if you can attend or if you think it'd be better for 
Victor (or whoever) to go.

Thanks!
Suzanne

Could you give me the January 2001 Gas Daily's for the following points

Scott Goodell said the Sonat items look correct.  The other items are for the 
Central Desk and I don't know who looks at it.  It's probably ok since the 
Central Desk items are more straight forward.

Hey gang.  Attached is the maualy invoice for Oglethorpe.  I have fixed the 
pricing and the volumes on the top part of deal 516907 to match the maual 
invoice.  Can we adjust the expected volumes in Sitara to match the manual 
invoice?  If yes, how do you balance Unify since these are deal volumes and 
not actual flow volumes.

AND Sherri, how this be entered from the accounting side in Unify, since 
scheduling vs actual flow vs billing are all different?

I was going to Mexico with the dough but decided against it.

We received $11,240.63 from medical reimbursements and $5.00 from the
Electric Company.  I just transferred $3,749.00 to to your checking
accounts.

The gloves are off and the courtship begins - what's your work address?  
Valentine goodies are on the way.  I'm officially in love... with you!

Well Chris, you know what the problem is?  You never bought me that $25,000 
diamond ring you kept promising me.  You're all talk.

She doesn't know that I exist,  now that I'm single again and all.  I should 
be able to lose 30 or 40 pounds by then.

Well the tickets have been purchased.  We arrive at the Hobby, TX airport at 
10:45 am on Friday, Mar. 16 flight # 1451.  We will be departing on Monday, 
March 19 at 10:55 am.  You have to promise me that we can eat at Lupe's 
Friday night!!

Jeff Porter with New Power just informed me that they are buying "a little 
more" than 4,300 dth per day of citygate gas on CGAS.  Dick and I will be 
chatting about this later today.

Joann found out about this yesterday and this is the first time I've heard 
about it.

Anyone who's been single and over the age of 18 can relate to this.

When I was younger I hated going to weddings ...it seemed that all of my

aunts and the grandmotherly types used to come up to me, poking me in the

ribs and cackling, telling me, 'You're next.'

? They stopped that crap after

I started doing the same thing to them at funerals.

I'm way to tired to go drinking tonite.

Since we are suppose to be using IT, I would say Doyle's cashout should be 
$7.611, the IT buy in zone 6.  You sure are a buddy, why don't you send me an 
updated doyle sheet?

We have a volumetric contract on Texas Gas and I'm not sure how to enter it 
in Sitara.  The volumetric demand charge is $.005, deal #461568

I just moved the following 2 sales to New Power from Trco Non NY to CGAS - 
WGL, deals 377264 (volume = 515 day) and deal 377268 (volume = 5 day).

Joann, New Power will probably take some of this gas to BG&E.

It's purtty!

I changed the Egan volumes for the 30th and 31st from 2599 to 4793 on the 
30th and 4794 on the 31st.  This empties out our storage.

You are welcome and have a nice day!

Hey Matt.  Sorry about not getting back to you sooner.  I probably won't move 
for another 9 months.  I have some legal issues I'm heavily involved in that 
will be taking up a lot of my time.

Thanks.

Chris,
??? I was going over my notes on  your search and I still need some more 
information. Please call me at  832-545-0504 or 713-268-2245 some time

things about him.

Victor,

I need to know who is the scheduler for this  pipeline.  Contract No. 
96031682 has an agency relationship and the agency agreement contract no. is 
96031689.  

I would like to know if we are still scheduling gas on this contract?  

Chris,

Do you know who has an executed agency agreement for  Contract No. 96031682 
between ENA and Commonwealth Energy, Inc.?

All, please respond as soon as possible.

Marlene Hilliard 

Just spoke with Jerry.  Jerry, Barbara, the bird and the squirrel are on 
their way to East Texas.

I will bring it and anything else I might have in tomorrow that I think you 
can use.  I will leave my sleeping bag in the car though.

   
	
	

I am going up somewhere near Austin.  Do you think it would be a possibility 
to borrow the backpack?  We're only going to be up there overnight so I 
shouldn't need to pack that much, besides I can't carry that much anyway.

Please change deal 583629 (sale to Mirant on NFUL) to Market East.  It won't 
let me change it. 

Thanks

How do you make those ham and tortillia thingys?  I want to make some for the 
super bowl party this Sunday.

According to my numbers, I show we have taken 67,560 out of storage through 
today.  And we are taking out 12,995 (2599 x 5 days) from the 27th - 31st.  
Could you double check my numbers please?

Thanks

I'm sorry.  I'm still looking for it but I think I deleted all the photo's.  
I'm checking my CD's.  Just pretend you are getting a big hug from me and 
that I'm taking you to your favorite resteraunt - Chic Fil A.

I'm guessing you don't have the picture of muffy. Just wondering. These last
couple of days have been very emotional for me.

PG&E National Energy Group and any other
company referenced herein that uses the PG&E name or

PG&E National Energy Group nor these other
referenced companies are regulated by the California Public
Utilities Commission.  Customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Company
do not have to buy products from these companies in order

Lines 6, 7, & 8 are sales to CES at the citygate, deals 250126 and 250131.  
The schedulers wanted 2 deal tickets for tracking purposes.  The pricing 
should be the same.  I did make a teeny little error, line 7 should be prices 
at $3.4228 and line 8 should be priced at $3.4428.

I will send these as I find them.  This is the detail I sent to Jeff for the 
April 2000 manual invoice.  It looks like the only deals that should have 
been suspended are the citygate CGAS sales.

Line 7 under the "Manual Invoice" tab applies to deal 268094, volume of 
615600 at $3.1279, sale to CES for Proxy storage injections.
Line 6 applies to deals 227081 and 227113, sales to CES at the citygate.
Line 8 shows the incremental transport expense ENA incurred to allow CES to 
swing.  Today I would take this expense and add it to the sales price on 
deals 227081 and 227113.
Line 9????  I still can't figure out what I did here.

I think everything else is sorta clear.

I'm emailing all of you because I never know how the deals will show up in 
Sitara.  This is how Leidy looks for Feb

Buy/Sale Counterparty Volume  Comment
Buy  Poco  15,380  NFUL into Trco at Leidy
Buy  Bay State 5000  CNG into Trco/Tetco at Leidy OR CNG SP from the storage 
meter
Sell  N Jersey 2491  Any pipeline into Trco at Leidy, we usually match with 
Poco
Sell  Southern 5000  Any pipeline into Trco at Leidy, Brad just sold this gas 
today.  we should match with Poco.

Questions?

Thanks.  You are wonderfulllll!

Yes - a small one.  So maybe you should go camping with me - and I have 
fishing stuff too.  Where  are you going camping.

   
	
	

It will be a combination of boys and girls, no particular boy for me, unless 
I get LUCKY!!!  Do you have any kind of backpack?

Please educate me - what are the current cashout rules?

I'm here for you.  Just remember me favorably when you become my boss 
someday.  I fetch coffe and pop, I always keep a stash of crackers,... the 
list goes on.

sorry Chris, I know you already sent this to me.  I got lost here for a 
moment between the Nov corrections and the Dec invoice.

Thanks for your help!
Darla

Is this what you are looking for?

Chris Germany
01/04/2001 03:10 PM
This is ready to go.  I highlighted areas that you need to fill in.  Thanks.

Let me know if you have questions.  I think we need to add Nov 2000.  

AND, according to Navigator, the balance in storage on 1/20/2001 is 
2,973,373.  Assuming ENA is owes you 40,000, the balance is 3,013,373 which 
is about 49% of the total storage balance.  Is this a comfortable number or 
crititcal?

Joann, are there any special storage rules for Feb and March?  Are we 
required to have at least 40% in storage on 1/31/2001?

Its ok to do the netout.  The volumes on deals 502957 and 456379 need to be 
changed but I think that will be handled by Volume Management after they 
enter the pipeline statements in Unify.

Darla Saucier@ENRON
01/22/2001 02:03 PM
If we've already discussed this excuse me. I just wanted to verify with you 
that New Power was okay in the system (download I sent you) so I can do the 
netout with them for this month.  Please let me know asap.

Thanks
Darla

It's Leah Moss at the pipeline.  It's Judy Townsend here.  Leah's number is 
713-627-5054.

do you know who's our tetco [east texas] transportation person nowadays?  
thanks.

I just checked the 24th, the actual number per navigator (actuals delivered 
to New Power from Stow) is 54246.  I'll check the others on Monday now that I 
know how to do it.

Just looking high level, I see 3 days where storage is off by more than 1,000 
dt's that I will check into.

Date Sitara  Jeff's 
24th 54245  55720 
26th 25058  32794
28th 39388  40053

I don't understand your storage number on the 16th.  Does that mean you 
banked gas that day?

Also, I setup a column for Navigator numbers and it looks like we took out 
66,000 for ENA.

I need to reconcile storage back to Nov so I can track what we took out vs. 
what we pay New Power for.

He requested 7000 for today, but then his shedule only addsa up to about a 
6425 burn???
Looks like they will still be a little long by end of run.

Call me, we want the backhaul contract

I need to look and see what I have.  But first, you are not going with some 
boys are you???

I have a really cheap sleeping bag, some collaspable water bottles, all sorts 
of small cooler type things, OHOHOH, I have a "wet seal" bag that you could 
put some goodies in to keep them dry.  

Do you need fishing stuff?

   
	
	

Chris, I need your help.  Do you have any camping materials (sleeping bag, 
backpack, canteen)  I am going camping with some friends this weekend and my 
dad has always supplied me with the goods.  I'm at a loss, can you help or 
know anyone who can?

These rates are correct and I'm assuming you want wellhead to the pool (no 
surcharges).  Zone 4 to 4 is the most expensive zone on the pipe, Zone 5 runs 
a close second.  Are you sure you want 4 instead of 4a (mobile bay)?

hey,

could you please tell me what the above rates are?  i have been told they are 
$0.1716 and 1.9% fuel, but that seems high.

thanks
joan

Should we just take the capaity for Feb and March or do you want to release 
the whole term then recall it later?
Hello Chris,

Columbia of Maryland now recognizes New Power as the supplier of the old CES 
customers.  Therefore, as of today, CMD assigned a whopping one dekatherm on 
Gulf and TCo to New Power, instead of to ENA, from Rayne to CMD city gate.

I executed the agreements and will release them to you assuming that it's 
okay to do so when I get the chance tomorrow.  I'd like to keep all of the 
capacity that ENA is managing together.  Let me you if you have any problems 
with that.

Can you give me confirmations on storage WD on 24, 26 & 28? I can only assume 
my request is confirmed unless told.
In Jan'01, you put ANR gas we bought under 3rd party, but in Dec it seems to 
be only under citygate deals. Is that correct? I know I neglected to adjust 
my FOM volume when those 3rd party vols change. Lets talk about 3rd party 
when you get back Tues afternoon?

Tim Ray is "The Man" at New Power to talk to about the any asset management 
deals.  I would love to be involved.  Mr. David Scott can get you Tim's 
number.

Please take the volumes to 0 for these 2 Hopewell deals on Dec 31.  Deal 
549152 & 549163.

Robin, I took the price to 0 on both of these deals.

I still have not released the 700 dth of capacity from VNG to Nabisco on 
CGAS.  I just spoke with Henry Riewerts at Nabisco.  He does not have a 
navigator ID and password.  This will be the only CGAS activity he has and he 
has not bought any gas for Nov either.  I think he needs someone to handle 
this for him.

Is this the type of thing we can pass on to EES?

Could you send me the excel worksheet so I won't have to recreate it?  Man 
you are a true Buddy!!

He requested 7000 for today, but then his shedule only addsa up to about a 
6425 burn???

In the fridge next to the mustard.

Hey  - jason wants to know - "Wheres the Ogy"

Jeff, don't forget that Mike is taking 27835 of the FOM gas into his pool 
everyday.  With the Maumee cuts, I am showing that you are buying gas daily 
from ENA everyday.   Column T under the CGAS tab shows what Gas Daily volumes 
you are taking from me.  Column V shows the Gas Daily sells you are making to 
me.  Column F is the citygate storage number that should match cell Q41 on 
your COH sheet.  We have one big discrepancy on the 8th.

Call me if you have questions.

Joann, on the 8th, Jeff is showing a withdrawal of 57431(citygate number) we 
are showing a volume of 49560 (48478 at the citygate).  Would you check that 
please.

I changed all the volumes to 0 on this deal now that I have a good picture of 
what took place.  Please make sure you have 0 pathed on these deals for the 
1st through the 4th.

thanks

Can you please help Client Services out on the pricing for Formosa 
Plastics/Sport Pipelline.

	
	

Elizabeth...  Can you tell us if the terms of the Formosa Plastics/Sport 
Pipeline deals have changed?  The terms USED to be Formosa got the first 
15,000/day (deal 229875), Sport deal #244626 got the next 5,000/day and Sport 
deal #244627 took the swing.  There have been new deals set up in Sitara for 
November production that don't mirror that.  Formosa deal #463959 starts on 
day 4 (what happened to days 1-3?) and gets the first 15,000/day.  Sport deal 
# 456694 covers days 1-3 but the prices are tiered to include what looks like 
Formosa's volume.  Sport deal #463958 covers the rest of the month but the 
prices don't mirror the first 3 day's prices.  Do you see a problem here??!!

Help!!

Would you guys see what is flowing current day at these points please?

JANUARY  10, 2001    12:30 PM CCT

TO:  ALL TENNESSEE CUSTOMERS

RE:  HIGH BTU LEVEL ON THE LAROSA LATERAL

Tennessee is encountering high BTU levels on the Larosa Lateral.  These high
BTU
levels have been the subject of customer complaints that the delivered gas
is interfering with the proper operation of various lines, regulators,
meters and appliances located on the Larosa Lateral.  Beginning, with the
January 11 Gas Day, Tennessee requests point operators of receipt meters
located on the Larosa Lateral to tender to Tennessee gas that meets the gas
quality specifications found in the General Terms and Conditions of the
Tennessee Gas Tariff.

The following is a list of receipt meters located on the Larosa Lateral:
010069  Mustang Island 1Dehyd
010184  Redfish Bay Dehyd
010803  Stedman Island Dehyd
010990  Ingleside Dehyd
011476  Mustang Island 776
012021  Red Fish Bay Transport
012566  Mustang Island

Absent resolution of the problems, beginning with the January 11 Gas Day,
Tennessee will not accept nominations from meters on the Larosa Lateral
tendering out of specification gas and will issue an Operational Flow Order
Balancing Alert to the point operator.

If you have any questions, please contact your Account Representative or
Volume Analyst.

You are so wonderful.  I am truly privlidged to work with you.

OK.  I would like for you to send Mr. Porter the remaining storage balance 
every other day and copy me - something like this.

And I would do it on a 2 day lag like this, today is the 9th, give him the

Or maybe you are doing this already?

Just send cookies then and we will be happy.

Hey gang.  Attached is the maualy invoice for Oglethorpe.  I have fixed the 
pricing and the volumes on the top part of deal 516907 to match the maual 
invoice.  Can we adjust the expected volumes in Sitara to match the manual 
invoice?  If yes, how do you balance Unify since these are deal volumes and 
not actual flow volumes.

AND Sherri, how this be entered from the accounting side in Unify, since 
scheduling vs actual flow vs billing are all different?

Darla Saucier@ENRON
01/04/2001 03:50 PM

Tennessee is finalizing their CanEast project which will scoop the 
Independence Pipeline effort and allow Tennessee to deliver 280,000 Dthd into 
Leidy beginning in 11/1/01 at the same time the first phase of Transco's 
MarketLink begins.  The first phase of MarketLink has a capacity of 166,000 
Dthd and the second phase is scheduled to begin 11/1/02 with an additional 
130,000 Dthd.  Tennessee was the successful bidder on a recent open season 
that National Fuel had for 19,100 Dthd of space between Niagara and Leidy.  
Tennessee has executed a 10 year lease for the space.  They will use this 
capacity and a 10 year lease arrangement that they are finalizing with 
Dominion Transmission for Ellisburg to Leidy capacity to form the basis of 
their CanEast Project.  The Dominion lease will allow Tennessee to use 
unsubscribed Zone L to Zone 4 capacity and deliver approximately 260,000 Dthd 
from the Gulf Coast to Leidy.  (Dynegy negotiated an index-based, revenue 
sharing contract with Tennessee for delivery into Dominion using this 
capacity for the 11/1/00 - 10/31/01 period).  Tennessee is currently 
negotiating with shippers to subscribe to the CanEast capacity.  They are 
willing to negotiate contracts less than ten years and have negotiated terms 
that synch up with the second phase of MarketLink.  This should allow 
available capacity from the Gulf Coast or Niagara to Leidy or secondary 
delivery points such as Dominion (since Phase I of MarketLink is set) for one 
year contracts.

As a reminder, firm shippers with binding contracts on MarketLink are:

Transco has until the end of April 2001 to file additional binding executed 
contracts with the FERC for an additional 404,000 Dthd of Leidy to New York 
capacity or the MarketLink Expansion as approved by FERC will be limited to 
the 296,000 Dthd of the first two phases.

These are the meter numbers I changed on deal 549411 effective 1/8/2001.  The 
total changed on the deal was a decrease of 31205.

I extended deal 559947 (Pool sale) thru the 31st, a volume of 27935 per day.

I changed storage deal 456379 from 196985 to 46985 on the 31st ONLY!!

Joann,  for Jan, we are selling New Power 31,679 out of the pool and 25893 
from other sources (AO6, Broad Run, Delmont, and Monclova - this includes the 
AO6 they are buying from us).  Which means we should only have 3844 out of 
the pool.

Actually the citygate and storage should be as follows

Vol Comment
3844 Out of the pool
25893 Other receipt supply
xxxx Storage - and this should match whats on the storage ticket.

The 2 Transco delivery points for the CP&L RFP (#6608 and #6562) are upstream 
of the Zone 5 pool.  So we should be able to segment  the longhaul VNG space.

Meter    Mainline Mile Marker / Lateral Mile Marker 
6608  PSCN Gaston   1323.51 / 0
6562  NC Nat Gas   1375.51 / 0

9167  Zone 5 Sta 165 ENA FT Pool 1412.99 / 0

941   Emporia    1412.99 / 102.89

My buddy is looking at lots on Seargent Beach.  Drive from your place to 
Seargent, go over the intercoastal, and take a left.  He said lots in there 
go for about $17,000.00.  He wants to buy one canal lot and one or two beach 
lots.

Comments?

I moved the volumes on deal 241639 from Transco Leidy to CNG Leidy.

Anyone here today??  Deliverd prices are about $12.75 right now, using Non NY 
pricing.

For Tues through the end of the month, please show Tenn Z5 and Z6 flat, and 
have the Wright gas into Canajoharie.

Tenn, I will be looking at what we have available on the Net 284 contract on 
your sheet to determine our flexibility.

See below to see what "The Man" has to say.

Ora_L._Ash@dom.com on 01/05/2001 09:34:31 AM
Yes, you can flow 100%.   I confirmed that this was a part ot the rate case
settlement.

Chris.Germany@enron.com on 01/05/2001 09:50:36 AM

In the old days, you could only flow 7/12 of the MDQ from secondary points.
That was when these contracts were good for the whole year.  So you are
telling me the "rules have changed"?  I can now flow 100% from secondary
points?

Ora_L._Ash@dom.com on 01/05/2001 08:38:35 AM

You can use the full contract MDQ to move from and to secondary points.  Of
course,  this would be subject to any secondary restrictions.

Chris.Germany@enron.com on 01/04/2001 04:48:44 PM

We have a FTGSS contract with a MDQ of 40,148 dts.  The primary receipt
point on this contract is storage.  BUT, we can flow some of this gas from
secondary points like Oakford or the Pools.  How much gas can be sourced
from Secondary receipt points?

Send this bill to Raquel Magana at 600 Jefferson.  She will forward it onto 
Ronnie Shields in our Conn. office for payment.  

Ronnie;
Please have someone look at the CES purchase agreement to see how these 
should be handled.  I would assume that at a minimum, they would pay, 7/12ths 
of the bill since the deal was consummated on July 31.  There may be 
provisions where they bear all the taxes.

I have a tax bill to Columbia Energy Services in the amount of $5,606.78 for 
gas stored at the Bear Creek Storage facility.  The amount is $5,606.78 and 
it is for the the 2000 tax year.  I was notified about this yesterday and I 
think it was due on 12/31/2000.

How do you want to handle this?  I was going to pay it and bill New Power for 
the whole amount.  I will also have our tax department fax a copy to Jeff.

Robert, please fax a copy of the letter from Jimmie Smith and the CES tax 
bill to Jeff Porter at 713-646-3499.

I have a tax bill to Columbia Energy Services in the amount of $5,606.78 for 
gas stored at the Bear Creek Storage facility.  The amount is $5,606.78 and 
it is for the the 2000 tax year.  I was notified about this yesterday and I 
think it was due on 12/31/2000.

How do you want to handle this?  I was going to pay it and bill New Power for 
the whole amount.  I will also have our tax department fax a copy to Jeff.

Robert, please fax a copy of the letter from Jimmie Smith and the CES tax 
bill to Jeff Porter at 713-646-3499.

Thanks

Hey gang.  Attached is the maualy invoice for Oglethorpe.  I have fixed the 
pricing and the volumes on the top part of deal 516907 to match the maual 
invoice.  Can we adjust the expected volumes in Sitara to match the manual 
invoice?  If yes, how do you balance Unify since these are deal volumes and 
not actual flow volumes.

AND Sherri, how this be entered from the accounting side in Unify, since 
scheduling vs actual flow vs billing are all different?

Darla Saucier@ENRON

Can the Sitara ticket be updated to match this invoice?

We have a FTGSS contract with a MDQ of 40,148 dts.  The primary receipt point 
on this contract is storage.  BUT, we can flow some of this gas from 
secondary points like Oakford or the Pools.  How much gas can be sourced from 
Secondary receipt points?

Good point.  Is that also Bear Creek storage?  The tax bill specifically 
states Sonat Bear Creek storage.  I also left a voicemail for our tax guy.  
There is no support for the tax bill so I don't know how the taxing authority 
comes up with their number.  I would like to see it but I bet it takes a 
while to get the support.

I also have a tax bill for Koch Bistenau storage.  We have some type of deal 
with NOPSI.  Any other ideas on that?

Question:  We received a tax bill from the Bienville Parish for gas in Koch 
storage for the 2000 tax year.  I found out yesterday that ENA handles 
no-notice storage for NOPSI and it might be related to that.  Do you know 
what Koch storage contracts we had for the 2000 tax year?

We also received a bill for Sonat Bear Creek storage.  I assume this would 
all be for CES/New Power.  If you know of any other Sonat storages we had for 
the 2000 tax year, please let me know.

Brenda will fax the Koch storage tax bill to you.

Thanks
Chris.

This is ready to go.  I highlighted areas that you need to fill in.  Thanks.

Thanks for the Oglethorpe.  I just sent my info to Mr. Homco for review.

Would you please send me the December purchases and sales for New Power?

thanks

Would you please be so kind and take a peek at this.  

Attached are my demand charges and CGAS activity for December.

Jeff, I have all the prices in my worksheet.  It would be easy to calculate 
one citygate price to put on our big citygate deal ticket.  And we are still 
out of balance starting on the 22nd.

 

Dear Team,

I updated the bookout deals 523459 and 523444 for the following dates, 20th, 
21st, 23rd, 29th, 30th, and 31st.  Please path this in Unify and let me know

That would help us out as it is in the same zone as the A06 gas we need for 
CPA. How much do you have and is it through Mar01? We may try to flow a 
little in Jan to see if it will go as we need reliable supply for CPA.

Chris Germany@ECT
01/04/2001 09:58 AM
You guys may see an opportunity for this gas sometime.  I have gas on 
National Fuel that I could deliver into CGAS at Ellwood City on a secondary 
basis.  Ellwood in Op 8, Market area 35, I think.

This trades around a CNG North plus.

Let me know one way or another, I'm just eager to learn.

Opps.  I took it home to read and I think I used it to start a fire and 
reduce my energy cost.  Would you please fax it to me at 713-646-8453?

You are so wonderfull.

I need 2 x-large shirts for Oglethorpe Power please.  I am going to give them

I changed the demand charge from $.155 to $.20 in Sitara.,

I also increase the price from $10.53 to $10.8003, that should have a bit of 
an impact.

up thru the snow.

Dick bought gas from Tim Ray, does this impact our stuff?  Dick bought 15000 
day at 9.21 from the 4th-31st.

I created deal 461123 (purchase from New Power) and deal 461134 (sale to New

the right is my calculation of the Overtakes.  The second column from the 
right is your cal of over's and under's.  Our storage numbers are close

additional 30,000/d from Dick J. which may be part of this deal. 

Coh Numbers on Jan01DailyEst include about 35,000/d of storage WD, noted at 
bottom of sheet. COH also includes 14,500/d purchased at Toledo Agg(NPC 
buying) and 1,250/d at A06 Agg. See attached JanCohChoiceEna.

CPA includes 3,913/d at BRCobb, 3.674/d at Tetco-Delmont and  2,689 at A06. 

We will do Buy/Sell on 3rd party so ENA can transport. Will pass on upstream

I tried to fax all 4 deal sheets at once - and the pages stuck together.  So 
I faxed each page seperately.  

Nice outfit.  Judy says "Hey".

I am showing a balance of 80,265 in the Egan park deal as of Jan 1, 2001.  
Egan is showing a balance of 84,944.  I am using our balance for now.  I'm 
taking 2592 dt's in to Texas Gas for the 1st and 2nd, and 2599 dt's per day 
for the balance of the month.

I tried to update all the deal tickets but I won't know if it worked until 
after our systems work.

I created a buy/sell with Hopewell that we are going to kill after the month 
is over.  Deals 549136 and 549152 will be killed next week.  These tickets 
are just estimating the loss on oil replacement.

Jim had a death in the family and is gone.  I didn't change any of the info

I don't see the facility numbers in Sitara.  However, I do use meter numbers 
and the NFUL meter number for the interconnect with TCPL is 010902.  Deal 
241639 is (term purchase from AEC) is at this meter.  And deal 511043 (ENA-Im 
Market East sale to ENA-Im Ontario) is also at this meter for December.  It 
doesn't matter to me which facility we use provided NFUL meter 010902 is set 
up in Sitara.

Richard, issues to consider before Faye makes any changes,
 *  NFUL is an EDI pipeline, how will the changes impact Angie's EDI file?
 *  Will we need to rebook our term purchase - (this should be fairly simple)?
 *   Will Unify need to be repathed since the beginning of time?
 *  Can this change take effect 1/1/2001?
 *  If Martin reads this without Darren tipping him off before 1:00 PM today, 
I'll buy him a "pop".

Kevin, I have included Chris Germany and Richard Pinion because they 
requested updates to facility #820006.  There is a note on this facility from 
Chris requesting this facility to be reactivated (10/28/99).  He would have 
to approve inactivation.  Richard requested a name change (4/25/00).

Chris is this still a valid point?

See Screen 3 - Facility #513423 appears to have been created in error.  The 
Norm and Trade flags are set to 'no'.

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Faye

Screen 1 - Note requesting reactivation.

Screen 2 - Shows interconnect with different pipes.

Screen 3 - This facility appears to be created in error, both the Norm and 
Trade flags are set to 'No'.

820006 is set up in Global as an interconnect between NFUL and TCPL at 
Niagara Falls.  That is incorrect and this facility should  be changed or 
inactivated ASAP  before any more deals get booked against it.  I believe 
there is an interconnect between NFUL and TGP at Niagara.
Didn't we have this same problem in the spring regarding Facility#513423.

Kevin

I created deal 546310 for pool sales to New Power.  I currently have a daily 
volume fo 4250 on this deal.  We should be able to move the volumes back and 
forth between this deal and the big citygate deal.

What was the volume of Jeffy gas going to Mikey?  And what day did that 
start?

According to my records, New Power has 140,099 dt's of CGAS capacity.  On the 
22nd, we scheduled 143,400 dt's on deal 502957.  Please verify that New Power 
took 143,400 dt's on the 22nd, its ok, I just need to do a price adjustment.

Thanks

Since we are selling deliverd gas, the Receipt and Delivery volumes should be 
the same.  Also, we can fix it so the imbalance is 0 on the 22nd if that 
would be easier.

Let me know buddy.

CGAS - we may not release any VNG CGAS capacity to ENA.  According to CGAS, 
we may loose some of our flexibility with the contract.  Scott is waiting to 
hear from CGAS.  At this point, we will not release the capacity effective 
for the 1st.

Tenn -  I do not have the new contract numbers yet.  Per Tenn - Scott will 
send a letter to Tenn requesting that the VNG discounts be transferred to the 
new ENA contracts.

Trco - Trco has a capacity release "glitch" in their EBB and needs to 
"temporarily flip a switch" while I do the capacity releases.  Since I know 
Trco well, I've decided to wait until after the 1st to do the releases in 
case their are EDI issues with the "switch flipping".  AND we would not know 
about any problems until the 31st.

Also, VNG has 35,930 dth of telescoped Trco capacity.  Williams has 15,930 
dth of the VNG capacity because of the FS service.  I will release 20,000 dth 
to ENA.  This will eliminate the overlapping problems we have with Williams.

Attached is my pricing and the capacity for December.   I went thru the 
capacity fairly close on CGAS so this should be correct.  Let me know if you 
have any questions.

Also, for the 1st,  I'm showing a FOM volume of 31,679 dth per day.  This is 
a combination of your max FOM Exhibit 1 gas, plus the CGLF volume plus some 
NX1 CGAS volumes.

Guess Who???  Its back on my desk.  How do you feel about doing a manual 
invoice?  That will be the only way to get it out quickly at this point.

Hi Judy,

I spoke with Chris Germany yesterday and he said that you were going to take 
care of fixing the Oglethorpe deal.  An unhappy Doug Jones from Oglethorpe 
called me yesterday.  He is wanting to get the corrected invoice ASAP so he 
can have the wire to us before year end.  If he doesn't get the invoice 
today, he will not pay us until after the first of the year.  

Please let me know when to expect the changes to come across so I can forcast 
the cash receipt in our system for treasury and also let Doug know when the 
invoice will be faxed over to him.

Thanks to everyone involved for all of your help.  Merry Christmas!

Darla

I changed the term on deal 510007.

Steve, this is CNG contract #100104 for 15225 dth day.  The primary receipt 
point on this capaity is storage.  Is this a Nov-Mar deal or is this capacity 
good all year?

Brenda, what are the rules for setting up VNG demand charges?  Also, we are 
releasing most (not all) of the VNG space to ENA effective 1/1/2001.  Should 
I set up ENA - Im VNG as the primary desk for demand charges?

We need to chat about the following VNG deals.
420130,  543185,  and 543186

What volumes do we have for Power Gas Marketing and for the sale to Clinton?  
AND what has Clinton agreed to pay us?  What is the deal number for the sale 
to Clinton?

1)  Volumes for Phillips for 08/00 have been changed to 7765 dth from 7542 mcf
   2)  Volumes for Phillips for 09/00 have been changed to 11796 dth from 
11452 mfc

These changes were given to me by Donnie Myers.   Thanks, Gloria

Chris Germany

Wade, for July and August, give me the actual volumes and price for Phillips 
and Power Gas Marketing behind Peoples.  AND are these volumes MCF's or 
MMBTU's?  AND do we back out any gathering charges on this gas?

Gloria G Barkowsky
09/21/2000 02:30 PM
Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is 
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I 
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.  
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of 
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So 
far,
it looks like 07/00 and 08/00.  Thanks, Gloria
  

I changed the term on this deal ticket.

Could you please send the service agreement into Koch for the Ormet 
transaction.  This memo that I wrote to Scott details the rates that we have 
negotiated with Koch.  Koch has to post our deal for five days, so could you 
please try to send it out today if at all possible.  I am also sending you 
the draft letter agreement that Koch sent to us which we will also need to 
execute.  We will also need to put an IT agreement in place with Koch.  They 
have offered the same discounted rates on an IT basis for any volumes above 
the 15,000/d of FT.

Also, could you please arrange to put in place an IT agreement on Cypress for 
delivery to Ormet Aluminum's Burnside,LA

Thanks for your help.

Craig
Craig Breslau
11/16/2000 04:37 PM
Scott:

Ormet's Burnside,LA Aluminum refinery is dually connected to Koch and Cypress.
The transport rates that  Koch has quoted for FT to Ormet are as follows:

From Bridgeline/Paradis or LRC/ Paradis .03 demand charge

from Venice     .05 demand charge

from the Mobile Bay pooling point on Koch .045 demand charge
(if we buy upstream of the pooling point then we would also pay a .0246 
gathering fee on Mobile Bay)

In addition we will be charged .0022 ACA from any of these receipt points.

The fuel rate is 1.6%.  This will be passed on to Ormet.

Koch has agreed that any volumes in excess of the 15/d of FT will be at the 
same discounted rate, but will flow on an IT basis.  If this IT is cut, we 
still must use best efforts to transport from other receipt points on Koch or 
on Cypress.  Ormet pays all additional transport costs.
Additionally, we have a price re-opener if Koch changes from monthly 
balancing at any point during the contract term.
I am working with Koch to get secondary delivery points on Koch in the event 
that the desk wants to take the gas elsewhere (i.e. if Ormet doesn't need the 
gas or if you choose to deliver off of Cypress).  If you have any preferences 
for alternate delivery points, please let me know.

As I mentioned, we  have already quoted NYMEX + .055 as the all-in delivered 
price to Ormet.

Ormet would like to come to agreement on this transaction today (his wife is 
due any day so he will be out of the office starting tomorrow).  They are one 
hour ahead of us so your comments are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for all of your help on this deal.

This is the first notice from Transco regarding imbalances.  Transco has not 
changed their IT notices since the 6th, when they closed down St 90.

(713-215-2514)December 21, 2000

Re:     System Imbalance Notice

Please be advised that Transco has been experiencing excessive negative
transportation imbalances (deliveries in excess of receipts) on its
system over the past several days.  As of December 21, 2000, Shippers
are advised to avoid any additional negative imbalances as soon as
possible.

Additionally, until further notice, Transco will institute more
restrictive practices at its pooling points.  Transco will reduce the 4%
tolerance currently allowed at its pooling points to 1% or 1,000 dts for
Shippers with negatively scheduled imbalances (i.e. deliveries into the
pools are less than receipts away from the pools).  Shippers with
positively scheduled imbalances at their pools will continue to be held
to the 4% tolerance levels.  Transco will not enforce these pool
imbalance tolerances during the timely nomination cycle; however,
Shippers are expected to balance their pools to the limits identified
above by the ID2 nomination cycle.  Transco may proactively decrease
markets to bring them in line with supplies at pooling points.

Absent voluntary compliance with this notice, Transco may be required to
use any remedies available, up to and including reliance upon Section 52
of the General Terms and Conditions of Transco's FERC Gas Tariff, to
ensure it retains the appropriate level of operational flexibility.

Cindy, take all the M2 production gas into our M2 tabs and lets go long in 
the pool.  We will sell the gas over the holidays or next week after we see 
what Dominion is producing.  We will not have this gas for January.

make sure you leave me about 20,000/d storage flowing if retros swing down.

I just sold David Scott 170 dth of TCO pool at $11.06 for the 22nd (deal 
542442).  New Power will schedule this gas out of our pool.  Bottom line , 
this is Mikey gas which is different from Jeffy gas.

If you read this before I call you then I will make brownies and bring them 
in.

Show Judy this.
We cannot let you balance your mdq across the month but we can offer a low
IT discount rate on top of the firm.  (this equates back to the effective
rate you were looking for.  You can change the amount of firm higher if you
like and then the ratio of IT at the cheap rate will also incease.  Your
cheap IT rate can be up to a volume of 50% of your firm.   After that it
would be max rate it.

I will be out this afternoon and Thursday but will call you from the road.

12/18/2000 04:56 PM
Deal # 454471 and Deal # 418249 are both set up for contract 69357. Deal # 
418249 matches the invoice so I think Deal # 454471 needs to be killed.  

The rate and volumes on Deal # 454471 match the invoice for contract 69759 
but Deal # 460384 is set for this contract.

Bottom line - we have an extra deal (454471) in the system according to how 
we were invoiced.

If you agree, please have Elizabeth kill the deal .

thanks,
Brenda

I just spoke with Jim Scabareti at AGL regarding the releases of capacity.  
AGL/VNG is fine with your proposal to release the assets for three years 
provided the releases are recallable for any reason.  This recall right is 
consistent with our asset management agreement (which basically determines 
the nature of recall rights AGL has under our deal)

So....

Go ahead and release the assets, 100% recallable, for three years.

Kimat, this is the offset to the big gain we made on CGAS last night on that 
one deal.  I increased our sales volume on deal. 502957 by 10,000dth/day 
starting on the 19th.  Deal 502957 is a citygate, index based sale and we 
should show a big loss on it tonite.

Chris - We now have a volume problem involving  Phillips Production supply 
and  Power Gas Marketing supply and the Clinton sales.   How do we 
reconcile?  Phillips and Power Gas Marketing are supplying statements to back 
their numbers, and per John Singer, we are trying to use them.  This new 
change in volumes will result in supply drafts for the differences.

We really need a solution and a resolution.  Please reply.

WRP

Nope.  Just bring a smile.

I sold 10000 day (deal 536976) starting on the 20th at $9.15 to New Power.  
Please bookout this deal with 536977 (purchase at FOM index pricing).

Take a look and let me know what you think.  Also, please check the volumes.

What are you going to Chicago for?  

I do not see a Sitara deal ticket for Tagg #NR6345.A, a Trco Z6 sell to New 
Power for Mar and Apr 2001.

I updated the worksheet with a little more info and I added Trco and Tetco 
Marktet area information.  I did this quickly so let me know if something 
doesn't look right.  On Monday, we will show you a bid for the Tetco and Trco 
volumes.

Also, the Tetco and Trco volumes are monthly and the CGAS volumes are daily.

I guess you and Muffy better be snuggling to stay warm.

Attached are my calculations of the IF volumes for CGAS.  I will also try to 
update this schedule for the AGL production area volumes.  

I have also included the CGAS NX1 deals.  I feel good about the NX1 volumes 
for Jan and Feb, I not sure about the Mar forward volumes yet.  I will keep 
working on thei sheet.

Does this work?  You don't read your emails do you?Call me before 11:20 am 
and I'll give you a dollar.

Should we release the VNG capacity to ENA effective 1/1/2001?  If yes, then 
what time frame (one year)?

Take a look at my worksheet and we will go over it.  It's mind boggeling. 

I'm checking all my deals and found I need to add the following.

Bookout deal 533305 with 533306 (volume of 688 day for the 1st - 31st).

Bookout deal 533317 with deal 533319 (volume of 5000 day for the 5th - 31st).

The last problem deals I see are 516286 and 521475.  This is not a bookout,  
One of these should be killed and I think it should be the purchase deal 
516286.  We should see New Power scheduling gas out of our pool.  The volume 
on the 5th - 31st should be about 40,257 day.  Just a note, since I think the 
purchase deal should be killed, this would make us 520,000 shorter for the 
month in Sitara.

I left a voicemail for Mike Garred to verify.

We sold the 1533 / day to Allegheny - deal 459226.  This is back on a month 
to month basis.  We don't know if we are selling them gas for Dec yet.

For Dec, we were taking 4679 day from the Egan parking into TGT.  Effective 
12/16/2000, we moved the remaining balance to Jan 2001.  I made the following 
adjustments to deal 473190, 
 took daily withdrawal volumes to 0 effective 12/16 - 12/31
 extended the deal to Jan 2001
 changed 1/1/2001 to 2444
 changed 1/2/2001 - 1/31/2001 to 2414

This might be a little confusing because we also have withdrawals of about 
1500 day in Jan.

Also, Egan is showing a different balance than what I have.

I show we should have a total balance of 132,247 (4679 x (31-13)  plus  48025 
)  at the end of gas day 12/13/2000.  Egan is showing a balance of 134,302.  
This just means that we parked more gas than I thought or we cut back on some 
of our withdrawals on the 1st through the 13th.  No big deal, I just want to 
make sure we don't leave any gas in parking.

Welcome Volunteers!!

Beavy, since you are going to be out, and most of our work will be done next 
week, I will start giving Tricia "to do's" and you can catch up later.

I have a meeting at 3:00 PM today.  I would like to give you both a quick 15 
min preview before then if possible.  Let me know.

Tricia,

Please run a "monthly facilitaion by location" report for "The New Power 
Company" for both MarketEast and East for Jan 2001 and Jan-Dec 2001.  I don't 
know if you can run the Jan-Dec 2001 on one report.  Tricia, if we do the 15 
min meeting today, I would like to have 3 copies of the Jan 2001 facilitation.

I create a ton of bookout deals for New Power  and I always start with the 
CPR report.

Thanks.

Nothing new to report.  I received an official copy of the inventory list 
last night.  I will try to get it notorized and mailed back to the lawyer 
today.

My question I guess is, what case?  What is the status?

dg

We can sell the tractor anytime as far as I'm concerned.  We will have to
pay some extra taxes but that's ok by me.  The lawyer said we may have to
buy a replacement if we loose the case but she doesn't think we would
loose.

The $10,000 scheduling fee is included and this demand charge is just for the 
New Power Market Area.  We are still working on the East demand charges, they 
are not correct.  I will probably add the East demand charges to a CGLF sales 
deal.

Brenda H Fletcher

I added a demand charge of $1,193,725 to deal 523459 for Dec 2000.  I don't 
think this should show up in the current month P&L, at least not from this 
deal ticket.

Let me know if there are any problems.

This demand charge is for the Market East and for the $10,000/month 
scheduling fee.  We are still working on the East demand charges for New 
Power.

Hey team.

I just created deals 456630 (sale to New Power) and 456638 (buy from New 
Power) at the pool.  This is to record the gas ENA is buying back from New 
Power when there daily loads drop below the FOM numbers.  I'm using the 
following FOM numbers

1st-6th  51,762
7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st
27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st

Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through 
the 25th.  Not as much as I thought.

7th-26th  41,762  New Power sold back 10,000 dth day 7th-31st
27th-31st 31,762 New Power sold Aquilla 10,000 dth 27th-31st

Using these numbers, ENA is only buying back a total of 164,031dth through 
the 25th.  Not as much as I thought.

gracias senor germany!

I entered deal 454356 in Sitara.  ENA inherited this deal from CES.  This is 
a sale to Nashville Gas Company at CGLF Mainline.   I entered all the pricing 
and volume terms on the comments.

P.S.  Nashville is in the process of assigning this deal to Sempra. 

Scott Goodell who knows all and sees all said he is at AEP, and his number is 
614-324-5038.  Scott is THE MAN!

Chris,

Do you know if John Hymel ended up at Enron in the CES deal?

I'd like to get in touch with him.

Thanks,

Don

Could you please put the "buy" ticket to offset the sell ticket #380571 on 
Columbia Gulf.

Thanks, 

Jesse

28213

I just spoke with Joann and this is what we are coming up with on CGAS.

Est Citygate for Nov  43,213
Storage Withdrawal  15,000

Net Purchase from ENA  28,213

Does this look correct?

We would enter a citygate sell to New Power for 43,212 and a purchase from 
New Power of 15,000 (grossed up for fuel).

AND, Dave, it looks like you might have 3 or more worksheets that you are 
maintaining.  Do you want to try and do away with any of them?  All I really 
need are the FOM numbers buy pipeline buy pricing zone.

Sean may want to go to this.

On behalf of Cynthia Ellis, I would like to invite you to attend the annual
Dominion Transmission Mid-Atlantic Winter Operations Meeting to be held at The
Jefferson Hotel in Richmond, VA on November 14, 2000.  We have scheduled the
meeting to begin at 10:00 am and last until around 3:00 pm.   Lunch will be
provided for you.   In order to appropriately plan for food and beverage 
needs,
please let me know by November 7, 2000 if you plan to attend.  I will also 
need
to know if you will require a room reservation for the evening of November 13.
You may respond via e-mail or call me at (304)627-3916.  We look forward to
seeing you there!

The CGAS exchange deals I set up for CGAS storage end Oct 31st.  I'm thinking 
of changing the process effective 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.  ENA billed CES (now 
New Power) for the gas delivered to storage.  Now ENA needs to pay New Power 
for the gas taken out of storage.

In my example, we would need to recognize the beginning storage balanc e 
effective 11/1/2000.

Take a look - let me know if you have any comments.

Maybe we should add another section to Mr. Scott's worksheet for "Third 
Party"  buy's and sells (like the Aquilla deal #452810) and the deal we did 
on the 7th where ENA bought the gas back from New Power.  Not a big deal for 
October, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again 
for the winter months.  I could see you guys buying incremental third party 
gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints.

Example:  You might buy gas from Sempra at Eagle into CGAS and we use your 
transport to get it to a citygate.  ENA would buy it from New Power at Eagel 
and sell it back to New Power at the citygate.  We should let you know what 
the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and Scott could put it on 
the worksheet.

So if we had this tab for October, it would just have 2 deals on it so far.

Comments?

Deal 452810 is an ENA sale to New Power at IF + .0075 for 10,000 dth day 
starting on the 27th.  New Power is selling this gas to Aquilla.

Steve Stonestreet said you have an email address for our team.  I would like 
to have that please.

I need to know what our demand charges are for some contracts that start in 
November.

thanks

Jeff Westover said you want the demand charges split out by pipe.  I attached 
September, is this the month you are looking for?

Chris, I just figured out why you did not see the e-mail, I did not send it 
to you!!!!
Sorry, here it is.
Guys,
A friend recommended Capacity Center, a service that e-mails information on 
capacity release, daily activity reports and system notices from pipelines on 
a daily basis.  There is a filtering mechanism for each service by pipeline, 
time frame and the critical nature of  the notices.  The cost is based on the 
number of users and reports, for example if we signed up 3 users for 6 months 
the cost would be approximately $3,000.  If you would like to check it out  I 
have negotiated a free trial for 2 weeks (until 11/5/00).  Click here 
http://www.capacitycenter.com/  the login name is sboyle@enron.com and

reports I can forward them to you via my e-mail.  Or you can call

Update.  Spoke with the lawyer yesterday.  We can't buy Don out right now.  
We need to turn in the final inventory list, get things resolved with Mary 
(be it good or bad) then we can buy Don out.

She still thinks that we won't have any issues with Mary.  After we provide 
the inventory list, she wants me to meet with her (Joal), Mary, and Mary's 
lawyer to see what we need to do to get this CONFLICT resolved.  Joal thinks 
we should be able to do this during the first 2 weeks of November.

I have a bad cold and I went scooter riding last night.  Do you care?

I can't blame brother too much, I still bounce back and forth between major 
frustration and apathy on the East Texas issue.  Hope for the best!!

Later

Update, Scott and I are still looking at the storage numbers.  We hope to 
have it done today but we are having trouble nailing down the numbers.

Donnie, for July, adjust the Clinton volume to match the purchases from 
Phillips and Power Gas Marketing - DO NOT SEND OUT AN INVOICE ADJUSTMENT.  I 
may need to change the price on the sale to CLINTON so that our receivables 
are netting to 0.

For August, September, October, and November, make the Clinton volumes match 
the Phillips and Power Gas Marketing Supply and DO send an invoice adjustment 
to Clinton.

Paul, let me know if you have questions.  For July, the imbalance is actually 
in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that.  For August forward, I 
believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes 
since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool.  Let me know if you want to 
make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - I just want these 
deals to go away.  Oh yeah, and make Clinton a lot of money!

Wade, for July and August, give me the actual volumes and price for Phillips 
and Power Gas Marketing behind Peoples.  AND are these volumes MCF's or 
MMBTU's?  AND do we back out any gathering charges on this gas?

Gloria G Barkowsky
09/21/2000 02:30 PM
Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is 
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I 
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.  
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of 
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So 
far,
it looks like 07/00 and 08/00.  Thanks, Gloria

which would end 9/30/2000.
I noticed that Jesse extended the date range to 2001.  Is this correct?

I changed the end term date on cglf k#50250 from 10/31/2000 to 7/31/2001.

I just  got off the phone with Rich Contos, he wants me to find out if Enron
concurs with the storage volumes sold.  I think Ernie Simien or Doug Kinney 
had
sent some volumes and associated dollar amounts to you to look at.

Let me know if Enron is in concurrance.

Phone is 713-267-4646 and you can see the e-mail address.

Come chat with me when you get a chance.  I see you are not at your desk, as 
usual.

Were you going to send me some deal numbers to check out for August ?

I just updated the volumes on deals 523444 and 523459 for the 12th.  This is 
a bookout.  The volumes on these deals should always match, if they don't 
then I goofed.

Please send me the August invoice for CES.  Did we do any manual billings for 
August?  I need those too.

We do get invoiced by VGS.  The Transport contract numbers are VGS01026-IT 
and VGS01033 - FTS-2

   

Brenda, VGS is all buy/sells for us.  VGS delivers directly into Koch, CGULF 
and TETCO.  We sell at the point or deliver into those 3 pipes where we pick 
up on transport.    FTS-2 and IT sounds like Columbia Gulf..Thanks
Brenda H Fletcher
10/17/2000 02:22 PM
Nothing is getting flashed on VGS for commodity.  We are paying commodity 
charges on a FTS-2 and an IT contract.  Can you get rates on the usage 
tickets for these contracts?

Thanks,
Brenda

FYI.  Commonwealth Energy is adding a new meter to their existing contract.  
The meter number is 4371201 and is at Hastings.  This meter is gathering 
dry.  This meter was a new meter set and will probably begin flowing at the 
end of October.  It is estimated to produce about 30 dths a day.  Please 
forward this on to anyone that needs to schedule this gas.  I'm not real sure 
who is doing your noms on CNG.

Thanks,
Heidi

I just called Lincoln Life - Dad's mutual fund.  He will mail me the forms to 
fill out today.

James Eckert with Tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on Wednesday.  I 
don't think we all need to go and I don't need to go either.  

He is going to educate us on the VNG contract #47.  The demand charge and 
commodity is discounted effective 11/1/2000.  This is what we know about the 
contract:

MDQ = 16,373 eff 11/1/2000
The 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted  commodity of $.05 and 
discounted demand of $6.08
If we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to $7.61

What I need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for 
volumes over 4723 day.
What is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day  for November - 
 is it 141,690 (4723 x 30) @ $6.08 and 38,310 ([6000-4723] x 30) @ $7.61.

I will be out tomorrow and I may leave early this afternoon.  Could you email 
me the deal numbers for the 3 purchases and 12 sales for the month of August?

We can sell the tractor anytime as far as I'm concerned.  We will have to pay 
some extra taxes but that's ok by me.  The lawyer said we may have to buy a 
replacement if we loose the case but she doesn't think we would loose.

I think everyone needs a good wife!

I didn't go to the shipper meeting.  We sent Sean Boyle, he's an ex CNG guy 
that works for us now.  You may have chatted with him at CNG/Sabine way back 
when.  He's a combo physical/financial guy in our group.

My Dad's estate stuff is still hanging in the air.  No new news - I hope to 
find out more next week.

Think I'll take half a day of vaca - later!

If I remember correctly, I believe Sithe had just purchased this plant from 
someone else.  The delivery point on CNG was NIMO.  And this was the only 
time we ever used the agency on CNG.

This is a Sithe Energies transaction and in no way has anything to do with our
Sithe/Independence transactions.  However, we need to make sure when the
contract is terminated, none of our Sithe/Independence contracts are 
affected. 
These other contracts are one ANR, PEPL, Union, TCPL, Empire, and NiMo.

Thanks, Diane

ENA is set up as agent for Sithe Energies, USA, INC on CNG Transmission.  I 
believe either Kate or Robin did a deal with Sithe last October.  ENA 
released capacity to Sithe (only 500 dth per day), and acted as billing and 
nominating agent on this contract.  It was a citygate sale  in New York and 
we wanted to transfer title at the pool.

I received a call from Scott Nelson (212-351-0494) with Sithe this morning.  
He is terminating the agency.

Did you call me?  I have a message from Mike at 3-5480.  It ain't your voice 
on voicemail.

Cute, I want one!!

I will be out the week of the 13th.

and a customer service update; (2) a 1Line update and discussion on business

practice changes that will require tariff changes; and (3) a review and
discussion of the EDI and flat file datasets for nominations, confirmations
and schedule quantity reports targeted at those customers and their
information technology staff who have expressed an interest in this
information.  Transco will also be holding a pre-filing meeting in
Washington
DC specifically to address the tariff changes associated with implementation

of the 1Line system.  That meeting will be held in mid-November and
customers
will be notified as to time and location in the near future.

The meetings in Newark and Charlotte will start at 9:00 a.m. and end at
approximately 4:00 p.m.  Coffee, juice and pastries will be provided before
the meeting and lunch will be served at approximately 11:30 a.m.  The
Houston
meeting will start at 12:30 p.m. and end at approximately 5:00 p.m.
Refreshments will be provided mid-afternoon.

The agenda for the Newark and Charlotte meetings as well as the Houston
meeting is included below.  Please note that the agenda for the Houston
meeting is significantly different than the other meetings.

Please RSVP to Rosina Freeman at 713-215-4054 or via e-mail at

I spoke with Rich yesterday.  He said it would be OK to net the storage true 
up invoice from Ernie with the Sep invoice.  I mailed the invoice via 
interoffice to Jeff.

There are 6 or 7 deals that ENA billed CES for September that should probably 
be billed to New Power.  All of the deals in question are on the Central desk.

How does the reconciliation look for Jan - June?  Rich said it was his 
understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal.

My fault.  Try it again.  I just released the deal.

Darla Saucier@ENRON

Jeff said he is still not seeing these 2 deals for September.  These are the 
deals I entered in Sitara yesterday for Sep.  Would you check on them and let 
me know what you find out?

I went motorcycle riding last night - I think I need to get some better
winter riding gear.

We will definitely go to court next Tuesday at 1:00 PM.  All we are doing
is verifying Dad's signature on the will.  Once the judge sees us it should
only take about five minutes.

That's all I have for now.

Oh now you're teasing me!  I went riding last night.  I think I need some

November - don't know where we are going yet.  

How's the new job?  What do you do with yourself in the evenings now?

I need your SS #'s for my beneficiary form.

Jerry, please forward to Don, I couldn't email him the other day.

Hey team, I know you guys are concerned about my welfare so I'm taking 
vacation.

I will be off on Tuesday Oct 17th and the week of Nov 13th-17th.

I took a 1/2 day of vacation yesterday, the 5th. 

It is amazing and yet not surprising how much Enron has accomplished in the=

first six months of this year. You continue to make it happen.  We recogniz=
e=20
that you work hard every day to accomplish Enron=01,s business goals, and w=

through Enron stock options.=20

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=

All Employee Stock Option Program or AESOP) began in 1994 and provided valu=

to participants through 2000.  Employees who have participated in this=20
program from its inception have realized a 1,119% increase in the value of=
=20
their stock options (assuming a stock price of $70) over the life of the=20
program.  =20

Enron stock options are a valuable part of your total compensation package=

and a contributing factor to your performance and to Enron=01,s continued=
=20
success.  Therefore, the Enron Executive Committee and the Compensation and=
=20
Management Development Committee of the Enron Board of Directors have decid=
ed=20
to continue to offer stock options as a part of your compensation package.

On May 1, 2000, the Committee approved an employee stock option program for=
=20
calendar years 2001 - 2005 (EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program).  =
It is=20
expected that EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will be granted,=

effective on or about December 29, 2000, for those employees who are eligib=

on that date (please see note below).  The new program, which is subject to=
=20
final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, is as follows:

? EnronOptions =01) Your Stock Option Program will give stock options to=20
eligible full-time and part-time regular employees in domestic and=20
international companies/locations.
? The grant of non-qualified stock options will equal 25% of annual base=20

December 29, 2000. (Salary calculation and value may vary in some=20
international locations.)
? The Board will grant the stock options on December 29, 2000.
? Eligible employees hired in subsequent years will receive a prorated gran=

of stock options.

Why commit your talent and energy to Enron?  EnronOptions =01) Your Stock O=

In the coming weeks, you will be receiving more details about EnronOptions =

Note: In addition to final approval by Enron=01,s Board of Directors, grant=

Also, there is 5000/day of Leach to BG&E space at max rate for a term of 
11/1/99 - 4/30/01.  Is this considered retail or wholesale?
I don't see any matching CGLG space to go with it.  Is that correct?

Chris Germany
01/10/2000 08:01 PM
Contract 62039 was replace with contract 65402.  It's 20,000 day with a 
primary receipt of Maumee and a primary delivery of COH.  The term is 11/1/99 
- 10/31/2000.  Should I bill the retail group for this contract or does this 
belong to wholesale??  Also, I'm showing a demand charge of $.15.

Nuthin I want to put in writing.

I want to discuss further and you should probably buy me a drink.  Oh yea, 
you already did!

   

Chris, I whole heartedly agree....As a group we are preparing a 
presentation/lunch where we will get together with Volume Mgt. and Client 
Services and show how a good logistics/accounting team works...We(Bryce 
Baxter, Kathy Kelly and Ed Terry) are also encouraging the folks from 37 to 
spend an hour or two here in our world during scheduling and our folks also 
spending time with the folks in 37 so we can both understand each other's 
worlds......  If you want to discuss further, please let me know.......      

Chris Germany
10/08/2000 11:50 AM
I think we need to get scheduling, volume management, and accounting together 
somehow.  I don't think a happy hour would do it because people tend to get 
in their groups and talk.

Let me know what you guys think.  I would like to talk to Bob Hall and Bob 
Supperty about this,.

I will fax you another report that should have the same data in a different 
format.

Jeff W Westover

Attached is a copy of the sales invoices and purchase verifications for 
Columbia Energy Services for Sept. 2000.

Let me know when I can send out the invoices for Columbia Energy.

Thanks, Jeff (3-3008)

I just adjusted the November Market East demand charge from $1,233,260 to 
$1,194,758.  This is on deal 508891.  Would you please send out an adjustment 
for the decrease to New Power?

Thanks

My fault for not correcting it sooner.

Attached are my demand charge calculations for the month of September.

I also included the scheduling fee of $10,000.00.  David and I discussed this.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Mr. Westover, there should be no manual billing for the month of September, 
everything should be billed through the system.

 

Please redraft the New Power September activity.  I'm looking for the deals 
shown below AND there should be a demand charge of $892,040.00 on deal 377245 
and a demand of $624,028.00 on deal 381811.

If you see the items above, please send me a new worksheet.

Thanks

Contract MDQ  Delivery Point Demand Comm  Comment
47  16,373  S Webster $6.0800  $.0500  Demand is $6.08 for daily volumes

If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point, the demand 
charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80.  

Questions for Tennessee;
What are the rates for October?
Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or 
monthly quantities?

I'm scheduling it. 

Jerry W Germany <germanj@basf-corp.com> on 10/09/2000 02:49:32 PM
My best time to take vacation would be between the 13 to the 22 of November.
How's that sound.

Chris.Germany@enron.com on 10/09/2000 02:45:25 PM
I have 17 days of vacation.  I'm rolling over 5 days which means I have 12
days left.  I think I can easily take off a week in November.  How about
you?

$9.50 by $9.60

Are we still getting a demand charge bill from Equitrans for contract 270?  I 
am still estimating about $5,000 per month.

Call me, lets chat.

I have 17 days of vacation.  I'm rolling over 5 days which means I have 12

We bought back some of New Powers first of the month volumes on deal 431846.  
Please match this deal with 431849.

I did this deal on the 5th and its effective the 7th - 31st.

I think we need to make sure we are doing a "point nom".  Acually since we 
don't EDI, we probably don't even need to do a point nom in Unify.  
Brenda H Fletcher
10/03/2000 09:18 AM
A Service Verification is a statement created in the Settlements module of 
Unify.  The Volume Management group uses this statement to approve a payment 
to a pipeline for a transportation related expense.  The Service Verification 
shows an amount calculated on quantities for a contract in Path Manager, 
times a rate from  either the Unify Tables or a rate on the Sitara deal 
ticket.  I could put a zero rate on the Sitara deal ticket to zero the 
unnecessary expense out but this doesn't resolve the issue.  Since we are 
noming agent only, we don't want something coming across the system for 
calculation of a payment.  Is there a different way to handle these types of 
contracts when they are being entered in Path Manager?  I've heard of 
something like a point nom as way to handle.  Are we doing that on this 
contract? 

   

Brenda, Please explain......What's a service verification and how can we fix 
this????

Brenda H Fletcher
09/22/2000 03:45 PM
We are noming agent only on Contract 37982 but a Service Verification 
continues to be drafted in Settlements.  How can we stop this from occuring?

Thanks,
Brenda

Who handles the billing for Ashland Chemical?

Hey Don, I'm still working on this.  I should have an idea by this Wed.

Refunds are always so much fun.  I suppose we would need to give some back to 
BUG if this happens.
Just wanted to make sure all of you saw this notice that we posted on the 
bulletin board last week.? This may mean significant $$$ for some of you.? In 
brief, we are filing a request to make an early partial refund.? The refund 
is related to the rate of return settlement in our last rate filing.? 
According to the rate case proceedings, the refund is not due until a final 
non-appealable order is issued, but we are requesting permission to do a 
partial refund sooner (around Oct 31).? As the bulletin states, if your 
company wishes to wait to receive its full refund after the final, 
non-appealable order, please notify me or another Transco rep.

Happy Halloween.?? ii

Re: Transco Files a Motion for Modification of Settlement to 
??? Permit Interim Partial Refunds 
??? Docket Nos. RP97-71-000 and RP97-312-000 

In response to certain customers' requests, Transco submits a 
Motion for Modification of Settlement to Permit Interim Partial 
Refunds in the above-captioned proceedings. By this motion, 
Transco requests that the Commission modify Article V of the 
January 20, 1998 Stipulation and Agreement to permit Transco to 
make an interim partial refund of amount to Non-Contesting 
Parties, if any, related to the Capital Structure/Rate of Return 
Issues on or about October 31, 2000. The refund is being made to 
parties in advance of the date that such refunds are due as set 
forth in the Stipulation and Agreement, in part to help mitigate 
the effects of current high natural gas prices on their 
customers. For further detailed information of the Motion filed 
at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, please refer to 
Transco's filing today in the above mentioned dockets. 

Specifically, Transco proposes to make interim partial refunds on 
or about October 31,2000 to Non-Contesting Parties related to the 
Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues. Transco will refund to 
those customers with interest from the date of payment to the 
date of refund, the amount, if any, collected from May 1, 1997 
through February 29,2000 in excess of the amount that would have 
been collected under the Settlement Rates as adjusted by the 
Commission's findings in its March 17, 2000 order in Docket No. 
RP97-71-000 on the Capital Structure/Rate of Return Issues, 
subject to the "refund floor". These interim partial refunds will 
be made on a lump sum basis, and will not be accompanied by any 
supporting documentation. However, supporting documentation for 
the principal and the interest calculation will be available upon 
request. 

If a Non-Contesting Party does not wish to receive an interim 
partial refund, and wishes instead to await issuance of a final 
Commission order no longer subject to rehearing on the Capital 
Structure/Rate of Return issues prior to receiving any refunds 
related to those issues, Transco requests that such Non- 
Contesting Party notify its customer service representative, on 
or before October 25, 2000, of its election not to participate in 
the interim partial refunds.

I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy 
Marketing on several pipelines.  Rich Contos's (the only CES person I know) 
last day is this Friday.  I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM 
should continue to exist as a legal entity on the pipelines.

As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and 
liability) relationships.

Comments/questions??

needed, and their service is excellent!!!

I'm glad you like the sweatpants. It turned cold and rainy today. I should

I got me a townhome... the contract will be signed on Tuesday. I really like

Additional information on the Transco MarketLink shippers:

Shipper   Phase  Volume  Term  Delivery Pt  Rate

Aquila   I     25,000 Dthd 10 years Manhattan  $0.35
Consolidated Edison I     30,000  10  Manhattan  $0.35
ConEdison Energy I     10,000  10  Manhattan  $0.35
St. Lawrence Cement I       1,000  10  Camden, NJ  $0.30
Williams Energy I  100,000  10  Manhattan/PSEG $0.35
Virginia Power  II  100,000  10  Trenton-Woodbury $0.30
PPL Energy Plus II     30,000  10  Princeton Junction $0.18

 Phase 1 begins 11/1/01.  Phase II begins 11/1/02.  The rates shown are for 
the demand and are the rates that Transco had been marketing for the 
project.  Each shipper is responsible for fuel and the electric power 
commodity charge and ACA.  There will be no GRI or Great Plains commodity 
surcharges.  The Manhattan and PSEG delivery points are Transco Zone 6 NY 
points.  The Camden, Trenton-Woodbury and Princeton Junction points are 
non-NY.
 Williams reduced their precedent agreement volume from 210,000 Dthd to the 
100,000 Dthd.  Williams' rights to PSEG points are north of the Linden 
allocation point.  Virginia Power is buying a project from Statoil on the 
Trenton-Woodbury line.  Virginia Power's commitment to MarketLink replaces 
one of Statoil's two precedent agreements.  Statoil has also sold another 
project that was underlying their second precedent agreement.  The new and 
unnamed project owner has requested and been granted an extension to the 
90,000 Dthd precedent agreement for a later phase of MarketLink.  Sunset 
Energy Fleet has requested and been granted an extension for their 95,600 
Dthd precedent agreeement.  LFG, a landfill gas developer, has also been 
granted an extension of their 5,000 Dthd precedent agreement to enable LFG to 
finalize a sale with a new owner or to locate an alternative landfill site.  
PPL Energy Plus has the right to deliver into a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL Interstate Energy Company pipeline system in Lower Mt. Bethel 
Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania or a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL's Eden plant in East Drumore Township, Lancaster County, 
Pennsylvania on a primary basis.  They also have the right to extend their 
agreement at the $0.18 rate for an additional two five year terms.  Dynegy 
(30,000 Dthd) and Engage (210,000 Dthd) terminated their respective precedent 
agreements.  Due to these terminations and reductions,  Transco only has 
announced precedent agreements of 190,600 Dthd for later phases.  If these 
precedent agreements become contracts, MarketLink would have 486,600 Dthd of 
shipper volume.  Transco has stated that all 700,000 Dthd of MarketLink would 
be built by 11/01/04.

John Hodge@ENRON
09/21/2000 08:19 AM
Transco filed service agreements with the FERC for MarketLink (Leidy - Zone 
6) yesterday.  The project will start in two phases.  The shippers and phases 
are as follows:

Phase I (11/1/01 start)

Aquila Energy Marketing    25,000 Dthd
Consolidated Edison     30,000
ConEdison Energy     10,000
St. Lawrence Cement       1,000
Williams Energy Marketing  100,000

Total Phase I    166,000 Dthd

Phase II (11/1/02)

Virginia Power Energy Marketing 100,000 Dthd
PPL Energy Plus     30,000

Total Phase II    130,000 Dthd

Transco says that the remainder of the FERC-approved 700,000 Dthd project 
will be phased in by 11/1/04.
The first phase will start construction in 4/01 and involves looping 30 miles 
of pipe in Pennsylvannia and 30 miles of pipe in New Jersey at a cost of $123 
MM. The second phase will cost $119 MM.  I will let you know the primary 
delivery points of the shipper's capacity when I see the filing.

Robin, I can never remember if NYPA is your customer or Craig's - AND I can't 
find him in my email directory.

Re:  Texas Gas Transmission Fuel Retention Effective 11/1/00

On August 31, 2000 Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas
Gas) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-518-000
to change the Effective Fuel Retention Percentage (EFRP)
under its Rate Schedule FT which Transco utilizes to render
service to its customers under its Rate Schedule FT-NT.
Texas Gas has proposed to change its EFRP from 3.37% to
3.27% for the Winter Season (November - March) and from
2.68% to 2.96% for the Summer Season (April - October). If
accepted as proposed, the revised Texas Gas fuel percentages
would result in the following changes in Transco's current
Rate Schedule FT-NT Fuel Percentages effective November 1,
2000.

Winter Season - 0.09% decrease
Summer Season - 0.26% increase

Smart call on your part.  NOW we are using long haul FT to serve Doyel

NEWS FLASH!!!!

The Supreme Court of the United States has ruled that there cannot be a 
nativity scene in Washington, D.C. this Christmas. The Court ruling is not 
based on the seperation of Church and State  Simply put, the  Court felt it 
could not find three wise men and a virgin in the Nation's capitol. However, 
finding enough Asses to fill the stable would not be a problem.

I bought 5.22, the bid is now at 5.28, what should i do?

Jerry W Germany <germanj@basf-corp.com> on 09/20/2000 08:43:11 AM
No, I'm not buying.   I reviewed my credit card receipts this week and I 
bought
last.  Yawl's turn.

Don has brought me lots of checks, one for $1800 on farm equipment, $3000 from
Gerald for cows, (I think we are suppose to hold this check) and $5900 for
selling the cows.   You want me to hold this till we talk Thursday night.  I
have the checks in my Freezer on ice so they will not be hot.   I can 
continue t
hold or deposit into the account.   Your call Bub.  Also have some on Dad's 
mail
that Don dropped off.

Barb and I will be going up Friday to Alto to check out the place, mow and 
weed
eat etc.   I'll grab the mail and I have Don's check for $10,000 to Mary.   
I'll
probably go by and drop flowers on Dad's grave.

How was your trip?  Did you miss me?   You by a motorcycle YET?   I have not
really looked yet.   Sold the four wheeler to Don for $4000 plus the trailer.
I did not really need it and he asked if I wanted to sell it.

Got the insurance check from Met Life.   I signed it and put my account # on 
it
to deposit after church Sunday morning.  Stuck it and my offering check in my
wallet.  They took up the offering so I pulled out my check and put it in the
offering plate.  When I handed the offering plate to the usher, I noticed
writing on my check, then it hit me, WRONG CHECK.   Barb said my face turned
dark purple and eyes looked like watermelons.    I was stammering, wait wait,
wrong check!   Whooo, that was a close one.   Thought you might enjoy that 
one.

Hey Dow stock is an excellent buy at $24.00.   If we do not buy a scooter 
soon,
I'm going to invest a little in the Dow Stock.

Talk to you this afternoon once you are settled back in.  See Ya

Chris.Germany@enron.com on 09/20/2000 08:21:59 AM

I'm looking at last night's New Deal report.  I see deal 425325 with a loss 
of $236,000, but I don't see deal 425332 with a big positive number

Mr. Germany,

How are things going?  You still pursuing JD's girl?  How's Corey doing?
Did you ever move into the bigger one-bedrooms at Bayou Park?  I hope so --
those studio apartments are too small.  How's Ingrid? doing?

As for myself, I have never been so busy in my life -- papers, group
projects, tests, etc.  I rarely have time to go out, and that really sucks
because the undergraduate women around here are just spectacular.  Granted,
they tend to be a bit bitchy (being rich daddy's girls and all), but they're
very easy on the eyes.  Anyway, if the trend continues, I doubt if I'll be
getting laid much during my two years at Vandy -- too many damn papers to
write!

Let me know how things are going.  I just got an e-mail from Jim; I think
I'll just be starting module 2 around Nov. 4, so I'll see if I can make it
down there.

In the meantime, my address here in Nashville is:

401 Village at Vanderbilt
Nashville, TN  37212
615/ 321-9648

Keep in touch,

Chad     

FINALLY, it's about time we hear from you.

I'm glad you're focused on schoolwork.  That's where your mind should be 
anyway.

I'll plan on seeing you on Nov 4th.

Transco response
Chris, 

I spoke to Rich.? We don't keep records in such a way that would give us the 
temperature at which we restrict Linden.? We determine 
secondary/interruptible space at Linden based on utilization.? Of course 
utilization is ultimately based on temp... but we just don't have an answer 
for you.? Part of the question is, at what temp do northeast LDCs utilize 
their full contract entitlements?

Jerry and I bought motorcycles.  I LIKE!

Are you still looking at getting a camera - an ELPH??  Is that a digital?

You Bet.  I may have you a helmet too.

Call me or Beverly at 853-6357

That contract should also be on the list.  I sent something to VNG about 
that.  I'll follow up on it.  GOT my mototcycle - guess what I did all 
weekend after my little East Texas Trip.

I need to get a tattooee now.

Attached are the purchases and sales with New Power for the month of 
November.  The invoices are on their way, I think it would be easier to sort 
and review the data in excel.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I've never heard from the dude.  I may send him a voicemail.

that goofy financial stuff is impacted please?

Update

Jerry and I went to East Texas this weekend.  we withdrew $750.00 from the 
Fredonia bank and I'm going to deposit that in the Credit Union.  I also took 
the petty funds in the kitchen drawer - $72.00.

AND we did get $2,000.00 deposited into Dad's account from the Credit Union.

Donnie, for July, adjust the Clinton volume to match the purchases from 
Phillips and Power Gas Marketing - DO NOT SEND OUT AN INVOICE ADJUSTMENT.  I 
may need to change the price on the sale to CLINTON so that our receivables 
are netting to 0.

For August, September, October, and November, make the Clinton volumes match 
the Phillips and Power Gas Marketing Supply and DO send an invoice adjustment 
to Clinton.

Paul, let me know if you have questions.  For July, the imbalance is actually 
in CES's pool and I have no idea how to adjust that.  For August forward, I 
believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes 
since the imbalance will be in Clinton's pool.  Let me know if you want to 
make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - I just want these 
deals to go away.  Oh yeah, and make Clinton a lot of money!

MMBTU's?  AND do we back out any gathering charges on this gas?

Gloria G Barkowsky
09/21/2000 02:30 PM
Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is 
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I 
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.  
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of 
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So 
far,
it looks like 07/00 and 08/00.  Thanks, Gloria

Chris -

Do you know the status of the VNG October 2000 confirm sheet that I am 
supposed
to sign?

Don't forget to chat with VNG about Nabisco.  

VNG should have released 700 dth of CGAS capacity to Nabisco effective 
11/1/2000 - 10/31/2001.  Nabisco was not set up as a prearranged bidder at 
the time.  During Nov bidweek for Dec, Nabisco asked me to release the 
capacity.  Since the term was less than 1 year, I couldn't release the 
capacity non-biddable.  I spoke to Jeff Huston about it early last week and 
he said he would get back to me.   Dick suggested I tell you.  TAGG - you're 
it, I will await your command.  Mr. Scott Goodell said we could release the 
capacity for 1 year eff 1/1/2001 and then recall Nov and Dec.

These are the VNG contract numbers on Tenn

gas from Emporti to the VNG citygate.  k#65066, MDQ = 38,000

We can learn  more about this contract later.

Correction deal 418015 is really 418051.

I entered volume and pricing on the following 2 deals in Sitara;

Deal 418015 CNG citygate with Tenn Prod plus transport pricing.

Deal 418065 CGAS citygate with TRCO and CGLF production pricing and Trco, 
CGLF, and CGAS transport pricing (this will take a while to do).

Do we want to turn the auto-confirms OFF?  I think every time I create a VNG 
deal, a confirm is faxed to them.

AND if anyone has a better was of doing the deals ( should we show these as 
production area sales), please let me know.  The easiest way I can come up 
with is to enter the sales at the citygate or storage facility and have most 
of the pricing done in a worksheet.

Robin, this is for the 5500 dth/day baseload sale and the 5500 dth/day put

Bay State did paid for the gas in full.  We were invoicing them the demand 
charge on top of the gas cost. They just did not pay the demand. So they do 
not owe us any of the gas cost.   
Should there be demand charge entery on the purchase side?

When did Bay State bill ENA for this?  And, did Bay State pay there bill for 
gas ENA sold them or did they deduct this from the payment?

It does work out to 5,500 dt per day at $.09.

Hello Chris,
Remember the demand charge that was entered in the sales side that you killed 
about a week ago?(deal # 233091)  Well, the demand charges need to be in the 
purchase side not the sales side.  Per Bay State, Enron should be paying the 
demand charges.  Are they correct???  Bay State is also charging interest for 
late payment.  Please let me know if you need any more information.

Have you been able to figure out if Enron has billed Ashland for Jan, Feb and

RE:  Iroquois' 7th Annual Customer Meeting, October 4-6, 2000
(batchmail 09.21.00)

Just a reminder that TODAY, September 21, 2000 is the cut off date for
hotel reservations at the Mystic Hilton for Iroquois' meeting.

If you haven't done so already, you can make your reservations online
at:

**  http://www.hilton.com/hotels/MYSMHHF/index.html

**  with the hotel directly at 860-572-0731

**  or with Hilton Worldwide at 1-800-HILTONS

Use the group code "IGT" to get the Iroquois rate of $135.  After today
we cannot guarantee room or rate availability.

Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about the the lack of rooms on
Wednesday night at the Hilton.  The golf was originally planned for
Friday afternoon but we had to move it to early Thursday morning because
of the holiday weekend, and could not get additional hotel rooms for
Wednesday night because of another conference.  There are still plenty
of rooms left for Thursday night.

If you are coming on Wednesday night, it is suggested that you make a
reservation at one of the alternate hotels in the area and ask to be
waitlisted for available rooms at the Hilton.  The alternate hotels are
listed on our website at
http://www.iroquois.com/igts/mystic/section-mystic-hotel.html  The first
four properties listed and the Residence Inn are less than a mile from
the Hilton.

While you're at it, if you haven't already RSVP'd for the meeting,
please do so by September 28.  You can register online at
http://www.iroquois.com/mystic.html.  If you have already registered
online and did not receive an e-mail acknowledgment from Lori Rauser,
please phone her at 203-944-7022 to confirm receipt.

Please contact me if you have any problems with accommodations, or any
other questions about the meeting.  We look forward to seeing you in
October.

Russ verified that agency transport capacity deals can be set up in Sitara 
before the agency contract is in Global.  That makes things quicker for Scott 
and I.

Wade, for July and August, give me the actual volumes and price for Phillips 
and Power Gas Marketing behind Peoples.  AND are these volumes MCF's or 
MMBTU's?  AND do we back out any gathering charges on this gas?

Gloria G Barkowsky
09/21/2000 02:30 PM
Chris - this buy/sell deal with Phillips (seller) and Clinton (buyer) is 
causing some
problems for these guys in settlements.  Wade is paying by mcf's, so when I 
change
the volumes for Phillips, it of course effects Donnie's volumes for Clinton.  
Should this
not be done as a buy/sell, or what should we do about this?  I will be out of 
the office
tomorrow, but back on Monday.  Donnie is needing an answer on this soon.  So 
far,
it looks like 07/00 and 08/00.  Thanks, Gloria

Hi there.  We changed our CGAS storage numbers today and we have fixed the 
Sitara deals and worksheet.

Boo

Looks good with the following changes.  If you see these changes come through 
then its good to go.

Thanks

The price on deal 511820 should be $4.7012 not $4.8041, just corrected in 
Sitara.
Added demand charge of $1,233,260 to deal 508891.
Added demand charge of $647,256 to deal 380571.

Don't make any changes for now.  I need to draft a more detailed memo.

   
	
	

Chris,

 On deal #348443 with Clinton Energy, Clinton is showing a volume of 12,800 
dth instead of 12,803 (what we are showing).  Diane Morris at Clinton got 
with her scheduler and he verified that they only received 12,800 dth.  Could 
you please verify our amount and change if necessary?  Let me know what you 
find.  Thanks...

AND, I want to hold back $79,000 of revenue on deal #401601.

The customer price is $5.7025 which is based on the following

Sales Price  $5.4850
Transport to Stoi $.1526  (I included $.0147 too much by accident)
Storge Injection  $.0249
Capacity Demand $.0400

Total Price  $5.7025

We will overinject in October by about 362,000 dth to max out storage by Oct 
31.  Since we will not estimate the transport expense until Oct, I want to 
hold back roughly 362,000 dth x $.2175 = $79,000.00  (close enough).

take the balance to zero in September?

Thanks,

Dick, use this worksheet to calculate NIPSCO's price.

Scott, Dick may have you look at this.  The prices in Column H are for 
capacity demand charges.

Damon just told me he had the numbers wrong.  The FSS balance is 797,464 and 
the ISS balance is (797,771).  This is better.  We need to pay back another 
307 on the ISS and we need to do the inventory transfer.  I know you guys 
will make me proud.

I just received a call from Damon Sykes at National Fuel.  He said we have 
positive balance of 797,464 on our FSS  contract, and we have a balance of 
(797,163) on our ISS.  It looks like we paid back 301 dth too much.

Damon said we need to do a nomination to reverse the storage balances and we 
need to take out the 301 dt.  Would you guys speak to Nat Fuel about handling 
this please?

Don't worry about doing it this weekend, take care of it early next week.

Thanks

However, I will be flying out of Baltimore Monday morning and I'll be 
dressing business causal.  I'm leaving tonight.

Question(s) for VNG as noted by Chris Germany and Steve Gillespie.

Spreadsheet of contracts for review by Victor and Chris before meeting with

Please note:

Because of a shortage of people trading for the east desk on Monday of next 
week, Chris Germany will now take the place of Dan Junek at the Richmond

I will be out this Friday, Next Monday and Tuesday.  Dan will be out Monday 
but I don't know what his role will be with respect to transport anymore.  
Judy is out in the afternoons.  

So, that leave Scott, Vickie, and myself.  Vickie's role has not been fully 
explained to me but I'm sure she will be involved transport somehow.

We'll try for another day.

Jim, deal 226121 is our long term CNG pool sale to EES - the volume is around 
1,000/day each month.

Deal 348393 is our wonderful sale to you behind EOG for July and August.

Whats up?

   
	
	

Chris,

 I have two deals ( #348393 and #226121) that I show were sold to EES that 
EES is not recognizing - they do not have on their books.  Can you either 
send me some support for these deals or get in touch with Jim Barker (with 
EES) and have him enter these pieces on his side?  Let me know if you need 
any other information.  Thanks...

That means you didn't send me the attachment. OR if you did, I don't see it.

Where are the actuals coming from?  Is this someone changing the supply 
matched up with the Clinton deal?

   
	
	

Chris,

 I am showing an adjustment coming through for deal #320094 that is reducing 
the invoice by 1,709 dth (from 13,551 to 11,842).  Clinton already agreed 
with 13,551 dth and paid us as of August 25.  I was wanting to make sure that 
this change is correct.  Could you please look at this for me and let me know 
what you find out?  

I'm here.  Judy and Scott Goodell are out.

I just entered a deal in Sitara (deal 399824).  This is a sale to Transco at 
St 65, 50,000/day on the 18th - 30th.  I also entered a transport usage deal 
399826 for 50,000/day starting on the 18th.  This deal captures the commodity 
cost to go from our St 65 pool to the SIMS pool.

Hi Chris, 

I just called you a while ago and they said you'd call me back.? I may not be 
at my phone when you call because I'm at my other desk for the rest of the 
afternoon.

I called to thank you for the goody package I received this afternoon.? 
Hector likes his golf shirt and my pen and pencil are very nice.? I've 
already tested them both.

I'm going to be visiting the New York customers this week and I'll probably 
take my new pen and pencil with me, if I can figure out a way to cover up the 
Enron part.

Hope you are well.? Let's talk soon so we can act like tomatoes and catchup.? 
:) 

Take care.?? ii 

Below is a parking problem we have with IROQ.  In this example, we were

Just an FYI update on the Iroquois 06/26 parking issue.  This might be 
redundant, but the history is that Iroquois notified us on 07/26/00 that we 
were cut 364 MMBtu's (from 24,502 to 24,138) @ Canajoharie on the evening 
cycle of 06/26/00 (yes, exactly one month lag in notification), & the cut 
volume was placed into PALS.  As I understand it, the late notification was a 
trickle down, i.e. Beth @ CNG notified Iroquois on 07/26, & Iroquois notified 
us when they found out.  Anyway, the 364 MMBtu's are on the August 
Transportation Statement as a beginning balance on 08/01, not withdrawn, 
incurring parking charges of $173.77 for the month (364 MMBtu's x 31 days = 
11,284 MMBtu's @ $0.0154 = $173.77).  Per Angie's previous e:mail on this 
item, it sounds like we've got a problem with the late notification, & this 
parking charge is related, & so, may be disputable.  Either way, the volume's 
currently not in Unify as parked, & will not show up on the Service 
Verification at present.  

Are there any updates to the status on this item?  Thanks.

Brad-

I got your message this morning, and I'm not ignoring you- I have just been 
extremely busy with bid week activities and cleaning for August.  I think I 
know what you're talking about, and I handed that issue over to Chris Germany 
earlier this month.  I have not followed up with it since then, and that is 
my fault.  The main problem I have with this that we were not notified about 
the volume change until later the NEXT MONTH which would not be a timely 
notification by any means.  I think that Chris was looking into this issue 
with Colleen Sulllivan, because of the late notification.  I will badger 
Chris in the morning, but I can't guarantee an answer until later this week 
after the dust has settled from the 1st.  Thanks for understanding.  -Angie

Good job Chris.

My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to 
pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to 
enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also

may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.

TP #6562, North Carolina Nat Gas,  is a true backhaul from the Z6 210 Pool.
TP #6068 is the Trasnco interconnect with Col Gas at Dranesville.  This point

Chris, thanks for the help on Friday.

I got two numbers from Tammi De Paolis.  In her voice message she referred to 
these numbers as meter numbers and then later as transfer point numbers so 
I'm not sure which they are.  One number is 6562 and the other is 6068 
(Public Serv. NC).

From this information can you determine whether these points are on the 
Transco mainline or a lateral off the mainline?

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for 8/1and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\May_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a duplicate
copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'Comments':   Contains comments on selected items on various days.

Crystal confirmed that items coded as a demand charge on physical forward 
deals in the "External Column" do not show up in our P&L.

Example:  See deal 113266, sale to Reliant.  I was concerned that we would 
double dip the reimbursements for transport demand charges if I show 
reimbursements on the transport sheet and we include the reimbursements on 
the Physical Forward sale as well.

Vickie gave me an open season notice on Transco's Momentum Expansion 
Project.  Bids are due Thursday, Sep 29th.  Momentum is expected to be in 
service by 5/1/2003.

Shippers can elect the following receipt points, St 65, St 85, or Destin.  
The primary delivery point is St 165.  The minimum term is 15 years.  I will 
still be here doing transport.

This impacts the following deals in Sitara, 

Deal 222734 - purchase from Alliance
Deal 265943 - purchase from Meng

I changed the formula on the IF-CNRGATH curve in the EastMrkt file.  Before 
the change it was CGT/APPALAC - $.32.  After the change its (CGAS - 
$.30)x(1-.0492).  This widens the spread by about $.24.

I justed asked dick, vickie is taking over Dan's job.  Does that mean 
transport??? EOL??? dick doesn't know.

We must have lucked out in June because the commodity variance in June for

I just entered a commodity rate on deal 299159.  It has very big volumes on 
it each month and there has not been a commodity rate on it.  Joanne just 
verified that this is regular transport, not Dayton or CALP.  This will be a 
big OA variance for June - August.

Angie, these volumes may go up.  I think Tenn is still trying to balance the

billed for storage deliveries please?   

You are funny.  I laughed for 5 min when I saw this.

I may need you to help turn the chicks... you guess which kind!!

I'm there!

               It's a Party and You're Invited

      Occasion:  Farewell Party - Joni Veselack
      Day:     Sunday, September 10
      Time:    4:00 p.m.
      Place:   Woods on Augusta (pool area)

     I'm heading up north and didn't want to leave without having one
last get together around the pool!!! So, I decided to fire up the grill and
bbq.  I will have some snacks along with the bbq, but any side dishes or
desserts will definitely be enjoyed by one and all.

     Please bring your own "Cheer".

     Also, I need a head count for how much bbq to buy. (Get your minds

I changed deals 268090 and 268093 effective 9/7/2000.  We plan to have 
storage maxed out by 9/30/2000 and there will be no injections for October.

Comments, questions??  Will this cause any problems with the Choice program 
in October?

What are deal tickets 299159 and 299192?

I'm looking for an invoice from El Paso Field Services for July 2000 
production.  The rate should be $.05 and the volume should be around 37,000.

Have you seen such a thing?

I'm all over it.  I have 2 plane tickets, one for Monday evening, the 18th, 
at 5:20pm and one for Tuesday morning,  19th, at 6:45am.  Knowing what a 
wonderfull morning person you are, I will probably leave Monday evening.

AND I will be in town next weekend.  Who is giving you a pool party??

Just hope you hadn't flaked out yet.

How was East/West Texas this past weekend?? I bet it was extremely hot.

I got the okay on bringing the cat up here!!! Only $250 cat deposit.

If you are in town next Sunday, September 10th. We are having a BBQ, "going
away" thing at my pool around 4 pm. I do need you to come by before we leave
on Friday, September 15th... to get a packing strategy... I think I'm good
to go... but since you have more experience at this... I'll take your
advice.

Thanks.

With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more 
critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we 
are buying.  Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the 
points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.  I would 
prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the 
delivery points.

I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the 
month.  Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt 
and delivery point on the contract.  But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it 
and I am unable to verify the information myself.  It could have a big impact 
on what we flow in Z6.

Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?  Let 
me know if you need specific capacity examples.

Opps.  I made an error.  This is a Sep 2000 contract.  I changed the term on 
deal from 6/1/2000 - 9/30/2000 to 9/1/2000 - 9/30/2000.

We have a new Transco 6-6 contract.

Term  9/6 - 9/30
Contract # 3.6878
MDQ  4,752
Rec  Leidy #6161
Del  Mainline BG&E #7221 (Non New York)

Please enter this on the morning sheet.

Thanks

I just noticed that ENA is still agent for CES and CEM on Transco.  If we no 
longer have a need to be agent, I think we should terminate those agencies.  
What do you think?

You need to give me a boottle in a  brown bag.

There are a ton of parks around with nice, little benches.

I thought I would sleep in the car, or maybe a shelter.

So where are you going to stay... the floor is available.... it's got
carpet.

I really appreciate your help!!!!!!!!!!!!

I reserved a one-way ticket on Continental last night for 6:45am Tuesday,
19th.  It cost $263.00 and its completly refundable.  Sounds good to me.
I told the reservation lady that I was thinking about buying 2 tickets and
just get my money back for the one I don't use.  I would buy one leaving
Monday evening and the one for Tuesday morning

COOL, don't you think?

Sorry... I didn't call last night.

I was working on my September spreadsheet for TCO at home. I was going to
take a break and call you and my parents... but I had to get the
spreadsheet
done for the long weekend. I finished it at 1:30 am. Thought this would be
too late to call.

Hopefully the weekend scheduling goes smooth, so I can work on August
Accounting this afternoon. I'm just extemely slow at everything right now.

Chris,
Most companies send us their fixed-price bidweek data in this format. It's 
more
accurate since we just have to transfer the data instead of retyping 
everything
into our master database. It also saves time on days like today when we have 
to
turn everything over in a day. Anyone with questions can give me a call --
thanks!!

My only comment to this is to please make sure the contracts have IMNE and 
IMME as desks since most of them will be market area deliveries.  They are
already in Unify and the multiple desks may be all we need to path them.  The 
Transco schedulers are also going to have to know the receipt and delivery
points that are primary for all these contracts with Transco changes among 
other things.

As most of us are aware, Trasnco will be terminating all master commodity 
contracts effective 9/1/2000.  I don't think we should make any changes to 
the master contracts in our system until after the 1st.  However, we will 
need start adding the demand contracts to the East and Market East in 
Sitara.  Following is a list of master contracts and the associated demand

Wade, I have decided that everything currently in our system is incorrect.  
Please set up a meeting with all the people shown above and we will discuss 
how to correctly handle this in our system.  We also have some other supply 
behind the LDC that we might as well handle correctly.  
Wade, while we are at it, do you want us to look at NYSEG, CPA, and East 
Ohio??? Any others?

People I need in attendance
Mary Theresa or Jeanne
Steve Gillespie
Angie
Sylvia Campos (or someone from the contracts group)

This is what I'm thinking, everyone please think about this before we meet.
I think I will have Peoples set up as a pipeline and we will move all the 
deals to this new pipeline.  
Steve, get the Peoples password from Angie.  I need you to go into escript 
(Angie can help you with this) and run anything you can get out of this 
system.  These are actually CES passwords.  It is my intention to use this 
information to set up transport or pooling contracts in Sitara.

   
	
	

Phillips Production has/had two seperate PNG deals:
 1.  500 MCFD; $2.82/MCF; 1/1/00 - 6/30/00
 2.  300 MCFD;  $2.95/MCF;  1/1/00 - 11/30/00
To my knowledge, PNG does not send out production information to either the 
producer or the pool operator.  This information should be available on 
E-Script.
 Phillips gets their production volumes (which they use to create our 
invoice) from the company integrating the meter charts.  I beleive that this 
is the same information provide to PNG.
John

   
	
	

Wade,  Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. But I need help 
understanding this one.  We have a process already to handle John's behind 
the citygate deals  

Since, the actual scheduling is done by CES in Virginia,  we never nominate 
this gas nor do we see actuals.  We hear about them from John and Terry and 
we are supposed to get confirms from the producer and CES.  Whenever one of 
these deals occurs, we have buys from the producer and sales to CES to 
account for these transactions internally.

It's my understanding that whenever John cuts one of these behind the 
citygate deals;  that Terry puts it into Sitara for him.  The offset also 
entered by Terry  is a sale to CES (Now the New Power Company effective Sept. 
1) with commercial (usually Chris Germany) confirming the sale price.  Angie 
schedules it in Unify under CNG and we create, track and balance like usual. 

Is that not the case here?  Is this something that's getting reconciled in 
Jeanne and Terry's project for CNG???

By cc: Angie, please get with Terry /Jeanne and Chris to help Wade.  THANKS!  
Please keep me abreast of the status.

ENA is being invoiced by Phillips Production Company for production on  
Dominion Transmission (CNG) via Peoples Natural Gas.  This is 
behind-city-gate gas that we do not get documents supporting the volumes. I 
have invoices and production statements from Phillips.  

Per John Singer Notes Mail of 08/23 concerning the July production," Phillips 
Production / Peoples: Price:  @ $2.95/Mcf  Term:  1/1/2000 - 11/30/2000 Est. 
Volume:  500/MCFD  (Actual Volume will vary.)   I have no way of verifying 
the actual volume.  Chris Germany and Angie Zeman will try to get into CES's  
PNG pool via E-Script.  This may be the only way to verify actual volumes.  I 
have a call into Phillips to see if they might have a pipeline statement 
verifying volumes."  Joihn's call to Phillips read partially,  " I just 
talked to Sam Fragale @ Phillips.  The 7,843 Mcf @ $2.95 is ENA's. "

Our deals have been using point 20200 on Dominion Transmission (CNG).  Deals 
for Jan 00 - Mar 00 were 210359 and 210364.  These were copied to 226543 and 
229733 respectively for April 00 forward  Deal 226543 has April 00 only, but 
should probably be extended through June-00 according to deal notes from John.

Hopefully this is the final version for September FOM volumes.  See the 
comments dated 8/30/00 identifying the changes.

Call me at 713-345-7692 if you have questions.

David

Uhhhh - - - - - - -  Yea.  Whoo Hooo.  Hold me back.   I feel the excitement.

Just kidding, hope your day is full of wonders!!!

My flight is early Saturday morning... September 2nd. I should be home by 10
am. I leave late Monday night, 7 pm. I'll just catch a cab at the airport on
September 2nd and will probably leave my car at the airport on September
4th.

Thanks again for everyone looking after my cat. If the sale of my condo goes
as plan... I probably be back in Houston the following weekend to pack and
ship my stuff to Maryland. As these plans materialize, I'll let you know.

Alma, please continue to park in my space. I know you will have a rough
couple of months with your foot surgery. I'll just use your spot when I'm
home.

Thanks for everything... I'm so excited to come home!!!

The PPL contract number for September is 523489, volume= 2,400.

Dick wants to over inject as much as possible for the holiday weekend.  I 
adjusted the deal tickets in Sitara.  We will inject 31,463 on the 1st, and 
31454 on the 2nd-5th.  Our injections drop to 25172 on the 6th.

Colleen, we still show the 1,000 dt/day of Equitrans capacity on our CES (now 
New Power) sheet.  Do you know if CES ever agreed to take this contract?

I need a volunteer.  The "Vol" will be responsible for pricing all of The New 
Power deals in the market area.   99% of this activity takes place on CGAS.  

Who wants it?  Certain people have expressed an interest in learning  more 
about pricing, Tricia Spence, Joe Casas, and Beverly  Beaty.

I estimate it will take about 15 minites a day during the month, and about 
4-6 hours during bidweek.  I also believe this deal will go away effective 
4/1/2001.

Pros
Will learn the concept of a physical bookout - will become a Sitara pricing 
guru like myself.
Will learn a great deal about transport pricing.
May lead into executing capacity on CGLK and CGAS - I will not turn this over 
until I am satisfied with the Vol's performance on pricing. 
Can easily be done after the work day crunch (this may be a pro or a con)
Will learn more about the pricing curves and how physical deals impact the 
desk P&L.

Cons
Somewhat tedious - not as bad as it used to be.
May have to anwser Dick Jenkins questions.  
I will have to assign this to Scott or Vickie if I don't get a volunteer.
I will do the training - possibly in the evening or on the weekend, AND I'm 
very detail oriented.
I will provide feedback on this persons progress and I take this part of the 
job very serious.

I made a few small changes to the storage balances on CGAS.  I had to create 
a new deal ticket starting Sep 1st because the name changed from CES to "The 
New Power Company".

Joanne,  I made a change to Aug 31st.

Kyle, I think you need to change tagg.  

Let me know if anyone has questions.

Just double checking my numbers, this is what I now show on COH storage.  Let 
me know if I need to tweak it and where.

Con Ed released Transco space to EES.  The offer # is 21535, volume = 10,0000 
dth, demand charge = $1.50, term = 9/1/2000 - 9/30/2000.

Con Ed did the release pre arranged, non-biddable. 

Paul, you should be able to execute this space before 9:00 am and re-release 
it to me (company #7973).  

thanks.

Kimat, I think either 226553 or 372096 + 227882 should be taken to 0 for 
September.  I'm taking deal 226553 to 0 for now.

I changed the demand charge for Equitrans k#270 on the Aug and Sep 
worksheet.  Would you let me know what the capacity deal tickets are and I 
will change Sitara as well.

thanks

I just spoke with the lawyer.  We can't do anything until the end of 
September.  Then, if no one contest the will, I will go to court on a Friday 
morning and be appointed executor.  She said there needs to be 2 witnesses ( 
and the sons count, so does Mary) to testify that the signature on the will 
is Dad's.

Scott Hendrickson sold the 10,000 month of Power Gas Marketing supply behind 
East Ohio to EES (deal 380671) for the term of the deal.  The price is CNG 
index flat, and the term is 9/1/2000 - 10/31/2000.

I must have deleted the GRI memo I had.  Sorry about that.

Kimat, I copied Sep forward on deal 202939 to deal 380571 and changed the 
counterparty to new power.

Hey woman, how much vacation do I have left BEFORE i fill out a timesheet for 
the 2nd part of August?

The Power Gas Marketing supply for Sep is 3,000 DTH.

Kimat, It looks like we have some deals booked twice.  Take a look at my 
worksheet.  All volumes are monthly, positive is supply, negative is a sale.  
Also, I believe deals 231667 and 226703 should be moved to New Power.

What about deal 202939?  Normally, I move this deal to CGAS and its very 
confusing the way I do it.

Ignore my previous email.  For now, just book out deal 372088 with deals 
229344 and 229357.

Some questions about the 1st.

Per the proxy, we should be injecting 26,219 dt/day into storage.  You are 
showing 36,304 dt/day on the FOM sheet.  AND I see a citygate load of 29,461 
dt/day.

This morning Tim Ray sold Dick 23,060 dt/day at the pool.  Is this to reduce 
the citygate load or is this additional New Power supply?

On September 26-28, Temmessee is doing work at the Lockport compressor 
station, which is accross the river from Transcanada.  This work will impact 
the amount of gas Nat Fuel can receive from TCPL at Niagara.  Max capacity is 
around 429,000 dth.  During the work, the estimated capacity wil be 300,000 
dth.  Nat Fuel will have to cut firm shippers.

429,000 300,000

jporte1@columbiaenergygroup.com on 08/23/2000 01:27:23 PM

We need to reach an agreement on the theoretical storage as CES needs to
transfer to NPC a specific volume and price for COH, and AGL ESS, WSS and
Sonat. I had thought we had an understanding that CES would be billed, per
Melissa's memo of 3/15 and conversations during June, the percentages times
the
current month's storage capacity. We may have confused you by sending FOM
noms
for storage injections that were different than that formula, and Doug has
noticed the bills from ENA tend to represent the noms.

How should this be resolved? Should we go on ENA billed volumes or by the
formula? Let me know.
My calculations per the formula would give us the following balances for
7/31/00...
COH-4,053,906
AGL-Sonat- 504,379
AGL-ESS-9,827
AGL-WSS-220,209

Good job Chris.

My contact at Iroq is out of the office.  When she gets back, I will agree to 
pay $10,153.82 per my worksheet.  Let me know what would be the best way to 
enter this in Sitara.  I think she is back in the office next week.  I also 
think she will agree to my numbers just to get this resolved.  However, she 
may just want us to pay what I think we owe while she does her own research.  

Comments?

Hi Team.  I just want to make sure everyone gets this message.  Effective 
September 1, we will be using "The New Power Company" in sitara.  All 
existing deals will need to be changed to "The New Power Company" in sitara. 

If you enter deals in the sitara or you find an existing deal with the 
counterparty "Columbia Energy Services", please change the counterparty to 
"The New Power Company".

Let me express my deepest condolences to you in the loss of your father.

I lost my mother three months ago, and the suddeness, starkness and size of 
the loss remains with me. 

Please understand I care for you as a friend, and I pray you will be as 
strong as ever soon.

Clayton

Angie, would you go into Unify on July 31st and change the pathed volume to 
Clinton from 430 to 651 please - this should make the total volume = 13,551.  
Change the supply from Phillips to balance out the transaction.

   
	
	

Chris,

 I just finished talking with you about a deal that we sold to Clinton Energy 
Management (Deal #320094).  The volume that we have in our system has a 
volume of  13,330 MMBtu and it should be 13,551 MMBtu @ 4.56 (We only need to 
change the volume).  Could you please change this as soon as possible so that 
I can get a corrected invoice to them?  Let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks...

AND my COH balance effective 7/31/2000 is 4,053.932 ( a difference of 26dt's).

Use the "Daily Activity" worksheet in this file.  The CES storage balance as 
of 7/31/2000 is 4,053,932 dth (see balance in cell L146).  The actual sale to 
CES for the storage injections is deal 268094 - this deal shows the daily and 
monthly activity.

If I remember correctly, the only confusion we had on the TCO storage was the 
beginning balance.  There was 170,981 dth in storage on March 31st.  To 
correct for this, we adjusted the injections for April so that the balance on 
April 30th was 13%.

Let me know if you have questions.

I'm not above groveling for affection.

try my sheet again, it is adjusted to pool and the 1st is still good. Since 
COH is the only TCO market with any swing, I am sticking with those to 
calculate. We look 5,000 off on 2 & 3. 
I have 41,858(FOM)+15,000 (NP Buy)-53,798(TCO usage)=(3,060) sell to NPC.
These were TCO totals but my COH numbers on 2 & 3 match, adjusted for F% to 
pool.

I didn't buy it yet.   But I going to take a serious look at it.

Did you buy it?   Remember, I'll look after you buy.   Computer on my Jeep 
died,
after market security knocks the cotton pickers out.  New computer cost 
$535.00,
I found a used one for $250   MMMM, four down Nissan pickup beginning to look

I think selling the Power Gas Marketing gas to EES behind EOG is working well 
(other than the price).  I would like to sell it to EES for the term of the 
deal.  You have not sold it to anyone have you?  If not, I'm going to try to 
sell it to EES for the term.  And if I remember correctly, the volume is 
10,000/month and the term is 10/31/2000, correct?

a volume of 497,015.  I think this  was loaded back from Unify.  Can we get 
that fixed?

Doug, we billed you incorrectly for June on the CGAS storage.  We should have 
billed you for 1,089,289 but we only entered 497,015 in our system.  We will 
get that fixed.

dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 08/17/2000 07:44:41 AM
Scott and Chris--Yesterday, I asked Scott if you guys could provide me with a
summary of the volumes of gas sold to CES during April, May, June, and July 
for
the theoretical storage services under our 12/99 Agreement with ENA.   
Attached
is a file that I prepared showing the theoretical storage injections for the 4
storage services as they appear on ENA's monthly invoices.   I note that the
June injection for the TCO storage appears to be only about half of what we
requested and what appears in our GMS system.  My ultimate objective here is 
to
provide The New Power Company with  definitive estimates of the end-of-July
inventories (including left-over inventory from last winter) as well as the
volumes "injected" in July alone.  I hope the attached file helps.   If we
could get this resolved next week, that would be great.

I just purchased 35000 day for Sat, Sun and Mon from New Power (deal 525128) 
at $8.40.  Bookout with deal 525121 (sale at IF + .0125).

Hey Doug, I'm back in the office for awhile.  Let me know if you still have 
questions.

dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 08/07/2000 01:21:57 PM
Chris--In addition to my question regarding the AGL-related "transportation
adjustment" charges in the June 15, 2000 invoice for May 2000 (invoice #
11738SA), can you also please check on the 200,000 dth sold to CES at the TENN
Bear Creek storage facility in June?   (SA-236411).   Is this gas related to
one of the so-called pre-pay deals (TEAC, MGAM, MGAG)?  If not, what is it 
for,
because we have not requested that any gas be injected into the Tennessee
storage for this injection season.

Thanks.

My only comment to this is to please make sure the contracts have IMNE and 
IMME as desks since most of them will be market area deliveries.  They are
already in Unify and the multiple desks may be all we need to path them.  The 
Transco schedulers are also going to have to know the receipt and delivery
points that are primary for all these contracts with Transco changes among 
other things.

We sold directly to Clinton for the term of our deals.  Clinton (Latrove) 
should have pulled directly from Power Gas Marketing's pool.  The Power Gas 
Marketing supply deal ends Oct 31st and the local production deal ends Nov 
30th and then we will be out of the local production business.  We've tried 
to tell everyone but I bet you still get phonecalls until we are out of it.  
Sorry.

Did we end up doing this deal or did you sell directly to Clinton?  I'm 
thinking that you sold directly to Clinton....  Let me know.  Thanks!  md

Paul is out of the office today but I found the customer name in my notes - 
it was right below all my notes on CanFibre.  The customer is Latrove Steel.  
I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works.  Does anyone object 
to that?  I will wait until this afternoon before I call.

Heidi
Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?  If 
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.  However, we 
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Marde L Driscoll@EES
06/21/2000 08:29 PM
Questions that I have:
1)  I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool.  It 
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the 
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these 
types of noms.)  This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas 
behind the gate and we don't need more production.  If the customer can't 
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will 
only make my pool longer.

2)  If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest 
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3)  Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount 
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?  

4)  If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be 
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with 
PNG.

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction 
from Phillips Production Company.  This volume is will be decreased  until 
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the 
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule).  There 
are 7 Phillips meters  in CES's pool beginning July 2000.  Heidi Boyd @ CES 
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool 
until the meters are moved.  EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in 
their pool beginning July 2000.

2.  See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.  

Note:  PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the 
system.  Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force 
Majeure.  Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd 
volume.

Chris Germany@ECT
06/20/2000 03:59 PM
Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this 
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works 
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  
If yes, how many meters?

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will 
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this.

	
	

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to 
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost 
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

If this is for a volume of about 10,000 Dth it is a pool-to-pool transfer 
from ENA (we are transferring this gas from Power Gas Marketing's pool).  
When ENA purchased CES's book of business they acquired local production 
behind the citygate.  This is one of those deals.  I did this deal with Chris 
Germany of ENA.  If you need more information please let me know.  Thanks!  md

Hey buddy, can you just send me $20.00???  I won't be around for the happy 
hour.

James R Barker@EES
08/10/2000 10:45 AM
We haven't had the Thursday happy hour in a few weeks, so let's meet at the 
Gingerman tonite after work.  Barry has the first round!!!!

Please forward to anyone I missed.

I don't think we will be able to do any payback at Niagara or Tenn/E Aurora 
on the National Fuel deal.  After adjusting for what we took out today, we 
owe Nat Fuel about 88,500 dth.

Here are the points that I believe will work best

Tenn/Colden (meter #060003)  Tenn Zone 5 close to the Niagara Spur - we can 
use Dracut supply or Iroq/Wright supply.
Tenn/Lamont (meter #020072)  Tenn Zone 4 - we can use Cook School for this or 
Dan can flow long haul - Cook School is baseloaded into CNG.
Trco/Leidy - we currently have 1,000 dth from CGAS going into CNG - we can 
redirect this to Nat Fuel at no additional cost.

Thanks for pointing this out.  To my knowledge we have never even tried to 
overlap the contract or do any segmenting.  

   

Any concerns to forward to Becky Cantrell by Friday the 11th of Aug.???? We 
currently only have a 2017 dkt/d term contract #125005, a 35,465 dkt/d term 
contract #125008, an IT contract and a parking and loaning contract to handle 
our Canadian term supply.  We typically transport to markets off Iroquois, to 
Tennnessee pipeline and CNG pipeline.  That is a simplified summary of our 
daily activity on Iroquois.  If you need any information, please let me 
know.  

As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago, 
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented 
capacity.  Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the 
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement 
shipper.  Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not) 
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible.  For instance, 
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the 
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy 
to complete within GISB timelines.

Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on 
Iroquois' system?  Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?

Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments 
on this issue.  I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

Thanks.

Hey buddy.  I would love to take a tour.  I'm tied up with a family illness 
for the next couple of weeks so don't wait on me.

Great Idea though.

Yesterday I was getting ready to fly out of Fletcher's at Hobby airport when 
a man asked if I was with Enron (he saw my United Way shirt most of us were 
wearing yesterday).  He said that he too was an Enron employee but had missed 
the United Way kick-off event.  He told me he was one of our corporate pilots 
and we spoke for several minutes since I had someone waiting at Houston 
Southwest airport to pick me up.  

I asked if I might arrange with him to get a tour of our corporate hanger and 
airplanes and he said he would be glad to arrange such an event.  I told him 
that several of us pilots at Enron might be interested.  He gave me his card 
and said that he had a trip for Tuesday but to just call him when we were 
ready and he would arrange to make it happen.  Soooo... If you are interested 
or know others who might be, let me know some times and dates and we will 
make this happen.

Please send those to Scott Goodell and he will get them to the right person.  
I believe ENA should be paying all those bills effective 1/1/2000.

Chris,

   Columbia Marketing has some outstanding invoices from Jan - Mar of this 
year
for gathering and processing charges against contract 50140 IGS.  I talked 
with
Doug Kinney at CES, and he referred me to you.  Should Enron be paying these
charges?  Do you need me to send copies of the invoices to you, or do you have
an accounting contact for me?

   Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated.

   PS  Credit tells me that the Jan Gulf invoice is outstanding, also.

ENA was not  making payments to Statoil so CES made the payments.  Let me

Please include Scott Goodell on all responses.

Here's how I spent my weekend.  What did you do?

Mary

I took off all last week.  Chad was married last Saturday, and I spent the 
rest of the week at Dad's and the hospital.

I talked to Jerry today - He has been up there since last Wednesday.  The Dr. 
said Pops has anywhere from 2 weeks to 1 month.  They are taking him out of 
the hospital tomorrow or Wed.  I'll be going up there quite a bit for a while.

There is nothing wrong with a good heart attack.

This deal (#227738) was booked in our system on Jan 17th.  According to my 
notes, this is an "unwind" for AK Steel.  It was done as a physical fixed 
price deal and it goes through September.  The volume is 5,000 per month for 
April through August and 20,000 per month for September.

CES sold the physical gas back to ENA.  The only gas CES has are the Exhibit 
1 volumes.  So I created a sell (#226553) to CES for the same volume at a  
price of IF CGAS + $.0075.

The deal numbers for March are 157559 and 205228.

dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 08/03/2000 06:57:54 AM
Chris--There is a recurring set of monthly transactions on ENA's invoices that
I don't recognize.  Perhaps you can help me understand what they are.   In 
each
case, CES is invoiced for purchasing approximately 4,000 to 5,000 Dth/month at
TCO pool at an IF TCO Appl index price.   The Sitara # for this transaction is
SA-226553.  Then, this same monthly volume is re-purchased by ENA at a fixed
price.  The Sitara # for the "buy-back" is SA-227738.

Do these transactions have something to do with the physical gas that we have
purchased from ENA for our retail customer retention activities?

Thanks.

Why yes we do and here it is.  We create a new worksheet each month.  The 
worksheet you are looking for is "Rates".  Assume the rate you are looking at 
is FT unless specified otherwise.   And, depending on what you are looking 
at, we may not have GRI included in the surcharges.  The password to modify 
is the filename "2000tran08".

   

Hey Chris,

Remember me????  I was wondering if you have an excel file where you keep
track of all the rates and fuels for your desk. If you do....can I get a copy.
I have my old one for
the Central desk pipelines but one for the NE would help. 

I was planning to create one of my own, but I figured why 'reinvent the 
wheel.'

Thanks

Here is what I think we have for August

892510  16136  Penn Fuel capacity - Access to M3
892511  7426  Penn Fuel capacity - Access to M3

892875  9496  Access to M3

892872  18705  Access to M2
893741  5000  Access to M2

Now the really bad contract
Offer #17378 from Nat Fuel.  Judy or Scott will need to tell you the contract 
number on this one.  There seems to be a really big difference between 
Ela/Etx and M1.  I think you can physically flow 5000 to 8000 from Access to 
M2.

this is an in-ground storage transfer.  Jeff is faxing me the form to

Willard Kinzer, via his wholly owned LDC Belfry Gas, has 142/day of firm 
transport available on 8/1/2000 for one year, which delivers into TCO.  He 
has released and sold this in the past, as he has his own supply that he uses 
to feed his Belfry Gas market.  (Kinzer is the largest independent producer 
in Kentucky, with about 18,000/day).

His agent, Milton Beattie, would like to know if we want to bid on this small 
piece of firm transport.  He  can be reached at 1-606-679-8812.

Call me or him if interested, and either way, please let me know.

East Ohio
I created deal 348393 (sale to EES).  This deal should get matched with the 
purchase from Power Gas Marketing, deal 264613 for July and August.  The deal 
volume is 10,000 for the month.  We have the Power Gas deal thru October.  We 
still need to sell Sep and Oct to someone.

I noticed the volume for July in Power Gas Marketing is 0, so I entered an 
expected volume of 0 on the EES deal.  I didn't want to mess anything up so 
close to nom time.  Please put 10,000 for the month on both deals for July.

Thanks.

Peoples
I changed the volume on deal 264595 to 3500 for the month.  This volume 
fluctuates each month and John Singer will tell us the actual volume.  This 
deal also goes through October.

We are buying local production from Phillips Production Company.  I did not 
see a deal in the system for August so I created 348434, the price needs to 
be corrected.  This deal goes through November.  The estimated volume for 
August is 300 per day, this volume also fluctuates each month..

We are selling all gas behind Peoples to Clinton, deal 348443.  The price on 
this deal is CNG IF per mcf.  Clinton will pay us based on actuals.

Let me know if anyone has questions.

Donnie, I prepared this email a couple weeks ago but was unable to send it 
because of email problems.  It was in my "save as a draft" folder.

ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14.  
The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a 
purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put 
in some of the buy/sale activity.

My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright 
one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days 
we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at 
Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add 
another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy

try my sheet again, it is adjusted to pool and the 1st is still good. Since 
COH is the only TCO market with any swing, I am sticking with those to 
calculate. We look 5,000 off on 2 & 3. 
I have 41,858(FOM)+15,000 (NP Buy)-53,798(TCO usage)=(3,060) sell to NPC.
These were TCO totals but my COH numbers on 2 & 3 match, adjusted for F% to 
pool.

Chris, 

I created two CES purchase tickets to offset the sales in TRCO Z6 that we are 
not obligated to deliver.  THe ticket numbers are:  345235 and 345230.  I am 
not sure about the pricing on these deals, you might want to take a look at 
them.  If you change something, that is fine, just so that the total volume 
is 494 per day.

Thanks,
Vicki

August 12th is open for rafting.  The Royle Gorge section will be low,
so we do not have to rent wetsuits.  But, you can if you want to.  The
price is $86.89/person.  If we get 12 or more people it's $78.20/person.

I have not heard from all of you yet, so please let me know if you are
interested.  Mary is looking into the camp site.

I'll send another e-mail soon with updates.  :-)

I heard from Algon yesterday on those contracts I said not to pay.  We made a 
mistake releasing the capacity so ENA will be responsible for the charges.  I 
do not want to bill CES for these charges since we made the mistake.  This 
should only be a problem for May and June, I think.

Please pay the disputed amounts.

I owe you big time.

Send me a bill.

The attached file contains CES's first-of-the-month daily volume requirements
for August 2000.  This request is submitted 3 business days prior to NYMEX
close for the month of August.   The file contains volumes to be delivered to
the citygate as well as volumes to be injected into storage consistent with 
the
theoretical storage injection schedule.

Please note that for the month of August '00 CES is not purchasing additional
volumes of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate 
deal,
as was done in June and July.   Also, CES is not ordering any volumes in 
August
for Honeywell (formerly Allied Signal) which ceased to be a CES customer at 
the
end of March 2000.

Please call me if you have questions or problems with the attached request.

Mike, here is the worksheet.  The 2 tabs you need to use are "CES Retail 
East" and "CES Retail Mrkt".  Also, CGAS contract #67693 goes from 54,327 dt 
per day to around 108,000 dth per day starting Oct 1.

dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 07/24/2000 04:33:06 PM
Chris--Yes, you may provide the subject information to Mr. Garred.

Thanks.

Chris.Germany@enron.com on 07/24/2000 04:08:02 PM
Please respond to Chris.Germany@enron.com

As we discussed on the phone, Mike Garred with CES is requesting a copy of the
CES demand charge sheet.  Please let me know if you approve.

It probably was and at this point I don't know what is and isn't in the 
system.

   
	
	

Chris,

Do you know if all this gas was simply turned around and sold to CES?  And do 
you know if we have made any progress on getting these deals into the system?
	
	

FYI - John Singer wants us to pay this based on volume he is providing in a 
spreadsheet.  To do thatm, Gloria will have to put this in Unify, and won't 
have true pipe support.  Are you comfortable with that?
	
	

Attached is the backup fro the Jan, Feb and Mar for Belden & Blake's NYSEG 
invoices.  I created these spreadsheets from the information given me by 
Heidi Boyd, who was the person nominating this gas for CES.  Belden & Blake 
invoiced ENA base on these spreadsheets.
 The NYSEG gas is a back to back purchase/sale to CES.  There should be a 
deal for the sale in the system for the sale.  Check with Chris Germany.
There are three price scenarios for the gas.  Should there be a spereate  
deal for each price? 
John

Chris,

How the hell are you?

Hope all is well.

I was wondering if you could forward to me a list of all of the pipeline 
capacity and storage assets that you have on behalf of CES.  I am in the 
process of setting up New Power on the respective pipes.

Credit is an issue.  To better know how much credit NPC needs, I thought it 
would be good to see how much FT CES gets on each pipe.
  
Do you maintain a spreadsheet similar to the one you used to maintain for 
EES' assets?

Can you tell what I have?  Make sense?

Thanks.

Add the demand to the commodity, that's comes out to $.0505, there is your 
nickle.  However, being that we work for a marketing company and recognize 
the value of fuel, we take that into consideration.  The pipelines don't 
usually.

   
	
	

I thought that Carolyn Turner  said her minimum would be a nickel??????

Bids close at 9:00 am on the 26th.  The start date is the 27th.  Currently 
there are no bids ( Scott and I will get with Dick this afternoon).  The min 
demand is $1.0587 which works out to be about $.035 per dth.  The commodity 
is $.0155 (no GRI) and fuel is around $.09 at $4.00.

How impersonal and Late so first - my apologies.  No excuses but this week 
has been unbelievable.  

I hope that you had an incredible Birthday - I guess you started early since 
I did try to call on Frid.  I hope it was fun.

I bought my self a new BD car!  Kind of exciting.

Today a few of us in my group are headed to the London office! So In my haste 
I wanted to be sure and at least send you a belated birthday wish.

Hi Gang.  Transco has a shipper meeting next week in the afternoon.  I will 
probably be out all week.  I believe Scott Goodell and Beverly should go and 
take anyone else that would like to attend.

RE: Modifications to Capacity Release Processes and Segmentation
and Order 637 Compliance filings

On June 30, 2000 Transco made a compliance filing with the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in Docket No. RP00-17-000.
This filing proposed several changes to the Capacity Release and
capacity segmentation procedures that are to become effective for
business beginning gas day September 1, 2000.  A customer meeting
will be held in Washington DC on August 1, 2000 at 10:00 a.m.
(please see the Transit posting dated July 14, 2000) and in Houston
on August  3, 2000 at the Williams Tower, Level 5, Dining Room C
at 1:00 p.m.  The Houston meeting will address both the segmentation
changes and highlights of Transco's Order 637/637A Compliance filing,
with segmentation being discussed from 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. and the
Order 637 discussed from 3 p.m. - 5 p.m.  In order to finalize
the appropriate arrangements for the meeting, Transco requests
that you notify Liz Laurel at 713-215-2069 by Monday,
July 31, 2000.

There are two key elements to the proposed changes
in Docket RP00-17-000:
1.  Use of "Master" FT-R Commodity Contracts
Transco will no longer use the "Master" Commodity Form of Service
Agreement for reservation rate capacity releases.  Historically,
Transco has required capacity release shippers to execute two FT-R
contracts upon their initial acquisition of released capacity:
the FT-R Demand contract and the FT-R "Master" Commodity contract.
With subsequent reservation rate releases, shippers were only
required to execute new FT-R Demand contracts.  Each FT-R Demand
contract was specific to a capacity release deal and the FT-R
"Master" Commodity contract was used for all nomination and
commodity billing purposes.

Effective with business for gas day September 1, 2000, Transco will
require shippers acquiring capacity through reservation rate
capacity releases to execute and nominate transportation on each
new FT-R Demand contract.  This will require new activities to be
created for each capacity release contract.  For any capacity release
deals that span the August 31 - September 1 period, nominations for
gas day August 31, 2000 will be on the existing "Master" Commodity
contract and nominations for gas day September 1, 2000 will be new
transactions on the FT-R Demand contract.  Additionally, all
commodity billing will be done on the FT-R Demand contract.

Transco will send a "Notice of Termination" to all FT-R "Master"
Commodity contract holders identifying the contract that will
terminate as well as a list of all of the FT-R Demand contracts
that will continue to be effective in September.

2. Limiting nominations within a segment
Consistent with FERC's ruling in this docket and consistent with
similar rulings on Tennessee and Texas Gas, Transco will limit the
quantity of gas that can be scheduled  IN ANY SEGMENT of the
pipeline to the original firm contracted capacity.
Transco will aggregate all nominations under an original FT
contract and any related capacity release contracts
(or subsequent re-releases) to ensure that the total scheduled
quantity for the family of contracts is within the original
contractual entitlement.  If nominations for the family of
contracts exceed the original entitlement, nominations using
any secondary capacity rights will be considered as secondary
nominations and subject to cut on a pro-rata basis.

As stated above, Transco intends to implement these changes for gas
day September 1, 2000.  In the event systematic changes cannot be
completed or the FERC directs Transco to modify its planned
implementation, Transco will notify customers via TRANSIT of any
business practice changes as well as the expected implementation
timeline.

If you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact
your Customer Services Representative or Scheduling Analyst.

Hello

Watch your "snail mail" for your invitation to:

Iroquois' 5th Annual Customer Golf Tournament
Monday, August 21
8 am
Tower Ridge Country Club
Simsbury, CT

For a sneak peek (sorry, photos but no course map), visit their website

PS - It has just come to my attention that there is a typo on the reply
page of the invitation - it says "I will/will not be attending Iroquois'
Canadian Golf Tournament".  Although the 5th and 6th holes are pretty
high up on Heublin Ridge, we haven't relocated the tournament to north
of the border, its still in Connecticut. My apologies.

Just spoke with Pops.  I let him know that his favorite son (ME) will be up 
there this evening.  He thinks I'm in Lufkin.

Hey, I just created a new deal for this contract effective 8/1/2000.  I 
thought I had done this but I can't find the other deal I created.

The new deal #is 340210.

Screen is 8.375 by 8.425, I'm happier!

I just changed the volume from 11000 to 11316 per day for the whole month.

ENA purchased 11.000 dth from New Power at IF flat (deal 509454).  I created 
a sale deal 522203 (sale to New Power at IF + .0125).  Please Bookout these 
deals. 

Just send me $50 and we won't worry about it.  I would also like a new golf 
shirt but I don't think I want the name Clinton on it right now.  Try to get 
me an AEP shirt.

Here is what I know.  We started pulling 430 MCF (443 dth) from pool N424PB 
effective 7-1-00 which was changed to 430 dth effective 7-18-00.  I'm 
assuming pool N424PB is the CES/ENA non-priority pool.  Let me know if we 
need to do anything different on our side.

Chris Germany@ECT
07/18/2000 05:23 PM
Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day 
from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.  

I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 
for the month.  

AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will 
probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has 
agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat 
with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure 
out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not 
know the actuals for July production until September sometime.

Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's 
brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas. 

Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.  
With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly 
easy.

Let me know what you guys think.

kdestep@columbiaenergygroup.com on 07/18/2000 02:02:39 PM
Hi Paul and Chris,
 Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
yet.
 I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!

Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES

Effective immediately we are changing the way we handle deliveries to 
Oglethorpe on Transco.

Current Process
ENA sales gas to Oglethorpe at St 85
ENA buys gas from EPMI (deal 318335) at St 85 at Gas Daily
ENA sells gas back to EPMI at Doyle Plant at Gas Daily plus variable cost.

New Process
ENA sells gas to Oglethorpe at St 85 (deal 329314, baseload deal  and deal 
318423, gas daily deal)
ENA does an exchange buy (deal 338732) at St 85.  Curretly, this volume will 
match the sale to Oglethorpe at St 85
ENA does an exchange sell (deal 338735), volume on this deal will be the 
amount on deal 338732 less Z4 to Z4 fuel.

FYI    I requested fuel waivers from Canajoharie to Trco-Leidy for Aug and 
CNG said no.  I think they will still have the waivers to most of the 
citygates though.

Read below, are you interested?
James T Javins@EES

Chris:

Milton Beattie called me about this, and on the second call, he said this was 
currently being utilized by ENA via the Columbia Energy acquisition.  If ENA 
still wants this, could you have the appropriate party call Milton Beattie at 
the number below.

Willard Kinzer, via his wholly owned LDC Belfry Gas, has 142/day of firm 
transport available on 8/1/2000 for one year, which delivers into TCO.  He 
has released and sold this in the past, as he has his own supply that he uses 
to feed his Belfry Gas market.  (Kinzer is the largest independent producer 
in Kentucky, with about 18,000/day).

His agent, Milton Beattie, would like to know if we want to bid on this small 
piece of firm transport.  He  can be reached at 1-606-679-8812.

Call me or him if interested, and either way, please let me know.

Jim

FYI    The 4,000 the East Desk bought from Ontario for tomorrow will probably 
get constrained but we wanted to try it. 

I changed the rate on transport usage deal 227992 from $.27 to .32.  Impact 
will be ($18,400)

I need your help  changing the curve formula - please.

I'll give you a call in the morning around 8:15 am.

Later Buddy.

Chat with Alan at EES, I bet its the same escript you currently use.   This 
might be one of those "let me get Alan to help me for a free lunch" things.

kdestep@columbiaenergygroup.com on 07/19/2000 09:06:47 AM
PNG and EOH have their own EBBs but they use the same Escript software.
You have to log in through PNGaltra and EOHaltra once you click into Escript.
If you don't see them they probably aren't installed.
If not maybe you could walk me through how to do it?

Angie.Zeman@enron.com on 07/19/2000 10:03:20 AM
Please respond to Angie.Zeman@enron.com

Are those the passwords for E-Script?   I can't seem to use them...   My
login for E-script starts something like ES0___  so I assumed that hers
would be something similar.  Let me know.  Thanks Kara!

kdestep@columbiaenergygroup.com on 07/19/2000 08:33:08 AM

That sounds wonderful to me.
For East Ohio user id is "boydh2", password is "boydh4"
For Peoples user id is "boydh1", password is "boydh6"

If you guys are still working on the CPA or NYSEG local, I MIGHT be able to
help with that better so please let me know.  I'm so glad you cleared this
up
with Sampson!

Sorry dude, I don't have his number.

And I finished my first civil war book.  I'll try to get that to you.

Where should I invest my money?

If I made as much as those EES boys I could afford a Harley.  I have a 1995 
Yamaha Virago 1100.  I like it.  I got a tattoo of a heart with your name 
inside it.

Where I'm from, you and your Harley would fit in just fine.  How's things

ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14.  
The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a 
purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put 
in some of the buy/sale activity.

My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright 
one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days 
we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at 
Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add 
another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy

Scott Goodell@ENRON
07/12/2000 10:25 AM
Congratulations on your purchase of CES Retail.  Chris and I usually handle 
the capacity so we wanted to touch base with you before August business 
begins.
Are you keeping the CES entity for the month of August or switching to TNPC?  
If you don't switch for August, when do you expect the name change to occur?

If you stay under the CES name, business should proceed as usual.  If you 
switch, keep in mind:

For the Columbia Choice programs, the utility is required to release to the 
party responsible for billing Choice customers.  For July- Columbia Maryland, 
Columbia Virginia, and Columbia Ohio released space to CES then I would 
re-release the capacity to ENA for nomination purposes.  This would refund 
the original shipper the demand charges, then ENA would receive the transport 
charges and bill CES direct.  Do you have an entity for Columbia Gulf and 
Columbia Gas for this?  If you do, please submit paperwork for ENA to have 
agency rights.  If not, call Erin Scott at 713-267-4212 to set up your 
business party.

For Atlanta Gas Light, said they will continue to release to ENA, unless told 
otherwise.  Releases begin 7/19 for August allocations.

I will be out of the office 7/13, returning 7/21, so call Chris with any 
questions.
Scott

How will New Power establish credit on the intersate pipelines??  EES and ENA 
used corporate guarantees.  Also, should I set up ENA as agent (when I do 
this I prefer to be the billing and nominating agent)?  Where is my free 
lunch and my New Power golf shirt?

Timothy L Ray@EES
07/10/2000 10:44 AM
Are you still willing to provide assistance for establishing New Power to do 
business on the interstate pipelines?  I would welcome the help if the offer 
is still there.  Talk with the appropriate individuals internally and give me 
a call at your convenience. Since ENA is doing all of the nominating upstream 
at the moment, there is not a tremendous sense of urgency.  However, I would 
like to move ahead on this quickly anyway.  

I would see TCO, Transco, Sonat and TETCO as first tier requirement.  CNG, 
NGPL, ANR and Panhandle are probably on the second tier.  

Thanks Chris.

ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14.  
The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a 
purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put 
in some of the buy/sale activity.

My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright 
one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days 
we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at 
Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add 
another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy

 

Hi Steph, I don't know if this question should go to you.  If not, please 
forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is.

The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct.  The 
demand charge looks OK, its the demand volume which is not calculating 
correctly.  And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective 
June 1.

Please look at the following contracts/deals.

Rosemary's replacement.
  I am pleased to announce the appointment of Paul F. Egner,
III to Director, Customer Services & Scheduling for the Transco pipeline
system. In his new position, Paul will oversee Transco's Northern and
Southern Market Area, Transportation Marketing, Scheduling, Electronic
Development & Commerce, Market Area Operations Accounting, Production Area
Operations Accounting and Imbalance Control.

  This new opportunity comes in recognition of the tremendous
job Paul has done while serving as Director, Gas Management & Control for
Transco, a position he has held since 1997. Prior to that, Paul held various
management positions of increasing responsibility in Gas Control, Customer
Service and Transportation Marketing. Egner joined Transco's engineer
training program in 1984, completing assignments in the Transmission
Department's Corpus Christi division office and in Offshore Pipeline Design.

  His experience in these various areas within Transco make
him an ideal candidate for this position.

  Please join me in congratulating Paul on this well-deserved
appointment.

I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission 
invoice.  I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.  I 
believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity.  
I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO 
Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on 
this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport 
expense.

According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these 
charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small.  
Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.

FYI - we are moving our local production behind Peoples to Clinton's pool.

John, I assume you will be the one talking to the producer. 

Carol_A._Miller@DOM.COM on 07/14/2000 06:37:50 AM
Paul,

An Amendment to Appendix "C" will need to completed by both the pool that the
meters are being transferred from and the pool that the meters are being
transferred to.  I have discussed this issue with Heidi Boyd at Columbia 
Energy
and I believe she will complete this form on their behalf in order to delete 
the
meters.  You will also need to complete this form in order to add the meters 
to
Clinton's LGA pool once the Pooling Agreement has been completed and the pool
becomes effective.  I will fax the form to Heidi this morning.  It must also 
be
signed by the producer.  Please confirm your fax number (614-760-2794) and I
will be happy to fax the form to you as well.

Once our production pool is set up, I would like to transfer the CES/ENA 
meters
into our pool.  What do you need from me to transfer these meters?

The attached file is an update of the CES FOM June'00 request that was
transmitted on 5/26/00.  The changes between this version and the original
version are listed in the worksheet labelled "Comments".   The only changes
versus Friday's transmittal are to AGL volumes delivered on Transco.

The worksheet labelled 'Total Reqs.' and the one labelled 'Jun00 EPA Vols' 
show
volume requirements at the various citygates.  I have not adjusted our volume
requirements to reflect supply from local production behind some LDCs per 
Chris
Germany's e-mail of 5/24/00.  However, I have inserted notes indicating where
and what portion of the citygate volumes shown, will be supplied by local
production per Chris's aforementioned e-mail.

Also:  The volumes in the attached are requested pursuant to the 12/99 Energy
Purchase Agreement between Enron and CES.  During June 2000 CES will be
procuring additonal volumes from Enron under a separate deal, which should not
be confused with this request.

New Power Company will be formally taking over the CES-Retail Agreement 
effective 7/31/00.  Who should be responsible for changing all the deals in 
Sitara to correctly reflect the new arrangement?    Please advise.

Mark:
I received a notice in the mail in connection with Columbia Energy Services 
Corporation's sale of its "Mass Markets" business to The New Power Company.  
The purpose of the notice was to inform us that effective July 31, 2000 
Columbia would be assigning its interest in the January 30, 1998 ISDA Master 
Agreement that it has with ENA to New Power as well as all transactions under 
it.  Please call me if you have any questions about this.  I expect that we 
will receive shortly a formal consent agreement.

Beavy and I changed the following deals for July and August.  We took all the 
August activity to 0.  This is how these deals should be balanced

Deal 318562 with 318686.  And 318691 with 318682.

I'll look at the economics in the morning.

We do all the KO noms on Navigator via k#60094.  CGAS does not bill us 
anything on this contract, KO does.  KO somehow gets the information from 
CGAS.  That's what confused me because I remember us sending in a fax nom.  
We don't even talk to KO anymore.  I wish KO would reference the CGAS 
contract on the KO invoice.  Maybe we could ask KO to do that.  I had to chat 
with 1 KO person and 3 CGAS people to get all that information.

Sorry if this is a stupid question, but why is the pipeline set up as CGAS 
and what exactly do you mean by doing the noms via CGAS?  Does that mean that 
we turn the noms into CGAS who then gives them to KO?  It's been a long time 
since I scheduled CGAS and KO, but I remember that when I had a KO nomination 
I use to fax KO a paper nom directly and we use to put everything into 
autonoms under the KO matrix and not the CGAS matrix.  What makes this 
different?  Just curious.....

until Wednesday, July 12, 2000.

If you have any questions, please call (713) 345-5555.  We apologize for any 
inconvenience.

I made the following changes so we can track and pay the KO Transmission 
invoice.  I terminated deal 236178 (CGAS k#60094) effective 6/30/2000.  I 
believe Joann has been using this deal to path the KO Transmission activity.  
I created deal 327869 effective 2/1/2000 - this is a CGAS contract with KO 
Transmission as the service provider.  We will still do the noms via CGAS on 
this contract.  However, we will pay KO Transmission for the transport 
expense.

According to KO, we have not paid our Feb - May invoices.  I set these 
charges up on deal 327869 as demand charges.  The amount are small.  
Beginning with July, we will reflect a usage charge on deal 327869.

Questions??

Let's try next week, I'm bouncing in and out this week.  
And THANKS!!!

So when do you want to go?  I'm available Friday or any day next week except 
Monday.

I hope you had a great birthday!

I'm going over the Park & Loan discounts on CNG for May.  I need to see the 
invoice to compare what we were billed to what CNG is showing on the discount 
letter.

Gloria, Terry does not have the invoice.  Could you get me a copy please?

Thanks.

Colleen, this is the email response I received.  

Kim, could you find out from payables if we are making payments to a company 
called "Capacity Center"?  If we are, I would like to know who with Enron is 
authorizing these payments.

Thanks.

It is the policy at CapacityCenter that we not disclose the names of our
customers.  One Enron person is currently enrolled for our services.  I have
forwarded your question on to them so they may contact you directly.

If you are interested in learning more you can sign up for two week free
trial.  Link to http://www.capacitycenter.com then click on the free trial

Yep.  Went to Dad's on Sat, left Mon before lunch.  Took my woman and went to 
Jerry's on July 4th.  Had a good time.  He does a good job cooking on his BBQ 
pit.  I was very tired on Wed though.

You do that.  Did you have a nice 4th?

Per my discussion with Marde yesterday afternoon - EES is set up to serve 
CanFibre.  However, National Fuel Gas Distribution (the LDC) will not let any 
gas flow until CanFibre gets a corporate guarantee in place.  Per Marde, 
CanFibre is working on getting a guarantee.

OK - I'm tossing all my info on CanFibre.

We have some small annoying park & loan deals on Iroq for July.  The parking 
deal is 323553 and the loan deal is 323558.  When we get cut by an upstream 
or downstream pipeline, Iroq uses the park & loan contract to balance the 
supplies and markets. 

Joanie Veselack is leaving.  She is going to PG&E in Bethesda

The deal number for the gas below is $4.44.  We are using ENA transport and 
the deliveries are on a secondary basis.  The deal number is 322199 and I 
added the meter numbers that I used to enter the deals.  Robert, Joann, the 
volumes should not change and CES would like to keep this deal seperate from 
all other deals.

Please let me know if there are any questions.

Chris and all--Below is our volume request for July 7-31 for C&I customers
behind COH.  Its a similar situation to the one we had in June with C&I
customers taken over from us by Metromedia Energy.  We need to do a separate
deal to cover these volumes like we did in June.
Please provide Kara with contract numbers in the morning.  Also, could you
please provide the pricing on this deal?  Thanks.

I have very little info on this deal.  Who pays for the FT on Equitrans?
Contract 270, volume=1,000/day, start date = 7/1/97, max demand, all receipts
and all deliveries, AND the end date is 10/31/2099 (looks suspicious to me).
Scott is trying to find the term of this deal from Equitrans.  I believe
Equitrans did say this is a capacity release deal.

Scott, I'm going to list this as a wholesale deal for now.  It was not on my
wholesale transport worksheet from Mark Breese.  Please email everyone with 
the
end date when you find out.  Also, please find out who the releasing shipper 
is
and the primary receipt and delivery points.

Thanks

I will try to find out this afternoon exactly what EES is doing and give you 
an update.

Dick will be doing some deals with New Power that is seperate from the "Asset 
Management" deal.  Following are the spot deals Dick has done with Mike Garred

Deal  Vol  Price  Comment
516083  10000  8.00  sell to NP for the 5th at the pool
521475  20000  8.28  sell to NP for the 6th-31st at the pool - I killed deal 
516286 which was in Sitara as a purchase from NP.
510586  1435  7.20  buy from NP at WGL on the 1st
513896  1500  7.25  buy from NP at WGL on the 2nd-4th

These deals have no impact on the "asset management" deal with New Power.  

FYI.  Also take a look at today's Gas Daily
jporte1@columbiaenergygroup.com on 07/03/2000 10:19:15 AM
Hope you have seen the press release from Friday. If not, please see the
attached, announcing the agreement to sell the residential and small 
commercial
operations to The New Power Company. Please be aware that the deal is not
closed yet and no customers will be transferred to TNPC until all federal,
state and utility program requirements have been completed by both CES and
TNPC. We are attempting to keep you informed of any updates and I remain the
main gas utility contact for CES, so if you have any questions, please contact
me at 703/561-6447.

Thanks,

Hey, send them again.  I don't have them.

   
	
	

Yesterday I faxed you the forms for establishing a pool on Equiitrans.
Reminder, those forms must be faxed back to Equitrans TODAY to effect a 
August 1 start date.
Thanks,

I have not discussed August forward with anyone yet.  I would like to discuss 
our options on handling the pool with Heidi, hopefully after the July 4th 
holiday.  

I hope you guys have a happy 4th if I don't talk to you before.

   
	
	

Since we have meters (Phillips Production meters) in the pool, if PNG will 
allow, it may be best to transfer the pool to ENA's name.  If the CES pool 
has to be closed, Phillips Production will have to sign documents to move 
meters from pool to pool.  I'm not sure what the lead time is to move meters.

If you are going to nom 430 Dth/Day, Heidi needs to nom Phillips Production @ 
9,058 Mcf/Month (9,058 * 1.03 = 9,330 dth) plus Power Gas 4,000 Dth/month.

Is Clinton going to take the PNG throug the end of the contracts?  Power Gas 
expires 10/31, Phillips expires 11/30.

ENA is selling the Power Gas Marketing pool gas behind East Ohio 
(10,000/month)  to EES for the month of July.  EES has the ability to take 
this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would 
talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from 
Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks 
like this pool can be terminated.

Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi 
is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was 
terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may 
need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in 
August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer 
any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this

In reconciling with CES I have come across deal numbers 144284, 229286, and 
232373 that have CES as the counterparty but in the terms they show the deal 
is actually with Allied.  CES has paid everything we invoiced them, including 
these three deals, but they have admitted that they are unfamiliar to them.  
I have not said anything to CES yet.  Do we need to change the counterparty 
or what action should we take?

Thank You,

Molly

I bought 15,000/d at the TCO Pool from Dick J at $6.895 for 12/2 through 
12/31. At first he was concerned we were swinging on ENA and not storage and 
I assured him you folks knew what volume we buy/sell @ GD as soon as you get 
my nom. I have even included my estimate on the bottom of my daily nom sheet.

JD is a dead man.   Are you going to give Kori a birthday smooch!

After this Friday, use this as my e-mail:

By the way,  how's Stephanie doing?  JD seems to be doing well.

John, call me when you get a chance.  I called 330-493-7790 and there is no 
voicemail.

I show no sales to CES for the month of July.  I created deal 315460 to 
bookout with deal 217769 and deal 315471 to bookout with deal 223967.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions.

FYI.  I changed the meter number on this deal from IMB-508914 to 9170.  They 
are both Trco Non NY.  

Hey Buddy!  I just had a chat with Kori.  She is very sad she didn't get a 
birthday kiss from you.  There will be a little birthday bash on Friday July 
7th and she will be there.  What do you think?

I would like to RSVP for Chad's party.

Term  12/8/2000 - 12/31/2000
Demand $.07
k#  3.7714
Volume  5,000
Rec  Zone 6
Del  Zone 1

I just set this up in Sitara.  Please try to set up an activity number on 
this contract this afternoon.  Judy will be using this contract to flow 1 to 
3, 2 to 3, or 3 to 3.  We may use this contract to hook up with Leidy gas and 
flow it to the 210 pool or to Doyle.

Chris,

I'll assume that Natural Choice deal we discussed a couple of weeks ago is a
no-go.  Columbia Energy Svcs still hasn't executed its contract.

Here's a little ditty my sister sent me.  (You need sound.)

Hi gang.  I have not changed anything on the storage deals since the middle 
of last week.  I am still showing our projected ending balance on June 30th 
to be 3,626,785 dth.  Let me know if you see something different.

Thanks

Hey Team.  Doug, correct me if I'm wrong, CES no longer has any Equitrans 
market and we still have the production.  For July, take all of this gas into 
CNG.  You will probably need to get the CNG meter set up in Sitara.  You 
should also make sure the interconnect with CGAS is setup.

You are all wonderfull people  - I will make this free pop Friday (Wooo Hooo).

thanks

as soon as you vgive me back my ice chest

Jeff;
I recommend that CES have ENA match the pricing for each package that has 
been bid.  This means that we will let the unbid portion of capacity remain 
under the posting.

Please copy me on your e-mail to ENA.  Thanks

jporte1@columbiaenergygroup.com on 06/26/2000 08:23:12 AM
This should do it. I believe the BGE Rate Schedule on CNG is GSS. Call if you
need more info.

tray@enron.com on 06/25/2000 01:32:18 PM
Please respond to tray@enron.com

I will have a discussion with Dick Jenkins on Tuesday afternoon.  I will
see what he can offer to us in terms of of bundled delivered package.  ENA
has 23K a day going to Zone 5.  They should be willing to deal.  Is there
anyway you can take a stab at what our position is from Nov 00 to Oct 01 by
zone and op, less the winter storage and SST that we own?  I need a good
idea what our needs are.  I could compile this myself but I am loaded up on
finalizing the deal on Monday.  Thanks

jporte1@columbiaenergygroup.com on 06/23/2000 03:08:03 PM

Surprisingly, 12,485 of our 15,500 dth/d of capacity that TCO had put out
for
bid, has been bid on for between the minimum, $5.171 and $5.1807. CES
currently
has it from 11/99 to 10/00 for $4.56.  We have until 7/6 to tell ENA, as
our
agent, to tell TCO whether we want to match those bids for the next year or
let
it go to the bidders.
Also here is an update on the non theoretical storage.

John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

Thanks

Please send this email to anyone that may need to see it.  I'm sure I left 
someone out.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 06/26/2000 05:37:36 PM
The attached file contains updated July 2000 volume requirements for CES.  The
changes relative to the original request sent on 6/23/00.   Changes are
described on the worksheet labelled 'Comments' under the date 06/26/00.   The
only other change that I currently anticipate is to NIPSCO when they post our
July requirements on their EBB.

Please call me if you have questions, etc.

Hey buddy.  We are having all sorts of problems with St 30, 90% internal.  
You should try to sell to someone else if possible.  Maybe Williams??

This transaction involves 5 contracts.  Nat Fuel is billing ENA a total of 
($.125 x 1,000,000 dth) or $41,666.67/month for 3 months.  I don't think Nat 
Fuel knows how we will be billed yet so I am going to show this as a demand 
charge on contract A02353 until we figure it out.

Chris Germany
06/23/2000 03:56 PM
Hey Team.  I need the following services set up on National Fuel.

IAS  <== we just created k# A02353
ISS  <== I think we already have this set up on k#H02262
FSS  <== Nat Fuel has not assigned this contract to us yet.

Believe me, this all happened really fast.  I just sent some of the paperwork 
to legal and I need it back by Monday morning.

Chris Germany
06/23/2000 02:35 PM
We have a new Park & Loan / Storage deal on National Fuel effective 
6/23/2000.  National Fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract 
to our brand new firm storage contract.  We are now long FSS and short PALS. 

FSS
 We have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day.  
However, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth 
on any given day.  Also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like 
Trco-Leidy.  We do not have to ship the gas on Nat Fuel.  

IAS
We give Nat Fuel the gas back on an IT basis via our IAS agreement (Nat Fuel 
is still setting up the contracts).  We can give Nat Fuel the gas back at any 
point we wish.  We do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we 
withdraw on the FSS.  And we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.

COST
What we will probably do most of the time is take the FSS into Trco at Leidy 
and payback the IAS agreement at Niagara and Leidy.  ENA will pay Nat Fuel 
1,000,000 dth x ($.125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for June, July, 
and August.  This deal is over on Aug 31st.  I just entered the demand charge 
on my Market East demand charge sheet.  I do not have any deals set up in 
Sitara.  I need to see the contracts from Nat Fuel first.  I will keep track 
of the balances on an Excel worksheet.  All commodity cost and fuel is 
capured in the $.125 demand charge.  Beavy and I will make sure the payback 
and withdrawal tickets are balanced in Sitara once we start flowing gas on 
this deal.  If we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any 
withdrawals, then I will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to 
keep the tickets balanced.

Payback Techniques
Under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, 
Dick Jenkins, I've come up with some options on paying back the gas.

Niagara - only works when Niagara is open.  Nat Fuel has been very close to 
capacity this week.  However, we should always see what Martin can do with 
the gas if it gets backed up into TCPL.  OR if Niagara is constrained, we can 
ship the gas on our firm Nat Fuel contract then pay it back to Nat Fuel, at 
today's prices that cost about $.105

Wadd - take our Tenn Z6 length into CNG via Iroq, ship it to Trco- Leidy, and 
payback the gas at Leidy.  At today's prices, that cost about  $.055, 
assuming we get to roll over all of our CNG fuel waivers.

Tenn -   we just need to see what type of IT rate Dan can get to ship the 
Gulf to Tenn Z4 (Ellisburgh).  We can also move the Dracutt to Nat Fuel on 
segmented capacity for $.145 or  move Wright to Nat Fuel for $.11.  We cannot 
use the Net 284 contract on any of the Tenn / Nat Fuel interconnects.

Let me know if you have any questons.

My location is EB 3224b  and anyday after 3:45PM is good for me.

ENA is selling EES gas on CGAS.  Sitara deal #225818.  EES is showing a price 
of $3.347 for May production and we are billing them $3.324, which price is 
correct?

Thanks

Hey Greg.  Hope this works.  My phone number is 713-853-4743.

We currently have the following transport contracts on CNG for July.

k#  MDQ  Comment
5A2500  15000  Oak to BG&E

5A2551  4003  Corn to BG&E
5A2551  383  Lebanon to BG&E

5A2526  3947  Corn to Leidy

Total  23,333 dt

Angie and Beavy are working on the fuel waivers for July.  And we can still 
take 7950 dth from Cornwell. 

Please terminate the following CNG contracts effective 6/30/2000.  For June, 
we released this capacity to Energy Express.  Boston Gas recalled this 
capacity effective 6/30/2000.  I changed the deal tickets in Sitara.

Hey Z, would you show Beavy how to request the CNG Fuel waivers for July?  I 
want Beavy to do it for a couple of months so she will be aware of our 
operational flexibility.

Remember, you need to keep track of all of this on your 2000 accomplishments 
for your year end review.

Thanks.

You make it sound like you are going away for good.  I'll see you when you

Well, they put me on this special audit team to research anything that Chris 
Germany transacted.  (Not really, just kidding!!!)  

I just decided that it is time for a change and an opportunity came up.  I 
was in Gas Settlements for a little over a 1 1/2.  Don't worry, Mary will 
take care of you!!  By the way, Darla Saucier will be handling the The New 
Power Company counterparty.  Please work w/ Darla and Mary for November, 2000 
business.  It was fun working w/ you.  Take care.

Why did you go to power?  Are you going to look for some of the mistakes I 
made back in 1994??

Paul is out of the office today but I found the customer name in my notes - 
it was right below all my notes on CanFibre.  The customer is Latrove Steel.  
I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works.  Does anyone object 
to that?  I will wait until this afternoon before I call.

Heidi
Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?  If 
not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.  However, we 
will not see the fuel credit until August(???) to verify if this works or not.

Marde L Driscoll@EES
06/21/2000 08:29 PM
Questions that I have:
1)  I am assuming that the Clinton end-user will not go into EESs' pool.  It 
needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the 
end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these 
types of noms.)  This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas 
behind the gate and we don't need more production.  If the customer can't 
take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will 
only make my pool longer.

2)  If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest 
just a flat index price between ENA and EES.

3)  Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount 
of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?  

4)  If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be 
willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with 
PNG.

1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction 
from Phillips Production Company.  This volume is will be decreased  until 
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the 
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule).  There 
are 7 Phillips meters  in CES's pool beginning July 2000.  Heidi Boyd @ CES 
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool 
until the meters are moved.  EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in 
their pool beginning July 2000.

2.  See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.  

Note:  PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the 
system.  Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force 
Majeure.  Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd 
volume.

Here is what I'm looking at for July 1.  Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer 
that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will 
use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a 
special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the 
customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this 
customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf 
credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know 
how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works 
out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a 
CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at 
that price but I will.

Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  
Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, 
settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test 
Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for 
July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES 
take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions?

Questions
John
1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's 
pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  
If yes, how many meters?

2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples

Volume

Heidi (EES)
If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's 
pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to 
EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES 
is going out of business and they may make exceptions for that.

Marde
I would prefer to move both supply customers over to EES, where EES makes the 
payments and bills either Clinton or Clinton's customer.  At what price will 
you take these deals?  I assume we need to get this info from John before you 
can anwser this.

	
	

As of today, Power Gas Marketing volume has decreased from 7,500 per month to 
4,000 per month, until further notice, due to Peoples regulating the volume 
of production into their system.

Phillips Production is also down..

For July, I would sell 4, 000 per month supplied by Power Gas Marketing (pool 
to pool), and 300 MCFD x 1.03 = 309 Dth/day metered production from Phillips 
Production.  The Phillips Production meters are in CES's pool.  It will cost 
$100 per transaction to do a pool to pool transfer.  If Paul Leanza can use 
the gas through November, we should move the Phillips meters to his pool 
(309/Day).  The Power Gas volumes go through October.

I'm not sure if it matters but it will make it easier to find, I think.

   
	
	

Yes, the producer receives a fixed price, however, these deals are probably 
in TAGG as Nymex plus basis deals.  Phillips deal was transferred to ENA, 
Power Gas was triggered on ENA books.
Or does it matter???

Chris Germany@ECT
06/21/2000 08:42 AM
So both of these suppliers are now fixed price because  they locked in the 
NYMX?

We only took 80% of what we could, so we can increase by Market Zone delivery,
or not. We have advised any new buyer of the options and are keeping them
informed if we are forced to make a move, as in the case of the 15,000 of
capacity on TCO. We are being conservative and keeping everyone informed.

There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think the 
demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals 
900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to 
310,000  for Dec
310,000 for Jan
280,000 for Feb

Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of 
this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge.  
There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for 
the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?

Thanks

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was 
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I 
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.

Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I 
believe its in the deal correctly.

Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or 
something real intelligent like that.

This deal goes thru 2/28/01.

now $4.085 by $4.095

$4.115 by $4.13

The demand charges match what ENA was billed by the pipeline.

this has been billed correctly and wanted to verify with you.  Please advise.

I can be reached at 713-853-7912.

Phil,

Bruce asked me to e-mail our information to you.  The following spreadsheet
outlines the amounts we owe you for each production month.  This shows you
the exact charges we are to pay along with how much credit we are due in
each production month.  Each MARQ and FTNN charge on CNG Demand is credited
on our monthly CNG Demand billing.  This is showing us that you should have
been billed this amount by CNG Transmission and then in turn you should
bill us these amounts.

               (Embedded image moved to file: pic07770.pcx)

If you need any backup in regards to these demand charges, please notify me
by e-mail or you may call me at (315) 460-4122.  These amounts are showing
outstanding in our accounting statements, so therefore, I will be happy to
assist you in any way I can to get these amounts paid.  When billing,
please fax me a copy of your complete bill and also mail an original in the
mail.  According to our contracts, we need an original invoice complete
with wire instructions in order to make payment to your company.

Sincerely,

Becky E. Morrow

This is a Zone 4 to 4 fuel percent.  Doyle is .8 miles off the Transco

I thought Chris Meyers said they took this into consideration when talking to 
Transco.  It has no impact on pricing when flowing the gas from St 85 or St 
65.

this is a Z6 NNY to Doyle fuel %  ??

Joanie called Kara at CES about deal 282945.  This is the CGAS citygate gas 
for Energy Express.  We are selling the gas to CES and CES is reselling it to 
Energy Express.  Kara told Joanie that she does not expect the volumes to 
change on this deal.

Scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport 
CES actually has.  There should be some big changes in CES's transport 
numbers for June.  (Ex  ENA purchased the BG&E capacity on contract 
k#65403).  Also, if ENA elected to release CES capacity to Clinton or IGS,  
we need to make sure we record that correctly on the ENA sheet.  Any credits 
we show on the CES sheet will be passed thru to CES.

Chris;

Can you send me confirmation on the deals that were done for COH outside the
Enron-CES agreement.
The IF Index for TCO App pool is 4.53 +.0175+.02+transport.  Can you confirm
each market area delivery point with volume and delivered price.
I need a confirmation record for our files since we are buying this gas
on-behalf of someone else.

thanks - Charlie

We are selling 20,000 day to Transco at TP #5564.  It will cost us $.0153 to 
go from St 65 to the Sims deal, no fuel.  The transport usage deal is 289228.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Check out how I entered deal 289172, the final prices are $4.415, $4.435, 
$4.455, and $4.475.

Comment?

I shuffled the storage deal tickets (deal 268090 and 268093) around for 
June.  We are injecting more gas at the beginning of the month and less in 
the end of the month.

On Tuesday, our net injection goes to 29,687 dth.
On Sat, 19th, our net injection drops to 2,204 dth.

This keeps us at our 60% max storage balance on 6/30/2000.

Could one of you fine gentleman give me the details of what New Power paid 
ENA for October activity?

Hi team.  Do not discuss this with anyone at CES or EES please.  May not be a 
problem but just in case.

New Power Company is current working on the acquisition of CES' mass market 
customers.  In light of the acquisition, there are issues that surround our 
relationship with ENA as we step into the supply management agreement.  Below 
are the observations  that I have.  I would like to get you feedback on 
these.  If necessary, let's get together to discuss the ramifications.

1) We are purchasing customers within only twelve markets.  As such, we will 
only interpret the language of the agreement related to "existing markets" as 
applying to only those twelve markets.  For other markets that we conduct 
business in, we would choose to make a decision on supplier and load 
management even if it is an LDC identified as an existing market under the 
agreement.  In essence, we see the supply management agreement being 
bi-furcated since CES is selling C&I to another marketer.

2) My interpretation is that New Power Company will only be on the hook for 
capacity and storage charges as they apply to mass markets.  This would 
include capacity and/or storage allocations received on CVA, CMD, AGL.  In 
addition, it would include the FSS and SST purchased on COH.  It would also 
include the following transportation agreements: 61822, 61825, 61838, 61990, 
64939, 65418, 62164.  There are some capacity agreements on TCO for 
CPA(65041, 65042) and BGE(65108) that were purchased by CES for both C&I and 
mass markets.  It is our contention that we will only be on the hook for the 
demand charges related to the capacity covering mass market purchase 
commitments identified in the schedules of the purchase agreement .  All 
un-utilized capacity would to stay with CES and/or buyer of the C&I 
agreements.

3) We need to discuss the application of the contract to additional capacity 
that New Power procures applicable to the periods prior to Apr. 1, 2001.  I 
want to keep this capacity separate and under our control.  I will need your 
viewpoint on this.  If ENA feels strongly that we must place the capacity 
under the supply management agreement, then I would want to discuss our 
ability to market any excess capacity in open market.  Bottom-line, I want to 
avoid gas costs being inflated due to my inability to receive value for 
un-utilized capacity. 

4) I would like to get your viewpoint on the right of first refusal clause.  
My view would be that its applicable would be made to transactions of similar 
nature and service level. (supply management)  To the degree that New Power 
chose after the primary term to manage its supply, all supply only 
transactions would not be subject to this clause.    

I know you will need to review the contract.  We have some time to discuss 
these issues, but would like to have feedback from you no later than next 
Friday, if at all possible.  I can be reached at ext 39475.  Thanks for your 
help. 

 

      

I released the Transco and CNG capacity to Energy Express for the term of the 
deals.  However, Boston should recall all this capacity effective 7/1/2000.

Transco Offers
#20100 for 15 dth effective 6/1/2000 - 5/31/2008 from k# 2.4899, Wharton to 
Algon
#20101 for 5 dth effective 6/1/2000 - 5/31/2008 from k# 2.8607, Wharton to 
Algon

CNG Offers
#13817 for 67 dth effective 6/1/2000- 3/31/2003 from k# 5A2529, transport to 
Leidy

#13824 GSSTE, effective 6/1/2000 - 3/31/2006, Demand Vol = 132, Capacity Vol= 
14661.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Scott,

I got your message this morning regarding the releases for the Columbia
customers.  I'll call you as soon as I complete my nominations for the
weekend.

I understand you may be having a problem releasing to EnergyEXPRESS on CNG -
I'll see if I can't resolve that...

Thanks,

I didn't even know about deal 219618.  I will chat with Dick Jenkins about 
this after trading.  

Drew Hill

Chris, I have researched the buy and sell from/to AEC Marketing for 4/2000.  
Here are the details:

Location:  7126-NFUL/TRCO LEIDY TRANSCO

  transport demand charge(4/2000)    = $56,078.82

Deal   227196 purchase 9189/day @ NX1 + .22 (3.12)    

Deal  219618 sell              6000/day @ Michcon Citygate G.D. M.I. + 
.39(3.39) 

It seems as though ENA is recouping the demand charge only on 6,000 mmbtu per 
day.  Do you know if the additional reimbursement has been locked in?  
Perhaps on the financial side?         
I

Done.

Whoo hooo!  I just took the demand charge for CALP to $0 for May.  This 
affects our demand charges on CGAS.

We are parking 4,875 dth/day for the 27th-30th on CNG (deal 281565) and we 
are taking out 478 dth/day for the month of June (deal 281565).  ENA is 
paying CNG $.04 times the total volume parked.

Angie, these volumes may go up.  I think Tenn is still trying to balance the 
weekend and they are a little long.  Clarissa will let you know.

I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this 
ticket), 268090, and 268093.

Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this 
volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the 
volumes coming out in August.

I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.

Let me know if you have any questions.

It is definitely a CES deal that will be over in Sep or Oct of this year.

If the deal is confirmable as a deal that came across on CES's books 
[reported as an active deal by CES to ENA], then the deal is a CES deal (CES 
- Statoil). BUT, if this is a newly discovered deal - - - - we will need to 
confirm with Risk (Mark Breese) to ensure proper booking & that the deal has 
been quantified; OR if it is a newly negotiated deal or a deal finalized 
after 1/1/00, then it should be entered without the CES prefix (statoil). 
Based on the production dates of deal# 280185 and #226563, as combine with 
the fact and that I can not find anything in the CES deal listing (CES 
'books') specifying a 333/day deal with Statoil I am again hesitant to use 
the CES prefix (nor can I confirm that deal #226563 should have been entered 
with the CES prefix.

John, can you fill in the missing details?

Cyndie

Chris Germany@ECT
05/25/2000 04:19 PM
John, I took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal 
starting June 1.  This is the purchase from Belden & Blake behind NYSEG. 

I changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.  This is 
the purchase from StatOil at CPA.  The price on this deal is NX1 + .434 and 
the price on John's worksheet is NX1 + .54 (per MCF).  John, is this price 
adjusted for dth??

I created deal 280185, purchase from StatOil, volume of 333 day, the price is 
NX1+ $.56 PER MCF.  This is a purchase of local production behind the 
citygate.  David, this deal probably needs to be hedged in Sitara.
Cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from CES - Statoil Energy.  I set up deal 
280185 with the same counterparty.  This deal should have been in the system 
effective 1/1/2000.  According to Elizabeth, we should not use the CES - 
StatOil Energy.  It doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal 
should have been in the system from Jan and it is the same type of deal as 
deal 226563.

I changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.  This is a 
purchase from Questar and it is also local production behind CPA.  
John, there are 3 deals for Questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 
right now.  Can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing 
purposes?

Molly, I created deal 280132, FOM priced sale to CES.  This deal will be 
matched with the CPA local production deals.

Let me know if anyone has any questions.

This is citygate gas ENA will sell to CES for June.  This will reduce the 
numbers on the sheet Doug sent us yesterday.

East Ohio Gas on CNG
10,000 dth/ month from Power Gas Marketing

CPA on TCO
500 dth/day from Power Gas Marketing
1,833 dth/day from StatOil
1,100 dth/day from Questa - Note:  this is an estimated volume.  We should 
know the actual volume in the next day or so.

Note:  CES is not taking any Carnagie gas at CPA.

National Fuel
250 dth/day from Belden & Blake.  The deal expires 6/30/2000.

Equitrans
All of the Equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.  ENA 
nominates this gas.  CES still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for June 
on Equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to CES.

CES will not be receiving any local production behind Peoples or NYSEG.

Its good we didn't book anything because CES just sold a lot of their 
customers to another company.

   
	
	

FYI
Scott Neal
05/04/2000 05:32 PM
I definatley think we should book these volumes for all of your reasons below 
plus each month we don't seem to have a decent estimate until the 30th or 
31st.

   
	
	

Scott--
Here is your problem in getting these booked.  You can do what you want, but 
I still think we should book it.  The flexibility in takes is only 10% so 
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don't 
book anything.  Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell 
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to.  In addition, per our 
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely 
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or 
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year.  This 
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term.  And finally, what if 
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in 
there.

Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you 
want.  

	
	

FYI,

I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are 
not reflected in the books.  Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to 
book since there is flexibility in the takes.  Also, he said he has a strong 
feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it.  Dick 
agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now.  So Chris 
said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me.  

Hi.

I probably will not be able to attend the meeting on Thursday.  Should I let 
someone in your office know about that?

I changed the effective date on the following Transco deals in Sitara.  
Transco told me this morning that these contract agencies were terminated 
effective 3/31/2000.

Deals 165415 and 165423.

I found a couple of big adjustments on the April capcity sheet.  I am still 
billing CES for the Union Camp capacity and it was terminated effective 
3/31/2000.
  The net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to CES.  

It also appears that I billed CES the scheduling fee of $20,000.00 twice.

Jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00 
equals $1,865,705.00.  If we billed CES twice for the scheduling fee, then we 
should  issue a credit to CES of about $84,000.00.  Please redraft deal 
227081 and let me know what the impact is.  I would like to send out the 
credit either today or tomorrow.

Thanks.

APPALACHIAN PRODUCER NOTICE

POSTED May 23, 2000

Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing 
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative 
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression 
into our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a 
limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make 
this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a 
period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and 
Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for 
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its SCHUTTE 
compressor station.  The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 4404 & 4405.   
Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental 
capacity for throughput through these compressor stations.  The incremental 
capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the 
limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.  
Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it 
receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement.  
Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing 
time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to insure 
that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other 
producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression 
in place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights 
to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more 
requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for 
which there is capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the 
proposed 
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should 
be included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the 
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after 
June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  
Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close 
after Noon on June 23, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value 
of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on 
this opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at 
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may 
have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.

Sincerely, 
H. Dale Rexrode
Director, Producer Services & Business Development

application 
must indicate the amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression 
agreement.  Dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires 
differing time frames.  We will balance that consideration with our need to 
insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of 
other 
producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression 
in 
place and operable within six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to 
all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more 
requests 
for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there 
is 
capacity, Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the 
proposed 
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the 
incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be 
included (please print or type).

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the 
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after 
June 23, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  
Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close 
after Noon on June 23, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of 
your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this 
opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at

Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing 
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative 
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into 
our gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited 
number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this 
opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  For a 
period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 24, 2000, the Gathering and 
Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for 
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its CAMDEN 
compressor station.  The Dominion "bubbles" affected are 3306, 3307, 3401, 
3402, 3403, 3406, 3407, 3408 & 3409.   Dominion recognizes that, although 
limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through 
these compressor stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through 
new compression agreements will not exceed the limit Dominion determines 
to be the capacity of the existing compressors.  Dominion will attempt to 
be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit 
approved 
applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the 
existing non-compressed gas entering the system.  Please submit your written 
application to Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  
The application must indicate the amount of "incremental" gas for the 
specific compression agreement.  Dominion recognizes that the installation 
of compression requires differing time frames.  We will balance that 
consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not 
abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted,

months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity 
will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights 
for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion 
will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the

For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, 
the Gathering and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept
applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas 
feeding the Barbour County High Pressure System.  The Dominion "bubble"
affected is 4205.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does
exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor 
stations.
The incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements 
will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the 
pipeline system.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the 
applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not 
unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed 
gas entering the system.  Please submit your written application to 
Joe Thompson at the Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  
The application must indicate the amount of "incremental" gas for the 
specific compression agreement.  Dominion recognizes that the installation 
of compression requires differing time frames.  We will balance that 
consideration with our need to insure that the application process is 
not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, 
the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within 
six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed 
capacity will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression 
rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, 
Dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the 
proposed location where you will be requesting to install compression. 
Also include the incremental volume you are wishing to transport under 
the compression agreement.  Your name, company name and address, 
state of incorporation, phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address,
if available, should be included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development

    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the 
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after June 12, 
2000
to notify you of those requests that have been approved.  Please realize that
this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after Noon on June 12, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value
of your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this 
opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at (304) 
623-8709
or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may have regarding 
this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.

Hey Chris,

Just out of curiousty, do you happen to have a copy of the contract for New 
Power on Transco and Sonat?  I just want to make sure that I'm fully getting 
all the peices.  

Thanks!

Chris, Iroq cannot find the payment for May 1999 of $1,934.42.  Can you 
provide some support showing the monies being paid to Iroq.

We paid parking fees to Iroquois in two months:

May 1999 $1,934.42
June 1999 $1,872.02
Total  $3,806.44

Let me know if you need anything else.

As of today's gas day, ENA has a balance of 658,375 dth in CES's storage.  We 
still have 56,000 dth we can over inject for the month of May to reach our 
"approved" max monthly injection amount.

Thanks to the help of Terry Franklin and Dominion Transmission, all our CES

1.  Hopefully this should help to alleviate some confusion and hassle for 
everyone.   -AZ

Did you get the fax of all the deals in our system for June?

We have the Equitrans capacity (1,000 dt/day)  through July.  Scott will tell 
John Singer we need to get out of this capacity.  Scott and I have decided to 
leave this on the CES Retail worksheet and see what happens.

ENA purchased the 19,000 of BG&E space from CES.

   
	
	

Per our discussion on Monday, we need to give CES-Retail a bid for the two 
TCO transportation contracts that were dedicated to c&i customers that they 
will no longer need once they sell their c&i business effective 6/1/00.  As 
you recall, one contract is to COH for 20,000/d through 10/31/00 (#65402); 
the other is to BG&E  for 19,000/d through 4/01(#65403).  This is the 
information that Jeff Porter and Charlie gave to me--you need to confirm that 
this information is accurate.

I am going to call Charlie back tomorrow morning (Friday, 5/12) and suggest 
that he talk to one of you two directly for a bid on the agreements.  I think 
this will be more efficient (and put the pressure on you to price it 
up!!).    If there is any problem with this, please let me know.

Did you get the fax of the Consumers Energy invoice??

Hey you said I could delete this one.  Yea!!

Who is the trader for deal 231760?  As you can see from Lisa's note we have a 
price discrepancy.  Can you please help us out.

Lisa Valderrama
05/21/2000 10:39 AM
It looks like we have a price discrapency on deal 231760 for April 
production.  Columbia Natural Resources has invoiced ENA  at $3.02 and we 
have the deal priced at $2.14.  Could you please check with the trader and 
confirm which price is correct.  

Thanks

I just spoke with CES.  CES will keep the National Fuel for the month of June 
since June is the last month.   Please call me when you get a chance to 
discuss everything.

I did not discuss the Equitrans gas with CES.  I want to talk to Scott about 
that tomorrow.

   
	
	

No home yet. May have to take to Penn Fuel.  I left a message with Equitable 
to see if they are interested in Peoples, EOG, Equitrans and Penn Fuel.
What are you going to do with the CPA.  Bary Vanderhorst w/EES might be 
interested.  If not I wll contact Equitable.

I will contact Dominion to see if they are interested in any of this gas.

Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?  

I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate 
production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on 
the EOG and 
Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted.

Yep.  So that would be part of our $100,000.00 gain, right?

Crystal Hyde
05/22/2000 12:54 PM
Hey Chris,

The numbers I have in the P&L for the SE  net  are  (297,048)

The numbers in your worksheet net are  (281,238) 

That isn't too big of a difference, plus it is in our favor.   A mere 
$15,810.  Should I go ahead and let that into the P&L for tonight?

Thanks!

Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas.  Marde will show me a 
number after I find out if CES wants this or not.  Marde also said the seller 
pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool.  Marde 
said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF 
+$.09 for gas this month.

EES cannot take any Peoples gas.  Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell 
it to Peoples?  I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton.  Marde 
is going to check around.

Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?  

I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate 
production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on 
the EOG and 
Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted.

New Virus Taking Offices By Storm
  This virus warning is genuine.

There is a new virus going around, called "work."   If you receive any sort
of "work" at all, whether via email, Internet or simply handed to you by a
colleague...DO NOT OPEN IT.

This has been circulating around our building for months and those who have
been tempted to open "work" or even look at "work" have found that their
social life is deleted and their brain ceases to function properly.  If you
do encounter "work" via email or are faced with any "work" at all, then to
purge the virus, send an email to your boss with the words "I've had enough
of your crap...  I'm off to the bar."    Your brain should automatically
forget the "work".

If you receive "work" in paper-document form, simply lift the document and
drag the "work" to your garbage can.  Put on your hat and coat and skip to
the nearest bar with two friends and order three bottles of beer  (or rum
punch). After repeating this action 14 times, you will find  that "work"
will no longer be of any relevance to you  and that "Scooby Doo" was the
greatest cartoon ever.

As usual, you are awesome!  Let Steve know what the fuel waivers are when you 
get them.

Thanks

Angie Zeman@ENRON

Chris-

I sent all the paperwork to Pam for the June fuel waiver requests this 
morning.  I will let you know when I hear about the results.   Thanks- AZ

I found $357 not showing up on Texas Gas, K#T016336, AND the OLD total for 
Texas Gas is showing $18,423 when the actual total is only $1,442.

We are showing the Equitrans contract on both ENA and CES.  For now, I'm 
taking it out of the ENA sheet - its $7,000

That's all for now.

I just found somehting that will probably stick out when you run the new 
demand charges.  The TETCO demand charges on the ECT Trans worksheet were not 
subtotaled.  The total demand for these charges was $18,424.

I just found somehting that will probably stick out when you run the new

subtotaled.  The total demand for these charges was $18,424.

Please check on the purchase from AEC Marketing.  The daily volume is 9189, 
the deal number is 227196.  I'm trying to find out if we get reimbursed for 
the transport demand charge we pay National Fuel each month.

Thanks

We have a sale to Tractebel on CGAS with a price discrepancy.  This was a 
deal we took over from CES wholesale.
Here are the terms per the confirm Tractebel faxed us.
Term:  11/1/1999 - 10/31/2000
Type:  EFP
Differential: $.235
Point:  Tco Pool
Trans Date: 5/6/1999

Sitara Deals:  158716/227890   the price in sitara is Tco Index.

Elizabeth faxed the confirm to me.  I will gladly give this to David.

Please take a look and let Elizabeth know which price should be in Sitara.
Thanks.

There is a demand charge of  $-.22 x 900000 on this deal ticket.  I think the 
demand charge should be $-.22 x 10,000 x # days on the month.  This equals 
900,000 over the term of the deal.  I changed the demand charge volume to 
310,000  for Dec
310,000 for Jan
280,000 for Feb

Audrey, the global contract is 96017642 and 12/2000 is the first month of 
this deal.  We should receive and invoice from COH for the demand charge.  
There is a very slim chance we will be selling COH any gas on this deal for 
the month.  Would you forward this email to the person that handles COH?

Thanks
chris

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was 
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I 
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.

Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I 
believe its in the deal correctly.

Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or 
something real intelligent like that.

This deal goes thru 2/28/01.

Fyi, in case anyone is interested.

The STOCK MARKET closed sharply higher on Thursday following the
release of today's report on retail sales for April, which was down.
Today's report eased trader fears about rising interest rates
however; it is unlikely that it will cause the Fed. to abandon its
current policy of higher interest rates until there is further
evidence of a slow-down in the US economy. Technically, today's
action appears corrective in nature leaving the door open for
sideways too lower prices on Friday. It will take closes above
trendline resistance crossing near 10,760 to temper the near-term
bearish outlook in the Dow.

JUNE BONDS closed higher on Thursday following today's release of
friendly retail sales data. This week's rebound off the 62%
retracement level of this year's rally crossing at 92-31 has allowed
June to challenging initial trendline resistance crossing near 94-09.
Multiple closes above this resistance level would signal a minor low
might be in place.
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/USM0-daily.html

CRB INDEX surged to new highs for the second day in a row confirming
Wednesday's trading range breakout above 217.88. Sharp gains in
energies supported today's rally in the CRB, which has renewed its
long-term uptrend. I would not be surprised to see the CRB trade
sideways too lower on Friday as it consolidates some of this week's
gains and possibly retest broken resistance at 217.88. However, this
week's move to new highs has opened the door for a possible test of
weekly resistance at 223.23 later this month.
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/NYCE/CRY0-daily.html

CURRENCIES the June Dollar closed higher on Thursday following
Wednesday's late-session turnaround. The setback off last week's low
as the appearance of a potential bull flag. Closes into new highs
would confirm an upside breakout of weekly resistance at 111.37,
which would open the door for a possible test of the 1981 high at
114.88 later this spring. The Swiss Franc and D-mark closed lower on
Thursday with the D-mark gapping down and closing below long-term
support at .4624. Closes below last week's lows in both markets are
needed to renew this spring's declines. The June Japanese Yen posted
a key reversal up after session lows fell short of the Feb. low at
.9125. Additional gains on Friday would confirm today's reversal
pattern however; June needs to close above .9394 to confirm a
short-term bottom has likely been posted.

PRECIOUS METALS closed mixed on Thursday. June gold posted a new low
close for the week and in doing so turned a number of short-term
momentum indicators bearish. Follow-through weakness on Friday could
set the stage for a possible test of May's low at 273.60 in the near
future. July silver closed lower following Wednesday's inside day
increasing the odds July will try and test this spring's double
bottom at 4.975. Today's mid-range close leaves the door open for
sideways trading on Friday. July copper closed slightly higher on
Thursday after probing last week's gap. Momentum indicators are
overbought and turning bearish warning bulls, time is running out and
downside risk is increasing. Closes below gap support at 82.40 would
confirm a short-term top has been posted.

http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/COMEX/GCM0-daily.html

GRAINS closed higher on fund buying and NOAA weather forecast. July
corn posted an inside day with a fractionally higher close as traders
digested Wednesday's bullish long-range weather forecast from NOAA.
Light consolidation ahead of Friday's supply/demand report also
limited today's gains. NOAA is still calling for a potential drought
this summer, as LaNina is likely to persist through August. A steady
too higher close on Friday sets the stage a possible resumption of
last week's rally next week if hot/dry weather returns to the
Midwest. July wheat gapped up and closed sharply higher for the
second day in a row due to strong fund related buying. Expectations
for a friendly supply/demand report on Friday and bullish weather
forecast have been the driving factors behind this week's rally.
Today's close above minor resistance at 2.78 1/2 makes March's high
at 2.84 July's next target, then this winter's high at 2.95 1/2. The
rising ADX signals additional short-term gains are possible during
May. http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/CN0-daily.html
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/WN0-daily.html

SOYBEAN COMPLEX closed steady to lower due to consolidation ahead of
Friday's supply/demand reports. July beans posted an inside day in
relatively quiet trading ahead of tomorrow's reports. Never the less,
this week's rally is turning a number of short-term momentum
indicators neutral too bullish leaving July poised to renew this
year's rally if the weather turns hot and dry next week. Closes above
5.82 1/2 would confirm the uptrend has resumed. July soybean meal
spiked to new highs before light profit taking tempered today's
meager gain. Today's high-range close leaves July poised to extend
this month's move to new highs if Friday's reports come in neutral to
friendly. July bean oil closed lower on Thursday in narrow trading as
the market remains poised to extend its decline off May's high should
Friday's reports come in neutral to bearish. Today's bearish export
sales report does not bode well for the longer-term outlook in bean
oil. If the decline resumes, the 50% retracement level of this
spring's rally at 17.50 is July's next target.

http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CBOT/BON0-daily.html

LIVESTOCK closed lower on Thursday pressured by weaker cash and
product prices. June hogs closed slightly lower but near session
highs as the market attempted to consolidate recent losses amidst a
sharp rebound in bellies. However, lower cash bids and additional
long-liquidation limited to day's rebound as the market is
consolidating above minor support at 71.96. Momentum indicators
remain bearish signaling further losses are possible later this
month. June cattle closed into new lows for the week confirming
Wednesday's trendline breakout. Today's close below April's low at
68.22 sets the stage for a test of March's low at 67.70 in the near
future. Expectations for rising grain prices and declining boxed beef
prices continues to weigh on prices.
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CME/LHM0-daily.html
http://www.quotewatch.com/charts/futures/CME/LCM0-daily.html

FOOD & FIBER closed mixed on Thursday. July coffee continues to drift
sideways ahead of the May 19 retention plan meeting. July sugar
closed on spec. buying on ideas world surplus should continue to
shrink due to lower production levels in Brazil and other sugar
producing nations. Profit taking ahead of the close tempered today's
gains. July needs to close above 675 to renew this spring's rally.
July cocoa gapped up and closed higher due to fund short covering.
Today's high is challenging this spring's downtrend line crossing
near 830. Multiple closes above this resistance level are needed to
confirm a bottom and trend change. Momentum indicators are turning
bullish signaling additional gains are possible. I would not be
surprised to see an inside day on Friday as July consolidates some of
today's gains. July cotton posted a potential key reversal down on
Thursday after session highs fell short of testing the 75%
retracement level of this spring's decline at 62.76. Today's
mid-range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on Friday.
Bullish short-term weather forecast for West Texas and the southeast
US will continue to underpin prices. Momentum indicators are bullish
and suggest additional gains are possible.

The ENERGY MARKETS closed higher on Thursday with July heating oil
posting a new contract high today. July crude oil has retraced over
75% of this spring's decline setting the stage for a possible test of
March's high at 30.46 later this spring.

We can use it as far as I'm concerned.  Have the reimbursements been 
addressed?

   
	
	

I need to know WHY you all are still uncomfortable using the service p&l, at 
least for demand charges.  Please advise.

Colleen,

The main reason I am uncomfortable about using the service p&l is because 
Chris, Dan, and Judy are uncomfortable with it.  As soon as they are happy 
with it, we are ready to use it.

David

David--
Why are you still not comfortable using the service p&l, at least for demand 
charges?
What system resources are you talking about?

Colleen,

I think the reason that they haven't moved has been one of timing.  Chris has 
not had time to pull them out of their spreadsheets and put them onto 
another.  This, of course, has led to the obvious point that we are still not 
comfortable using the service P&L from unify.  When Scott gets back next 
week, we will together with him and Dick to verify what needs to be moved and 
take care of it manually until system resources can handle it.

David

   
	
	

David
Is there some reason why we are not allocating demand charges for the market 
area pipes to the Market East p&l?  If the only reason is that you're not 
sure which ones to do, this is my suggestion.  It seems to me that there are 
only three pipelines where there is overlap and that would be Tennessee, 
Texas Eastern and Transco.  For now, why don't we leave all the demand 
charges for those three pipes, plus all others not listed below, with the 
East p&l, and move the following pipe demand charges to the Market East 
book:  Algonquin, Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Natural Resources, CNG, 
Cove Point, Equitrans, Gatherco, Iroquois, Marco, National Fuel.

Obviously you need to confirm this with Dick and Scott, but this seems to 
make sense to me.  Please advise.

I will be out of the office Wed, Thur, and Friday of this week.  Please call 
Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711 if you have any questions.

Thanks

we will showing CES a bid today.

   
	
	

Chris--
Have you called Charlie yet with bids on the three CES transport contracts we 
discussed?   
Also, have you received from CES the official in writing notification of 
their withdrawal from certain c&i markets?

I want to make sure we have enough time to handle all the transportation 
contract issues, etc. for June bid week.  Please advise.

Molly set up the following tickets to capture our CGAS storage transactions.  
This is how it will work,

Deal #  Comment
268093  CES Exchange Buy - use when storage injections are less than the 
proxy volume
268090  CES Exchange Sell - use when storage injections are greater than the 
proxy volume
268094  CES Sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket.  The volume 
should not change.

The daily proxy volume for the month of May is 35,133.  When we inject 
35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 
268094.  When we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the 
transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport 
will be matched against deal 268090.  When we underinject, we will use deal 
268093 as the supply for deal 268094.

This may seem a little confusing.  Please call me if you still have questions.

Thanks

Oh be still my aching heart,
filled with bitter sorrow at my loss, (sniff)

I'm ready to move to Ohio and become a pig farmer and work on my poetry!!

I was trying to send the tractor photo to you yesterday but I was having 
problems.  I will try again tonight.  It takes a long time for system at home 
to show a photo email.

Done, please review the following zones.  They are different from last 
month's pricing.

TGT Zone 4 <=== the biggest change
Tenn Z6
And I added CGLF Onshore and CGLF Mainline.

I don't know if we will have CGLF changes or not but I wanted to set up 
pricing to take care of it.

To ensure everyone is on the same page.... Steve Stonestreet at TCO and I had 
a conversation on how TCO works its storage ratchets. Steve, if I have 
misstated something, please let us know.

There is a FSS schedule that tells the ratchets, minimum injections, maximum 
withdrawals, etc. This FSS schedule has been updated in the attached 
spreadsheet with Enron's SCQ and Enron's MDSQ, which enables Enron to know 
its different volume requirements.

Based on the attached schedule, each month there are different Maximum 
Monthly Injection Quantities (MMIQ)  based on Enron's SCQ. There is no 
Minimum Injection Quantity required by TCO.

TCO Injection Session and % of SCQ;

April = 15%
May = 20%
June = 20%
July = 20%
Aug = 20%
Sept = 13%
Oct = 7 %

If you add these months up, the total Injection is 115%. Essentially, 
shippers have an extra 15% that does not have to be used during the injection 
period. Please note, Shippers can inject all year around on TCO (November is 
5% and December through March is 10%... typically not done).

For example, Shippers do not have to inject the ratchet amount in April 
(15%). If the Shipper falls behind on the STOI, and the Shipper needs to 
catch up on STOI in the future months, and the Shipper wants to go over the 
ratchet level for that month, then TCO will need to give its prior approval 
(I sound like a lawyer). Typically, TCO is more willing to approve 
overinjections in the early months of the injection session versus 
overinjecting in September and October, when TCO is full. 

Some other basic rules;

Shippers do not have to fill storage 100% by October.

Shippers cannot have more than  60% in storage by June 1st, unless 
overinjection is approved by TCO.

Shippers can have daily net withdrawals in the summer, and it works the same 
way it did in the Winter. Depending on the % SCQ, this will determine the 
MDWQ. As of today, 8.3% is in the ground so Enron can net withdraw 54,324. 
Once Enron is between 10% to 20%, then the MDWQ is 70,521... but remember 
Enron's SST is only 54,324 until October 1st... so other transport will need 
to be used to avoid overrun charges.

Why do we care about all of this....

Enron wants to slow down on the injection into storage. Because choice still 
uses storage withdrawal in April and storage withdrawal is used for 
Hopewell... there may be days that we are net withdrawing. As long as we stay 
below 54,324... there will not be penalties. If we go over this amount, we 
will need to get gas controls approval... the same drill we use for 
overinjections above 36,304.

TCO Schedulers... we have been doing a great job monitoring this so far. 
April is a very hard month to monitor storage. Remember, if we have problems 
running Storage reports from our PC's or Laptops, TCO has the ability to run 
the reports and TCO will run it on the weekends if necessary. From these 
reports, we can determine if we need to get the overwithdrawal or 
overinjection approval from TCO's Gas Control. TCO's gas control will need a 
volume amount to place in their book... which is the bible for TCO enforcing  
penalties. The penalties are pretty steep... max is $10 dkt.

Please save this note for future reference.

I changed the Oct 2000 volume on deal 203062 (tagg NA1167.8) from 95244 dth 
to 95246 dth.

Please make the following change:
Deal 203030 (NA1137.4)  change the volume for April from 50,857 dth to 13,527 
dth, and change the volume for May from 17,866 dth to 4,752 dth.

Please verify the following info;
The confirm for deal 169036 (NA0713.1) shows a price of $2.295 + $.6800, 
according to CES this should be a price of $2.795 + $.6800.  Please verify 
which price is correct.

The confirm for deal 168997 (NA0713.4) shows a basis price of $.455 for April 
and CES is showing $.175.  Please verify which price is correct.

Do you need a HUG??    :o)

Per our discussion on Monday, we need to give CES-Retail a bid for the two 
TCO transportation contracts that were dedicated to c&i customers that they 
will no longer need once they sell their c&i business effective 6/1/00.  As 
you recall, one contract is to COH for 20,000/d through 10/31/00 (#65402); 
the other is to BG&E  for 19,000/d through 4/01(#65403).  This is the 
information that Jeff Porter and Charlie gave to me--you need to confirm that 
this information is accurate.

I am going to call Charlie back tomorrow morning (Friday, 5/12) and suggest 
that he talk to one of you two directly for a bid on the agreements.  I think 
this will be more efficient (and put the pressure on you to price it 
up!!).    If there is any problem with this, please let me know.

Kim, I'm at a CNG shipper meeting in Florida next Wed - Fri.

   

Please let me know if you are able to attend a meeting regarding Capacity 
trading on EOL..  The meeting will take place next Friday, May 19 11:00- 1:00 
in EB30C1.  Please respond by tomorrow.  Lunch will be provided.

Thanks

Chris,
As we discussed, please get with Brenda Fletcher and set this up as a demand 
to pay the .0153 storage fee, since the pathing does not allow me to pay 
through the Volume system.  As long as it is on the deal, it will show up in 
Settlements and I can pay.  Also, I need it done from January 2000 to current.

Thanks,
Mark

the

Steve, I don't think you need to be at our meeting.  We have room 3125B at 
1:30 PM tomorrow.

EB3125B

I think this same memo is on the EBB several times.  FYI  

                                                      May 9, 2000 9:40 a.m.

 Dear West Virginia Producer,

Over the last several years, Dominion Transmission has worked hard providing
additional value to producers on its gathering system and through innovative
projects and joint ventures.  In continuing with that process to bring you 
more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our 
gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into 
our
gathering system may be approved.  We have been able to grant a limited 
number 
of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity 
somewhat more widely available to the producers.

For this second offering, the process we will use is as follows: 
For a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 Noon on May 10, 2000, the Gathering 
and Production Division of Dominion Transmission will accept applications for
compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its Craig, 
Yellow Creek and Schultz compressor stations.  The Dominion "bubbles" 
affected 
are 3219, 3223 and 3224 for the Schultz area and 3214, 3215, 3216, 3217, 
3218, 
3220, 3221 and 3222 for Craig station and 3208, 3209, 3210, 3211, 3212 and 
3213
for Yellow Creek station.   Dominion recognizes that, although limited, there 
does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor 
stations.  The incremental capacity authorized through new compression 
agreements
will not exceed the limit Dominion determines to be the capacity of the 
existing
compressors.  Dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the 
applications 
it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably 
interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering 
the system.  Please submit your written application to Joe Thompson at the 
Dominion Gathering & Production Office.  The application must indicate the 
amount of "incremental" gas for the specific compression agreement.  Dominion 
recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time 
frames.
We will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the 
application 
process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once 
granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within 
six months of Dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity
will be forfeited.  In the event that more requests for compression rights for
incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, Dominion will 
award the rights on a prorated basis.

Please include in your written request the mid number or a map of the proposed
location where you will be requesting to install compression.  Also include 
the 
incremental volume you are wishing to transport under the compression 
agreement.  Your name, company name and address, state of incorporation, 
phone and fax number, as well as an e-mail address, if available, should be 
included (please print or type).

Forward this information to:   
    Joseph A. Thompson
    Manager, Business Development
    Dominion Transmission
                                Gathering & Production Division
    500 Davisson Run Road
    Clarksburg, WV  26301

After all requests are received, we will review the request and make a 
determination on granting compression based on capacity available and the
capacity requests.  You will be contacted as soon as possible after
June 12, 2000 to notify you of those requests that have been approved. 
Please realize that this is a "window" and the opportunity will close after
Noon on June 12, 2000.

I hope that this will provide opportunity for you to increase the value of 
your production facilities, and I look forward to working with you on this
opportunity to add compression.  You can contact Joe Thompson at 
(304) 623-8709 or Dan Stuart at (304) 623-8705 with any questions you may 
have regarding this compression  "open season" request on Dominion Gathering.

Recalls need 24 hr notice - we require them to recall by 8 AM for gas to be
flowed the following day.

Hi gang.  We still need to make some changes to Sea Robin.

I believe we need 2 pricing zones, Mainline Pool and Offshore.  The new Sea 
Robin curve will be used to value the Offshore zone and we will use CGLF/La 
curve to value everything else.  Per my discussion with Christine, the 
following meters should be moved/mapped to the Offshore zone;

Meter
4743
4747
4741
4754
4771
4753
4794
4728
4700
4749
4751
9740
6335
6333
4794
4700
4850
ISRP84
FSRP3
2SRP9

Please let me know what I need to do or if anyone has any questions.

   
	
	

Chris,

Here is the thread on the Sea Robin Curve

Dave

I think the best thing to do would be to create a separate zone for all of 
those ISRP meters.  The traders typically take deals from ISRP to the Pool 
and incur transport.  Therefore having two zone would more accurately 
represent what is actually happening.

I am in London helping Brent Price with some audit work that he is doing.

David

Imelda Frayre

05/03/2000 08:07 AM
Well, whenever we map specific meters on a zone to curves that are different 
than what the entire zone is mapped to, we create an alternative facility 
mapping for each specific meter that you want mapped differently.  Currently, 
there are 137 active meters on the Sea Robin Pool zone with a prefix of 
ISRP.  That would mean I would have to create 137 alternative facility 
mappings.  Another alternative would be to have all of those meters moved to 
their own zone and then just create one mapping for that whole zone.  
However, this will also take a great deal of time, since Global Facilities 
would have to change the zone on every single facility record.  Plus, we 
would have to see what type of activity is on all of these meters and we 
would have to update the zone on all of these deals after Global Facilities 
made it's change.  So, let me know what your thoughts are.  What are you 
doing in London???

Imelda
Imelda,

I am in London right now, and dont' have access to a phone.  The only part of 
Sea robin that should be moved are the meters with a prefix of ISRP.  I'm 
sorry if that wasn't clear.  Please let me know if that will be a problem to 
fix.

David

Imelda Frayre

05/03/2000 07:47 AM
David, Sea Robin Pool is a zone on the Sea Robin Pipeline (SEAR).  The Sea 
Robin Pool zone includes many different meters some of which do have a prefix 
of ISRP.  However, there are also other meters in that zone that have the 
following prefixes: LSRP, FSRP and PSRP.  I mapped the entire zone to the new 
curves you sent us.  Given your message it seems like things might not be 
peachy after all if you only wanted the ISRP meters mapped that way.  Please 
call me as soon as you get a chance.

Imelda Frayre
x35423
I am not sure if Searobin ISRP is a meter level location or Zone level, but 
as long as only Sea Robin Pool ISRP locations are mapped to the new curve, 
then everything will be peachy.

David

Dave - they called me on this to see if it was a meter mapping or a zone 
mapping.  I said zone.....

Imelda and Karie,

The East desk traders have asked me to set up a new curve for the Sear/Sea 
Robin Pool/ISRP zone.  The curve is already set up in Erms.  Please do your 
sitara voodoo to map the above location to this new curve.

I believe Kodak just doesn't support the USB connection very well.  I tried 
the other connection and it works great.  I pulled all the tractor pictures 
off the camera with no problem.  I still have not seen a photo as clear as 
the very first one Chance pulled up of the family reunion though.

All the tractor pictures are a little fuzzy.

Doug, I believe this invoice from Consumers should be paid by CES.  Cora gave 
a description of the invoice below.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks
Cora Pendergrass@ENRON

The title transfer fee is much like Michcon's in that if you move gas from 
one marketer to another such as Columbia Energy Services to TXU instead of 
nominating directly to the end user themselves they charge you a title 
transfer fee.  TXU is the agent for Dahlmer Chrysler who is CES' end user 
customer.  Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool 
DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler  they would not be charged the title transfer 
fee.   However since TXU is there agent and CES has to nominate to TXU  
(marketer to marketer) they are charge the fee.

I love my sweats.  Hows muffy?

achin@colcnr.com on 05/05/2000 09:39:44 AM
Could you provide me with this rate again this month, please?

Would you please write a description on how Consumers Energy works on the 
billing for title transfers?  I need to explain this to Doug Kenny still.

Thanks.

I'm about to set up 11 contracts on Trco for May.  There is no rush on 
setting these contracts up for Unify.

I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel 
waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.  Do I need to enter them on 
the secondary capacity deal ticket?

Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing 
from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport 
capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on? 

I think everything is OK now.  I set up deals 260724 (k#B00693026471), 260689 
(k# F01978) and deal 260712 (k#I00454).  I changed the end date for deal 
235701 (also k#B00693026471 - unpathed) to 4/30/00 and it still shows up in 
Unify for May.

Beavy, make sure you use the B*** k# with an MDQ of 9005 when you path May.

I was under the impression that the new services were set up by Sylvia.  She 
had discussed this several times with me in the last two weeks.  You should 
only have to set up new deal tickets with the new service effective 5-1-00 
and end the old tickets 4-30-00.
The new service types should be as the below example - The new service type 
is no longer "Transportation", it is now "Transportation-Pathed" for K# 
B00693026471.

 What do I need to do?  Should I end the exitsting contracts effective 
4/30/00 and create new ones effective 5/1/00?  Does Marlene need to create a 
new type of FT rate service to make these contracts appear different ( maybe 
that has already been done)?

necessary.

I have been speaking with Sylvia Campos on this.  Originally they wanted to 
do this via IT request which I thought would cause some problems. Since then 
they changed their minds and decided to so it Sonat style and merely create a 
different service type (so as not to change historically).  To my 
recollection that is the way that they were going and supposedly it was 
cleared with Connie Sutton.  So this reversal does somewhat surprise me.

DG & RP,

National Fuel says they are 100% using the GISB pathed model type.  Our Unify 
noms are non-pathed.

1) Can you look at the National Fuel invoice and verify that the accounting 
area will still work effortlessly if we change Unify to pathed.
2) If we elect to change Unify's model type to pathed, let's do it just like 
we did Southern Natural.  And, I would like this done for May 1 noms in 
production and have the Scheduler (Beverly?) path in this new model type 
manner.  We are suppose to be getting scheduled quantities in production 
starting tomorrow, unless ECOM prevents it, so you'll be able to see what the 
pipe expects in the pathed model type.
3) If we elect to NOT change Unify's model type to pathed, I guess we can't 
ever edi this pipe unless I can figure out some clever way to join up the 
noms.

Beverly, Do you think it would be a problem to start entering the upstream 
k's and downstream k's when you path in Unify.  The pipe told me this is 
mandatory data unless the nom is involved in the Appalachian area.  If it is 
a problem, don't do, I don't want to slow you down since you have to enter 
the data twice today.  If and when we do edi, we'll need the up/down k's 
entered at that time.

Thanks, Diane

Scott & Chris-

This is mainly just an FYI so everyone has all the same information.  Earlier 
today I had lunch with Ken Capp and Mike from CNG Sabine and they brought up 
the point that Enron is the only customer that is not using Sabine any 
longer.  Most of their customers are using a combination of Sabine (IHT 
Contracts) and CNG Transmission (TTT Contracts) for their daily business.    
Ken is concerned about losing Enron as a customer since in the past we did a 
lot of business through them.  Ken is now interested in doing some 
negotiating.  As of today, CNG Transmission will not be charging any fees 
until October at the earliest- if ever- for the service they are providing, 
but after October, the fee could be up to 84 cents per transaction, applied 
to the seller only.  Ken said that he would be willing to talk about lowering 
his rates for Enron if that's what it would take to bring us back into their 
customer list.  Of course, this is an exception to what they do for their 
other customers, so Ken is requesting that we keep this negotiation process 
confidential in the best interests of both parties.    If you have any other 
questions about this conversation, please let me know. 

Scott-  Ken's number is 713-752-4018, in case you don't have it.   

Just as a side note:  Ken also mentioned that they are looking into providing 
a hub service for Transco right now.

    Our model type is always "P" for pathed.

Just had a thought, according to Joanies worksheet, we can inject a max of 
1,210,121 into storage for the month of May.  For now, our target injection 
volume in storage for May will be 1,210,121.  When we overinject, like we did 
for the first four days, we need to decrease the volumes on deal 231214 for 
the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be 
1,210,121.

I will try to monitor the deal volume.

Thanks.

Seen this one?

I think Alicia fixed this last week.  Take a look and let me know.

David,

As per my conversation with Chris Germany on Friday, 04/28, we these volumes 
are only being billed under FirstEnergy.  Please make appropriate changes in 
Sitara.

Let me know if you need further information.

Thanks,
Jeff
	
	

Jeff,

Can you make sure that we aren't doubling a deal with Belden.  If not we will 
pay them 2.649.

Thanks,

David

	
	

Belden sold their Marketing company to FirstEnergy.  My sale to Belden for 
2,500/day TZ4 @ $2.649/Dth was part of that sale to FirstEnergy.

John,

Can you please help with this deal.  The original CES information shows a 
purchase from equitable and a sale to Belden at the price of 2.649.  Has 
First Energy bought Belden, or is the First Energy deal different.

Thanks,

David

Customer is short paying on deal 157848.  ENA billed 72,500 @ $2.76 and 
customer is paying at rate of $2.649.  As per Dcaf and Sitara rate should be 
IF-CGAS-Appalachia-MI which is equal ot $2.76.  Please confirm rate for this 
deal.

Thank you,
Jeff

It appears that the evergreen function on certain Transport contracts is not 
working.  Take a look at deal 98243.  I just had to extend the date for May 
31, 2000.

Tetco is going to start scheduling Lambertville.  Lambertvile is in Tetco M3 
(in New Jersey).  This means that anyone flowing gas through Lambertville on 
a secondary basis will probably strart getting curtailed.  Lambertville on 
Tetco will be just like Linden on Transco Z6.  

The following LDC's/points are downstream of Lambertivlle.  
E Town
N Jersey
PSE&G
Con Ed
Lilco
Bug
Belle Mead (interconnect with Transco)
Hanover (interconnect with Algonquin)

Leidy is considered upstream of Lambertville.  Also, deliveries to Algonquin 
at Lambertiville is considered upstream of the constraint.

Tetco will not give me any indication as to how much gas may be cut or how 
much secondary will be allowed to flow through Lambertville.

Meredith, when you get a chance, please confirm which points are downstream 
of Lambertiville.

CGLF contracts 66680 and 66681 ended effective 3/31/2000.

thanks

04/27/2000 06:05 PM
please get together so that we will have the appropriate forward quantities 
re: CES retail  in the book.
	
	

 Here's the first one that was sent to Mark F. on 3/1/00.
	
	

Mark,

We need to put the forward deal volumes in the books for the CES Retail term 
deal (for April 2000 forward) as soon as possible.  For your information, 
Chris Germany has the final spreadsheet that has all the term volumes and 
prices in it.  I discussed this with Scott Neal and, although CES has a 10% 
swing in the volumes they may nominate from month to month, he does want to 
put those index positions into the appropriate books at the levels provided 
to us by CES.  

Please talk to Chris before entering any of the East Desk deals, since he 
indicated that he may want to enter these deals because of the complexity of 
them; however, I want to make sure they get run through TAGG, etc.  Anyway, 
there are very few Central Desk deals and they definitely need to be put in 
by your group (I think you're the right one).  Again, those deals should be 
on the final Exhibit that Chris Germany can provide to you.  In addition, I 
received an e-mail from the Central region scheduler, Cora Pendergrass, 
showing their nominations for March--it will probably be a good idea to 
compare the Exhibit to what they gave us for March just to make sure things 
are matching up.  I'll e-mail that list to you separately.

If you have any questions or if I need to give this to someone else, please 
advise.

Has this been addressed?

Brenda H Fletcher
03/27/2000 11:53 AM
The invoiced rate on this contract is for  interruptible gathering but the 
information on the deal reflects a Firm contract. How do you suggest handling 
so the contract type, rate schedule and firmness are consistent with the 
pipeline?

Also, there are 10 contracts that we were invoiced for processing charges 
that are not on the Service List in Path Manager for Feb.
Are you working on getting contracts and deals added?

Thanks,
Brenda

They are all in really bad shape.  May is looking pretty good though.

Brenda H Fletcher
04/24/2000 11:58 AM
Jeanne, Terri and I need to begin comparing  the April Spreadsheets to the 
Demand Service P/L Report for flash purposes.  Please provide feed back as to 
current status of accuracy of spreadsheets.

Thanks,
Brenda

"Moths"

A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really
well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in
passionate love making.

The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, "quick my husbandjust got
home, go hide in the bathroom!" So the man runs into the bathroom.

Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. "Why are you
naked?" he asks.

Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here
and get ready to recieve you."

"Okay." the man replies "I'll go get ready."

He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a
naked man standing there clapping his hands.

"Who the fuck are you?" the man asks

"I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid
of the moths you are having problems with."

The husband exclaims, "But you are naked!"

The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.

"Those little bastards!"

Friends,
Greetings from India.  Just a brief update to let you all know what is
happening.  This week I finished a 3 week teaching course on the Book of
Romans, with 8 students from one of the schools in Kodai.  I think that is
the most exciting thing I have ever done in my life.  I asked the students
one day who lead them to Christ.  Everyone single one of them have been
saved through the ministry that I and Jonathan Daniels have been doing in
their school over the last year.  But what was even more exciting than that
was the fact that only one of them was from a Christian family.  All of the
others were from Hindu families, except one who was from a Muslim family.
That young man's name is Anifa.  He came to Christ through one of the
pograms I did last year at his school. In just one year he has grown so
much, and is known campus wide as young man of integrity and devotion to
Christ.  Already he has lead several other young men to the Lord.  Anifa
will honestly spend hours at a time waiting on God, and the whole school
knows that he is a man of prayer.  Recently Anifa asked me if I would teach
him how to preach, because he said he believes that God wants him to go back
and reach his people for Jesus.
Until Anifa shared his testimony with me, I was getting a little frustrated,
because I thought that in all of my time here in India, I had not won a
single Muslim to Christ.  Now I can leave Kodaikanal confidently, because I
have won one young man to Christ, and I know that he will win many others.
Please be praying for a team from North Texas District lead by John Bates,
and a team from San Antonio First Assembly of God lead by Andy Hostetler.
They will be coming in June and July.  We will be starting 2 new Churches,
and ministering in the schools.
And please continue to pray for the new Church in Shenoy Nagar that was
started last summer by the team from Southwestern.
I look forward to seeing you all this year.  Angela and I are praying about
God's direction for our future.  Please pray with us that for God's guidance
as we plan for our future together.  God bless.

Chad Germany

Please change the term on deal 143913 to evergreen.

Here is the segmented capacity volumes for May

Zone Master K# Volume  Segmented Contract
6-6 3.4367  40,000  3.4367 (ready to rock)

3-3 .7537  46,800  3.4620 (will execute last segments tomorrow)

3-3 .7537  100,000  3.4801(backhaul k) (will execute last segments tomorrow)

I did get the email.  I was looking right at it and couldn't see it I guess.

   
	
	

I believe Irena talked to everyone - just to confirm - we changed the meeting 
date/time -

Moved to Friday - April 28 a 11 am - EB2132.

	
	

Please plan to attend one more meeting on Thursday, April 27 at 11:00 am in 
EB2132 regarding changes to Sitara and Unify to accomodate transportation 
reimbursements systematically rather than spreadsheet based.  Please advise 
if you cannot attend.

Contract 230104 (deal 231301) does not exist.  The correct contract is 560104 
(deal 254262).  I just killed deal 231301.

thanks

Robert, our CNG/Cove Point meter is set up and we can fix the 19th.  I just

ENA has a put to COH (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day.  This deal was 
in the system for December and I just took it to 0 for the whole month.  I 
estimate we should make about $495,000 on the deal change.

Kimat, this deal also has a demand charge that ENA pays COH for the put.  I 
believe its in the deal correctly.

Alvin, please show this on the morning sheet as a "Put to COH at IF" or 
something real intelligent like that.

This deal goes thru 2/28/01.

Chris--see Melissa's note below.....per her note it would appear that part of 
the capacity we valued in the Wholesale book (not Retail) was not really 
capacity they owned.  Can you give me the details on this capacity--what term 
they gave it to us for, rate, receipt and delivery points, volume, etc.  Then 
we need to look at what impact it will have to take it out of the book.  
Thanks for the help.

Colleen,

As I understand it, we were acting as Agent for TCO capacity owned by Titanium

Wholesale book.  Could you please look into this on your end and let me know
how to best proceed with correcting this situation.

Thanks,

on an intraday and Joann uses storage to balance.  The CNG changes were made 
yesterday it sounds like.

I just sold intra day gas to CES on CGAS and CNG.  The CGAS deal is number 
250938, the volume is 257, the delivery point is BG&E, and the price is 
$3.53.  This deal is for 1 day only.  The CNG deal is 250897, the volume is 
51 to NIMO East and 211 to Peoples, and the price is $3.60.

Thanks

The GD Flat buyback from Adams at the TCO pool is deal 516555.  I created the 
deal with 0 volumes.

This is proof that we at least get reimbursement from ECT - Canada on the 
Boston Gas Transport.  I feel much better about this part.

Thanks Brenda.

We reimburse 89.27% of the total Tennessee and Iroquois charges unless 
Houston diverts to a more expensive place.  In that case we only reimburse 
per the maximum to Boston.

Well, just in that amount of time, I found out more about the deal....

I was inherited from CES.  CES had originally made the sale and when we 
bought their book of business, we ended up with that sale.  You may want to 
speak with Chris Germany about it, he was very involved with the CES 
assimilation.

Scott

Please unvalidate deal 229101 so I can change the buyer from ENA - Im Bug to 
ENA - Im Market East.

This transport contract is set up under ENA - Im Bug twice (deal 229101 and 
77563)

Thanks.

I also need to make sure the end term date on both deals is 3/31/2000.

We have our CES/Bug contract for May.  The MDQ is 103 dt and the contract 
number is 893255.

Robert, let's deliver 1,000 day to Cove Point off CGAS for May.  That should 
give us 812 day injected for May.

This may change after I chat with Laura at Cove Point.  I knew we could 
deliver 4,000 day for April but she never told me what we could do for May.

Ms.  Arnold called looking for the IF today.  She gets a much better response

UGI ships the gas for CES.  Normally we sell CES this gas at ELA.  It looks 
like it will be at CGLF Mainline for the next few months.  Doug will verify 
this information and let us know.

Got an fax from UGI saying that the capacity they release for our customers
will be on Gulf/Tco from May thru Sep. I believe this is a change from TETCO.
Call me if you need a copy of the fax.

that the attached file is archived on the network in P:\Energy

Just a note that the bill from TCO goes to Aristech and CES pays Aristech for
both demand and commodity. Any gas we buy from Enron should not include any
commodity costs. Thanks JPP

Joan.Veselack@enron.com on 04/20/2000 12:12:17 AM
Please respond to Joan.Veselack@enron.com

Kara, because we are close on the SST's max MDQ, we are going to use some
of Aristech's Capacity. Also, to be pro-active on the huge temperature
swings that we have been seeing on the weekends, we are going to do a 50/50
split with storage. Hopefully, this will prevent overrun charges and
overdelivery gas. Cross our fingers!!!!!!!!!  This has been approved
through Jeff Porter, the CES Choice God!!!!!

Also Joann Collins is on call this weekend. Friday is an "unofficial
holiday" for us. Joann will be in the office tomorrow morning to do Choice.

Contract Changes:

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for   4/3
(Intraday)     and 4/4  .    There are two worksheets:  The one labelled with
today's date contains the volumes that we need at each of the delivery points
indicated.   The schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas
is needed at a specific point.   The AGL volumes in this spreadsheet are not
current and should be ignored.

The sheet labelled 'Daily Change' shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in
the requested daily volume relative to a prior value.  For the current gas 
day,
the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using the previous day's
volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current gas day is 3/28, then
the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for 3/28).  For
tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the change is computed using
the First-of-the-month volumes requested for those days.  (e.g., If today is
3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect to the
first-of-the-month volumes for those days.)   This sheet should be useful in
determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that we take or turn back.

Responses:
1.  I'll let Kevin answer this one.  ANR and Michcon are Central Desk pipes.

2.  I would prefer to address all items on Exhibit 1.  If possible I would 
like to see the original Exhibit 1 volumes and updated Exhibit 1 volumes 
through March 2001.  However, I don't remember buying back any baseload gas 
on TCO for April.  I thought we priced everything at FOM IF and every day, we 
are buying back gas at GD - $.01.

3.  Are you doing a buy sell with Erron at the same price?  Does Duke bill 
CES directly for this?  

4.  See attached worksheets.

5.  I don't know all the information on the local production yet.  The 
pricing I'm currently using is the Exhibit 1 FOM deliverd pricing (pricing 
using ENA transport).  The attached April file has a Local Production tab.  
Molly Johnson is updating this information.  After she completes April, she 
will recreate Jan - Mar.

6.   Since the delivered pricing on TCO is the same, I'm not concerned about 
the individual citygate volumes.  For pricing purposes, I only care about 
total daily deliveries.   It would be a problem if you were trying to take 
additional gas from a non-constrained citygate to a constrained citygate and 
you don't have enough capacity.  This holds true for most other pipelines as 
well, Tenn Z6, CNG North Citygate, CNG South Citygate, ...  This would be a 
better question for Charlie to ask me when he is looking for something 
specific as it comes up.  The only thing I will not allow you to do is take 
gas from one pipeline to the other, Texas Gas Z4 to CGAS, and Colleen has 
discussed this with Melissa.

dkinney@columbiaenergygroup.com on 04/18/2000 09:40:36 AM
Chris--Below is a list of questions that we need to address fairly quickly.
Please look it over and let's talk.  The items are not prioritized in any way.

1-Enron's invoices show that for deliveries to Muncie (Indiana Gas) off ANR 
the
price index used is Michcon.citygate.GD.M.I.   The same is true for delivery
points into Michcon.   Is this correct, or are you actually using ANR ML-7 
plus
the Exhibit 1 increment applicable to Michcon?   Exhibit 1 specifies ANR ML-7
as the price index for Michcon.

2-CES has completely exited the following market areas/zones as of April 1:
TCO 6-11, TCO 6-12.   However, because Exhibit 1 contains projected volumes 
for
these two market areas in April 00, CES had to purchase from and resell to
Enron 90% of the April volumes contained in Exhibit 1.  Exhibit 1 contains
projected volumes for both market areas thru October 2000.   Are we required 
to
do a purchase/sell-back in each of these future months, or can we dispense 
with
this?  I refer you to Section 3.6 of the Gas Supply Assignment and Agency
Agreement (p. 11-12) as having some bearing on this issue.

3-The monthly volumes in Exhibit 1 off Iroquios into Central Hudson are
incorrect.  The 4,200 Dth is a monthly volume, not a Dth/day volume.  Since 
the
supply for this point is already arranged as a back-to-back with Duke Energy
and since Duke appears to be billing us directly for this gas, I do not intend
to do a simultaneous "buy/sell"  with Enron of the volumes in excess of the
(erroneous) Exhibit 1 volume.  If you disagree, let's discuss.

4-According to Exhibit 1, CES gets monthly capacity releases for TCO 4-21
(O&R),  TCO 7-3 (West Ohio), TGP Zone 6 (Boston Gas?), would you please 
provide
me with the Dth of capacity released to Enron as CES's agent on a monthly 
basis
for April at each of these points?   (I also need these numbers for January,
February, and March.)

5-How is the local production behind NYSEG, NFGD-PA, and CPA priced?

6-How will Enron invoice CES for daily swings on TCO in situations where gas
was merely being re-directed from one delivery point (where we were long for
that day) to another delivery point (where we were short)?

There will undoubtedly be other questions.  I will direct them to you as they
arise.

Thanks.

This morning, Roman Blake with CALP told Robin Barbe that CALP never received 
the payment for the wire transfer.  This is the first I've heard of this.

Mark, would you please verify that the payment went out.  I've copied Joanie 
because she talks to CALP quite often and I just want her to know what is 
going on.

Also, I have a copy of the March bill.  I will go through it today and give 
Mark a copy.

Thanks.

Well, now that I am somewhat settled into my new home (I'm still trying to 
hunt down a giant slip-n-slide for the backyard), it's time to throw a 
party.  This Saturday, April 15th at 7:30 pm, I will have my first official 
party to put the first beer stains on the new home.  Let's keep this pretty 
simple and painless, everybody just needs to bring a little something to 
drink and I will provide the rest.  I will have directions sitting on my desk 
to figure out how to get to Pearland, for all you inside the loop people 
don't be afraid, it's not that difficult and long of a drive.  

If you have any questions let me know and please pass this on to anybody I 
may have left off the list.

Hope to see you all Saturday,

Matt

Directions:

Take 288 S to the Pearland exit (CR 518) and take a left off the exit (going 
east).  You will stay on 518 for 1.2 miles.  After you come upon your third 
stop light you will make a right, this will be CR 90 ( there will be a strip 
mall on your right with a Domino's Pizza on the corner).  Travel on 90 for 
1.8 miles until you dead end.  This will take you to CR 101, which you will 
take a left on.  Stay on CR 101 for 0.4 miles until you see Kennedy Rd and 
take a left.  My house is the first house on your left-hand side once you 
turn onto Kennedy.  3606 Kennedy Drive   281-692-9255

Please add the following demand charges to the manual invoice.

Transport Demand $2,512,347.00
Sched Fee  $20,000.00

I may have included the scheduling fee in the manual invoice.

Jeff, I highlighted all items that need to be suspended or changed in 
yellow.   I'm still working on the purchases.  I do have 2 significant 
purchase items that I want to include on the manual bill.

AND, I'm still working on the pipeline demand charges.  I call you with that 
number.

Jeff, I have update this sheet for the actual storage to date.

I'm trying to keep this worksheet simple.  I added the actual numbers per 
navigator.  I think I need to add an Enron balance and a CES balance.  What 
do you guys think?

According to Ed Santa with Iroq, we paid the disputed parking for June 1999 
activity and we did not pay $860.00 of expnese in May 1998.  I not concerned 
about the June 1998.  Would you once again please verify what we paid Iroq on 
the disputed parking fee from May 1999 through July 1999?

thanks

I didn't call be cause I got home at 11:00 PM..  I though you might be 
asleep.

Seen this one?

Molly and I discovered that CES has about 1400 dt of Texas Gas Zone SL to Z4 
capacity each month.  Dayton releases this capacity to CES each month.  We 
have been using this capacity since Jan 1 to serve the CES Zone 4 markets.  
According to Steve, the primary path on this capacity is Zone SL to Dayton's 
meter in Zone 4.

I have been pricing all the Texas Gas Zone 4 at IF CNG App.  I believe we 
need to add a Texas Gas Zone SL IF  and make the premium $.01.

I have not brought this to CES's attention.  They will eventually catch it 
because we have been billing CES the transport demand charge.

Hey guy, please copy Scott Goodell and Molly on anything you send me in the 
future.  Molly will be working with me on all the CES deals.  Her email 
address is Molly.Johnson@enron.com.

Thanks

The attached file contains our daily volume requirements for    and  the
following day(s) as listed .    There are three  worksheets labelled as
follows:

'Total Reqs':  Contains the volumes that CES is requesting from Enron at each
of the delivery points and dates indicated in the columns labelled "NOM".   
The
Enron schedulers will want to check this sheet to see how much gas is needed 
at
a specific point.   The AGL volumes are not timely and should be ignored until
further notice.    CES schedulers note:  the attached file is archived on
P:\Energy Ops\Enron\April_00\Daily\ *.xls, so you don't have to save a
duplicate copy elsewhere on the network.
'Daily Change' :  shows the change (increase +/decrease -) in the daily volume
needed from Enron at the designated citygate delivery point relative to the
supply volumes arranged previously with Enron prior to the current date.  For
the current gas day, the change is an intra-day change and is calculated using
the previous day's volume request for the current day (e.g., If the current 
gas
day is 3/28, then the change is computed with respect to the 3/27 request for
3/28.  Note that this procedure assumes that the prior day supply change was 
in
fact effectuated).  For tomorrow's gas day and any subsequent ones shown, the
change is computed as the latest Dth Nomination requirement less the
First-of-the-month supply volume plus or minus any adjustments made since the
first-of-the-month to the FOM supply for the (future) days shown.  (e.g., If
today is 3/28, then the change for 3/29, 3/30, etc. is computed with respect 
to
the first-of-the-month volumes for those days adjusted for any additional
purchases or sell-backs since the first-of-the-month thru 3/27.)   This sheet
should be useful in determining prices for daily changes in gas volumes that 
we
take or turn back.   The column labelled "ENA Daily Swing +/- vs FOM volume'
shows the absolute magnitude of the daily swings allowed by ENA at
pre-specified prices.  Prices for Swing volumes exceeding these magnitudes or
for swings at delivery points without pre-specified pricing must be 
negotiated.
'TCO Storage':  Shows the daily swings taken by CES on its (paper) storage
injection for the month.    Daily swings on TCO storage may be used to meet
some or all of the daily swings at delivery points off TCO as shown in the
"Daily Change' worksheet.   Omitted pending resolution of TCO storage issues.

What happens if we sell CES spot gas??  It would be fixed price.

Maybe we could send CES a different type of report since they have so many 
deals.  What do you think??

   
	
	

How do you feel about not sending CES a confirm. unless the deal is for 
1month or longer?

I don't think CES has transport on these pipelines.

I should have February to you by next week some time.

Chris,
I am missing support for MICHON, AWGC, TRUNKLINE, WNG and NGPL.

Also, I can't remember when you said we would be getting Feburary.

Thanks for all your help.

Please change the zone location for meters T0012 and T0A62 from North Other 
to South Other.

Thanks

The meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.  Experience has taught me that 
someone much more important may bump us.

This meeting will focus on the CGAS storage contract.  What we bill CES for 
storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.  April is 
a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the 
same time.  CGAS only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.  The 
deals in Sitara are set up as CPR Storage for the injections and the 
withdrawals.

Which brings up the following issues;
 *   How do we bill CES for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with CES 
at the storage facility.
  Kate Fraser said there were never any BUG buy/sale tickets in Sitara for 
storage.  How did that work?  Mark, I'm counting on you for this one.

 * How do we track the storage balance in Unify?

 * How are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since CGAS will 
bill on the net injections/withdrawals

I'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting.

Thanks

FYI
	
	

Can you help with this Dayton issue?  This is the one we discussed where 
Dayton is saying there is a fixed price and we have it in the system at 
index.  Can I get a list of all Dayton sales for CES so I can try to match 
them up?

We need to determine if this is another data entry error, or if CES provided 
us with incorrect data, or if Dayton is wrong and this really is an index 
deal.
Thanks for your help.

This deal haunts us every month. Need someone to verify that CES GMS pricing 
equals Enron's Sitara pricing. 

Just a reminder, the GMS report I used from CES system only had volumes and 
no pricing. I ensured the physical volumes were correct. Commerical still 
needs to verify the pricing on the deals. I don't think this has been done 
yet.

CES DEAL TICKETS
gms ticket # = s-dpl-0070 
term = 12/1/98 to 5/1/2001
volume = 5000

gms ticket # = s-dpl-0079
term = 12/1/99 to 5/1/200
volume = 5000

ENA DEAL TICKETS
135702 = 5000.
It appears I changed volume to 0 on 2/29

145321 = 10,000
This ticket has been used for the total 10,000. This may be incorrect. (April 
forward deal # is 227296).

The physical total volume is correct in Sitara, not sure about the pricing.

Thank you for your assistance.

What should I tell the lawyer if she should call today?

Gloria will let us know which CNG contract to path this deal with.
The meter numbers are 50089201, 5105901, and 5118301 and this is CES

NO.  CALP is a wholesale contract. 

Brenda H Fletcher
04/11/2000 09:09 AM
Chris,
Do you invoice CES Retail for the monthly and volumetric demand paid by ENA 
to CALP?

Chris Germany
04/10/2000 06:09 PM
This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has 
changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 
- 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand 
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.

Which brings up 2 important points;
 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss 
this with CALP (and she may have already)
     However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.

 2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.

Comments/questions?

Chewies on the way!!!!

Hey Anita, I changed the price and attached is my calculation.  Your rates 
are close enough as far as I'm concerned though.

achin@colcnr.com on 04/11/2000 07:48:51 AM
I came up with $2.60218 on Cook School Road for March and $2.93210 for April
(using new fuel rate).  Maybe I'm calculating it wrong!  Tell me how you
calculated it.

For Nora I got the same rate you did $2.11

My worked.  How many times a week did you put down?

I need to talk about how to handle CES storage in Sitara and Unify.  

The people that need to be their are Jeff, Mark, Victor, and one ot the CGAS 
schedulers.  Please let me know if you can meet tomorrow afternoon around 
2:30 pm.

Everyone else is more than welcome to attend.  Please let me know if you will 
be attending.

I will schedule a conference room after I know who is attending.

Here is a quick and dirty worksheet.  I've been trying to come up with a 
total daily activity worksheet on "Sheet 2".  The storage numbers and choice 
numbers are on "Sheet 3" and the proxy numbers with the daily storage volumes 
are on "Sheet 1".

I faxed you the PSNC invoices for Jan and Feb.  They have a little comment on 
their that PSNC has not been paid for either month yet.  Give me a call once 
you get these.

error, will let you know.

Hey guys.   I have a ton of emails to plow thru with CES buy look what I 
found.  The CES storage proxy schedule is at the bottom.

Regarding your memo below, following is a status on those items:
1, 2:  The pricing and consistency in pricing for handling intra-month 
changes does appear to be an issue.  Since the contract didn't spell out in 
detail location by location pricing (and I think intentionally so), we 
believe the best way to handle this for April forward is to agree monthly 
(during bid week) of the process and pricing for each location.  I know Chris 
Germany has prepared a proposal that I think he has discussed (generally, not 
specific numbers) with Brian, Doug and Charlie.  I will ask that he forward 
this proposal TODAY and finalize the process for April ASAP.  Let me know if 
you do not think a monthly process of agreeing to the changes is sufficient.

3.  Local production - unfortunately I think we have opened a can of worms 
here.   Here is what is happening:  Your people are nominating this 
production (we are not even set up to do behind the citygate nominations), 
but the contracts were assigned to us in the Wholesale transaction.  That 
means they were valued by us and put into our system at a value.   We are 
reviewing this detail now and are finding quite a few discrepancies between 
the prices that were listed on the Wholesale Deal List and the actual 
contract prices with the producers.  So, this is one issue we will have to 
address as indemnification items.  That's problem one.  Problem two is that I 
am assuming you all would like this production back since you are doing all 
the nominations.  We need to work on a solution for doing this (if that is 
what you want).  For Jan, Feb & Mar, however, it appears that we will be the 
ones paying the producers, so we will need to get volume information from 
your schedulers in order to get this billed and payed for properly.   I'll 
follow up with more information on this in the next couple of days.

4.  Monthly invoices - regarding the pipeline demand charges, it sounds like 
Chris has been trying to verify all the charges before he sends copies of the 
pipeline invoices on to you.  Maybe we should change this process to one 
where he sends them to you as soon as he gets them instead of waiting on his 
confirmation and review of all the charges.  This means you may see quite a 
bit of incorrect data, but at least you'll have something.  Let us know what 
you would prefer.  Regarding the January invoice specifically, I do know that 
the Columbia Gulf and Columbia Gas packet of pipeline invoices was mailed to 
your office yesterday, March 29.  Chris will get all remaining demand charge 
statements to your office by Wednesday, April 5, and all corrections he is 
aware of as of this date by Friday, April 7.  I apologize for the delay.

5.  Swap confirmations - I spoke with Jeff Hodge and he believes he has a 
packet of all the confirms--he is in Calgary today and will be back on 
Monday.  Is that soon enough for this to be sent to you?  If not, please 
advise and I'll see if his assistant can search for this data.

Thanks for clarifying the storage proxy schedule with the remaining inventory 
balances.

Colleen,

Attached is an updated storage proxy schedule for COH and AGL showing what our
balance will be as of April 1, 2000.  As always, if you have any questions,
please let me know.  I'm sending a copy of the document to Denny Pick for
signature and will then send it to Jeff Hodge to get signature from Enron.

Aside from the storage issue, there are several other items that we need to
discuss.  Below is a brief description of each.  Please let me know how you
think we could best deal with these - whether it's via phone call or having an
in-person meeting down in your office.

1.  Pricing - I left you a message about this last week.  According to Chris
Germany, all changes to volumes after first-of-the-month must me negotiated.
In the contract, however, it specifically refers to pricing intra-month using
gas daily OR negotiated pricing depending on the timing of the change.

2.  Consistency - During our discussions with Chris, it sounds as though some
pipes are being handled differently than others again as it relates to
intra-month changes.  I'd just like to make sure that we agree on the pricing
mechanism and then apply it consistently.

3.  Local production - Apparently there was local production that John Singer
purchased specifically to back Retail customers, and this production was not
removed from the Wholesale book prior to the sale.  We need to discuss how to
handle this production.

4.  Monthly invoices - We still haven't seen the complete January 2000
invoice.  As I understand it, the demand charges have not all been sent over,
and several items that need to be changed haven't yet been changed.  Also,
Brian Perrone and Charlie Dalphon have indicated that they have requested
back-up documentation on the demand charges, but we still haven't received
anything.

5.  Swap confirmations - For all of the swaps that Clay Deaton put in place
with Enron to keep Retail's existing hedge positions in tact, I still do not
have executed copies of all of the confirmation agreements.  Rich Contos and I
have both called several people about getting a complete set of copies, but we
can't seem to find the right person over there.

Whenever you have time to discuss these, please let me know.

Thanks,

Melissa

This is a good time to bring this up.  Unless the original CES agreement has 
changed, ENA will pay CALP a monthly demand charge of $103,417 from 1/1/2000 
- 4/30/2000.  From 6/1/2000 - 7/7/2000, ENA will pay a (volumetric) demand 
charge of $.02/mmbtu to CALP for any volumes utilized by ENA.

Which brings up 2 important points;
 1.The month of May has not been addressed which means Robin needs to discuss 
this with CALP (and she may have already)
     However, currently we will not be showing any demand estimates for May.

 2.  It's a new ball game starting 7/8/2000.

Comments/questions?

Brenda H Fletcher

This contract is on the ECT April spreadsheet under CES Wholesale.  What is 
the relationship between ENA and Commonwealth Atlantic?
(Who pays transport invoice?  Any reimbursements?)

Thanks,
Brenda

I am taking off half a day PM on Dec 29th and Jan 1st - 3rd.

Please put this on Dicks calendar and the desk calendar.

Hey guys.  I'm cleaning up my emails and I don't know if this was ever 
addressed.

My sources tell me this means NIMO will continue to assign CES CNG capacity 
unless CES can prove they have primary firm to NIMO.  What I'm not sure of is 
will NIMO start assigning CES the upstream Tetco capacity.

Scott, who at CES worked with NIMO on the capacity elections?

Molly LaFuze

Does this affect us?  If so, how?  Thanks Chris.

hboyd@columbiaenergygroup.com on 03/10/2000 07:58:31 AM
Hi Molly,

I don't know if this will effect Enron or not - I don't even know if Columbia
Energy had any firm capacity off of CNG released through NIMO, but just in
case, I though you might like to know about this.

Sorry I am not much of a help here.

Thanks!

than I wanted to .  Live and learn.  Ankle is doing ok.  I wear an ankle

Hey Anita, I apologize about the delay.  I have a lunch meeting with CES and 
I will call you after lunch.  I do have the fax you sent.  What is you phone 
number?

achin@colcnr.com on 04/10/2000 10:17:14 AM
I received faxes (Enfolio Spot Confirmations) on the above agreements with 
Enron
that show as follows:

East Tennessee Rate:  $2.6264 per MMBtu

Cook School Road Rec. Sta:  CNG Index minus $0.125

Are these the rates I should use to invoice Enron for these agreements?

I need to get the invoices to Sandra at Enron today, if you could get back 
with
me ASAP, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,

Anita

I have my 1st therapy (physical not mental) session tomorrow at 3:00 PM and 
the lady said it would last for 1 1/2 hours.  Matt, why don't you go in my 
place, that sounds like it is going to hurt..

However, Scott Goodell will be here AND we have new and improved smaller 
cubes now.  

Hey fellas,
I'm going to a meeting in your building tomorrow at 2:30 p.m.  If time
allows, I would like to stop by and visit each of you after the meeting.
I've never seen your workstations (?) before.
ii

Kay, I have a conference call with 2 of our outside attorneys at 2:00 PM on Monday so I may not be there.  I also sent the first response to Donna Greif, Kevin Brady's manager.

You gave me 2 invoices for CNR that are not on your April 2002 payment worksheet.

Producer	Volume		Amount
J E Harris	815		$260.80
Carol Littleton	748		$239.36

Should I toss these 2 invoices or should they be included in the list?

Name			Company			Number		Comment
Toby Lester		FPL Energy Services		561-625-7020	Small player but they may sleeve some volumes for you.
Scott Garrison		Entergy-Koch			713-544-4999	I don't think I spoke to this guy.  I can't remember.
Jim Taylor		Reliant Energy			713-207-1482	See note below.
[Germany, Chris]  
Nelson Ferries	Duke Energy			713-989-0725	Nelson never told me that he wouldn't do any deals so you might get something going.
 

Reliant Energy.  I would like to talk to Reliat if you want to do something with them.  I currently have a cash balance of $228,000 with Reliant.  We are going to send them and invoice for $156,000 for sales ENA made to Reliant.  That will leave me with about $71,000 and maybe we can do something to work it off.

Cinergy will not trade with Enron.  Robin Barbe's contact told her they would not trade with us regardless.

 

I didn't make tooo many changes.  Take a look at Florida and Koch.

Fantastic.  You behave yourself and try to get us jobs TOO!!!!!!!!!!

Hey Ya'll,

Just wanted to let ya'll know that I am employed now!!  Yeah!!!!  I am going
to be a Algonquin Gas Scheduler for Duke-Energy!  I am so excited and
relieved.

Hope ya'll have a great Christmas!

Keep in touch,

Sign us up.  BUT, I may be WHO KNOWS WHERE sowing all my wild oats with half naked Brazilian women.  I don't have that many oats left anyway, it could just be an oat.  By the way, Suzanne made a Second Baptist comment to me yesterday when I was talking to Robert.  I can't remember exactly what she said but I sure do wish you wouldn't tell her anymore STUFF about us.  I finally figured out that her and Jim are very similar.  Information is power that they can share with others, even useless trivia information about friends.  I don't think either one of them mean any harm, they just can't keep their big mouths shut.

I'm off to another wild day of tariff review.  Call me when you can, it brightens my day and wakes me up!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Howdy. 
Suzanne left me a VM today.  She wants to know if we will come over for New Year's eve dinner.  It would be her, Kevin, Bob Superdi and his wife, and us.  Sounds good to me.  What do you think??  I should probably give her a response.

Why don't you guys plan an evening in Houston and I'll show you the trade floor.  I really prefer to do it after 5:30 these days.  It doesn't have to be this week, I was just thinking about it.  Maybe I'll get a free meal off of both of ya!!!!!!!!!!

NO - we are not going anywhere afterwards to look at HALF NAKED BRAZILIAN WOMEN WOOOOOOOOOHOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

You are both a bad influence on me already.

This is what I have so far for Wholesale East TPort.  I need to research the rest.

 

I really need to chat with the pipeline on this one but this is my best guess right now.  This gas was parked at Bear Creek on a Tenn park and loan contract.  It is scheduled to come out on Sonat.  To my knowledge, we don't have any Sonat demand charges.  But our monthly demand charge expense on Tenn is at least $376,000.00, mainly due to the Boston Gas netback deal.  I think Tenn would make us prepay the Tenn demand charges to get this gas out of the park & loan on Sonat.

We have 500,000 that was scheduled to come out in December on Sonat.  I have no idea how Tenn/Sonat will bill us for this contract going forward.

We currently have 2 park & loan deals with Colubia Gas.

Deal 1) we have 310,000 that was scheduled to come out in December, contract #67401, we are currently paying $8370.00 per month on this deal.

Deal 2) we have 310,000 scheduled to come out in January 2002, contract #70457, we are currently paying $16,740.00 per month.

I have not spoken to the pipeline but I believe we would have to prepay all of our transport demand charge expenses before CGAS will let us schedule any of this gas.  Our monthly demand charge expense is $290,000.00.  I would also assume that we would have to prepay the EES demand charges as well.

No Burt Shears in our phone dirctory.  I also tried searching for just
"Burt" and "Bert" and nothing came up with the last name sounding, feeling,
looking, or smelling like a "shears".

When you have time can you see if you have a phone number (somewhere at
Enron) for Burt Shears.  A lady I work w/ needs it.   (it is a friend of
hers - I think.) thanks

This is what I see so far for Ogy for May.  We need to buy the imbalance back that was created on the 3rd but we can chat later.

 

I do not know which, if any, of you guys is the right one to note this, but=
 I wanted to forward for the appropriate person's attention.  If not you, c=
ould you please advise me of the right Enron person.

That said, I recommend that the person within Enron responsible for this de=
al make sure that liability to Enron under the fuel  management deal be ful=
ly understood.  We are doing what we can to minimize penalties or costs, bu=
t we are quite limited in options due to the bankruptcy.  Please let me kno=
w your thoughts.

Regards,
Ed  =09

Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days.  I hope we don't=
 need. =20

Events of June 3

Gas service to the plant has been challenging.  Lonestar Pipeline is runnin=
g a pig for June 4,5,&6.  Lonestar told us that roughly 60% would be cut. A=
pparently Friday, May 31, Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti=
es the maintenance information.  He also indicated that our Lonestar=09rep =
said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system =
was Lonestar-Carthage and Lonestar-Katy Plant.  Neither of the plant's supp=
liers -Apache/Cinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day =
June 4.   Cuts did occur as we were warned.  Of the total nomination of 45M=
M, 17.1 MM flowed for today's gas flow.  The supplier breakout is Apache/Ci=
nergy -20MM and  Williams-25MM.   Yesterday, Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t=
hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for today's =
flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June 5 & 6.=20

I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June 3.  I =
also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a back-up.  The plant ca=
n burn No.6 low sulfur fuel oil.  Mike indicated that the plant would not w=
ant to do that and hadn't burned oil in quite some time.  I told Mike that =
I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera=
ge with the suppliers.  He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t=
he plant.  I told him that I =09wasn't familiar with Lonestar specifically =
but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a =
plant of it's size they probably have remote control capabilities.  If not =
they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve=
.

The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language.  Th=
e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right =
to choose the supply point/points into Lonestar's system from a list of pri=
mary or secondary points in Exhibit A.  If the plant's transportation contr=
act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in=
to Lonestar's system at a location that will flow on the plant's transporta=
tion agreement.  If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig=
ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels.  Yeste=
rday, I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at=
 Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy.  T=
om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didn't have =
a copy of the amendment.   Sounds like the amendment may have changed some =
of the delivery points.  I told Tom at Cinergy that =09my primary concern w=
as flowing gas supply to the plant.  Tom was suggesting that this may be a =
force majuere event.  I told him I didn't interpret=09the force majuere lan=
guage that way.  The force majuere language addresses freeze-offs and line =
breaks but not maintenance.  I also told him that the contract has a provis=
ion for transportation interruption. =20

In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op=
erational issues and not monetary issues.  I told him we could address the =
=09financial resolution per the contract after the event was over.  I told =
him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min=
imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th=
e pipe cutting back their gas supply.=20

   =20
Events of June 4

This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy.  They are supplying 1=
2.9MM at Aquila-Katy into Lonestar for June 5.  Williams is buying 10MM at =
Carthage and 5MM at HLPL for June 5.  Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju=
ne 5.  Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June 4 =
after the pigging was completed.  They will  pay back the volume ratably fo=
r the remainder or in a day. =20

Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around 12:30 to say the plant needed=
 to cut back to the 17.1MM flowing gas volume for today.  The plant's burn =
rate was causing the pig to run to fast.  Russ is the manager of the transp=
ortation administration department at Lonestar.  I called Russ back at 1:10=
pm to inquire about the problem.  I asked him to call gas control and see w=
hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could=
 bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem.   I also called Mike =
to inform him of the new events.  Russ called back and said the run would b=
e over at 12:00pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul=
d help was El Paso Field Services-Ennis.  He also indicated that the pressu=
re had stabilized and the plant may be able
to make it through the run without the incremental gas.  I called Cinergy a=
nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point. =
 Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou=
ld let me know.  At 3:30 Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and=
 the cost would be $0.95 to $1.00 more than the contract price.  She said t=
hat they didn't think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested=
 meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract.  They would buy =
the gas if we would agree to pay the price.  I called Mike at White Pines a=
nd ask him what he wanted to do.  He indicated that he wanted us me to buy =
the gas.  I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the n=
om.  Russ said the plant was burning more.  Now they were burning 48MM and =
requested they cut back to their nominated volume of 45MM.  I told Russ I d=
idn't think that they could be I would call.  Mike confirmed that they coul=
d not.  He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off eve=
n 20 to 30 MW.  He said Brazos is "playing chicken" and are requesting ever=
ything they have.   I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get =
them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the co=
ntract after the pigging event is completed.  I called Michelle with my pro=
posal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back.  We=
 agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after =
the event was over.  Michelle called back and said the gas was going to com=
e from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered.=
 =20

Events of June 5

The plant made it through the June 4 gas day on gas.  I spoke with Michelle=
 and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June 6 the sa=
me as June 5.  She said that Apache didn't think they were liable to make u=
p the gas they shorted us for June 4.  She said I could talk with Pat Green=
 at Apache regarding the issue.  Williams moved their gas from Carthage to =
HPL for June 6.  I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the poin=
t.  I requested that =09Kevin do the same with his Lonestar contact.  Neith=
er of us has had a return call from our corresponding Lonestar counterparti=
es.  We will have to address the =09issue intraday if necessary.
=09
I will keep everyone posted of any new developments.

You must be busy today.

Looky at what I just opened in my email.  I had some stuff tucked away in a different directory and I'm going thru it now.  Does this still need to be addressed?

Hey Chris,

Does this amount look correct to you??  Do we actually owe New Power $5MM ?  they haven't mentioned it to me, but it's showing up as a balance due to them.  could you please verify ASAP?

Thanks!

Greetings,

Thanks for the TV. and Jaime also said Thanks for the bed room suite.
Chris, I found Dad's old pistol.  It was under the dresser in his bed room.
I placed it in the linen closet third shelf from the top, back left.  It is
captured in a pistol storage case.  I stuck it in behind the sheets and
things.  I saw Chad and Angela on my way out.  They are a great couple.
Jerry, I am going to be very busy with the scrap here at work.  I am going
to get in touch with Gerald and you and him can work out the agreement if he
wants to lease Dad's pasture.
As I stated he will pay $20/acre per year.  You had said we do not want to
pay for a fence along the creek.  When I have leased places in the past I
have had to build new fence at my own expense.  Most folk's base their
cow/calf operations on a five year program/depreciation.  If I built fence
and that particular piece of property sold before the five years was up,
then I was reinversed the balance of my initial fence/material investment,
excluding my labor.  Something to think about.  I hope we do not own that
place for five more years.  Gerald also said he would mow the grass around
the house and sort of keep the place tuned up.

Ma fell Saturday Night and busted her forehead.  They placed her in
Angleton/Danbury for overnight observation.  I think she required about
seven stitches in her head.  There were x-rays taken and her lungs are
pretty much gone.  Of course, that depends on how well the x-ray tech can
read his prints.

Stopped by and saw Bernie Max.  Now where did they come up with a name like
that?  They removed the lymph glands from his neck.  Starting down the torso
just at the left collar bone, a width of about three inches go down the
torso about six or seven inches.  A triangle shape about the size of a piece
of large pizza.  The incision must have been about 1.5/1.75 inches deep into
his body.  The doctor told him it was only fatty tissue.  They took a pretty
big chunk out of his chest.  He had a six " x eight " piece of skin removed
from his left thing for a skin graft.  It looked pretty painful.  He was in
good spirits and bull corning around.

I guess that is about it.  I would like to have a timber appraisal performed
on the Dad's place.  I'll be chatting with you guys.  Oh, I forgot the dang
remote to the TV.  I really was not for sure which one it was.  I think I
need it to program the darn thing.  Keep your powder dry.

Y'all be safe,

don

Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed
by Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a
termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't
include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting
with Mary.  IF Mary agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original
agreement.   I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this
lawyer the happier I will be.  BE NICE NOW.

Things are always crazy around you, even when the rest of the world is sitting still.

not a one.  i don't even have a phone yet.  We moved into a new office today
(my first day) so things are a little crazy around here.

How many deals have you done????

How many deals have you done????

Chris
	This in my new email address

A man was stopped by a game-warden in Northern Michigan recently with
two
buckets of fish leaving a lake well known for its fishing. The game
warden
asked the man, "Do you have a license to catch those fish?"

The man replied to the game warden, "No, sir. These are my pet fish."

"Pet fish?!" the warden asked.

"Yes, sir. Every night I take these here fish down to the lake and let
them
swim around for a while. I whistle and they jump back into their
buckets,
and I take em home."

"That's a bunch of hooey! Fish can't do that!"

The man looked at the game warden for a moment, and then said, "Here,
I'll
show you. It really works."

"O.K. I've GOT to see this!." The game warden was curious, now.

The man poured the fish in to the lake and stood and waited.

After several minutes, the game warden turned to the man and said,
"Well?"

"Well, What?" the man responded.

"When are you going to call them back?" The game warden prompted.

"Call who back?" The man asked.

"The fish." replied the warden.

"What fish?" The man asked.

We are still together.  But you just wait, there is still time, especially since I went to church twice yesterday and she didn't want to go at all.  She's a heathen like you.

Have you an your Woman broke up yet.  Normally takes about 2 days after dinner
with us.  Man the meal and company was excellent.  I enjoyed myself greatly.
Especially after you picked up the tab.

Looks like we are getting another $5,000.00 from the asbestos settlement.
Maybe I should just keep this to myself.  I'm so poor and I need so much.

Don, why don't I mail this other ag exemption to you and you can fill it
out just like the first one you sent in?  What mailing address should I
use?

I'm going to the doctor this afternoon for my allergies.  I hate getting
old.

Sounds like they are having fun!  I lucked out, I have a doctor appointment at 2:15 PM today.  This is with my specialist up on 1960.

Hey buddy, this is out of a Duke Energy newsletter.  I'll just give you the highlights.

Duke Energy acquired Market Hub Partners Storage (MHP) from subsidiaries of NiSource, INC.  MHP currently operates 2 facilities.  The Moss Bluff facility in Liberty County, Texas, and the Egan facility in Acadia Parish, La.

I have never used Moss Bluff, I know it interconnects with Tetco in Stx.  I like Egan - it hooks up with ANR, Tex Gas, Tenn, CGLF, and Trunkline.

I am a proud papa!  She's so cute too!

What are you doing in CT?  I thougt you were in  CA?

Things are going ok for me.  Me and my "Woman" (we are not married - yet) are living in an apartment near Kirby and Westheimer.  I'm tired all the time anymore - not from staying up with the baby, that's woman's work.  I'm reading a Tom Clancy book and I can't put it down.

Congrats on the new baby! You must be a very proud papa!
 
Hope all is well with you. Drop me a line when you get a free moment.
 
Ami
 

YOU BET.  I'm going to work out after work, go home, get comfy clothes, go by Walgreen's for drugs, pick up a "guy" movie, then drop by the immer palace.

Can I make you soup for dinner tonight, if I promise it has meat in it? 

We may be dining with my brother and Sister in law tomorrow around 6:30 PM.  Comments ???? Questions????? 

It is over with.  The addendum may or may not be signed and its a seperate document and I will personally pay for all legal cost incurred regarding the addendum.  But the other documents are in route to me, i get it, i sign it, you and donny sign it, i send it back, waaaala!!  The lawyer told that once the documents are filed with the courthouse then everything becomes ours (I don't call the lawyer anymore because her time is "billable")  I don't think its that simple though.  What do you think?

So what are you doing this weekend?

Hey,

If some where down the line they want to excerise this right, then we worry
about it.  I say we worry about it for the next  five years then let whom ever
has  a problem with this hire a lawyer for the rest.   What you say BUB.  Lets
just get this over with and move on with life.   See Ya.

Chris.Germany@enron.com on 05/10/2001 03:58:53 PM
Spoke to Carrie at the lawyer's office today.  Everything has been signed
by Mary and Carrie will mail me the originals to sign.  I asked about a
termination ont he $1500.00, Joal told Carrie that since we couldn't
include it in this agreement since we didn't agree to it in the meeting
with Mary.  IF Mary agrees, they will prepare and addendum to the original
agreement.   I've learned a lot and the sooner we are through with this
lawyer the happier I will be.  BE NICE NOW.

The sale to PSE&G is in the New York book.  Judy is trying to get Transco to bill PSE&G directly for the demand charge.  We are still waiting to hear from Transco.

A physical forward deal with the reimbursement amount entered as an external fee in Sitara.  PSE&G would be buyer and TP-2 is seller (assuming this is a TP-2 deal).    What is the term of this deal?  Is commodity reimbursed also? Please confirm desk , provide details and I will enter the deal.  

Thanks,
Brenda

   

I just added the PSE&G demand charges on Transco to our capacity worksheet.  The net impact is $0 because I'm also showing this as a reimbursement.  How should we put this in Sitara.  I'm showing a transport demand charge on the capacity deal ticket.  How do we get the money back from PSE&G?

We sold the National Fuel back to the Canadian desk for June at NX1 + $.235.  The volume is 9189 per day, deal ticket 782980.

Kimat, please forward to the Canadian Book Admin.

Mr. Homco will have to answer that one.

I'll handle it from here on the volume.  Thanks!  I assume that after that, it's ready to go?

   

Demand charges are showing up now.  We still have a problem with the 9th (4500 @ $5.445), this should not be on the invoice.  My Transco scheduler has informed me that they have taken the volume to 0 in Unify and that this item will need to be "actualized" 0 by volume management.  I don't know how that part works.

Dara, are you volume manangement??

On the 8th TP2 sold VNG 10,000 dth at st 65.  This volume was entered on deal 760980, which is a VNG buy from Gulf 1.  I took the volume on this deal to 0 for the 8th and created deal 780794 (VNG buy from TP2 at St 65).  Please make a note in you files.

Meredith, you will need to repath these deals on the 8th.

Thanks

I guess you don't have pictures for me do you?  I saw Traci Wood Tuesday evening at a little resteraunt on Westheimer called Paulie's.  Do you care?

Thanks

Darla Saucier@ENRON
05/09/2001 11:14 AM
Any updates???

   

I added the demand charges but I still need one of my Transco schedulers to remove the volumes "actualized" on the 9th.

Natural Gas Futures End Higher

    Natural gas futures on the NYMEX closed higher yesterday as traders
sought to cover their short positions due to a feeling that the market was
oversold following the steep decline of the last several days. The June
contract climbed
$0.04 to $4.279 per MMBtu. June rose $0.039 to $4.353 per MMBtu. The market
was basically just marking time until the AGA releases the latest storage
injection figures this afternoon. The AGA is expected to announce an
addition to storage of about 100 Bcf. A somewhat lower injection could spark
a rally because the market has already discounted a triple digit build.
However, an injection of over 115 Bcf could send the market to $4.00 in a
hurry. A year ago, stocks for the same week rose 58 Bcf, and the five-year
average injection is 61 Bcf. Since the AGA began reporting storage data, the
highest ever recorded was 78 Bcf in 1998. If current weather models hold up,
the Midwest and Texas will escape much of the summer's hottest temperatures,
and right now, temperatures are mild across most of the nation. Look for
technical support at the $4.20 level, and resistance is expected at $4.40.
Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada generally slipped
$0.10  $0.15 per MMBtu yesterday, except in the west where most spot prices
rose due to hot weather. Natural for next day delivery at the Henry hub
dropped $0.12 to $4.21 per MMBtu.

Enron's Lay Calls for Open Access to Transmission Grid

    Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, says that generators should have easier
access to the power grid. Lay spoke after receiving the US Energy
Association's 2001 US Energy Award, saying that today we don't have open
access to the transmission grid, and we could get more power into the West
if we had open access. He says the FERC should open up the power grid
throughout the nation so generators no longer have to pay a series of
separate fees to move electricity from one region to another. He also says
FERC has the authority to open up the power grid in the same way that
natural gas pipeline transmissions work. It's clear we've under-invested in
energy infrastructure in the last 10 to 15 years, and it's going to take a
few years to correct that.

Kinder Morgan and Calpine Offer 2 Open Seasons
for Sonoran Pipeline

    Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Calpine have announced that two open
seasons have begun and will continue through June 1st on the recently
announced Sonoran Pipeline.  A binding open season is being held on Phase
One of Sonoran - which would run from the San Juan Basin in New Mexico to
the California border - to give shippers the opportunity to commit to firm
capacity on the pipeline.  A non-binding open season is being held
simultaneously on Phase Two of the project - which would extend the pipeline
from the California border to the San Francisco Bay area - to give potential
shippers the opportunity to express their interest in obtaining firm
capacity to California delivery points.  Sonoran has received a binding
commitment from Calpine Energy Services for 400,000 Dth per day on Phase One
and a non-binding commitment for 500,000 Dth per day for Phase Two. The
proposed pipeline will be a 1,030-mile, high-pressure interstate natural gas
pipeline from the San Juan Basin in northern New Mexico to markets in
California and is projected to be in-service date by the summer of 2003.

Power Suppliers to Meet with California Governor

    Executives from energy suppliers are meeting with Californias governor
today, and several are willing to discuss concessions that include price
limits on power sold within the state. Last week the governor said he would
seek to force the suppliers to accept reduced payment for billions of
dollars owed by the states utilities. In the face of a state investigation
into alleged market manipulation, some generators are willing to discuss
limits on prices for some electricity sold to the state. Williams says it is
prepared to support temporary price controls that would extend through the
summer of 2002. Williams is also willing to discuss a range of possible
alternatives for repayment of past debts owed to it. Reliant will reiterate
an earlier offer to sell some electricity to the state at $20 per MWh if the
buyer will pay for the natural gas to generate the power. Duke Energy has
proposed accepting less than full payment for power sold to the state in
return for an end to state and federal investigations into the prices they
charged. Duke, Enron, AES, Dynegy, Mirant, El Paso Energy, Reliant, and
Williams will all send executives to Sacramento to the meeting.

BULLS CAUTIOUS
In spite of slip sliding natural gas prices, analysts are still cautiously
bullish. There seems to be little incentive to abandon the bullish cause
with the prospects of hot summer weather looming."This is a weak market, but
I think that below $4.60 you have to anticipate the return of industrial
demand. It's really a wild card as to whether that demand will take the edge
off the current large injections. Over the past month, the market has gone
through a major change. Production has increased, storage  is higher, and
the injection last week at 102 BCF was the largest since June of 1998,' says
George Ellis, broker analyst with BNP Paribas, New York. "I was skeptical of
 the whole concept of demand erosion, but it's obviously real and when you
combine that with an increase in production, the supply demand balance
becomes clear. There is potentially more room to the downside, but the wild
card is weather and if that kicks in, prices could move sharply higher. If
prices fell to $4.38 then that would be a reason to put on another 25%
hedge. As long as we're holding these prices I think there's a good chance
prices will rally higher. I'm cautiously bullish. I would not be an
aggressive seller," he said.

Blackouts Hit California Again

    California residents suffered through a second day of rolling blackouts
yesterday as temperatures soared, driving demand ahead of supply. The
California ordered that as of 3:10 PM the state's utilities must cut 400 MW.
Blackouts had been forecast by the ISO since early in the morning with the
heat coming at a time when many power plants are still off-line for
maintenance. The Los Angeles Department and Power, was as usual was excluded
from the blackouts. The LADWP is not under the ISO's control and has more
than enough generation to meet its demand. The ISO said demand was running
about 1,000 MW above Monday's levels. Earlier Tuesday, the ISO had projected
blackouts could be ordered before noon, but the return to service of two
500-kilovolt lines operated by BC Hydro meant more power was able to flow
south. About 700 MW produced by small suppliers, known as Qualifying
Facilities, are currently offline because they have not been paid. The hot
temperatures are likely to continue today, with the threat of more
blackouts.

AND, I want to hold back $79,000 of revenue on deal #401601.

The customer price is $5.7025 which is based on the following

Sales Price		$5.4850
Transport to Stoi	$.1526  (I included $.0147 too much by accident)
Storge Injection		$.0249
Capacity Demand	$.0400

Total Price		$5.7025

We will overinject in October by about 362,000 dth to max out storage by Oct 31.  Since we will not estimate the transport expense until Oct, I want to hold back roughly 362,000 dth x $.2175 = $79,000.00  (close enough).

Thanks

Hey.  I went on a company outing to Aransas Pass last week.  Left Wed afternoon and got back Friday afternoon.  One of the pipelines I deal with has a hunting and fishing lodge down there.  It was nice.  I caught 2 redfish - both keepers too!  The guide would bait my hook and throw it in the water.  All I had to do was sit there and look pretty till the fish started biting.  I could really get used to that sort of thing.

The fishing guide said I should expect to pay about $1,000/ft for my fishing boat.  I guess my boat will only be about 4 ft long.   Keep looking for my BOAT.

Let's see - the ex wife came in from Denver for a wedding Friday night.  She stayed with me all weekend.  I took her to the airport this morining.  Things went pretty well - no romance, just good friends.  I introduced her to my girlfriend - we all had lunch together.  That was a little odd.

Nothing else going on.  I'll try to have an update on the legal stuff by Wed.

Later Gator.

BETH!!!  Donna!!!   Welcome to the party!

Wade, I don't know how to handle these deals in Sitara or Tagg but I bet someone on this distribution does.  

1.  Does anyone have any idea on how to stop deals 340305 and 332163 from creating an invoice each month?

2.  There are deal volumes in Sitara for the East, Central and West desk.  Should these volumes be zeroed out or should we just focus on keeping tagg updated and not worry about Sitara?  Maybe someone is working on the Sitara deal volumes.

Chris -Can we get these deals fixed (delete the triggers) so they can be reversed (corrected) in Unify?  We have April-02 out on A/R all ready, but May-02 is still in draft status (we have not closed the accrual/accounting month change in Unify for ENA).

The sooner the better.  Please let me know.

Thanks  WRP

I don't think the triggers are correct.

Ed, this brings up a good question that may already be addressed. Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system.  Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002?  One of the Midland deals (MCV 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in Sitara with triggers.  We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002.  These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in Sitara.

Please check into deals 332163 and 340305 for sales invoices to Midland Cogen.  Max Doner thought these deals would not trigger activity anymore per your note to him on 5/13.  I see where these deals were updated by you on that date.  Are the deals legit, or are the triggers generated legit.  Please let me know ASAP.

Thanks  WRP

We would have been around $.39 to $.42.

   

Dominion was able to buy TETCO M2 delivered for NYMEX plus 32 cents.

Little correction going forward

The higher of
St 65 Offer plus $.27
TCO Offer plus $.19

Currently, we are unable to use IT to serve Ogy at Doyle on Transco.  I have devised a super scientific method for pricing VNG space for Ogy.  Poke all the holes in it you want.

Use the following formulas to determine the price to Ogy

The higher of
St 65 Offer plus $.35
TCO Offer plus $.14

Good Luck

Re:     Market Area IT Availability  May 1, 2001

The available interruptible transportation service (IT and
secondary FT) on Transco for pipeline day Tuesday, May 1,
2001 and continuing until further notice is summarized as
follows:

Tier I and Tier II (only Sta. 90 through
Sta. 180 affected)                                      0 MDt/day

South Virginia Lateral Compressor Station 167           144 MDt/day

Tier III (Station 180 through East)                     0 MDt/day

Leidy at Centerville Regulator Station
(Only deliveries downstream of Centerville
regulator affected)                                     OPEN

Linden Regulator Station
(Located in Union County, New Jersey)                   50 MDt/day

Mobile Bay Lateral                                      162 MDt/day

As a result of unscheduled maintenance at Station 90 the packages will
be reduced as stated above.  This maintenance is expected to last 4-5
days.  Customers will be notified of a change in the availability of
interruptible capacity at Station 90 and Station 180 as soon as
possible.

The above available interruptible transportation service
refers to deliveries into the affected area that have
receipts upstream of the bottleneck or affected area.

I don't think the triggers are correct.

Ed, this brings up a good question that may already be addressed. Both of the Midland deals still show up in the trading system.  Should they be terminated effective 6/1/2002?  One of the Midland deals (MCV 2, deals #340305 and 332163) was put in Sitara with triggers.  We stopped serving MCV 2 effective 4/1/2002.  These triggers will continue to create an invoice each month unless we change the deal in Sitara.

Please check into deals 332163 and 340305 for sales invoices to Midland Cogen.  Max Doner thought these deals would not trigger activity anymore per your note to him on 5/13.  I see where these deals were updated by you on that date.  Are the deals legit, or are the triggers generated legit.  Please let me know ASAP.

Thanks  WRP

I think the pricing should be Trco Index plus commodity plus fuel.  It looks like you just have Index plus commodity on the pricing.  

I set up the following new TU deals for May 1

759849	St 30 to Z6 New York
759876	St 45 to Z6 New York
759877	St 65 to Z6 New York

DTI will not be charging for TTT service through June 01, they will probably not start to charge any time soon, however they still have the ability to charge.  My feeling is that they will find it difficult to charge after providing the service for free for some time.  If they do start to charge by nom is there a way we can provide that service?  I will think about that one. 

I'm going to a Unitariean church on Sunday.  Not happy about it either.

Please bookout the following deals;  Deal 643754 with deal 759487 for May and June.

Guess I won't need you tonight.  My woman and I are going to a movie.

Did you say you were missing a phone?  I may have an extra one for sale - CHEAP TOO!  I made a bunch of 1-900 calls on it last night.  Newphew called me at 12:00 ish and showed up around 12:45.  I'm tuckered.

You de MAN

Here's what Beverly had to say.

Tell Chris hi for me too. And, congrats on the new baby!  This reorg is
going to be very interesting.  You are going to have scheduling people doing
contracts and accounting and vice versa.  They haven't announced who is
working for who yet, but we are getting the operations accounting people and
their manager.  Then, we are going from 4 teams to 3 big ones.  We'll see.
Supposedly, the managers are dividing up the customers first under the
managers, then putting us wherever they want, I guess.  It's kind of crazy
around here.  Let me put it this way - if the industry didn't suck right
now, I'd look for a new job.  This company is weird.  It takes them forever
to do anything, then they don't have the right people in the right places.
Plus, they are very, let's say conservative, instead of 'cheap'.  When you
are used to the best money can buy, like at Enron, then you go to a company
that complains if you throw away a paper clip, well, you get the picture?
No wonder it's taken them 5 years to get 1Line, which, by the way, still
doesn't work too well!!

Let me know what curve the following deals are being marked against.

Chris,

Please fax the support sent to you on this.  I will contact Cindy Wernecke once
I receive your fax.

Thanks,

I was going to call and harasses you but no one answered your phone.  I'm pretty sure my purpose on life is to make you miserable.  What do you think?

I will be out of the office this afternoon after 2:00 pm - Tenn shipper meeting.

According to somebody - housecats left outside kill over 1,000,000 tweety birds a day!

Brad McKay sold 33,000 dt of the Iroq/Wadd to the firm Canadian book for May and I just sold 9189 of the NFUL Niagara to the Canadian book at a +.29 for May.  On NFUL - I created deal 749380.

I figure buying stuff for me and making myself happy is just like making you happy  :)

When is that very last one going to kick in? 

The truth is out there!

Computer Gender 

An English teacher was explaining to the students 
the 
concept of gender 
association in the English language; noting how 
hurricanes at one time were 
given only female names, and how ships and planes 
were 
usually referred to 
as "she." One of the students raised her hand and 
asked, 
"What gender is a 
computer?" 

The teacher wasn't certain and divided the class 
into two 
groups:  males 
in one, females in the other, and asked them to 
decide if 
a computer should 
be masculine or feminine. Both groups were asked 
to give 
four reasons for 
their recommendations. 

    The group of women concluded that computers 
should be 
referred to as 
masculine because: 

1. In order to get their attention, you have to 
turn them 
on. 

2. They have a lot of data but are still clueless. 

3. They are supposed to help you solve your 
problems, but 
half the time, 
they ARE the problem. 

4. As soon as you commit to one, you realize that, 
if you 
had waited a 
little longer, you could have had a better model. 

    The men, on the other hand, decided that 
computers 
should definitely be 
referred to as feminine because: 

1. No one but their creator understands their 
internal 
logic. 

2. The native language they use to communicate 
with other 
computers is 
incomprehensible to everyone else. 

3.  Even your smallest mistakes are stored in 
long-term 
memory for later 
retrieval. 

4. As soon as you make a commitment to one, you 
find 
yourself spending half 
your paycheck on accessories for it. 

The truth is out there!

Should we start terminating CES as a shipper on the interstate pipelines?

Ernie, this is what I think.  ENA sold CES gas delivered to the NIMO citygate.  I don't think we ever had supply behind the citygate like we did with Peoples and East Ohio.  Heidi probably did the imbalance trades because it was after the gas flow day and we were unable to do anything about it.

Comments, questions?

Ernie's on the team now.

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
	Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

Thanks for your help

I just left Cingy a message  - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance trades that we intiated.  However, it could have been done by CES or EES.  I asked her to call me back.

I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we were not aware of.

Laurie Ellis@ENRON
11/01/2000 02:55 PM
Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.

She has a mostly white one - at least those are the color of the kitty hairs on my clothes.  She left his front claws in because she said it was mean to take them out.  Of course she gets a little angry when he sharpens his claws on the couch.  I figure he will get run over by a car someday and she will be said - I will be sensitive and caring and then she'll get another one.

I guess I don't have to tell you that those long distance relationships are kinda tough.  Good luck.

What kind of kitty does Ingrid have??

Rob is fine... we had a little tiff and didn't talk for a week. He went to
the LDC forum in Boston. We made up over e-mail today... or at least
exchanged apologies. I'm not sure when I'll see him again. Gloria is
visiting me next weekend... girls night out. The following weekend Cindy is
visiting me. The weekend after that I'll be in Houston for TCO shipper
meeting. It has been two weeks since I've seen him. We have a great time
when we are together, it just hasn't been very often latetly.

I'll ask my woman her opinion about my rock hard stomach.  I'm sure she
will agree after I tell her what to see.  I guess women can be sensitive.

Ingrid's fine - and you?  How's your man?

My last response didn't make sense... now that I re-read it. I meant to see
I like a cat personality better.

I'm sorry about the cushy remark... I'm guessing you have worked out a
lot... since I last saw you. It's probably rock hard now.

So how is ingrid??

You like (cat) attitude don't you?  And what makes you think my stomach is
cushy??????

I'm guessing your stomach is nice and cushy.... not rock hard. Your
women...
ingrid???

I'm not getting a hamster!!! They have no personality like a cat.

Why don't you get a hamster or something like that.   You know my woman has
a cat - he likes sleeping on my firm, rockhard stomach when I watch TV.

I planted 50 plus flowers this weekend in my flower boxes. They look so
pretty. I hope I don't kill them. I'm going to find me some kittens in the
next few weeks. I'm lonely without Miss Muffy. Cindy Vachuska is coming to
visit me in two weekends. I'm taking May 4th off.. we are going to do some
museums, day to the eastern shore, and baltimore's inner harbor.

Bidweek is such a joy!!! We are suppose to be back online with y'all... so
they say.

How sweet.  Its doing ok.  A better question is "how's the lovelife?".
That's doing ok too - although I wish I could find the perfect woman.  Mine
is wanting to take some trips - Maine, New York, EUROPE!!!!!

What's up with you girl?

See.... I'm being nice and not asking any other questions.

Hope you're doing okay.

Is my buddy Robert Allwein working with you?  If so give him a big kiss and a hug from me.

U forgot to copy you brother.  I don't think he did it.  I think it just kicked in somehow.

Ya'll reckon the old Coot had all this planned so if there was any problem form
marriage, family etc, this automatically happened.   He probably did this back
when he was swapping land with Bertha and did not plan on us having to do this
again in the future.  MMMM, interesting.   Hey did he leave any of the land to
me or just you guys???

Chris.Germany@enron.com on 04/23/2001 01:13:03 PM
Spoke to Mary last night.  She's doing well and I know you both care.  She
said Bernie Max was in surgery for 4 hours on Friday to have a melanoma
spot removed from his collar bone - not good.  She found out about it
indirectly somehow.  Gerald and Shirley didn't know about the surgery
either.

I should have an update on our legal issues by the end of the day.

I just spoke with "Wendy" in the Cherokee County Appraisal District.  She
said all of Dad's property was transferred to us back in August of 2000.  I
told her that seemed odd since the property was still in probate.  She said
that there was a special warranty deed transferring the property to us and
that Mary Esquivel had agreed to transfer the property.  Don't know how
that happened and don't care.  She also said that we need to fill out the
ag expemtion on both pieces of property.  The one I have is for the 31
acres.  Don, she will mail the other application to you at P.O. Box 532,
Brazoria  77422.  She will also mail a copy of the last application Dad
filled out.  We need to get the completed applications back to them in May
(does not have to be May 1).

Love you MAN!!

I include Darla on anything dealing with New Power or CES.  Maybe CES should just be you??  AND Wade can tell me what producer activity is going on or if he is aware of any items not in Sitara.  But Ernie should have the whole CES picture nailed down.  I'm thinking this Statoil should just go to Ernie and we not be involved.  I spoke to him on the phone before I sent the email.

Hi team.  Laurie has been asking for quite some time about an imbalance trade behind NIMO.  As you can see, I did my usual ignore it and maybe it will go away but its not working.  So,  this is what I need to know;

 Did Enron purcase gas (pool or local production) behind NIMO in Jan and Apr 2000?
What CES activity do we have at NIMO for the months shown above?
	Do we have any out-of-balance items at NIMO for the months shown above?

El Paso and Reliant don't have time to talk about right now but I'm also having a problem telling them about the deal because there are too many unknowns.  It's not the same as selling parked gas on Sonat.

Still working it though.

Chip,

This e-mail confirms the info that we talked about this morning:

1)  We found the old interruptible transport contract that is referenced in the firm storage agreement.  It is a maximum rate transport contract that allows discounting of transport rates.  I do not know what the maximum transport rate is for Bridgeline, but it is probably one rate for the entire pipeline.  No active discounts were found in ENA's records.  With the pipeline's cooperation, however, new discounts can be negotiated.
2)  Under ENA's firm storage agreement, you must withdraw it from storage at the Storage Delivery/Redelivery Point which is defined as the interconnect between the storage field and Bridgeline Pipeline System.  This means that some sort of transportation agreement on Bridgeline must be used if ENA does not sell the inventory in place.
3)  Chris is making some preliminary calls to gauge the market interest for purchasing ENA's storage inventory.  So far he has not received much positive feedback.  As we discussed before, using an interruptible transport contract puts the shipper at risk that the gas will show up everyday and be available for sale to third parties.  The price ENA receives from purchasers will most likely be discounted for this IT transport risk.

Good luck with the meeting,
Ruth

I've made a few changes.  I've heard from Greg and OpCo is on-board.

One remaining question is whether we go in offering to pay demand charges for the total 2.5Bcf or only the 1.9+Bcf actually used during this period, given that the gas was trapped.  The ratable amount is approximately $100k lower than the $575k in the letter.  If for no other reason, from a negotiating perspective I believe we should go in with the lower number.  Mark, do you have a view on this?  If our legal analysis is clearly based on demand charges at the maximum volume, we probably should stay with the $575k.

This is what I want, at 17 to 18 footer with a 70-100 HP motor.  I prefer a shallow draft center console for bay or bayou fishing.

Make it happen buddy - and remember, I'm not made of money.

I am glad to hear the both of you are o.k.  How does the grass look up at
Dad's.  I am thinking we should maybe bale the hay.  I have intentions of
going up there this coming weekend.  You should have bought a boat during
the boat show.  I have a friend who is always fishing and I will ask him
about a boat.  Do you want a ski boat or a fishing boat?  Freshwater or
Saltwater.  I do know the best motors are made by Yamaha.  A friend of mine
at Demi Jon had a Gulf Coast which is basically a chopped down Boston
Whaler.  I think the boat was around 21/23 '.  The sides were approximately
6/8" tall with a center console and a very large ice chest mounted directly
behind that which served as a seat.  It also had what I call a jack plate on
the motor for vertical lift prop clearance between boat and bay bottom.  He
could run in about 8" of h2o.  If I remember correctly it was a V 6 150
horse Yamaha.  That baby would fly.  They are bay boats but Aubrey took his
out in the Gulf frequently.  You should call Duane Davis.  I bet he can find
you exactly what you want.

Buddy, did the Easter Bunny come to see you?

Be Safe!

Well I guess you know by now that Jerry and I survived Florida.  I had fun
at Disney.  The airshow was a bit of a let down though.  AND NO, I didn't
buy an airplane.  Now I'm thinking ... boat... yeah that sounds real good.
See what you can find me.

I'm tired of my Ford Explorer.  However, I checked new car prices on the
internet and I think I'll keep my Explorer for a little while longer.  New
cars are so expensive.  So just go find me a boat and I'll be happy.

Just came in to work for a few min.  Later.

Did she show you her tatoo?

I need to be back in Houston by 2:00 PM.  I'm thinking about driving myself.  Your the boss, what do you think?

I am so glad you are going.  Here is the scoop.  Think about your flights
and let me know.  If you would rather drive w/ Berk and I and another guy
that works here, you are welcome!!!
But, you know you will never catch as many fish as Judy.  She is just
amazing.  No one can touch her!

May 2-4 -       Fly to the lodge (Corpus) on Wednesday afternoon or evening
(May 2nd).

                         There is fishing  on Thursday  (all day)  and
Friday morning.   Everyone leaves the lodge around noon on Friday to fly
back.

My contact at new power has not been returning my phone calls for the past two weeks. I am trying to resolve some of those prior period issues and tie out for this month as well.  I don't know if he's out on vacation or what.  I usually talk to Cris Miceli, do you know someone else I can talk to over there?

According to Kimat, TP2 gets the NYPA sale at Mamou at the prices show below.  We have 3 options on serving this deal: 
1) buy Texas Gas capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from the Zone SL Pool
2) use Transco Zone 3 wellhead
3) buy Trco capacity and ship the gas on a secondary basis from St 65

Most of the time we use option #1.  Texas Gas is cheaper than Trco even after paying the transport cost.  However, this deal comes to the TP2 book at the prices listed below.  For April, TP2 purchased the gas from GULF2 at the Zone SL IF + $.005 and shipped it to Mamou.  The total transport cost  is $.02 (including demand - this changes each month).  We don't arb the supply with Trco and Texas Gas because NYPA is extremely difficult to work with and this is a term firm sale to NYPA.

Should we change the mid price for the NYPA to include both the Zone SL mid price  and the transport expense?

Then try AEP in Columbus.  They have a big shop and you should know some of the people there. 

Thank you for the leads, but I am going to stay here in "the land of grey winter", until Todd is ready to move south.  That will hopefully be in 2 or 3 years.

<Embedded StdOleLink>

Congratulations on the good news.  Sorry to hear about the bad news.  There seem to be lots of scheduling jobs around here but I don't know if you want to do that.  Bob Superty is the best person to chat with their.  Also, you might chat with AEP.  They just bought some Houston assets and they might be keeping those assets in Houston.

Hello Chris!

I was writing to give you some good news and bad news.

Good news:  I got engaged last weekend.  I am very excited!  Todd is a very wonderful person.  This is the person I met on MM last year who lives in Columbus.

Bad news:  I am getting laid off.  I transferred to Columbus with Clinton.  They are laying off half their staff.

I am not real fond of Columbus and hope to move back to Houston one day.  Hopefully we can work together again one day.

Hope all is well with you!

Take care!

Susan

Please give Judy Townsend, Scott Goodell, and myself  the ability to trade the physical Canadian products.  We need to be able to see them on EOL.

Very funny!

You really don't care about my back do you?????   Its doing ok.  Went to Florida with my brother last week.  Spent 2 days at the airshow and 2 days at Disney.  Enjoyed both very much.  That was my first Disney trip and it was pretty cool.  Need to go with a Chic next time though.

Mr.  Hodge is trading CGAS and his number is 713-853-7276.   And YOU ARE CORRECT AGAIN - he's the old CES dude.

Behave yourself girl.

Hey.. how's it going??

How's your back??? How was Easter???

I may come down for the TCO/Gulf meeting in May. Have to get the blessing of
my boss first.

Who is doing TCO pool??? The screen says John Hodge... he is really a nice
guy.

Is John (can't remember last name)... TCO appalachian guy from CES... still
at Enron?? Do you have his number?? I've been given the order to start
finding appal gas... what a joy. I thought I would give Jim Javins a call
too.

Hope all is well for you.

Maybe we should have the transport books roll up into the ENA Upstream book - then us little transport folks could work with the wellhead desk instead of against you.  That way we could get credit for our knowledge even though it doesn't show up on the bottom line of our P&L.

Scott Profitt was looking for your phone number.  I gave it too him.  I think he misses you.

Please change the counterparty on deal 806589 from TP2 to TP3 (sorry about that).

Suzanne is here.  She said you and her are doing some Manual work this weekend.  You and I are breaking up for the weekend but I need to get my car back first.  Maybe after we go to the movie.

PS  Scott said the resteraunt to go to in Round Top is "Royers".  He said you go shop for antique crap and then go eat at this place.

I would leave early if I were you.

My car will be ready today at 4:00!  My only concern is that traffic going I-10 west will be horrendous! 

I finished all but one.  Guess what time I finished????  Oh, and we have until the end of today to finish them.

Did you finish your reviews? 

Did mine.  Need to do one for this person in risk management.  I finished at 12:15

Did you finish all but your own?  Saving the best for last?  
I guess you finished at 11:30.  Am I right?

It was nice of you to put thought and effort into those reviews.  Even if the process seems like a waste of time, you did your part!
I feel so blah today.  I'm tired and sad and have cramps.  I almost turned around and went home when I was on my way to work, but I have so much to do.  I'm hoping to just work quietly today, get my mind off my troubles, and get some things off my plate.
And I love my kitty cat.  He's my precious boo-boo.

We have some Trco long haul capacity for 1 year starting 5/1/2001, contract 3.8924.  This is a mini asset deal with PSE&G.

Transco has agreed to bill PSE&G for the demand charge.  I took the demand charge off the sheet and zeroed out sitara effective 5/1/2001.

Effective 6/1/2001, please move deal 655067 (sale to NYPA) from ENA - IM EAST TP2 to ENA - IM EAST TP3.

Jeanne, effective 6/1/2001, we are going to move the TGT transport from TP1 to TP3.

I dialed Suzie's number and Liz anwsered.  Then I asked to speak with the other ____zzy and she transferred me to Lauri.  I was expecting her to transfer me to you!!

Please set up and annuity for June where the TP3 book pays the New England book a total of $57,266

This will show up as a loss in TP3.

Let me know if you have any questions.

she is at superior, do you need her for something?  what are you doing?

She is soo cute.  Does she sleep at night.  How are you sleeping.  Hey is
Christina Sanchez still working there.

Kim, according to Dalton (the IT guy), I need 3 sets of monitor arms and Judy needs 2 sets.

Did you order my other monitor?

I changed the meter numbers on the following deals.  Please check the hedges.

Deals 816519 and 816524

I did take a look at the $139,000 home.  This house has been on the market for awhile.  The backyard sits next to some big building - that's a bad thing.  I have not had a chance to look at the other house - the sq footage seems really small though.  Based on what I've seen over the last 8 months, it would take something around $190's - $205's to make me happy and I'm not willing to spend that much right now.

Another thing that bothers me is the economy.  All I hear about are layoffs.  The only industry still booming is the energy industry and we keep streamlining.  That's what keeps me from spending the big bucks on a house.

Thanks for the info though.

Guess what?  The house is unsured through July 21st or 24th or something like that.  I went digging through the papers last night and found it.  Guess who the Goober was that paid it last year???? me.

What I don't have are papers on the Silver Leaf resort thingy.  I mean I don't have a stitch.  That's ok - I mailed them a letter yesterday.  I'm going to try to get a gazillion bucks for it and leave you guys high and dry!   Whoooo hooo - Brazil (because of the ladies) here I come!!!!!!!!!!

Movies I want to see - Swordfish (John Travolta), The Mummy II, and a new Jet Li (kung fu dude) movie.

I'm still looking for a bay boat fella's - about 17-19 ft long with a 70-115hp motor.  I'm willing to spend up to $6,000.00.

I'm coming over after I work out today.  I'm coming over after i work out tomorrow too.  I won't see you Friday or Saturday.

Chris,

The New Power Company deal #649352 has a demand charge (income) of $1,183,732 that you added.  Do they owe us this money and how is it related to this deal.
I looked in your demand charge spreadsheet to see if we reflected it in our P&L through a reimbursement but am unable to find it.

Your help and input would be greatly appreciated.

What are your Trco volumes again?  I can make changes now without writing new deal tickets.

CALP released their 40,000 dth to ENA for Nov-01 through Mar-02.  The new contract number is 71451 and it should be set up in Sitara.

Our Texas Gas contract for Nov-Mar is k# T0181760000.  Our MDQ is 18,000 dth per day and the demand charge is $.01 per dth.

I just killed deal 1143337  TGT k#T018123, that was the wrong contract number.

TP1 sold 2000 dth to the New England book for November via EOL.  The price is NX1 + .445.  The point should be South Commack.  As of 10:44 am this deal had not loaded into Sitara for November.

Please change the volume on these tickets this afternoon.  I don't want to put them in pending status while you are scheduling.

Deal 646813  - volume should be changed from 465 to 572 for the month of November.

I have 2 contacts at Iroquois

You should probably talk to Robin Almond at 203-925-7274.

Here's another one, 500 dth from Z0/ZL to Dungannon for Nov-Mar and / or  Apr 02 - Oct 02.  I'm guessing max rate.  Let me know.  I just want to make sure you have it to sell.

Also, how does the open season work?

Hey Chris - we have capacity for both of the packages you listed below.

Z0/ZL to Z4 - Carrol County Meter:  Rate is Max rate

Z0 or Zl to Broad Run:  I can give you $.18 ($.16 demand/$.02 commodity)

If you want this capacity, we will be required to post an open season.....

I'm looking for the following capacity, let me know if you have it to
sell.

Z0 or ZL to Z4 - Carrol County Meter, 1,000 day for Nov-mar and
Nov-1year.

Z0 or Zl to Broad Run, 10,000 day for Nov-mar.  I think Corey showed a
demand $.22 before which is above TCO pool by about $.17.  Let me know.

Thanks

Boston Gas DIfferential for Oct 2001 = ($.0641)

Chris,
I was speaking with Gerry Hrap and he said that they will require the number by tomorrow morning at the latest for negotiations with Calpine (per discussion with yourself, John McKay, and Scott Neil).
Sorry for the rush,
Nicole 

Hey there.

 Got your message.  I'll get you the numbers by tomorrow afternoon, maybe today.

Thanks

I'm looking for the following capacity, let me know if you have it to sell.

Z0 or ZL to Z4 - Carrol County Meter, 1,000 day for Nov-mar and Nov-1year.

Z0 or Zl to Broad Run, 10,000 day for Nov-mar.  I think Corey showed a demand $.22 before which is above TCO pool by about $.17.  Let me know.

Thanks

I know you told me that this capacity could be released.  Can it be released in 4 seperate peices?  Plus I may be doing permanent releases too.  Any problem with that?  Does this contract have an evergreen clause?

Who is my contract for capacity release questions?

Hey there.

 Got your message.  I'll get you the numbers by tomorrow afternoon, maybe today.

Thanks

I believe its Janice Felton but I will make sure.

Thanks

Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.

Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.

I will wait to hear from you. 

Robert, when you get a chance, please give me all the service deal numbers for CGLF k#37393.

Marlene, the new termination date for this contract is 5/31/2002.  If I have time, I am going to send CGLF a termination notice for this contract effective 5/31/2002.  Is that something you could do for me?

Let me know.

Hey, I'm older than you, therefore my life expectancy is less.  So I have much less time to spend QUALITY time with Little Wilbur.  I propose that I stay home and be a house husband.  You would have a hot (oatmeal) meal waiting for you when you get home.  The dog would love you, the cat would love you, I would love you.......

What do you think?

This looks like one of those things all us employee's should sign up for.

Hello everyone,

My husband Ryan is going to be participating in the American Heart Walk on November 3.  He is walking on behalf of our daughter, Sydney, who was born in May of this year with Congenital Heart Disease.  If anyone would like to sponsor us with a cash donation, we would be very appreciative.  I will be accepting donations today and tomorrow.  This is a wonderful organization whose research saves lives like Sydney's every day.  All donations are matched by Enron and are 100% tax deductible.

Please help this worthwhile cause if you can.

Thanks,

Vicki Versen

			IT	FT	Fuel		FT Demand

All rates include ACA but no GRI.

I'm still passing out your name and number to people that are looking.  I only give it to people that I think would fit in a capacity role.  Are you OK with that or should I stop?

You should call me so I can harass you.

I get real tired of this guy.  For whatever reason he and I just don't seem to comunicate real well.

Forget it.  I don't need your lecture.

Because you have a discount before and after makes little difference - some
people call some days and not the next.  Kathy has called on Saturday and
Sunday for intraday rates.

I will go back and make corrections for you on the 14th.  How much volume?

Corey

I believe I did because 1) I used the .12 rate in pricing the deals in my
system and the deals are at a fixed price which means I had to calculate it
AND 2) I had the discounts on gas flow before the 14th and gas flow on days
after the 14th
AND 3) the 14th is a Friday which makes me think we would not have
forgotten to call as oppossed to an intraday on Sat or Sun.

Its only a diff of $80 or so. So if its difficult or "improper" don't worry
about it.

Thanks

    -----Original Message-----
   Nothing is set up.  Did you call in?

   Would you see if we have a discount for gas flowing from 500L to Carnes
   on Sep 14th?  We had discounts before and after so it seems like we
   would have a discount for that day as well.  I can't find anything in my
   notes.

This Confirm was sent to the counterparty but it is not showing that we received an executed copy back

EE9092.1 (Sitara# 10258, no confirms on file, in TAGG & in Sitara & DCAF, states that this is a rebooking of E23290.1)
EE9092.3 (TAGG states that this is a rebooking of E23290.4, as part of E23290.1; no confirms on file)

E23290.1 (states "Retrofit - Oracle  #52730.IB, 15419.02") 1/8/98

This LOOKS (at least as far as I can tell) like the volumes are a result of the Fuel Load need to support X HP hours for the compressor, this is echoed by a memo related to E23290 (looks like someone did an inquiry into this in 10/1995. I did a very quick scan of these "agreements" & it appears as all this looks to be gas for the "Hubbard Station" compressor fuel requirements (there is an Exhibit C that calcs out HP-hours into fuel requirements). Other than the SWAP confirms - - - - and this "agreement" I could not find anything else other than deal tkts. 

The "Agreement" progression (for the Compression Services Agreement) goes like this:
3/1/95 Compression Services Agreement (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - Amended & Restated 11-1-97 (fuel calc in Exhibit C) - - - - terminated & replaced by 6-29-00 Compression Services Agreement (Fuel Calc in Exhibit B).
The Fuel needs are found in the exhibits. 

So, id according to the notes in TAGG & if all of these roll back to E23290 - - - - - here is your paperwork

Chris,
Have you alerted the Settlements person handling New Power?

In September, ENA agreed to purchase capacity from New Power on Transco.  The total demand charge should have been $9,000.00 on contract 4.0159.  New Power released the capacity volumetrically and I didn't catch it.  The actual demand charge billed was $270,000.00.  New Power agreed to reimburse ENA for the difference of $261,000.00.

ENA will pay the pipeline the billed demand charge of $270,000.00 and bill New Power $261,000.00 on deal 1110019.

 

My girlfriend is pregnant and we are getting married around January.  But not too many people know about that.  If anyone says anything to me I'm gonna deny it.

Don't want no kitties.  I'm going home now because I've lost so much money today.  BYE

Chrisssssssssyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

I've been thinking about you. What's up with you. Mr. Singer said you were
looking at houses. I missed you at TCO meeting... you could have found
yourself another wife!!

I got two little kitties... so cute. Their names are cc and alex (sis and
brother). CC is for curious cat or crazy cat... she ran up the screen last
week, jumps on the kitchen counter and tore down some curtains.

I'm starting to think you don't care about me anymore.  What are you doing?

This is the guy in charge of all the transport for Cinergy.  I have not been able to speak to him because he is out of the office so much.  And I don't know if I'm still in his good graces either.

Paul Drexelius  713-393-6856.

Frank, I was out last week and I'm just now getting to you email.

As a Marketer, I agree with Dynegy's slide #20, "the risk of not being able to find replacement capacity (OR CITY GATE GAS SUPPLY) within two hours or less may be too great" .  The only time capacity would be recalled is on peak days.  Also, according to my Transco schedulers, PSE&G does not accept contract number changes after 12:30 PM the day before gas flows.  If we were using released capacity to serve a market at PSE&G and the capacity was recalled intra-day, we would not be able to schedule the gas because of PSE&G's nomination and scheduling procedures.  This is an interesting point because the only term capacity release deal we have on the East Desk is with PSE&G.

However, we do support intra-day capacity release.

Attached is a presentation from Dynegy that answers the question of " Will intra-day capacity recalls support reliability for the Provider of Last Resort in a deregulated market ?"  Dynegy seems to be saying "no".  KeySpan is the LDC that is suggesting that the POLR ( in their minds, KeySpan ) needs intra-day capacity recall rights to serve the market reliably.  Another question comes from this as to our larger business.  That is, Will intra-day capacity recall rights effect our business favorably or unfavorably as a whole ?  Chris and Maureen, I am interested in you thoughts on this asap.

Thanks

Frank
If you have thoughts on Dynegy's proposal that you would want expressed, let me know.

Attached is Dynegy's presentation on the Intra-day recall of capacity
issue to be discussed at Wednesday's meeting.

Stacey,

I am forwarding this to you from Chris Germany to handle. I checked the deal in Sitara and the contract that is attached is contract no. 96017703. It looks like there is paper however I am having problems with Live Link. You might need to check with Ellen for the confirmation.

Chris has asked a copy of the contract or confirmation on this deal. If we have both I would probably furnish him with both.

Thanks,

Julie, I'm leaving at 10:00 AM today.  Please let Scott, Maureen, or Robin know what you find out on the Boston Gas deal for the winter.

Thanks

I based Sep off the CNG index.

The Boston Differential for Sep 2001 is ($.1187).

The Boston Differential for August 2001 is ($.1166).  I want to understand the contract better before I give you the Sep price.

Ruth, you and I are chatting about this today I hope.

Kam, I'm guessing this becomes an O&A issue each month.  I don't know if you need to be involved or not.

Hi Chris,

I realize that you are getting bugged from a few of us in Canada for the Boston Differential numbers.  I am in Accounting and I am in desperate need of the Boston Differential for August and September so that I can finish my invoicing for the month.  I really have to have these numbers by the end of the day today (latest).  Sorry for being a pest, but I am starting to panic!  Please send these numbers to me or Nicole Laporte, as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Kelly

Chris,
We just require August and September, we already have July.
Would it possible to get the differential number before Wednesday? Our Accounting group requires this number for invoicing and they are a few weeks late with their August invoice and require the differential immediately.
Please let me know,
Thanks,
Nicole

Sorry about the delay.  I'm starting to look at this again.  I know you need August and September.  Did you say you also need July?  

I don't know if Canada makes any money off this deal but my book is taking a beating.  Ruth Concannon and I are meeting Wednesday to discuss this deal.  There are some other things going on with this deal that she is aware of.  I should have your prices by them.

Thanks

Chris,
Attached is a spreadsheet listing the differential since January 1998.
Please let me know as soon as you know something!
Thanks!
Nicole
 << File: BostonGasDifferential.xls >> 

Nicole, would you send us the last price you were given please?

Thanks

Chris, I remember there used to be one excel spreadsheet on Boston. But I can't find any on my CPU, perhaps it got lost when they upgraded my CPU. Do you have it? Let me know what we need to do. Thanks.

Kimat

Nicole, I have the Boston Gas confirmation letter.  Thanks.

Kimat, are you familiar with the Boston Gas worksheet Dick Jenkins would update to calculate the Tenn Z6 city gate price?  It wasn't very big, and Dick would have me verify the Iroquois and Tenn transport variable cost.

You are my hero.

Chris, I will look into this.  Paul

FYI.................

let me know if you have any interest in the Tco-Pool Leach swap for the winter.  I'll take TCO pool at Index and sale Leach or Pool at Index - $.04.  I can't remember if you guys could do it or not.

go to www.publicdebt.treas.gov.  the term is 30 years but you can cash them in after 6 months.  If you cash them in b4 5 years, you lose three months intere

Please let me know what prices the following deals came to the TP1 book at in Sep 2001.

Deal		Comment
1005704	Sale to Ontario
1012990	Sale to Ontario

A.K. is looking for the volumes and dollars on deals ENA has done since March 1, 2002.  I would appreciate if everyone would look at my worksheet and let me know if you are aware of something I have not included.

A.K.  I just includes the spot deals that we have done to support term deals or to liquidate storage/park & loan positions that we have.  As I said in my voicemail, you might also be looking for capacity release dollars as well.

 

let me know if you have any interest in the Tco-Pool Leach swap for the winter.  I'll take TCO pool at Index and sale Leach or Pool at Index - $.04.  I can't remember if you guys could do it or not.

Could you tell me what deal tickets you are seeing?

Please check Tenn contract 36647 on the Demand speadsheet.  Sitara isn't matching the spreadsheet.

Thanks,
Brenda

Actually it is not a new truck.  Had 33,000 miles, Ram 2500 3/4 ton, 4 x 4,
360 Magnum Motor.  Infinity stereo, bucket seats, nerf bars, tool box, bed
liner, camper tow package, 5 speed manual.  Oh, it is dueled out through one
catalytic converter with Flow Masters to accent the sound.  Makes me want to
race!!!  I believe the fuel consumption will be tolerable as well.  Now,
Debbie wants it.  I gave $16,900 + tax.  It is very clean and is Sandalwood,
Driftwood or something of that nature in color.  Almost silver.  I have to
pick up old gray over at Jerry's.  Debbie said, it is going to be hard on me
to sale my old dodge truck.  I said Yep, had that truck longer than I have
had most of my women.  I really need to engage brain before articulating!  I
am doing dirt work and hope to plant ST Augustine Grass by Friday before
rain.  One thing is for sure, the economy is not faltering on my account.
Dow Stock is back up over $33.  Hooray, hoorah!
Needs to go to $41 and then I will be happy.  I spoke with Gerald and he
said there are a bunch of folks hanging around Dad's place.  We need to
change the lock and place posted signs at the gate.  I may want to put some
steers or heifers up there.  I am going up soon and having the tractor
fixed.  Reggie said he will pay us soon.  He also still wants the tractor if
we can hold on to it.  First come, first serve.

When is the wedding?  We're set for 11/01/01.  Be sure to take your sweety
out on the balcony tonight and gaze at the full moon.  It was sure beautiful
coming up last night.  We used to go out and lay in the pasture on a blanket
and watch for the space shuttle.  I had a couple of hickies on my neck the
day after and the guys all wanted to know if those were shuttle burns.  Just
jealous.

My kid is making wonderful grades and has reassured me she will graduate
within the four year period.  She still has some sort of scholarship but I
am not for sure how much it pays.  She is going to be a kinesiologist,
sports injury therapist.  I think she just wants to be able to touch
football players legs.  She will be 20 on 11/03.  I am really proud of her.
Cindy said Jaime has grown up very much.
You should e mail her sometimes.  I am sure she would like to hear from you.
Jgerma5@aol.com.

At any rate, be careful and be safe.  You should have listened to Maw, as
long as you keep your mouth shut and your pants zipped, you will be alright.
Shucks, guess none of us three paid much attention to that.  Oh, Jeff
Sherrar has a new book out. Rise to Rebellion.
There were some pretty cool dudes back around 1774/76.  There will be two
volumes to this saga.  I am half way through the first and you can borrow it
when I am through.  I sure like his style of writing.  His books are always
hard to put down.

After the split Dow Stock there are 120 shares.

Keep Your Powder Dry!

What's happening?  I understand you have a brand new truck.  Must be
nice having money!!

I need 2 things from you.

	1.	I found the title to the 4 wheeler and I was going to
change it over to you name.  What do you think?  If that's ok, how do
you want your name to show up on 		the title and what
address should I use?

	2.	I'm getting ready to divy up the Dow stock.  How many of
Dad's shares do you have?

Last thing, send me a million dollars, I'm tired of working.

I thought we only had cashout, at most 3 times, before this June.  I can't remember.  I do know that most of the time this plant was not buring like it did in July and August of this year.  I say we just keep the dough and go to Mexico.

Hey guys,

Would you please ck the Oglethorpe deal from July 2000  - Dec 2000? Is there supposed to be a cashout booked in Sitara for these months?  Oglethorpe over paid their invoice every month.  I believe that Doug told me the extra was for the cashout that was not invoiced.

Thanks
Darla

I can't get through on the phones.  Please call me 713-853-4743

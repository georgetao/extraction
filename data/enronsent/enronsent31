CAN WE VOTE ON OUR NEW ADDITION?
jody and the former 'less than zero star' are in...and i'm sure
rick, grant, dan, bj, & currie would back me on any vote for newcomer!
we also have to pick the place...either ENRON field or jody's place?
i'll be marathon training that morning so i'll be rushing to whichever
location we choose.  i'm cool with the spotswig residence if he's
offering.
5 votes for jody....who else is out there?

O.K...O.K...After all these years (Rick would definitely get a kick out of
this), I guess I'm in.  It was much more fun to sit back and laugh at Ty and
Dan each week though.  I'm sure I'll pay for that now.

Ty, if you can get John Sz. on board, he and I can put together a team this
year if you're still looking to fill a spot.  I need John for sure though.

I'll throw my house in the hat as well for a possible location to do the
draft.

We're 5 min. up from HWY 249 (by Willowbrook mall and the horse track), or
about 15min. from 45N/Beltway, or about 15min. from 290W/Beltway.

You make the call.....

September 8th it is!  franchise players to be named by 8/31!
draft will be 11-12 ish but where?  dan has volunteered his house
(pearland)...we can do it at mine (katy)...or anywhere else that might
be more centrally located?
jody has shown interest for years and even held the draft at his place
a few years back (the infamous pool basketball tournament...and the black
eyes which resulted from it....and let's not forget the HAWK/rotweiller -C
 URBY/warlock doberman showdown).  i say we give him the first
opportunity.

jody,
once we figure who has designated a franchise player then the remaining
teams without one have what we call a supplemental draft....basically a
catch up round.  there is one catch for those who pick franchise players....
when we draw numbers for the 1st "official" round they pick at the bottom
because they have the best players in hand.

sorry if i'm being the brother at arms but we need to finalize asap.  the
cost
is $225????  someone please confirm.   jody, john szallai is back in town
and wants in on the action and i will share a team with him if necessary
or you can???  we also vote at every draft what upcoming changes we
desire for the following year.

(although our name will change) and leave my Southern team in the capable
hands of my co-owner Jeff.  Dutch has said that he will be back.  Thus, that
is 3 teams spoken for.

S & M RULES!!!

Well it seems that Kevin has already done plenty of work on this.  I'm glad
to see that plenty of people are still interested and planning on being
there.  Dan's e-mail is bouncing back - so Ty try and get in touch with him,
and Jody if need be.

I'm assuming that the franchise player issue for next year will be voted on
at the draft, as usual.  Kiske, a motion to eliminate Tight Ends?

Current status quo - franchise players were voted on at last year's draft
and will be allowed for this season, but we will be voting on whether or not
to eliminate them for upcoming seasons.

Everyone comfortable with announcing your franchise player by August 31?

I'll designate my franchise player as Edgerrin James.
I vote for September 8th as well,  11 or 12 is fine with me.

dan and i are in...probably bj as well.  bj and i are totally against

it will not be as casual as a home but maybe move faster

dutch,
since there will be a plethora of college games televised than do we
have t.v. access....and what about food/drinks?  if we can do all this in

me too , arnold is out today so a little busy
i love you honey

Good morning to my sweet honey..
Hope your day goes well...I really hope
that I did not come across as insensitive in our 
discussion to try to get the townhouse back in the
event we get a contract on our lot, I just want what is best
given the levels of stress we deal with day in and day out
So- I would like to talk further about it- because if it makes sense
to try and keep going on that new construction then maybe we should- I guess we would
have "down time" while it was being built... just hope the lead on our
lot comes through.
love you

will call , thnx

luv you

Checked on CA flights- I know you are busy so just respond when you can and i will take care of this - it needs to be ticketed today
Which option works best for you: LAX was too expensive

1- Leave 8/31 at 5:30pm arrive Orange County 6:55pm
Returns 9/3 leaves there 2pm arrives here 7:20pm 
Total price $331.50 per person

OR
2- Leave 8/31 at 8:40pm arrive Orange County 9:55pm
Returns 9/3 leaves there 2pm arrives here 7:20pm
Total Price $243.50 per person

PS
No need to use up miles for this since tickets are not very pricey- would rather
save those 80k miles to go to a more expensive destination

bid 3.815 Monday 8-20 at 11:45

Thanks again.

Kevin,

There have been several things change as of late in my life.
One ,  we are not buying a townhouse anymore, we still have to sell our lot.
Kay is going to stay at a townhouse near downtown and as of today i am looking for an apartment.
I came to the realization that I got way off track , as I usually do , with the plan of both of us
getting a place on our own for six months and going from there. I can not tell you how grateful I 
have been for the support both you and Nancy have given me during this time in my life.
I know i have not been at your house as of late and that is due to being off track of the plan.
Is it ok for me to be at your house on and off for the next couple of weeks as i get an apartment set up ?
I will be working on renting a place that starts the 1st of the month.

Let me know

okay - here's what i know -- we are trying to hire some of the best

people out there at whatever they may do -- one position that we are

looking at is kinda what you are already doing -- our nymex trader is

bob shiring -- take that however you wish -- but that's who you  would

be working directly with so that's who you would need to talk to.  i

know this position is in the budget for this year but i'm not sure what

the time frame is.  bob's email is bob.shiring@rweamericas.com -- you

can tell him that you got his name from me and then i'm sure he'll

approach me about it -- that is, of course, if you are interested and to

the extent that you do not have any contractual issues in talking to us.

Hey Tori,

First of all Congrats on the new job.

Thanks for telling Susan and thinking about me.

So tell me a little about what the opportunity is all about.

If there another person that I should talk to just email me

the Name and number and I can talk to them.

the curve settled 3.57 for apr 02 to mar 05
the curve has an adjustment of 0.025 cents

all in the offer is 3.72

I will get with john on Monday to confirm the 0.125 , I do not know if this fits into

Attached is the quote sheet I mentioned earlier - we are submitting the indicative bid Tuesday, Aug. 28th, so I will be sure to check back with you Monday afternoon for a real-time number.  For now, a notional Offer-Mid spread would be helpful (to ensure our models do not explode when we include it...)  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.  Thanks!

How was the game?  I'll tell how the game was....it was the worst display of Cougar Football I have ever seen.  It doesn't take much to not make the top 10 worst UH football performances, but we did it.  It's not like we got pasted by a good team, Rice sucks too.  It was so bad Richard got in a fight with a die-hard cougar fan that sits in front of us.  Do you know anyone that might want to buy my Texas tickets.  Maybe I'm just ruined after having to put up with 25 years of the Cubs, but I can't take less than mediocrity anymore!

How was the game? I got stuck having to go to a latino gansta'

no to the snake

Chris  don't do it!!! KEEP THE ALGEBRAIC MEAN SEQUENCED DRAFT ORDER.   
PS -  I'm for keeping TE's too!
 
(Somewhere, Rick is rolling over in his  grave)
 
Grant Johnson - Eddie George
Jeff Smith - Peyton Manning
Michael Deluke - Marshall Faulk
Michael Currie - Edgerrian James
Jeff Ullrich - Kurt Warner
 
I know this was brought up last year and we  kind of decided much of nothing...but does anyone object to going to a snake  system for the draft.  1-14, 14-1 for the whole draft?  We will  still have a supplemental round for those that do not keep franchise  players.  Then the non-franchise teams will pick in opposite order of  the supplemental round for round one...thus if you pick first in the  supplemental round, you will pick last (for those that did not keep  franchise players) in the first round.  Then, the teams that kept  franchise players will be randomly selected to pick at the end of the first  round.  After the first round, the draft will snake back the other way  with the last pick in the first round getting the first pick in the second  round and the draft will continue in this snake order until the end of the  draft.  Let me know what you think or if you are confused.
 
See everyone at the draft!!! 
 
Kevin
 

if there are 5 franchise players then the order should be supplemental 1 through say 7

round one should go supplemental teams  7 to 1 then franchise teams in reverse order
of how they ranked the previous year

round 2 through what ever is the same as the other draft we did

why?

no to the snake

>  -----Original Message-----

suggested draft order:

scenario
5 franchise teams and 7 non-franchise
franchise teams ranked 1 - 5 based on total points of franchise player from previous year

First the supplemental draft

Round one
# 5 franchise team, # 7 supplemental , # 4 franchise , # 6 supplemental and so forth and so on

with a non snake system going from there

ok everyone chew on that and spit back

Dutch

The snake thing is good and bad.   But I think the first round should be
randomly selected for ALL teams because the current way gives those not
keeping a franchise player a double benefit by picking in the supplemental
and then also at the top of the first round.   Theoretically the non keeper
teams are getting the 8-14 best players who are arguably also franchise
players.  In effect by not keeping a player you are randomly selecting a
lower level franchise player.  So they shouldn't get the an automatic shot
at 15-22 or whatever it might be as well.  So snake or no snake all of round
one should be random order.

now that i have Jeff on board lets here from the rest of you

Dutch's suggestion would alleviate all of Kevin's points below.  Whether we
snake after that is another issue - the top three rounds are more important
than the back to back pick issue.

12 or 14 teams , 5 or 6 franchise players some one will always be complaining of unfair drafts
this is just a suggestion to chew on 
I still agree with the vote and in keeping with the rules of the league

dq

There are 14 teams.
Even with Dutch's version, you will still have someone that kept the 5th
franchise player getting the 15th pick, while someone that did not keep a
franchise player, but had the first pick in the supplemental round getting
the 6th pick and the 28th pick.  I don't think that is fair.  We have always
voted on rules changes for the next year at the current years draft.  I
don't think we should make an exception now to the rule.

...get yourself signed up for the H-Town Slaps office pool.

All right folks, this is the last note I'm sending about this stuff.
The word is out...the league is active with people joining every day.
 Week 1 is finally here so get your picks in after you sign up.  You
can make adjustments to your picks until one hour before the first
game.  If you misplaced the first email I sent (shame on you!), here
is the link that you need to get started....

http://football217.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/join?league=slaplist&

Once you get to the Join League Page, you will be asked to
enter a password.  The password for this league is:  kingme10

On the Join League page, select your name from the drop-down list.
If you don't see your name, select "New Player" and click Submit.

Thanks to all the good folks who have already signed up (and paid the
entry fee! ($100)).  If you know people who may be interested in
joining, please let them know.  If you are not interested in playing,
ignore this message and have a nice day.

Questions?  Send me an email...

This is an invitation for you to join the best NFL office pool since
well, last year's pool.  During the off-season, a secret vote was
apparently held to designate me as the commissioner for this year's
league.  Well let's do it...

General Q&A about this league to help you realize you should sign up
and play (for those of you who have not played before):

Q1.  How much does this cost me?
A1.  Ah yes, the most important question.  It costs $100 per player.
The money is due to me by Sunday, September 9.  You don't pay...you
don't play!  Get your fee to me in person or mail it to the following
address:

Brian Dunlavy
8073 El Mundo
Houston, TX 77054

Q2.  What is this?
A2.  It's an NFL office pool.  Each week, you will select the winners
of the NFL games straight up and assign a ranking of 15 to 1 for the
games (or 14, 13 if teams are off).  Your 15 game is your most
confident game while your 1 game is the game that you just can't
figure out.  If your team wins, then you get the number of points you
designated to that team.  For example, New York Giants vs. Cleveland
Browns.  You select New York to win and rank them with 15.  They win,
you get 15 points.  They lose, you don't get any points.

Q3.  Why are the rankings for the games important?
A3.  Because that is how you win money!  Each week, the individual
with the highest score wins the weekly money which will be $50.  A
running total of the scores is kept for the season and the rest of
the money will be paid to first through fifth place (possibly sixth
place).

Q4.  How do I enter and play?
A4.  The league name is "H-Town Slaps".  You can access the site at
any time using the web address:

http://football217.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/join?league=slaplist&

NOTE: Once you get to the Join League Page, you will be asked to
enter a password.  The password for this league is:

kingme10

On the Join League page, select your name from the drop-down list. If
you don't see your name, select "New Player" and click Submit.

Read over the rules for the league for further information.  If you
have any questions or concerns, please contact me.

Good Luck!  Also, I don't have everyone's email addresses (especially
those who have played in the past) so please forward this email to
your friends who may be interested in playing.

Thanks,
Brian

good morning baby
i am not having a good morning
i have to re-execute my contract from last week
because we (in my rush I emailed it to legal wrong) had the price in it wrong- too many zeros
so it looks like they can buy power for practically nil
no one caught the error before customer signed it
so it really sucks that I have to get him to resign
hope it flies with him
kay

Hi Denise, Kay, and Dutch, 
i thought i'd say hi before i logged off - 12:42 am.  Amanda has been home sick the past two days and i have been rescheduling appts and putting away christmas decorations. she is doing better and will head to school tomorrow.   
Denise i hope you are taking care of yourself. 
Kay and Dutch - thanks for sending your address, the kids are in the process of writing holiday thank you's.  Any chance you could send or email a picture of the puppy Rex, they would love it and me too. 
Kevin and Jo came for dinner last friday and kevin loaded some cool picture scanning software - hopefully i'll get some photos out this year on the web. 
Life is going good here - i am going to the  annual mardi gras committee meetings and setting boundaries and have NOT volunteered to head a committee. I just answer questions and give details and just talk to people about details.  I am loving IT!! and not overwhelmed. My big decision will be what dress to wear.  Larry is right back into working HARD on these sprint deals after our ski trip.  The kids are asking to go again - even Kyle after altitude sickness- they both want to be in breckenridge!! Larry talked to a friend that has a condo in i think winter park. said we could use it sometime.  any other news:  Kyle was star student last week - made a huge poster with tons of pictures to share with his class.  Amazing to me that he is almost 7 years old.  The art teacher told me that after class last monday he just spontaneously gave her the biggest hug  and it made her day.  He is one special little boy.   
Hugs and love to each of you, 
Michele 
PS Hey mom thought you'd enjoy reading this too.

I would still like to play golf this weekend b/c it is the friendship that is fun
I might even take on Ernesto for the Brock dog challenge

It is truly sick what happened , I was talking to a broker that was in the second world trade tower as it got
hit and he was describing what was going on.  Several people I know made it out of both buildings but many are not 
yet accounted for , so at this time all there is is hope.

May everyone have a peaceful day

Dutch

This show how truly sick and evil people can be, but also show how the good
of everyone can come together in moments of tragedy.  Our thoughts and
prayers are with those that have been personally affected by this event.  I
can't imagine having to explain this to children.

Dearest K-Kay and Dutch,
Was really hoping to hear from you by this morning.  After what we saw on CNN  last night I want to know that you both are okay  - haven't traveled - and all of your friends are okay too!
We're only getting bits and pieces of news and it's  so shocking.
I want to hear from you now even if it's just one  line!
Love MOM

ok that is fine , I will give mark jerry's' balls , I just want a chance to kick your ass at golf buddy

I am still waiting for Nov. 2 .................then I can kick the ass of a golfing lawyer

Alright, I'll throw my two cents in.  Dutch is right, Ricky is right, Ernie is right, as is Kevin and everyone else who responded.  We are an extremely fortunate bunch.  We tend to be extraordinarily resilient and forgiving.  I took a bunch of flak over the past three years for my frequent absences, however, they were not absences because of a flippant attitude.  Law school took its toll as did accommodating Jo's set of friends.  My time had to be split many ways and it can be difficult to juggle everything as I am sure you are all aware.  But, mind you, I was not absent because I didn't care, or found something better to do.  It was never because I didn't want to.  At the risk of this becoming even more of a love in, you guys should know, as this is apparently the only opportunity we've taken, you are my friends.  And I would like to keep it that way.  I have to go now.  Mark says that that the keyboard placement blocks his access to my balls.

who in eol is pulling the plug ?

Dutch,
I just want to follow up on this email that I sent you.
We are getting very close to losing our database access to the EOL database.  I don't have the exact date at this point.  The word we got from EOL is very soon.

If it's very critical for you to continue to run your excel model, you may want to contact someone at the EOL.

Please let us know either way.

Thanks,
Franky

Dutch,

We have created a table in our SQL Server database which is almost similar to the one in the EOL Database. 
This new table is populated at realtime from the Tibco Data Feed.

After evaluating your existing eol_macro.xsl query, we discovered that we can not fully preserve the functionality of your model due to the missing REFERENCE_PERIOD_END_DTM field.  This field is used in your macro for grouping and sorting purposes.  We have requested this field to be added to the Tibco Data Feed but have encountered a road block, EOL is unwilling to add to this field at this time.

The next technology currently being developed by EOL will solve this problem but is not available until November.

As soon as EOL-IT shuts off access to the EOL database, your macro will no longer work.  
We anticipate that this is going to happen in the next month.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Franky 

I saved the file

The strip settled 3.255
volume 1 is -12 cents
volume 2 is - 8 cents

Dutch,

I've attached a spreadsheet which lists volumes for a prepay with the Municipal Gas Authority of Georgia (originator is Gil Muhl).  The volumes are not ratable over time, so I thought it might be easier for you to cut and paste the schedule into your model.  The term is November 1, 2001 - October 31, 2006.  The average daily volume is around 78,000 mmBtu/day.

I'm looking for your notional offer - This won't close until Q4.  Please call me if you have any questions - thanks for your help!

Attached is a file with volumes for the EEX VPP.  Remember, we will simply do an incremental VPP with additional volumes (column C), but our "pitch" to EEX is to tell them how much they would save by doing the incremental with us and not another company.  So, we want you to quote up the unwind of the existing VPP (offer in column B) as well as the Bid for the entire volume (column A).

Please provide the quote based upon where you set tonight's curve.

no change on the numbers i gave you the last time
the settlement last night was about 0.025 cents to low for that term 
the settle was 3.196

This is the same deal Russell has been pricing up with you.  It is a big VPP with Hilcorp and Lehman is recommending they proceed with Enron and we plan on meeting on Monday.

So, can I get a refresh BID on the following....

Thanks!

it was Greg and the confirmation person at chase on a conference call that i talked to

dq

Dutch,

I was forwarded the message you left for Joe Hunter regarding the Chase situation.  I have contacted legal to discuss Enron generating the confirmations for EOL deals.  Was it Greg Crowley at Chase that you spoke with regarding this?  I just need to give Mark Taylor the right name.  

Also, FYI, Joe is longer with the confirms group. Going forward, I can help you with any issues you have regarding financial confirms.  

Thanks,
Diane

When you have some resolution on this Chase deal, please drop me a line and let me know what's up.

Thanks,
Diane

Dutch,

Here's the info for Chase:

Chase trader: Greg Crowley 
          phone: 212 834 4286

TAGG no: VW1398.1 
EOL no: 1707177

15,000 a day (465,000 for month of October)

We signed in error their confirmation showing 450,000 per month, but they legally agreed to 465,000 by clicking on the EOL trade.

Sorry that error slipped through.
Let me know.

Thanks,

ily baby

Hi honey- i hope you made it on time today
you were very sleepy last nite..
I love you and am thinking of you
kq

here it is plain and simple
the problem is that the procedures that are in place are not followed
follow the procedures and there is no problem
 
 

JUST SO YOU KNOW.... WE WANT TO HELP THE PROCES...
WE ARE HAVING A MEETING WITH FRED AND MICHELLE/ DEREK TODAY..
WILL LET YOU KNOW IF I NEED HELP
THANKS FOR YOUR SUPPORT

If these problems are not being addressed as they should be, call me and I'll get on it.  This is unacceptable.

Fred- 

There are a number of issues we need to address with back office procedures immediately.  We are losing money on avoidable problems and gaining a bad reputation in the market.  Lets get Derek and Michelle together Tuesday afternoon.

2 of our counterparties are writing letters of complaint.. here's a sample of some of the quotes we have heard from the 10 counterparties we have added in the last 6 months.  

"I shouldn't have to spend my time decomposing the invoices and confirmations you send out" 
"It has been 10 days since we traded and we haven't received a shred of paper to give us the details of the trade" 
"We are being told in a confirm something different than we are being invoiced for" 
"We did not trade 300 contracts per day, it was per month - do you guys even think before you type" 
"I am a CFO and an accountant and I can't decipher what you are trying to confirm here" 

From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said "they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. 

The latest is the most disturbing:

"we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed

We do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the "backoffice"?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).

We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).  

All the problems are being caused by the following:

1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.

There are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.

Michelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.

2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  

We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.

2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.

2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. 

3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  

4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.

 

 

 

 

what is you fax number
 
as direct as i can be , you should not be in the middle of this 
do not get me wrong , i know that you are trying to help it is just that there
has been a break down in procedures and if you catch things it is generally to late
 
dq

WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE PROCEDURES ARE UP HERE.. ANY HELP APPRECIATED..

here it is plain and simple
the problem is that the procedures that are in place are not followed
follow the procedures and there is no problem
 
 

JUST SO YOU KNOW.... WE WANT TO HELP THE PROCES...

From a business dinner where a client of ours was speaking casually to large industrials and endusers. One, upon the mentioning of B2B exchanges said "they WILL NOT ever trade on EOL again because the backoffice procedure was such a nightmare.. they couldn't rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the confirm.  This was a captive client who and needs to trade... who will not show us their flow again. 

The latest is the most disturbing:

"we just want to do a small trade to test your system. We have heard it is a nightmare but want to see for ourselves - I mean how difficult can it be to book the purchase of 50 lots of crude" And still 5 days later they do not have one paper to show the details, not one phone call to confirm the trade...nothing.  We even warned the BO that this was a new customer and to make best eforts to make sure the process runs smoothly and efficiently. Well, clearly we failed

We do not understand what is going on in the back office.  Is it that they are too disconnected from our daily operations to understand how integral their accurracy is to our business?  Is there too much turnover? How are they trained?  Who is in charge of the "backoffice"?  There seems to be a different manager for every step of the process.. who co-ordinates all their efforts?  Does anyone care?  Ok.. I'll stop.. For our part, we have Michelle coming up to NY for a week in December (we wanted this to happen as soon as she started but did not work for her).

We have to stop this before we lose clients (which we will).  

All the problems are being caused by the following:

1. Our inability to generate an accurate position report for our clients.  This has already cost us money this year. Our clients do 10 trades a day.. they are constantly in and out of positions.. it is imperative that we get these right.  As well, this report is our ONLY check to make sure deals are entered and entered correctly into the system.

There are hundreds of books at Enron.  We have postions on with dozens of them.  We currenttly do not have an automated mechanism to pull deals from every book in one shot.  We have to select books one by one.. this method will always result in books being ommmitted given our deal flow.

Michelle is in charge of this process.  We need a IT person on this yesterday.  Michelle is spending most of her day verifying the validity of the report she generates.  Robyn, Russell, and I check it everyday.. there are always mistakes.

2. There is a breakdown in the backoffice functions after Michelle collects the tickets we write and verbally confirms them.  There is no check after they have been imput.  There are ALWAYS imput errors.  Michelle needs to check every deal after its entered into the system going forward.  

We also have NO set procedures for the bookings of deals.  We have no idea where our job ends and the book admin's starts.. for non standard deals like gas dailies and swaptions we need to know the exact process from start to finish.

2a. Confirms are sent immediately after deals are entered.. what if deals are imput incorrectly? the confirm goes out anyway resulting in mass confusion at the client.  Going forward, confirms need to be delayed until we can confirm that everything about the deal is correct.

2b. Invoicing.. there have been dozens of occassions where the amounts we are invoicing do not match the deals done.. 

3. EOL- We are pushing hard to get counterparties on here.. we have signed Renaissance up (a 10B program fund) but I shudder to see how EOL will fair at these tasks.  

4. Credit- All of our clients are margined.  If deals are in the system incorrectly, the wrong MTM goes to the client.. another mis-match.  We work closely with credit since we need to collect initial margin from some clients.. this amount changes daily- we need someone who can get on the phone with clients and explain these numbers through.. again, we are doing this now.

it does not look like what i have seen before but the price tells me it is an original
form some plantation

Sorry to hear that Richard , Will send prayers now and gifts later

dq

Hopefully everyone got their invitation to her party and now you can all
throw them away.  If you were coming to the party it has been cancelled b/c
Michaela is very sick.  Carrie took off today to take her to the doctor with
my mom and I'm not sure how she will be feeling by this weekend.  So we
think the best thing to do is just cancel and she just wont get any cake.
We are a little worried about her so say a prayer and hopefully all will be
okay.

Good question. I am not sure what the copyright regulations are in regards

you can copy/paste straight from there.

I will ask Kirk McDaniels about the Nymex website first thing tomorrow

Question 1:
When we talk about "the market" reacting to events, what are the prices
that we are talking about? From a simulation standpoint, I am trying to
figure out what prices we need to show as being affected by these many
events.  Is it the forward curve? Is it the spot market price?  Is the
bid/offer prices for the various instruments? And, if we are having users
trade basis, we will need different prices for different locations, right?

[Quigley, Dutch]  
for each event we need to build a change matrix that will change the previous price curve to a new one
depending on each event it could change all parts of the sport and forward curve

Question 2:
Given that the calculation of VaR is rather involved, we decided that it
would not be worth our effort to have that calculation in the model.
However, we understand that the user needs to 1) know their VaR and 2) know
that they need to make sure they stay within their VaR limit.  So, we will
need to set a VaR limit for the user and "fake" the individual VaR to
reflect their risk exposure.

I had a talk with Erro McLaughlin about this.  He made a good point that if
our user are not expected to understand the complexity of how a VaR is
calculated, will they know how to control their VaR, i.e. if a user sees
that he is over his VaR limit, what should he do to get it back within the
limit.  Is is as simple as not being too long or too short? And if that is
the case, would it be sufficient to use position reports/tallies as a proxy
for risk exposure, instead of VaR?

One possible way to fake VaR may be to adjust the VaR number to reflect how
exposed the user is. So if they are X dollars long, they have a VaR of Y.
If they change their position so that they are now 1.5X long, they have a
VaR of 1.5Y.  Perhaps we can also throw in a factor that takes into account
market volatility.

What are your thoughts?

[Quigley, Dutch]  
Instead of a VaR number we could set position limits that they must stay within at all times
i.e. over all position can not be outside a set range , NYMEX Risk can not exceed +/- 500 contracts
Basis & Index Risk can not exceed +/- 1000 contracts so for and so on 
Therefore not having to calculate VaR and expect the user to understand what to do to stay with in limits

Lastly, when could you meet with me next week? I would really like to meet

Errol,

Deal NS5777.2  , from 7/27/2000 of last year,  should have been killed along time ago. Can you kill the deal in the system please.
This might come up as a prior period adjustment, I do not know what happens when they are this old.

It's Friday, and I'm here settling Nymex.  I got a phone call from Evelyn Wednesday before Thanksgiving to come in today.  It's o.k.  I don't mind.  I get Monday off.  Just a few notes to let you know what's going on.  EDF Mann, Paribas and Carr Futures London pulled a fast one.  They set the margin at 150% more of what it would have been.  Here are the numbers incoming and outgoing.

        OUTGOING                

                Smith Barney Financial                  $232,499.00 
                Paribas                                 $46,026,588.00 
                EDF Mann                                $760,515.00 
                Carr Futures                            $12,331,010.66 

        INCOMING 

                ABN Amro                                $33,852.00 
                Saul Stone                              $19,800.00

Lori at Smith Barney was not in Friday, so we did not settle.  

FIMAT was not in, and the numbers came out like this.  They were supposed to have paid down on the loan by $2,931,087.24.  I don't know how you handle this.  Hopefully they will do this on Monday.

I know this is a terrible welcome back, but it was something that had to be done.  

dutch_quigley@yahoo.com

will relpy later ,glad to hear about the good drive.

dq

Hola,

If all recipients would please be soooo kind as to respond back with a home
mailing address....except for suebob and jojo..got your's already.

Well, we I made it safely to UT.  We made the drive in about 2 days getting
to Provo the 2nd evening and Park City the following morning.  Now I am
reminded why they always say that it is much safer to fly than to drive
cross country.  The first day we NARROWLY avoided running out of gas in
NOWHERE texas...and I also got a speeding warning from a state trooper.  The
2nd day of driving across UT on a two-land highway from Moab to Provo was
harsh...it was snowing..i had a deathgrip on the steering wheel while
oncoming cars blinded me with their headlights and john slept.  Those are
just the bad parts but it was well worth the time hanging with John and
seeing the country.

I've met my 3 roomates, Jimmy, James & Thomas... and they seem normal and to
John's delight none of them will be gracing a "Gorgeous Hunks of Park City
Utah" calendar anytime soon.  It has been snowing almost non-stop since I've
been here...and it seems that everyone is off to ski or board here in town.
I'm trying my best to hold off until the end of the week when all of my
skiing and boarding activities will be free.  I am scheduled to start this
thurs at the bakery.  I'm considering picking up another part time job just
to keep things interesting, but I'm going to see how things go with a 40hr
schedule first.

I hope everyone is doing well.  I just wanted to say hello and most
importantly get everyones home address. So take care all and I'll be in
touch.

Thanks for the call, I was on vacation.
Lets set up a time to talk , later in the day is best for me.
Let me know when is a good time for you.

Dutch
713-853-9216

Kirk,
As I am just catching up, I am not the one for storage and transportation issues as i do not trade them on a regular basis.
I was under the impression i was working on the options and futures. Yes there has not been any meeting with me for the past two weeks.  As for the conversion and arbitrage problems let me know , I am not sure what these are but am will to help.

Dutch

Dutch
How are you today? I hope all is well.
I know you are extremely busy meeting our financial targets for Q4/01. In light of this fact, I have tired not to bother the SME's and provide content for this project via other means. So far so good, but the next step will be for the SME's to review the content for sign-off. Your timely work for review will be invaluable.  

However at today's Status meeting Accenture had the following in their status report:

	Issues for Management Attention
Dutch has not been able to meet with us for the past two weeks, nor has he responded to our e-mail requests for information. This means we are relying on Andy for all the detailed trader content, which includes the two most complex problems, storage and transportation, as well as the conversion and arbitrage problems. With a maximum of two hours per week with Andy, it has been and will continue to be difficult to get all the help we need. Proposed solution: ask Andy and/or Dutch to give us the name of another trader who can meet with us to answer our detailed questions.

My initial question to you: "Is this statement accurate?"

My next Questions: "What Can I do to assist you?"
			 "Can you name someone to provide the information requested (i.e. two most complex problems, storage and transportation, as well as the conversion and arbitrage problems.)

Here is what I have provided to Accenture to help complete your assignments and to provide content for your review:
	BRM Text book
	Derivatives I as a resource only
	The slides attached below
	Other course work as a resource only

Do you have any suggestions? Thanks for all your assistance and I know how busy you are & how important your commercial duties are for the company. Thanks

Cheers
Kirk

Many of you have friends who are no longer with the company, so we wanted to provide you an overview of continuing efforts to assist Enron's former employees.

CAREER SERVICES 
Last December Enron established a website to assist former employees identify jobs in Houston and throughout the United States.  Only former Enron employees and potential employers can access the site, <http://careerservices.enron.com/>

        ? View job postings 
        ? Receive updates and information on career and community services available to them 
As of January 25, 2002: 
        ? More than 1,300 companies had been approved to view resumes 
        ? Company recruiters had logged on more than 3,500 times to search for candidates 
        ? More than 600 jobs had been posted on the site 

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE 
The Greater Houston Community Foundation 
The Greater Houston Community Foundation (GHCF), in collaboration with the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, the Houston Area Urban League, Crisis Intervention of Houston, and Career and Recovery Resources, have established a fund to provide dedicated support for former Enron employees.  GHCF offers former employees counseling services and helps them work with mortgage companies, landlords and utilities to defer monthly bills while they are out of work.   If you are interested in making a tax-deductible donation to the GHCF, please call 713-268-6458 or mail donations to GHCF at 4550 Post Oak Place, Suite 317, Houston, TX  77027.

Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund Account 
A former employee has established the Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund Account at the Humble Community Bank.  Visit the website at <<http://www.eerfa.com>> for more information or to make a donation.  Former employees can submit grant requests to eerfarequest@surfmk.com.

MDPC Transitional Assistance Program

MDPC will offer a holistic approach to re-entering the workforce including family counseling and stress management. For more information, contact Memorial Drive Presbyterian Church at 713-953-2550, ext 180.

i am planning on it, i told pete that he ran off another book admin

Great Idea Howard.
Can you add dutch_quigley@yahoo.com as my email address.
Look forward to the happy hour.

Dutch

OK ladies and gentlemen.  It has been quite a while since we had a Houston area Sammy Happy Hour, but I thought that we should do one again.  If you received this e-mail in error, or don't want to receive this type of e-mail, then just reply and I will take you out of my address book.  It needs updating as I have duplicate e-mails for some of you guys and gals.  I am thinking the 17th, 18th, or 19th.  I will make a tally of which day is best, so please reply.  If you don't reply, then I will assume that any of those days is good for you and make an executive decision.  Also, once we nail down a date, please pass this info along to anyone who might wish to come.  I know some of you guys don't live in town, or even in TX for that matter, but I just wanted to let you know what was going on.  Actives from SFA who might be in town that week are invited as well.  I look forward to hearing from all of you.

Ed Sacks has the list.  With respect to CSFB, it sounds like we have a dispute.  Trades, my understanding, can get "done" verbally and then confirmed.  It sounds like we should pull the tapes.  We should also think of whether the deal agreed to Friday is currently in or out of the money.

Ed, could you look into this?  
Chris:
We need to come up with a list of trades that we terminated last Friday so that we can take them out of our books.    Do you have that list?  Also, I spoke with "Dutch" this morning because CSFB left me a message yesterday after we filed claiming that the Friday trade was not effective.  I disagree even though a confirm has not been signed.  How do you want to handle this?

That's fine with me , i was just trying to clean up any lose ends

Thanks Dutch.  I spoke with John Arnold yesterday and he said that we can assume that the deal verbally confirmed on Friday does not need to be done.  That is CSFB's position and unless you disagree we will leave it at that.

Ricardo,

Thanks for the thought the other day.
Kay has been laid off as of this week.
I am still working until a deal can be done to 
sell off the trading arm of the company.
Will know in the next week or two.

Dutch

i have to say this is pretty funny.  won't happen cause
the 'hornys will be down by 35 by the begining of the second half,
and chance mock will be playing while chrissy will be to busy
seeing if he could transfer to austin peay or tarleton state.

Notice # 01-154
May 7, 2001

TO:
All NYMEX Division Members and Member Firms

FROM:
Neal L. Wolkoff, Executive Vice President

RE:
Implementation of New NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

DATE:
May 7, 2001
===========================================================
Please be advised that beginning on the trade date of Friday, June 1, 2001,
new NYMEX Rule 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades") will go into effect.

!    In the absence of an applicable give-up agreement, new Rule 9.11A will
define the respective responsibilities/obligations to an order of executing
brokers, customers and Clearing Members.

!    The term "executing broker" as used in Rule 9.11A refers to the
registered billing entity, Member Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is
transmitted.

!    Rule 9.11 will provide that, in the absence of an applicable give-up
agreement, a Clearing Member may reject a trade only if: (1) the trade
exceeds trading limits established by the Clearing Member for that customer
that have been communicated to the executing broker as provided by the rule
or (2) the trade is an error for which the executing broker is responsible.

!    The new rule also places affirmative obligations on executing brokers
to confirm Clearing Member authorization for an account.  For example,
prior to an executing broker accepting and executing an initial order for
any new customer account, such executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(a)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(b)  the account number;
(c)  the brokerage rate;
(d)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(e)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
Moreover, the executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or
the specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite
party, date, time, and any other relevant information.  The Compliance
Department will conduct periodic audits of such records, and falsification
of such information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

If you have any questions concerning this new rule, please contact Bernard
Purta, Senior Vice President, Regulatory Affairs and Operations, at (212)
299- 2380; Thomas LaSala, Vice President, NYMEX Compliance Department, at
(212) 299-2897; or Arthur McCoy, Vice President, Financial Surveillance
Section, NYMEX Compliance Department, at (212) 299-2928,

NEW RULE 9.11A ("Give-Up Trades")

(Entire rule is new.)

Rule 9.11A     Give-Up Trades

In the absence of a give-up agreement whose terms and conditions govern the
responsibilities/obligations of executing brokers, customers and Clearing
Members, the following rules shall define the respective
responsibilities/obligations of those parties to an order.  The "executing
broker", as used in this rule, is the registered billing entity, Member
Firm or Floor Broker to whom the order is transmitted.

(A)    Responsibilities/Obligations of Clearing Members

(1). Limits Placed by Clearing Member.   A Clearing Member may, in its
discretion, place trading limits on the trades it will accept for give-up
for a customer's account from an executing broker, provided however, that
the executing broker receives prior written or electronic notice from the
Clearing Member of the trading limits on that account.  Notice must be
received by the executing broker in a timely manner.  A copy of such notice
shall be retained by the Clearing Member.

(2). Trade Rejection.  A Clearing Member may reject ("DK") a trade only if:
(1) the trade exceeds the trading limits established under Section I(A) of
this rule for that customer and it has been communicated to the executing
broker as described in Subsection (A); or (2) the trade is an error for
which the executing broker is responsible.  If a Clearing Member has a
basis for rejecting a trade, and chooses to do so in accordance with the
provisions of Rule 2.21(B), it must notify the executing broker promptly.

(3). Billing.  A Clearing Member will pay all floor brokerage fees incurred
for all transactions executed by the executing broker for the customer and
subsequently accepted by the Clearing Member by means of the ATOM system.
Floor brokerage fees will be agreed upon in advance among the Clearing
Member, customer and the executing broker.

(B)  Responsibilities/Obligations of Executing Brokers

(1)  Customer Order Placement.  An executing broker will be responsible for
determining that all orders are placed or authorized by the customer.  Once
an order has been accepted, a broker or the broker's clerk must:

(a)  confirm the terms of the order with the customer;
(b)  accurately execute the order according to its terms;
(c)  confirm the execution of the order to the customer as soon as
practicable; and
(d)  transmit such executed order to the Clearing Member as soon as
practicable in accordance with Exchange Rules and procedures.

2.   Use of Other Persons.  Unless otherwise agreed in writing, the
executing broker is allowed to use the services of another broker in
connection with the broker's obligations under these rules.  The executing
broker remains responsible to the customer and Clearing Member under these
rules.

3.    Executing Broker Responsibility for Verifying Clearing Member
Authorization.  Prior to a broker accepting and executing an initial order
for any new customer account, the executing broker must confirm with the
Clearing Member by telephonic, electronic or written means, that:
(f)  the customer has a valid account with the Clearing Member;
(g)  the account number;
(h)  the brokerage rate;
(i)  the customer is authorized by the Clearing Member to place orders with
the executing broker for that account; and
(j)  a listing or summary of persons authorized to place orders for that
account.
The executing broker must retain a copy of the authorization or the
specifics of the telephonic confirmation, which includes: opposite party,
date, time, and any other relevant information.  The falsification of such
information shall be the basis for disciplinary action.

4.   Rejection of Customer Order.  Where an executing broker has confirmed
Clearing Member authorization to execute orders on behalf of a customer in
accordance with this Rule 9.11A, the broker may, in the broker's
discretion, reject an order that the customer transmits to the broker for
execution.  The broker shall promptly notify the customer and the Clearing
Member(s) of any such rejection.

	Prior to moves                After
DEC	-2,003			 1,967
JAN	10,502			-1,588
FEB	 1,338			   552
MAR	-7,013			   188
APR	 5,831			     33

the over all position before the move was 1,240 and as of yesterday it is 4,205.

Let me know what the concerns are at EDF MAN and the request that they are making.
We can shift some positions around if the have levels by months that they want us to stay under.

Dutch

Dutch - please send me the numbers.  Sarah

Sarah, 

That's is fine , I have talk to martin since I have been at ENE for the past 2 1/2 years,
so we will get together as needed to handle these concerns.

Dutch

EDF is concerned because they are worried about the number of positions they are taking on for Enron.  They want to make an additional margin call of $45 million which ENE is not willing to post (true reason: corporate liquidity issues.) According to our broker agreement with EDF, EDF is not allowed to request more margin than the NYMEX requires so we refused on that basis.  EDF may want to reduce the positions they are holding based on their perceived risk of ENE.  Ira Polk, the CFO of EDF Man said the best person to talk to is Marty Timmonds.  I would not call him up and volunteer to move positions but if he calls you and wants to do so, the moving of positions was agreed to as one way to reduce EDF Man's risk without ENE posting additional cash margin.

Dutch - there is a mess with Fimat and since you used to run John's book an=
d may see something in this situation I do not, I wondered if you could giv=
e me any feedback in this before I send it to Deffner.  Thanks, Sarah=09

On Tuesday, Oct. 30 Warren Tashnek (Fimat Houston) and Steve Forman (Fimat =
NY) telephoned me to inform Enron that Fimat cut its trading lines from $20=
 million to $11 million for Enron.  This cut is irrespective of the $20 mil=
lion credit limit we have from Soc Gen for the margin line.  (Soc Gen is th=
e bank that owns Fimat brokerage.)  Fimat made this decision based on the f=
ollowing events according to Steve:

Thursday 10/25
ENE positions were expitted from ABN to Fimat.  The positions came from exi=
sting positions at ABN, JP Morgan, SSB and Goldman Sachs.  Generally broker=
s agree how to handle expitting of trades including the transfer of cash as=
sociated with the moving of the trades.=20
Specifically a major issue evolved with ABN and Fimat.  In this case, Fimat=
 agreed with ABN to transfer the trades at the trade price and then rebook =
them at the trade price.  There was a $10 million variation margin associat=
ed with this transfer of trades at the trade price which ABN agreed to send=
 on Friday to Fimat.  Since Fimat agreed to accept the trades at the trade =
price, Fimat was exposed in the event that ABN did not send the $10 million=
 on Friday.  If Fimat had agreed to transfer the trades at the settlement r=
ate instead of the trade price then Fimat would not have been exposed for $=
10 million in variation margin on Thursday night.   =20

Friday, 10/26
On Friday, Fimat did not receive its $10 million from ABN as agreed.  When =
Fimat called ABN, ABN told Fimat that ENE called ABN and instructed ABN to =
send the money directly to ENE.  This left Fimat exposed for $10 million on=
 behalf of Enron. =20
On Friday morning, Fimat brokerage statements showed that ENE was owed $28 =
million by Fimat.  Fimat sent $5.7 million to Soc Gen to pay down the Soc G=
en margin line for Enron.  This left $22 million available for ENE but Fima=
t wanted its $10 million.  This led to confusion between Enron and Fimat.=
=20
On Friday, there was a conversation between Fimat NY and Fimat Montreal.  F=
imat Montreal asked Fimat NY to take positions on behalf of ENE.  The numbe=
r of positions and the variation margin associated with these positions wer=
e undisclosed. =20
Very late on Friday, HSBC tried to transfer Canadian positions to Fimat Can=
ada without an account for Enron at Fimat Canada. =20
Based in the bad press on Enron and the gossip in the financial community r=
ight now, Fimat NY told Fimat Montreal to refuse the transfer. =20
Fimat wants to know why Enron is expitting trades from bigger brokerage hou=
ses that have increased risk allocations fro Enron.  Fimat is uncomfortable=
 with these events. =20

Monday, 10/29
Fimat decides it wants an explanation from Enron.  Fimat wants to reassess =
the brokerage statements and double check both the amount of money transfer=
red to them and also the positions transferred.  Fimat informed Enron that =
it would not move money based on brokerage statements alone.  Fimat would n=
ot confirm to Enron what amounts of money should actually move until later =
in the day.  This does not work for Enron as we must inform our Treasure by=
 8:00 am as to what cash transfers will occur.  Under our current loan agre=
ement with Soc Gen, Fimat informs Soc Gen by 12:00 noon if money should mov=
e so Fimat is changing its way of doing business with Enron based on its di=
scomfort with ENE as a counter party. =20

Tuesday, 10/30
100 positions were expitted to Fimat to offset the gas positions from ABN.

Fimat proposed solutions
$3 million T-bill posted to Fimat as collateral on ENE behalf
Guarantee to Fimat with respect to trading from ENE (although ENE has alrea=
dy posted guarantee to Soc Gen for margin line)
ENE to convince Soc Gen to guarantee to Fimat that Soc Gen will make paymen=
ts on ENE's behalf

My tkae on the situation:
Fimat is upset based mainly on Enron's handling of expitted trades and bad =
press.  I told Fimat that I believed the reason trades were expitted to Fim=
at was that ENE wanted to move its positions to brokers who were offering m=
argin lines to ENE.  I promised to look into our handling or mishandling of=
 the situaiton but it seems that disorganization rather than ill intent was=
 responsible for Fimat's inconveniences.   I explained that Enron is prepar=
ed neither to mediate between Soc Gen and Fimat nor to cause Soc Gen to mak=
e payments to Fimat on our behalf.  That issue should have been resolved wh=
en the amrgin line was set up and the payment mechanism has been working fi=
ne so far.  As far as the confusion with ABN, we were not party to the disc=
ussions betweeen Fimat and ABN and can not make any comment to that.    Fin=
ally we can not make margin payments to Fimat when we do not have proper no=
tice time.  I am sorry that there is bad press out there but I do not think=
 we should give Fimat special permission to comb through our statements on =
an on going basis.  This may have been necessary for them earlier this week=
 but they need to get their act together and get the proper number to us ea=
rly in the morning like all the other brokers. =20

We need to determine how much we need Fimat right now.  I am not inclined t=
o entirely blow them off especially sinces I  do not want them to tell othe=
r brokers that we are acting strangely and hurt our reputation further righ=
t now.  At the same time, no one around Enron needs more work right now and=
 we can not hold a high maintenance broker's hand hand every step of the wa=
y.  Let's decide what to do and implement.

Frank gave me the info that per the EDF statement NG margin is 17,062,684 with them
From what you see is this number possible ?
 
Dutch
 

Hi Dutch,
 
You are correct, this is the related master number.  I would guess that by 9:30 ish Frank should have his numbers finalized, as my report is complete and ready for him to load.
 
I have not been forecasting EDF's number with treasury....if you believe that they will be sending this amount, please let me know so that I may inform treasury.

Again we have excess on our account today with EDF Man.  When I called to confirm, Paul tells me that no money with be transfered.  Total amount of excess is $24,296,123.00.  
 
Please call me if any questions or concerns.
 
Thanks!
gg  

Just wanted to let you know that i am thinking of you 
ILY
dq

thnx Gerri

Hi Dutch,
 
Yes, I would think this is possible because the overall margin excess is $24,296,123.00.  Unfortunately, I don't see any "breakdowns" on the numbers.
 
Hope this helps!
gg

Gerri , 
 
Frank gave me the info that per the EDF statement NG margin is 17,062,684 with them
From what you see is this number possible ?
 
Dutch
 

Hi Dutch,
 
You are correct, this is the related master number.  I would guess that by 9:30 ish Frank should have his numbers finalized, as my report is complete and ready for him to load.
 
I have not been forecasting EDF's number with treasury....if you believe that they will be sending this amount, please let me know so that I may inform treasury.
 
Thanks!
gg  

Gerri,
 
I assume this is for all commodities at EDF Man, would Frank have the break down in about 1 hour ?

Hi Dutch,
 
I hated to call you to tell you I still don't have an answer from EDF Man.  I spoke to Paul again about 5 min. ago (1:45) and he tells me that he still can't get an answer but that I'm the first on the list to call!!??  I then called our treasury department and spoke to Nera and she says that the wire has not come in as of yet.
 
I'll let you know as soon as I do!

Mojo,

that is sweet , pardon the pun
those cakes look great , what is in the casino cake ?
it looks pretty cool

How are things going for you ?
Have you settled into a groove yet ?

This past weekend was great for me.
I spent the entire weekend with Kay , 
we had dinner with my parents on sat. Night
and just hung out the entire weekend.
I have had a very different out look on life lately and
it has been working well for me. I have started to ask
alot more questions instead of always assuming the answer.
It has been working well for me.

Hope all is good with you.

document the rest of the cakes, petit fours, breads, and morning

So on the EDF Man acct if we executed and cleared throught them the total cost paid to EDF is  what ?
with the Floor rate 1.25 & clearing 0.90

do you also have the NYMEX fees ?

NYMEX fees are the same regardless of the Broker correct

For a full round turn it would be as follows...

Floor rate $2.50
Clearing   $1.80
NYMEX Fees  .80
TOTAL:  $5.10

Let me know if you want me to talk to him about an out of the money deal.

Dutch,

Pursuant to our conversation.

This is the risk we would like to swap out.
This is from your view......meaning if the position is positive ENRON is
LONG to JARON.  JARON would need to buy from ENRON to flatten out.

Hi there Dutch!

How are you? Hope you're doing well.

We having been working on a storage problem that Philip as given us the
framework for.  In working out the details, we've come across a few
questions that we know you can help us answer. I've included Philip's
description of this problem in the word doc below, just for reference.

1) In Philip's document, he lists discount factors over the months.  We
understand that since the users are making storage decisions and hedging
future months, they need to take time value of money into account.  What is
actually being discounted? Is it NYMEX? Is it prices of the instruments?
How does that factor into user's storage decisions?

2) In our problem, we ask the user to fill out a storage schedule and then
select instruments to hedge positions created by the storage.  In our other
scenarios we have initial and natural position split out into the Enron
risk buckets (Price, Index, Basis, GD) and have users choose the
appropriate hedging instruments based on the risk areas the instruments
cover.  In this storage scenario, the only positions created are by storage
decisions.  What risk bucket would storage create a position in? My
thoughts are that if the only positions created are by storage, then would
the user really need only 1 type of instrument to hedge their risks?

Thanks in advance for your help, Dutch!

Dear Ernesto , 

Welcome to the pleasure of planning an event for your asshole friends.
This has been a long standing tradition that the person that gets sucked or suckered
into planning an outing for the group gets bitched at non stop until the event happens.
The next step is "the event" that will be the turning point of this bitching.
There are two outcomes,
1.	Everyone has a good time and you will bitch back and it will be lessened to good friendly humor
2.	Everyone is pissed b/c they drove 100 miles , they play bad and blame you for picking a bad place to
	play, they kill you and bury you in a sand trap on the number 12 hole , finish the round and never mention
	your name again.

All I have to say Ernie is good luck on everyone play GOLF well this Sunday.

Live the next few days to the fullest , they might be your last.

Long live Ernesto

Dutch

Please read the message below (from Mark).  He asked about it, I looked it
up and got us a tee time.  If anybody wants to get a tee time somewhere
else, that is fine with me.  Just let me know so that I can cancel the tee
times in Kingwood.

With Richard playing and the boys from Austin playing, I think that Kingwood
is a happy medium.  We could try Brock park if that's what you guys want.
Who the hell lives by Brock?  I actually think that the drive to Kingwood is
better than the drive into 5th ward or whatever ward it is.

I don't mind making a drive to play in Austin or Beaumont or Katy.  It's

I heard an add on 610 for Kingwood Cove or something.  Do you have time to
check it out?

   Hi there Dutch!

   How are you? Hope you're doing well.

   We having been working on a storage problem that Philip as given us the
   framework for.  In working out the details, we've come across a few
   questions that we know you can help us answer. I've included Philip's
   description of this problem in the word doc below, just for reference.

   1) In Philip's document, he lists discount factors over the months.  We
   understand that since the users are making storage decisions and hedging
   future months, they need to take time value of money into account.  What
   is
   actually being discounted? Is it NYMEX? Is it prices of the instruments?
   How does that factor into user's storage decisions?

   2) In our problem, we ask the user to fill out a storage schedule and
   then
   select instruments to hedge positions created by the storage.  In our
   other
   scenarios we have initial and natural position split out into the Enron
   risk buckets (Price, Index, Basis, GD) and have users choose the
   appropriate hedging instruments based on the risk areas the instruments
   cover.  In this storage scenario, the only positions created are by
   storage
   decisions.  What risk bucket would storage create a position in? My
   thoughts are that if the only positions created are by storage, then
   would
   the user really need only 1 type of instrument to hedge their risks?

   Thanks in advance for your help, Dutch!

Hi Again,
 
Would you please re-confirm via this e-mail that per your conversation with John Arnold and his with Louise, I am to pay $30,000,000.00 to Bank Paribas.
 
I thank you for all of your help these past few weeks!

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

Mark is driving. Good. I need to hitch a ride on that bus also.

Bitching is what I do, so I will continue to bitch.  Please look us up some
sports bar near Texarkana so I can watch some NFL action after I kick your
butts at golf.  Long live the Beaver!!!  Mark, your driving right...I think
we need to leave at 4 am or so to make it to the border.

Smooches.

Hey Ernie, 

Tee Times and directions pls , I am in for hooter after we play golf

dq

There is a HOOTERS on 1960 and 59.  That might also require some driving.

Dutch,

Pursuant to our conversation.

This is the risk we would like to swap out.
This is from your view......meaning if the position is positive ENRON is
LONG to JARON.  JARON would need to buy from ENRON to flatten out.

Cal 3      (572)
Cal 4      1921
Cal 5       655
Cal 6    (1002)
Cal 7      (454)
Cal 8         96

I would prefer to Buy from Enron if you cannot find spreads.

Hi David , 

At this time I do not know of a rotation on the NYMEX desk.
Both Justin and myself are both Associates currently on the desk that will not be rotating
for some time now.

Dutch

Hi Dutch:

Do you know if your group may be looking as my rotation ends 11/30?

Thanks

Hi,

I enjoyed working with you during my prior assignment at Enron as the primary person managing the Nymex natural gas positions
and serving as a liaison between your Nymex trading activity and numerous brokers.

Additionally, I am currently seeking a new assignment as an analyst as my rotation date is approaching and am interested
in knowing of any positions available in your group. I do know Brian who formerly worked in your group as an analyst.

I am extremely interested in meeting with you to review my background after trading hours.

Thanks,
David

http://www.emerils.com/restaurants/delmonicolv/

dq

Hey Mo ,

When you get a minute I would like to chat about your doggie
We got a boxer pup this weekend and I wanted to ask you a few things 
about you pit bull

dq

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Hi Dutch,

Per our conversation today, I am resending the questions and concerns that
I have on the Futures and Options practice questions/graphic ideas.  It is
very important that we setup some time with you next week or the week after
Thanksgiving.  Let me know what your schedule looks like.

I need final signoffs on the Futures and Options practice
exercises/graphics.  The deadline for this was today.  I need to know if
you are okay with the graphic ideas and practice questions that you've seen
so far for the Futures and Options.

Questions and Concerns: I know you have seen these questions several times,
so I pointed out the areas that I need your help.
(1.) I need help with question #4 in Options.  I need help developing the
graphic for this question.
(2.) I need the answers to the scenario questions that you created and the
explanation for the answers.

Attached below are the two topics that you are responsible for in the
Knowledge System.

John,

I called Ben and left a msg to call you in reagrds to the below email.

Dutch

Dutch,

I am working on pulling together due diligence information for Global Finance in regards to ENA trading activity.  One number that stood out to us on the ENA PRMA detail was the Q4 2000 settlement of approximately negative $500MM.  We discussed possible reasons for this figure with the ENA accounting group, and they suggested it might be the Dec 2000 Nymex settlement, which was more that negative $600MM.  They suggested that I could contact you for further insight.  Would you have a few minutes sometime today to talk about that settlement?

Thanks,

Mr. Quigley,

I am predicting the worst knowing that we could possibly be running late. So
I have two questions. First, what will be the cost per square (minimum
purchase)? And would you like for me to bring some pico de gallo?

yes the coversion is 5.825 so ie 4.891 is 28.49

Dutch,

Can you please tell me the conversion of nat gas price per mmbtu to price per gallon or bbl.  For example, if nat gas is 4.891/mmbtu for May, how does it convert to $/gal or bbl?

Thanks for your help.  I appreciate your time.
Anjali

Anjoli, you can call Dutch Quigley and he can help you out.  He is on the trade floor so pls do not call him till around 3:00 today.
Thanks,
Sherry

Thanks, that would be great!

Anjali

We do not know what the conversion is.  I can check w/Errol first thing in the morning if that is o.k.?
Sorry,
Sherry

Sherry, 

Can you please tell me the conversion factor for nat gas price per mmbtu to price per gallon or price per bbl?  Can you please give me a short example because the conversion I see is 5.825 (mmbtu to bbls).

Thanks for your help.

I am glad to hear that the move went well. I am sure that you will do great and that you will learn alot.
I do not know if you got a hold of Kori or not but she has been here during the week and gone on the weekends.
I will be in sunny Florida this weekend and will be thinking of all my gator friends : )

Hope everything is going great

Dutch

Hi Dutch--
How are you doing? I am doing good. The move went very smoothly and I have already started at Teco. I am learning a lot !!! I don't have much time to talk right now, but I just wanted to ask you if you have seen Kori. I have tried calling her at work and at home for a few days now, and I haven't gotten in touch with her. I figured you would know if she was on vacation or something. She has my mail key and I needed her to check my mail for me. Thanks!!

Two statues in a city park, one female and one male, had faced each
other for many years. One morning, an angel appeared and told the
statues, "Since you have both brought enjoyment to many people for
years, I'm giving you your greatest wish and bringing you to life for 30
minutes. In that time you may do whatever you like." And the statues
came to life.

Smiling at each other, they ran toward a stand of trees and dove behind
a couple of bushes. The angel smiled as she listened to them giggling
and rustling in the grass. After 15 minutes, the statues emerged from
the bushes, smiling and happy. The angel was puzzled. "You still have 15
minutes. Would you like to continue?"

The male statue looked at the female and asked, "Do you want to do it
again?"
"Oh, yes!" the female statue said. "But this time YOU hold the pigeon
down and I'LL poop on its head!"

(Copyright 2001)

THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, maybe, had he not been saying the other things. 
Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths.
Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and meekly hand over tribute. 
And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. 
We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand that energy companies could create "shortages" whenever they wanted merely by closing plants for "maintenance"? You bet we did. And did we confuse the energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to repeal the laws of nature? We did not. 
But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit of volunteerism is much praised. 
Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but don't. 
AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using energy we didn't need. 
I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but never used. 
We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. 
Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! 
Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get away with it! You watch! 
I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any extra money. 
We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we see. And we await developments, or create them. 

Ina,

I still have not gotten my last two expenses , can you see if john has approved them are where the snag is
also from the trip how do I expense out a cash expense with out a receipt ie paying at crowbar for 6 people ?

Dutch

thanks for checking on that , it was $120 for the club , how should i put it on my next exp report ?

I called and spoke with the manager over accounting.  He said that the reason your expense report took so long is that it was being audited.  They do this randomly.  I told him you need a check cut today on the 107.45 and he said the other expense report should be in your account by this Friday.  I can still add the cash expense.  Just tell me how much it was.  You do not need a receipt if it was under $75.  

Let me know.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

I can add it on the second one I already sent in.  Accounting said because they are reviewing it, it will still be kicked back to John to approve today and they can add another expense on.  I will put it on there.

Purvi,

Glad to see you working on some good stuff : )

you need to pull out a black sholes calculation and input the varialbles that you were given
and then call a power options trader to ask for a marekt to check the resonableness of the model
models can be way off on options due to skew and market conditions

good luck

I have this little project to do and i need a little help from you... (since you are an expert in this field!!)

ok-- i need to figure out what the premium is on an aug on- peak call option for power. Now , I know that power is not what you do, but I can use some ideas on how to get started.

Terms

Strike price  is $200/ MWH
Forward curve for Aug is $125/MWH
Aug 2001
Foward Volatility of 100%
Valuation Date is June 8, 2001
Interest Rate is 6%
On- Peak Call Option for 50 MW

SO far, I have looked at some forcasts for Aug, and seen which hours the market rate is above 200 to come up with a premium value.  I have an answer for this problem, but I was just curous as to see where you would start. Anything will work. Thanks!!

Purvi

P.S-- also, don't be hesitant to tell me that you have no clue--- You'll still be my favorite manager!!!

Purvi,

I have not heard any major news on the ENE stock , we are all just watching it drop
most energy company stocks are in decline right now , wal street is bearish with 
energy stocks until california gets settled 

How is the new group ?

Thanks for the info. I did do the Black Sholes exercise and got a different premium.  I'll have to research it more. Anyways, thanks again for your help.. by the way, what is going on with the stock price? I only have 10 more days to exercise!!!!!!!! aaaggghhhhh

One of the questions posed in Don?t Sweat the Small Stuff is, ?Will this
matter a year fromnow?? Some things will, of course. But so many
others--perhaps most things---won?t. There is something very comforting in
knowing this. When the computer crashes, the keys are misplaced, the house
is a mess or the call isn?t returned, it is annoying, but it?s not the end
the world.

I am up to play anytime

don't we still have nine holes left at texas national?  and if so (and they have not expired),  why not try and head out there next weekend or something?  if not just a regular round somewhere else.  i'd be apt to go somewhere else besides brock and stuff.  i heard there are some pretty decent courses that are not too expensive if you dive out 20 minutes or so.  ernie said there's a course out in the baytown area that's not too bad.  let me know what you think.  i hope that everything is working itself out for you.  i know it's cheezy but i'm here for you.

Update on Andex VPP - They want to try and close on July 9th (Monday), but it will be dependent on pricing.

We have asked for quit a few updates and we appreciate your help.  Going forward, we will probably want to get a quote every other day, or when the market makes a significant movement.

If you would update the quote before you leave that would be great.

I can print reports so you can keep up with it, but I don't police everyone's time that closely.  Just wanted everyone to know so if you loose some vacation, it will be your fault.

	Yes, I already have a call into her.

Bill and Maria, one of you should check with Cindy first to make sure she is ok with it.

I checked with Dari who checked with Drew, seems like we are ok with Cindy Olsen replacing Andy Fastow.  Thanks, Maria Pavlou
	I think Cindy is fine.

We need to take Andy Fastow off of our board of directors on our web site - he was the officer for our sales marketing division.  What do you think about replacing him with Cindy Olsen?  Maria

		

Drew and Greg,

	Andy Fastow is currently shown in the organizational chart on Northern Natural's electronic bulletin board as "President, Northern Pipeline Sales Division".  Apparently, he was named to this position because he was not an officer or director of one of our marketing affiliates and was also not an officer or director of Northern. This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  I wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. I would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.

I'm a new addition to the gas pipeline legal group, having recently transferred from the EES legal department. Among other things, I'll be handling Northern Natural's compliance with the marketing affiliate rule. 

An issue has come up with Northern as a result of the recent changes at Enron Corp.

Why wouldn't we just use Andy's replacement?  Cindy is communciation and HR, not much fit there at all-  MK

This satisfied the requirements of the marketing affilate rule. Given recent personnel changes at Enron Corp., it's now necessary to find a replacement for Andy Fastow. Frazier King suggested Cindy Olson, who also is neither an officer or director of a marketing affiliate nor an officer or director of Northern.  We wanted to run this by both of you before proceeding further. We would appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.

	Actually, there was one new development late yesterday. Frazier wasn't entirely comfortable with having Andy Fastow in that role in the first place since he may have had access to transportation/capacity information in his capacity as CFO of Enron Corp. The same concern would, of course apply to Andy Fastow's successor. That was why Frazier had suggested Cindy Olsen. I spoke with Mary Kay and told her about this concern. She understands, but continues to feel that we should be able to come up with someone who is more substantively involved in Enron's underlying businesses but who does not have access to transportation/capacity information. I'll work with Frazier to see if we can identify someone. So, let's hold off for now in contacting Jeff McMahon. I'll keep you updated. Thanks.

I have no objection.  Drew do you want to contact McMahon's office or should I.  Either way is fine.  Greg

Any objections to Mary Kay's suggestion? If not, I'll probably need the help of one of you in contacting Jeff McMahon. 

Why wouldn't we just use Andy's replacement?  Cindy is communciation and HR, not much fit there at all-  MK

I'm a new addition to the gas pipeline legal group, having recently transferred from the EES legal department. Among other things, I'll be handling Northern Natural's compliance with the marketing affiliate rule. 

An issue has come up with Northern as a result of the recent changes at Enron Corp.

Joel,

	Yes, I would start with Michael. He did a calculation a year or so ago when OWC first filed for bankruptcy and should be able to update that. Another source is Maureen Palmer, who (if you haven't met her yet) is the EES business person who is responsible for the OWC/EES relationship. You should probably speak with Maureen in any event to get her input on whether EES really wants to pursue this claim. When I spoke with her about this several months ago, there was apparently a difference of opinion among our business people on this. Good luck. Let me know if I can help on anything else.

Bill,

I spoke with Bill Wallander today just to catch up on where we are.  Bill asked me to get him the documentation to support our pre-petition unsecured claim, including calculation of the amount thereof.  Do you know where I can get that information?  Michael Tribolet?

Thanks.

Joel

	I have no idea. I have never heard of these swaps. I don't know when these were implemented. Presumably after we signed the original deal, although I don't know. Apparently, the people on our trading desk dealt with the customer without getting legal input. Scary. You may want to check with Jim Keller's/Mike Smith's group to see if anyone there knows anything about this. 

What is all this?
Deborah, we need to paper the swaps outlined in the attachment and get to the customer for execution.  Apparently this was overlooked when we did the deals initially...although I can't imagine what we were thinking in not obtaining documentation for these.

I would like to get these out on Tuesday at the latest.  On the issue of the 77,500 MMbtu, I will address directly with the customer and let you know what I find out.

Thanks.

RZ

Richard,
To answer your first question, #326528 does not begin until Jan 1, 2002 so nothing has been billed out yet. For your second question, I agree that the 77,500 for Dec 01 of #328974 does look random. But I cannot verify anything for you besides what is in RGS. That is why we originally sent this spreadsheet to you to verify what was correct and what was incorrect in RGS. If this volume is incorrect, we need to unwind the deal in RGS immediately. Please let Russ and I know what you find out so the volumes can be fixed in RGS if needed. Thanks

Jennifer

Jennifer, sorry...left off the attachment.

RZ

 << File: Springs Industries Gas Swap Inventory.xls >> 

Jennifer, pls see my slightly enhanced file attached.  Can you determine when Contract # 326528 began billing?  I need an Effective Date for the contract.  Also, the 77,500 MMBtu for Dec. 01 looks totally random and doesn't match with the volumes for the remainder of the months for #328974.  Any thoughts on that one?

Thanks.

RZ
 

Richard,
I have attached the financial deals in RGS for 2001 where the originator is VEG Desk. Russ and I had discussed these deals with you a few weeks ago. Can you please verify that the pricings are correct, as we have nothing to verify these against. Thank you

	This is a test.

	Drew,

		Steve Harris and the other Transwestern commercial people are seeking guidance on what limits will be imposed by the new credit facility on Transwestern's dealings with affiliates, most notably EWS/ENA. Will it be necessary to obtain the consent of the lenders before Transwestern may enter into any transaction with an affiliate? Are there de minimis exceptions? Are there any plans to obtain pre-approval of either certain categories of transactions or transactions up to an aggregate dollar limit? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.  

Steve and Kim,

	I spoke with Drew after the staff meeting today regarding what limitations would be imposed by the new credit agreement on Transwestern's dealings with its affiliates, most notably ENA/EWS. Drew said that this and a number of other issues are still being negotiated and that it's not yet clear where we'll wind up. Obviously, we'll try and negotiate as much flexibility on the affiliate issue with the banks as possible. Drew indicated that the agreement should be finalized in the next day or so and that he would issue guidance on this and other issues as soon as it is. 

Emily,

	Thanks for all of your help on this!

Bill,

	To complete the information I provided to you yesterday, the name of the electric utility providing electric service to Transwestern's Bloomfield, New Mexico compressor station is: The City of Farmington Electric Department.

	In addition, although not required for a Transwestern bankruptcy filing, the name of the electric utility providing electric service to Northern Natural's Hubbard, Iowa compressor station is: Midland Power Cooperative.

The amendment that I think you're referring to was not signed. We sent it to Starwood and then nothing happened. If you can't find a hard copy, you can call Rell Tipton at V&E and ask him to e-mail you the latest version of the Starwood amendment that he's been working on. If you can't reach Rell, his assistant, Birdie Cortinas can probably help. Rell's number is (713)758-4506. Hope this helps.

Hi, Bill.  Sorry to bother you again.  I found four original amendments in Travis' office, but what I am looking for is the Amendment to the CMA that pertains to the Offer Period.  Do you recall the one I am talking about?  Did it ever get signed?  

Thanks,
Jean

No, unfortunately not.

Emily,

	I plan to be on vacation on the following days: December 7th (tomorrow), December 17th through the 21st, and December 31st.

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of TW's response to the FERC data request in the USGT negotiated rate proceeding. Please note that our response to Data Request No. 1, contemplates that we will provide to FERC copies of the other bids that were received on this capacity. We could attempt to summarize this other bids, but I think the better approach is to just provide copies. 

A schedule of actual volumes transported and actual rates charged USGT is attached (this is the Schedule C that is referenced in our response to Data Request No. 4). This will need to be updated next week prior to filing. I do not have the other attachments to the responses in electronic format. I can of course provide paper copies of these to anyone who would like to see them. 

I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon on Monday, December 10. Thanks.

 	  

Greg, 

	Sorry, I meant to copy you on this originally. Please let me know if this looks ok to you. I left you a voice mail about the day off tomorrow (December 7th). Thanks.

Emily,

	I plan to be on vacation on the following days: December 7th (tomorrow), December 17th through the 21st, and December 31st.

Attached is a draft of an agreement that would terminate the transportation agreement that Transwestern has with Public Service of New Mexico. Assuming that PSNM is okay with the concept of terminating the agreement, I have no problem with providing this draft to PSNM. Please call if you have any questions or comments.

 

Lili,

	Thanks for your message. First, I hope your son's ok. His health is obviously the top priority. Hopefully, he'll get better soon.

I'm having faxed to each of you a summary that was prepared by Michelle Lokay of the bids that were received by third parties for the USGT capacity. I understand that the preference is to provide FERC with a summary rather than the actual bids. 

Michelle,

	Here's a draft of the letter. Please let me know what you think. Thanks.

						Bill

 

Greg,

	When you have a chance, I think it would be a good idea for me to brief you on the latest developments regarding Enron Compression Services.  

Charlie,

	I think your summary is very good. I would like to add that although Midland cannot discontinue service to ENA for failure to pay the $88,816.33 and $39,881.55 invoices, Midland can shut off service if ENA fails to pay any future invoices. So, it's imperative that someone from Northern very closely monitor the situation with ENA and Midland to ensure that ENA makes the necessary payments. In addition, the bankruptcy court may require ENA to provide Midland with "adequate assurance" of future payments. If required, this will most likely take the form of a cash deposit or a letter of credit. Again, if ENA fails to provide this adequate assurance, Midland may discontinue service.

After the meeting yesterday and speaking to Bill Rapp and several others today I believe I can summarize the Hubbard/ENA circumstances as they exist right now:

There is no certainty when dealing with a bankrupt entity, however, this is where we are today.  The theme I keep hearing is business as usual. 

Tom,

Someone from Operations should probably follow-up with Midland Power (I suggest a boat load of empathy regarding their $128,000 in limbo) after they get the ENA letter.

 << File: 56q101!.DOC >> 

Actually, I recommended that we attach the entire bids and not the summaries. I believe it was Mary Kay and Steve Kirk who thought the summaries would be better. 

I am ok with a summary (although I don't think it is as powerful of evidence, assuming the bids show we complied).  Out of curiosity, why are summaries better (or should I ask:  Whats wrong with the bids).  Greg

I'm having faxed to each of you a summary that was prepared by Michelle Lokay of the bids that were received by third parties for the USGT capacity. I understand that the preference is to provide FERC with a summary rather than the actual bids. 

Steve,

	I understand from Maria Pavlou that you are reformatting and also perhaps editing the data request responses that I drafted. Please forward to me a copy of the proposed revisions as soon as they're available so that I can review them. Thanks.

ENA's bankruptcy lawyers are supposed to be sending out a signed copy of the letter today. When I receive it, I'll fax it to Charlie so he can forward it directly to the appropriate person(s) at Midland.

I visited with Charlie Graham this AM.  To the best of operations knowledge, the past due statement for October(past due Dec. 2nd.) was mailed Dec.5th.  Midlands normal practice is to discontinue service 10 days after mailing the past due notice.  I think it is safe to assume that we must have the attached letter in the appropriate Midland Officials hand before the 15th.

Charlie has agreed to represent Operations and call Midland power and to assure the letter is received by Midland asap.

Charlie,  the following are contacts we have used in the past for Midland.
Roger Wick---515-386-4111  (most likely the best starting point)
Patrick Minnick---712-297-5738  Key Accounts Executive
Norm Fandel---515-386-4111   Director of Marketing

Jerry, we should probably visit about this on the outage call this afternoon.  We'll need to get planning to run some capacity numbers just in case.
 
Thanks

Lorraine,

	Thanks for forwarding the attached message. The way I read this, PSNM is effectively withdrawing its demand for the collateral as long as we don't use the contract. We should probably send them a letter confirming that this is the case. I would suggest that you just send an e-mail in response stating that what PSNM has proposed is acceptable and that our understanding is that PSNM will not require collateral as long as we don't utilize the contract. Therefore, PSNM's demand for collateral by December 15 is, based on our understanding, withdrawn. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks. 

FYI

I talked to my Supervisor and here is what we can do, PNMGS will not accept or confirm any nominations under Off-System Transportation Contract T39817.  This will put the Contract in an "INACTIVE" status instead of total Termination of the Contract.
Prior to any  future expectation of Off-system Transportation, pursuant to Contract T39817 between PNMGS and TWPC, there will then be an updated and current determination on the Financial Responsibility as set forth under ARTICLE XII. FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.   PNMGS will then decide what, if any, steps will need to be taken prior to such Off-system Transportation.

Patsy,

	Since I haven't heard back from you re the e-mail I sent earlier this week, I assume that you're going to pass on the Nutcracker. Although I'm disappointed, I guess it's better to know this now rather than further down the road.

	Anyway, I just wanted to let you know that I really enjoyed meeting you and talking with you. You're a very, very nice person. So, I hope you find the person you're looking for. Take care and best wishes for you and your family. Happy Holidays!

Hi!

Attached for your review is a draft of the proposed letter agreement with ENA.

 

	

	Paul,

		Attached is a red-lined version of the EOG interconnect agreement, which reflects some minor changes that I made. Please call me if you'd like to discuss the attachment.

 

	Chris,

		Good to hear from you. I didn't bring the Starwood documents with me when I moved (can you believe that I forgot them?!!!), so I'm going off of memory. I believe that we are obliged to at least offer lease financing to Starwood if the conditions precedent to financing in the lease documents are satisfied. However, we do have the ability to pass through increased costs of capital that we incur as well as other appropriate costs to Starwood. 

		Hope things are going well.

Bill,

I hope your new job is treating you well.  Sorry to bother you but I had two more questions regarding Starwood that I am hoping you can answer.  They both regard the DSM projects.

1. If Starwood chooses not to use their own capital for DSM projects, is EES obliged to provide lease financing?

2. Related to the above, if we are obliged, are we limited in the rate we can charge?  i.e. Could we charge a "discouraging" rate?  The language in the MLA Section 2.2 seems to be adequately vague that if we were having trouble raising capital ourselves, we could pass those costs through as "such other factors as are customarily considered by lessor parties providing lease financing for similar equipment and terms."  

These questions came up when RAC looked at our summary documentation.  I am hoping these are quick questions for you.  Please let me know.

Thanks again,
Chris

Mark,
 
        Great to hear from you! The last few weeks have definitely been a difficult period. I still can't believe it. I'm doing fine and actually think that things are beginning to stabilize. 
 
        So, how's the baby doing? And how are you doing? John W. called about a week ago and said he thought you were doing well and seemed to be enjoying your new job (I guess it's not so new anymore). You definitely made the right decision to leave Stratum. As you've probably heard, they haven't been able to raise any money and now plan to liquidate. I think they're down to four or five people in New York and about the same number in Houston. 
 
        My address is as follows: 714 Camelot Lane, Houston, Texas 77024. 
 
        Again it's really good to hear from you. Best wishes. (Oh yeah, in case you haven't already seen the following movies, I highly recommend them: "Run Lola Run" (German with English subtitles) and "Memento" (American) - both are available on videotape.) (Also, if I remember correctly, you like classical music, so you might enjoy Murray Perahia's (sp?) recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations.) Take care. 

Bill: 

Been thinking of you a lot lately.  I hope that you are well in light of all of the enron news.  

I wanted to send you something via US mail.  I know that you bought a house about 1+ years ago, but I don't have your coordinates.  Can you send them along?

Thanks, Bill.

	Donna,

			Tony and I will participate in tomorrow's meeting. We will be in my office (extension 35269). Thanks.

Greg and Maria,	

Attached is a first draft of the response to the protest filed by the CPUC. I'm also sending a copy to Steve Sojic and Frank Kelly. I thought we would get your feedback, as well as that of Steve and/or Frank, turn another draft, and then distribute it to the business people on Monday. There is absolutely no pride of authorship on my part, so please don't hesitate to comment. Also, given the relatively short amount of time that we have to file this, I haven't prepared all of the footnotes and citations yet.

 

		
Steve and Frank,

	Attached is an initial draft of a response to the protest filed by the CPUC in RP97-288-017. I would appreciate any input that you have. Thanks.

 

	Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonment and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is that we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to the other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due to the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authorized by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.

 

Glen

	I should have included you on the distribution list. Sorry.

Attached is a draft of Transwestern's response to the protest filed by the California Public Utility Commission in Docket No. RP97-288-017. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. 

I have gotten some additional information from Mark on USGT's use of westward capacity, which I haven't had the opportunity to review or incorporate in the attached draft. From what Mark has told me, it further supports the statement in our response that USGT has not made significant use of its westward capacity and that the CUPC's claim that Transwestern is being transformed into a pipeline that is dominated by shippers using negotiated rates is greatly exaggerated. 

We need to file the response on Wednesday. Therefore, I would appreciate receiving any comments by noon tomorrow. Thanks.

 

At one point, we considered using a bill management agreement for Consolidated Container. I worked on this with Erin Stus. We came up with a draft that I was fairly happy with and it should be the latest draft under my Consolidated Container file on the j drive. If you can't find it there, give Erin a call. She should still have a copy.

Were you working on a Bill Management Agreement form that was final or near final?

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of TW's response to the protest filed by the California Public Utilities Commission of the latest negotiated rate filing.

  

Keith,

=09If I understand your change to the second paragraph correctly, the new c=
ompressors at Stations 1, 2 and 3 will be completed and placed into service=
 within the one-year deadline in the FERC order. The removal of the existin=
g units at those stations, however, will not be completed until six months =
after that. My general feeling is that as long as the old units are taken o=
ut of service by the one-year deadline and are no longer operational, we sh=
ould be ok and don't need to ask FERC for an extension. The ordering paragr=
aph from the FERC order requires that the new facilities be placed in servi=
ce within one year from the date of the order. It does not impose a similar=
 deadline for the abandonment of the existing facilities. I take it that we=
 would not operate the old and the new facilities at the same time (i.e., c=
ontinue to operate the existing compressors after we've installed and place=
d into operation the new compressors), since this would result in TW operat=
ing compression in excess of its certificated capacity. As long as we don't=
 do that, I don't think there's any need to ask for a separate extension fo=
r the abandonment.=20

Note the suggested changes. =20

Attached is a revised, red-lined version of the extension letter. I believe that I addressed Keith's question to his satisfaction, so I haven't added the additional language that he suggested regarding the timing of the removal of the existing compressor units at Stations 1, 2 and 3. Please let me know if you have any additional comments. Thanks.

 

What's a good time for everyone? I'm open in the morning.

I think we could wind this up with a quick conference call tomorrow a.m.  Greg and I had some additional thoughts on how to handle the issue that this contract is not for 40% of primary capacity - it is not like an El Paso/Dynegy, Enron or El Paso deal without necessarily getting into the alternate issue of sham transactions.  Also, Kathy R. checked and as of today, IS have not filed a protest.  Maria 

 Attached are some addtional comments and questions in regard to this answer.  MK

 << File: RP97-288cpucmk.doc >> 

Bill, attached are a few comments/questions on your proposed draft answer, which I thought was excellent.  We might want to discuss some of these questions with the ccs.  Thanks, Maria

 << File: RP97-288cpuc.doc >> 

Thanks.

One clarification,  we have not executed contracts for 120,000,  only 106,500 I think-  otherwise ok.  MK

Attached is a revised draft of the letter. The only change from the prior draft is to the volumes in the first sentence of the second paragraph. I've changed the contracted capacity figure from 120,000 Mcf to 106,700 per feedback from Keith. I think this is now ready to file, except that we will need to fill in the blanks. Please confirm this and give me a call at your convenience so that we can discuss the logistics of the filing. Thanks.

 

The attached spreadsheet breaks out scheduled volumes West of Thoreau for the period May, 2000 through October, 2001.  
The first tab of the spreadsheet breaks out the volumes by month; the second tab is a summary for the reporting period.  

Please note, for the reporting period, there were some scheduled receipts.  These have been listed separately and can be easily removed if necessary.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Dennis,

To follow up from our meeting today, please provide the delivery report that includes the following:

WHAT	Total volumes (by month) delivered to primary delivery points versus alternate delivery points
WHEN	For the period of 5/00 thru 10/31
WHERE	For all delivery points West of Thoreau (including: Calif pool, Window Rock, PGE/Mojave Topock and SOCAL Needles)
WHO	Send to William Rapp (legal), Kim Watson and myself

This information will be used to respond to criticism by the California PUC.  I believe that Bill Rapp is wanting to respond by early Wednesday so if he could get these numbers by end of day Monday, I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

Thanks for your help,

Attached is a draft of the letter that we propose to send to the CPUC regarding the AL2837 proceeding in which SoCal Gas is proposing changes to its "windowing" criteria. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. We need to file this tomorrow, so please communicate any comments to me by the close of business today, if possible. Thanks.

 

Your comments look fine. Let's wait and see if anyone else has any comments.

I'm a little nervous actually commenting that we have Shipper imbalances.  Here are my comments.

Attached is a revised version of TW's response to the CPUC's protest. This version reflects comments received from Teb, Mary Kay, Greg and Maria. I apologize that the attachment is not red-lined. I'm having computer problems and have not been able to generate a red-lined version that accurately tracks the changes. 

 

Attached is a revised version of our response to the CPUC. Sorry it's not red-lined. I can't get that function to work on my computer. 

 

I like Terry's suggestion.  In fact, in the preceding paragraph and the following paragraph where we refer to "shippers", we could refer to "customers" instead.

I agree with Lindy, I don't believe we want to mention anything about "Shipper Imbalances" my suggestion is to restate this paragraph like this:

In instances where SoCalGas happens to issue an Operational Flow Order ("OFO") during the Intraday 2 cycle, it can create imbalances with Transwesterns Customers. Because it does not afford Transwestern an opportunity to pass along these reductions to our upstream parties. When an OFO is issued in the Intraday 2 Cycle, an allocation is passed on to Transwestern through the confirmation process with SoCalGas.  Due to the timing of these OFO's, Transwestern is not afforded an opportunity to confirm such reductions with Transwestern's upstream parties.

If you have further questions, please give me a call. Thank you.

I'm the original owner. I got it shortly after I came to this department. It's a Compaq Armada M700.

Bill,
Are you the original owner of that laptop or is it a redeployed sysem?  Also, what model?

Not knowing exactly what model Compaq laptop Bill has makes this an educated guess on my part.  First of all, all new laptops came with both CD and floppy drives so if he is the orginal owner have him check in the bag.  If it was a redeployed system he may not have received all the pieces.  With that said, an internal floppy drive will run about $75 for the Compaq M700 laptop. Other models may vary in price a bit but probably not by much.

I'm sending this to you in Karon's absence . . . 

Bill Rapp's laptop (Compaq) is not equipped with the device that allows a 3.5" diskette to be loaded.  He can run CDs, but not diskettes.  What do we need to order and how much will it cost?  Thanks.

Linda,

	This looks fine. I just want to confirm that we do not countersign this transportation service request when we receive it from the potential shipper. Instead, we process the request and generate a transportation agreement that we send to the shipper for execution. When we receive an executed transportation agreement from the shipper, we countersign it and begin service. Is this correct?

Bill, Teb,

Attached is an electronic version of the request for gas transportation form that we would like to implement for TW in the new contract system..  It is very similiar to FGT's.  Would you please review and let me know if this looks okay.

Thanks

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.

Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors. To read the full earnings press release, go to www.enron.com/corp/pressroom/releases.

You may want to leave some time to general Rockies discussion this afternoon led by Frank and Steve.  Mike wants some order in the meeting it sounds like so you probably should leave some time for that.

Jay

There will be no formal rockies fundies today since i will be in the air...general discussion with Frank and Steve along with Canada will work for this week.

Jay

Keith and I discussed working towards this meeting being organized every week.  We would like the meeting to begin at 3:00 and to have all interested parties (Canada and Portland) dialed in to AT&T.  I would like the meeting room cleared and the handouts to be emailed before the meeting begins.  Please work towards emailing everyone an itinerary each week.

You guys are making great progress with the fundies information.  Nice work.

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

This morning we received FERC approval for the fourth tie-in segment (to
gate #7) contracted  for  92 Mdth/day.  This brings the firm capacity of the
Medicine Bow system to 472 Mdth/day.  The contract effective date will be
October 19, but you will be able to utilize this capacity as soon as we have
it set up in the system today.

Saturday Weather Forecast for New Orleans:

Saturday morning:  70% chance of showers and thunderstorms.  Some strong to severe with heavy rain possible.

Saturday noon: 60-70% chance of thunderstorms.  Some strong to severe with heavy rain likely.

Saturday late afternoon:  Rain chances decreasing, 30% chance of lingering showers.  

Saturday evening and night:  Clearing skies.

That is the best I can come up with right now.  Front is moving through on Saturday and it is all based on timing.  If the front slows down or speeds up, then of course it will greatly change the forecast.  My guess is that the front will come through faster than indicated and possibly by mid to late afternoon, rain chances will be nil, but at this point that is kind of risky.

Hope this helps.

Jay

take a look at the saturday weather forecast for new orleans.  my family is having a big outdoor party and my mother is considering canceling it b/c we could have rain.  i know you are busy but you are the weather master.  so if you have time, let me know what you think.

This was sent to me.  I don't know who wrote it but it is good!

 This was the same man who came within a hair's breadth of losing an
election in
November, who withstood the political chicanery of the Florida Democratic
machine to fix the vote count.
 This was the same man who admitted to having a drinking problem in younger
years, and whose happy-go-lucky lifestyle led him to mediocre grades in
college
and an ill-fated oil venture.
 This was the same man who mangled syntax even more than his father, and
whose
speaking missteps became known as "Bushisms." And on Friday, this was the
man
who bore the weight of the world and the responsibilities of a generation
with
dignity, class, confidence, appropriate solemnity,
 and even much-needed wit.
 One thing struck me during the campaign, that difficult,
 roller-coaster campaign that now seems years ago. It was that George W.
Bush
never seemed to get ruffled. Whether the theft of a campaign debate video or
the
sudden (some would say, vicious) release of a DUI arrest two decades ago at
 a key moment, "W" did not lose his cool. At times, his staff seemed
overconfident, as did many of us. A 350-electoral-vote win, they quietly
implied
and we optimistically believed. Then they counted the votes, miscounted
others,
and re-counted still others. At the end, he was still there.
 Whereas Al Gore almost frantically huffed and puffed, trying to gin up
something out of nothing, Bush quietly but confidently waited at his ranch.
He
did nothing:  that is the mistake people have constantly made with this man,
confusing lack of bluster for absence of action. No, his team of attorneys
and
the iron-willed James Baker were carrying out his orders, but W
 stayed in the background, confident and faithful.
 You see, it is this faith business that confounded everyone. We  have had
such
actors and liars in public office that we have looked skeptically whenever
anyone used the term faith.
 But this was the same man who was the first politician ever in
 recent memory to name Jesus Christ as the lord of his life on public TV.
 Not an oblique reference to being "born-again" or having a "life change."
 He said the un-PC-like phrase, "Jesus Christ," to which his handlers and
advisors, no doubt, off stage, were also saying, "Jesus Christ" in a much
different tone.
 God has a way of honoring those who honor him. David learned  that while he
was
on the run from Saul's armies. Job learned that after his time of horrible
tribulation. The Messiah said so Himself, many times. So this was the man
who
actually put faith into practice. He actually loves those who hate him. It
is a
staggering concept, so foreign in daily occurrence
 that few thought it anything but grandstanding. Even one of W's biggest
supporters chided the president for adhering to his "new tone."
 Yet there he was, again and again, thanking the Democrats.
 Appointing his enemies to high places in his government. Inviting his
former
foes and their wives to private movie screenings, and (I know, this is  hard
to
stomach) even treating them with dignity. See, this was the man who
 learned early on how faith worked: by praying for his enemies, you "heap
burning coals upon their heads." Happen to catch

Bill Clinton at the National Prayer Service?  Didn't look too good, did he?

 This was the man who named the absolute top people in national  security
and
defense, then caught barbs from the politically righteous  that this one
didn't
have the right views on abortion or that one didn't  have the right position
on
guns.
 And on September 11, at midmorning, this was the man thrust into a position
only known by Roosevelt, Churchill, Lincoln, and
 Washington. The weight of the world was on his shoulders, and the
responsibility of a generation was on his soul.
 So this same man---the one that the media repeatedly attempted to tarnish
with
charges of "illegitimacy," and the one whose political opponents desperately
sought to stonewall until mid-term elections--- walked to his seat at the
front
of the National Cathedral just three days after the two most impressive
symbols
of American capitalism and
 prosperity virtually evaporated, along with, perhaps, thousands of
Americans.
 As he sat down next to his wife, immediately I knew that even if  his faith
ever faltered, hers didn't. I have never seen a more
 peaceful  face than Laura Bush, whose eyes seemed as though they were
already
gazing at the final outcome . . . not just of this conflict, but of  her
reward
in
 Heaven itself. In this marriage, you indeed got two for the price of  one.
 The appropriate songs were sung, as one said, to in an almost
 unbearably emotional service. I, for one, broke down innumerable  times
merely  listening on tape delay on the radio. How the man spoke without
blubbering,
I'll never know.
 Then came the defining moment of our generation. Some people  fondly recall
their Woodstock days. Others mark with grim sadness  November 22, 1963, as
the
day America lost her innocence. But I firmly believe when the history of
this
time is written, it will be acknowledged by  friend  and foe alike that
President George W. Bush came of age in that  cathedral
 and lifted a nation off its knees. It wasn't so much his words,
 though read a  decade later, they will indeed be as stirring as any. The
conflict  would  end, he noted, "at a time of our choosing." It certainly
wasn't
his emotion.
 What had to have been one of the most stunning exhibitions of  self-control
in
presidential history, W was able to deliver his
 remarks without  losing either his resolve or his focus, or, more
important,
his  confidence.
 It was as if God's hand, which had guided him through that
 sliver-thin  election, now rested fully on him. His quiet confidence let
our
enemies know . . . and believe me, they know . . . that they made a grave
miscalculation.
  Now, this same man who practiced his faith through a tough
 election, who steeled his convictions even more in a drawn-out  Florida
battle,
and  who never once gave in to the temptation to get in the gutter with  his
foes (well, OK, maybe the "Clymer" comment is an exception), this  same
 man now lifted the weight of the world and the responsibility of a
generation
and put it on his modest shoulders as though it were  another unpleasant
duty.
 As he walked back to his seat, the camera angle was appropriate.
 He was virtually alone in the scene, alone in that massive place of  God,
just
him and the Lord. But that's the way it's always been in his  life
recently. In
that brief time it took him to return to his seat, I  believe he  heard
words to
the effect of, "You can do this, George. I am with  you always.
 And you can do this well, because I am going before you. And don't  worry
about the weight. I've got it." And I saw in his eyes a quiet
acknowledgment.
 "I know.  Thank you, Lord."
  Back at his seat, when W sat down, George H. W. Bush reached  over and
took
his son's hand. The elder Bush always struck me as a  religious  man, but
not
someone who shared his life on a daily basis with the  Lord.
 George H. W.  treats the Father like a respected uncle, visiting him  on
appropriate holidays and knowing the relationship is real, but not
constant.
 Anyway, I believe that in that fatherly squeeze George H. W. said,  "I wish
I
could do this for you, son, but I can't. You have to do this on your  own."
W
squeezed  back and gave him that look of peace that Laura had kept
throughout.
 It said, "I don't have to do it alone, dad. I've got help."

 

Plus we are going to go over your Canadian Fundamentals packet.  Here is your timely notice.

Thanks,

It looks great.  I am gald you and Yan were able to get everything working.  I need to get with him on some Rockies maps now that he has this one done.  Again, great job.

Jay

The eagle has landed.

Monique, I have moved the map under Desks->West Desk-> West Map. Please check it out, let me know if there is anything else. Yan

Yan,

Will you please release the map out of testing into the main west ops area.  I have checked the data on a test basis and everything appears to be working properly.

Thanks
Monique

I know how much i love you and how much i missed you and how much i want to be with you.  I am keeping my promise to you where Jennifer is concerned...but I want Denver to be whatever it turns out to be.  I don't want any plans or to hype it up or to try to cut it down.  I want it to naturally flow between two people that love each other and can be together.

I Love You 

I need to take a few hours off Tuesday afternoon after lunch.  I have some family business to attend to.  I should only be gone 2 hours or so.  Susan will be here to handle EOL.  Let me know if you have a problem with this.  I know I need to be here, but this is something I have to take care of and this was the only time I could schedule it.

Thanks,

Jay

Anything new on the reservations?

You have a appt at 12:00

I know you have been very busy so I wanted to send you a reminder about the reimbursement for me that we were dealing with before the move, and also the itinerary for my trip in mid-December.

Thanks and hope you are having a good day,

Jay

ok

You got paid for your airline tickets, but not the $100.oo change fee.

I fixed the deals.  I was waiting for a new pricing index to be set up in Sitara.  That is done now.

Jay,
	I am with the gas confirms group, and I need to verify the location and price for these two Oneok deals.

Thank you,

I agree that we should not move the business at this time, but we do need cross-training to occur.  Eventually the business should come here to Houston.  The decision was made to bring the physical trading business to the Houston office and I do not believe that that task has been completed.  My feelings are for continuity that all operations involving trading and scheduling of physical gas should move here under your firm control and direction.  I also think that some of our counterparties are confused as to who to call concerning these types of deals and that trading decisions are being made in Denver without our knowledge until after the fact.  This is something that I have heard from you and Barry that should not be happening.

I would still like to go to Denver for the cross-training to occur and we can determine the eventual placement of these operations after things calm down.

Jay

In light of the current circumstances with the company and the concerns that our counterparties have at this time, I would like to leave the upstream business in Denver.  Moving this business would lead to confusion with our customers and to our Denver based employees.  Let me know if you have any issues with this.

If you would like to go up there for coordination and training, then feel free to travel to Denver.

Thanks,

He works or worked here and he wanted my email address at home.  I think we should kill the deal on the firelogs.  Just too much unknown right now.  Tell her the truth about Enron and my employment situation and find out what we need to do to stop the deal (in writing and by when?)

I need to call that lady back, what should I say?  Do you know who Colin

The cashout deals are as follows:

I can get to the CIG web homepage but I cannot get into Cutomer Activites, Citrix, or Informational Postings.  It is critical for nominations and information purposes that I can get into these areas this morning.  Please advise as to how to access these portions of the website.  It seems like there are changes in the URL address and maybe that is the problem.

Thank you,

Have a good safe trip going to Conroe.  We are still planning on next Friday but don't know what time yet.  Y'all be careful.
 
Love,
 
Jay

Hi, Just to let you know we are planning to go to Conroe on Sunday for a few hours visit and then immediately return home. That seems the best day to take them to lunch and get back by dark. We are also feeding the neighbors dogs  etc. while they are gone so we need to get back. Hope Lauren is feeling better and everyone else is OK. Got my fingers crossed that the weather holds thru the first of the year and that no one is sick. Love, Mom 

11:00pm CDT...

Nymex = 2.80 = sprayed
Kern/Opal BOM = 2.42 = sprayed

Basis = tighter = sprayed

ENE = 20.9 = sprayed

Have a nice day.

I will try to be there.

Jay

The meeting with IHS Energy representatives will take place tomorrow from 10:30 to 1:30 in EB3321
It will probably take a while to set up the equipment, I would think the actual presentation will start about 11:30.
Please let me know if you will be able to attend.

That looks pretty good.  It looks like there are a few outliers on the graphs, but overall it looks really good.  Go ahead and do whatever else you think you should do.  This load should be very temperature sensitive and there should be no linepack or anything else in this load information.

Hi Jay,

I just ran regression on HDD and CDD and it shows me 92% correlation. I just wanted to check with you first before I do any more sophisticated stuff.
Let me know what you think about the regression.

 << File: citizens load-jay.xls >> 

That looks good Torrey.  When will it be placed in production?

Thanks,

Jay

fyi...
Hello Torrey,
	I examined past CIG deals and made code changes to allow default meter 991764500 when Enron sells physical gas.  Assuming deals continue to be sent as before, I have results of sample deals production which I tested with; see below.  Please test the changes at your earliest convenient.  Thanks.

file://o:/_dropbox/sitara/CIG_buy_sell.doc

Dat Truong x 63015

Hi Dat,

As per Jay's request, is it possible to set the SITARA bridge to attach the following two default meter numbers to CIG Mainline deals, depending on whether they are buys or sales (from Enron's perspective)?

Essentially, any deal in which Enron is the seller and the location is at Pipe "CIG" and trade zone "CENTRAL" should have a default meter number of 991764500, while any deal in which Enron is the buyer at the same location should go to meter number UNA-516938.

Since the EOL mapping tables can only support one meter number per location, it would be necessary to set this logic up in the SITARA bridge itself. Is this doable from your end?

Torrey

I would like to have all sales of CIG Mainline next day physical gas to bridge over to Sitara under the following meter location:

CIG/Mainline/991764500

and all buys to 

CIG/Mainline/UNA-516938

Please let me know what effects (if any) this will have on the bridging process, Sitara, and confirmations.

Thank you,

Jay Reitmeyer

great job...i am impressed.

I got everything hooked up , I guess.  You need to straighten out the cords
this weekend.

I would guess that Paul will lose his job within the next few weeks...but that should not leave the walls of your house.  I think I am ok if I want to stay.  It is really a scary situation and this is what I get for corporate lifestyle I guess.  We probably won't know the full effects for several more months, but I think that a lot of people will get laid off before Christmas.

Gald to hear that Mom and Dad made it ok.  Hope y'all are having fun together.  

How are you feeling?  I have not talked to you since your wonderful phone call.  I heard you were going through some pretty bad morning sickness but that things were better now.  I am praying that from here on out you have a safe and healthy pregnancy.  Really try to enjoy it.  Let me know how you are doing and what you need or need for the baby.  However, I am not available to go pick up ice cream and a pickle at 2am, that is W.R.'s job.  I have already done that.

Take care and I will try to keep you posted.

Love,
Jay

Jay,

Just a quick note to let you know that Mom and Dad arrived around 10am on
Sunday morning.  I took the day off yesterday and we did a few things around
the house and a little shopping.  Uncle Bob arrived around 11:00am from
Phoenix and we went to lunch.  He was back on the road for Houston around
1:00pm.  There is a new subdivision going up down the street from us so we
walked down there yesterday afternoon and wandered through some of the
houses.  Dad seemed to enjoy it -- walking off the sq footage, inspecting
the construction, etc.

WR and I have been really watching the situation with Enron and have our
fingers crossed that things will work out for you now that the deal with
Dynergy has been announced.  Uncle Bob seemed to think that Paul is in a
pretty precarious situation with his job.

Take care and tell the girls 'Aunt Lyn says hi.'

Lyn

Carole told me yesterday afternoon that you left.  I saw you right after lunch with a couple other people looking for a conference room.  I guess I know now what that was about.  That news shocked me because I didn't see it coming, but at the same time I am not surprised that you left.  With all the uncertainty surrounding this company now plus I know that you had had enough of risk that it doesn't surprise me.
 
Good luck with the new job and let me know what exactly you will be doing at the new company.
 
Jay

Hey Jay,
 
Just wanted to let you know that I resigned from Enron yesterday and took my job back at Wilkens Weather.   No, just kidding -with Energy USA over in the Galleria area.  They are a smaller, less sexier and more conservative company than Enron but then we all know what can happen to a "sexy" company. 
 
Anyway, I wish the best of luck to you in your future endeavors.  Keep in touch -you can use this address for now until I know my new address at work.  You never know if one may have to return a favor sometime in the future.  
 
See ya,
 
JR

You can get them whatever you want, but think back to when we were kids and how much you hated "big kid" gifts.  Meg does that enough.  In my opinion they are kids and the one thing they really want are toys and games...fun things.  It is no fun going to Grandma's house for Christmas and get nothing but clothes.  You want to get some toys to play with and have fun with.  That is just my opinion, but you should get what you want for them.

Love,
Jay

Jay,

Thanks for getting back to me.  I know that you are really busy and may not
have time to answer this but, any ideas on Christmas gifts for the girls?
Since we are driving to Indiana before going to Tyler and the car will be
pretty full, I would like to buy the gifts for the girls now and send them
back with Mom and Dad.  If clothing is a good option -- what sizes?  Also,
does Reagan wear any jewelry and if so, does she have a little jewelry box
or anything like that.  I thought about buying something that could be for a
'big girl' instead of toys.  However, I am open to any and all ideas -- I
want to get them something they will enjoy.  If you don't have time to
respond, please forward this to Jennifer.

As for my situation, my morning sickness seems to be getting a little
better.  I still have slight nausea in the morning but haven't lost my
breakfast since a week ago Monday.  I hope that this means I have turned
some sort of corner because it was really hard being sick every other
morning and fighting intense nausea every day.  Also, in the last week I
have really started to pop out -- it looks and feels bizarre.

Take care,
Lyn

sure....005 lower than our last bid

Good question.  I would like the 2 games but this is not about me.  Jr. Monopoly may be a little too much for her still.  She would probably enjoy the Dr. Barbie or the computer game the most.  But she will want to play the game on the computer right then so Mom better be prepared for that.

Hope y'all are having fun.

Love,

Jay

Mom asked that I send you the following questions:

Does Reagan have (or would like) any of the following:

	Jr. Monopoly
	Jr. Clue
	Cinderella's Doll House (Computer Game)
	A 'Dr.' Barbie doll

The mall is really close by so Mom and Dad are spending time shopping for
Christmas.  They bought a couple of things for the girls yesterday, but had
a question on the items listed above.

there was no link

Thought you might want to learn more about harry

Was this a 1-time thing or is it happening often?

Jay

Should we call PG&E, or do you want someone on your desk to make the call?

Chris

Aaron,

Since late last week PG&E web site started to posted with non data for some of the points.  Our solution currently is refering to previous day's data on the same point and using same values for days overlap and giving same value for new day.  Example:  on 11/01/01's captured file on California Production Injection poin twe have --

			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	      172

and on 11/02/01's captured file on California Production Injection point we have --

			11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01	11/08/01
California Pro Injection	     

when this happens, out transform code will fail and also potentially cause future loading jobs to fail because some future data is based on past data so we have to manually edited the file as follwing --

			11/03/01	11/04/01	11/05/01	11/06/01	11/07/01
California Pro Injection	     172		      172		       172	       172   	      172

Until web site data is back to normal or we find better solution, this will be the solution we implement for now.  Please let me or Chris Hyde know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

coffee or lunch this week works great for me - where are you working downtown?

You should be getting a call from Shaw Cable, today or tomorrow to arrange a
time with you to install the cable modem.
 FYI, I bought a used computer at Computer Outlet, and two months free
internet and installation came with the package.

Let me know if  you don't hear from shaw in the next day or so. Looks like
I'm going to be working downtown starting sometime this week, we should try
to get out for a coffee or bit to eat again.

Cheers, Greg

You don't have to apologize, I'm a pretty curious person myself.

I work from 8 to 5 and walk to work.  It takes me about 20 minutes.  I live

i tried to call your phone number, but just got voicemail.  here are my numbers:  (w) 403 974 6946 (h) 403 262 0205 (c) 403 512 3312 - it would be good to chat, but i'll respond here in case you get this and not your voicemail.  also, a better email is "trycooper@hotmail.com" i've been meaning to write you (it's on my list) but haven't probly because i'm not sure what to say ... i'm glad you got in touch.  i hope you had fun in belize with your family.  i checked and i don't have brinda's email - sorry about that.  i might have her phone number athome, but that won't do you much good i don't think.  also if you are checking out SFSU, you may want to look up someone named Ingrid Binswanger - i went to college with her and she is ultra-cool and might be able to give you the lowdown.  i think she is doing some sort of joint degree and is probly still there - not sure though.  

um, yeah, i was a bit surprised when you mentioned the 8 year statistic! but i'm not sure what relevance that really has.  it's too bad things are rocky between you and steve, it seems like you've been together forever.  it was a crazy night and i don't know what else to say, hopefully we will stay in touch better as a result?  it's funny to think that i've known you half of my life at this point.  of course, however you want to handle it is fine by me.  well, if you get this while you are in portland or sf, give me a buzz and i'll tell you what i can, otherwise, call or write and let's stay in touch.  good luck shopping for programs.

Hey Cooper,
  Well, I don't know if you remember, but I'm heading out to Portland for an interview.  Prob little to no chance I'll end up there, but what the hell, I've never been and it can't hurt to visit.  I remember you saying that you knew Brinda's email.  Do you think you could send it to me?  I'll be there the 14th.

Otherwise, don't really know what to say.  I'm pretty much still reeling from what happened.  I meant it when I said that nothing like this has happened in the last 8 years.  Unfortunately, my future with Steve is looking a little rocky right now, but I still don't know what my motivation was (drunkenness never an excuse...) and I've been pretty upset.  I haven't seen Steve yet, and to be honest I don't think now is the time to bring this sort of thing up to him.  I decide where I will move in feb, and I think it's best if steve and I go our own ways amicably, without this mess (yes, feeble excuse).

Anyway, don't mean to bring up all this crap, b/c it's not yours, but we've been friends for a long time and I respect you and like you, and I really don't want you to think that this is a frequent occurence.  I do wish I was a little more sober, not b/c it would've changed much, but I think it might've been better all around.

So, any advice on Portland or SF would be appreciated (one night in each).  Call 646 342 3507 or email.

Later,
Mara

hi mom,  yup 16.5 x 33 is my size.  thanks!  love, coop

Coop:  I'm going to exchange the shirt today.  I think it should be a 16

send it to you.  Please advise today.  Luv, Mom

I put in a call to the deloitte systems admin to have your email name changed to "Purtzki, Eze".  I hope you don't mind.  

I'm tired from moving.  Enron's moved me in the past and I'm used to just pointing and saying "that will go over there", etc.  and i spent all sunday night packing up my shit.  ugh.  most of it has been moved which is good.  i don't think you've ever seen my loft, but to get to it, you have to take the elevator up one building and then walk across the roof of another building (picture gravel with flagstones that are spaced for janice to walk across) and then into the floor of my building.  once the movers saw this, I think they almost quit!  it was bad, but they did a great job.  I told one of them, "the building i'm moving into will be a breeze compared to this one" and he laughed and said "of course, you have the worst apartment i've ever moved".  poor guy.  that's the most entertaining tidbit i could come up with.  

you should meet the building manager in our new building.  he's a freak, but in a professional way.  he's already yelled at jai and i.  he sounds russian and says in a thick accent "if you vant to leeve here, you haf to obey da rrrulesss".  i hope you read that with a russian accent in your head.  he has video cameras set up that feed into his kitchen!  his wife is a piece of work as well.  

count me in for the wine fest.  if you pick up some tix, grab me one, or let me know where the website is, etc.    

i can't believe you've moved on from tubulars.  while tubulars does seem like the next big thing, oil and gas seems like a promising area to study.

hi emily,

i left fairly quickly on friday night - sorry i didn't say goodbye - i was in a strange mood, maybe being sick and drunk?  anyway, i feel like i should have socialized more there and regret not talking to janice more, but it was great to see earls people outside of earls amongst friends.  

why don't we go to YIM instead of the Space?  i'm happy to go to yoga with other people instead of alone and i can go to any yoga class and enjoy myself, although rockne gets on my nerves if i let him.  i think janice wants to come too?  

congratulations on passing all of your courses.  i found graduating to be somewhat anti-climactic - i wish you had a ceremony to go to, but maybe things are different in canada.  

i finished reading tuesdays with morrie - great book - it's good to be reminded of certain things in life.  

i did get your call last night but deleted your home number.  i called your cell, but no one answered and there was no voice mail for some reason.  can you send on your home number?   

	- c - 

fine with me.

I was thinking about the $100 dollars.  I feel like it's more my
responsibility than yours.  Instead of splitting the money between us.  Why
don't we just wave the $25 dollars I was supposed to owe you - What do you
think?

oops, i just sent you a note w/o reading this one.  i might stop by ceilis for a bit.  

Finally...it's Friday! 
This week has flown by..the first week at work and I'm still here! (that's an accomplishment in itself) 
I just wanted to remind you that we (Jaimie and I and a few others) will be going to Ceilis around 5pm for a drink.  I was thinking about going to Janice's get together at the Auburn around 9 or 10.  I want to go home and chill out and change before I go to Yanny's...but I guess it depends on what happens at ceilis!
I hope work is going well and that your feeling better!

that motherboard does look sweet!  why the scsi drives though?  personally, i want to find a RAID card that can handle RAID5 (everything i've seen is 0,1,or 0+1) and then link up a bunch of smallish IDE drives - if the controller is good, you don't need super fast and expensive drives, so you get speed and redundancy.  as i look at hardware, i can't believe how much enron was paying compaq for hardware - it's amazing.  as for parts, what do you think about ordering from the cheapest U.S. source and paying duty?   

coffee or lunch would be great.  supposed to be big news about the enron auction today, but things are very slow and i'm more or less available any time - whenever you're next in town, give me a buzz, or if you're looking for a reason to come into town, how about tuesday or wednesday -- lunch or an afternoon coffee?

 We have delayed our trip to France, AGAIN! Janet threatened to divorce me if we don't go on a holiday soon, but she never follows through with her threats. Promises, promises.

Hardware... I'm in the process of building the ultimate server, myself. Check out the new Tyan S2466 motherboard. Sweeeet!. This with, a couple of AMD MP 1900+ processors and SCSI 15000 RPM U160 drives, this should be the ultimate. Hooked on the other end of the pipe to one of the servers at enron, it should push back so hard that those old Compaqs sream for mercy.

I'm shopping for hardware all over, really just out of the Computer Paper and by dropping into a couple of computer stores here and there. Memory Express, OA Group all have good prices, but I can probably get even better prices from a small computer shop out here in Cochrane. He'll order it in for me and I can negotiate with him.

How was everything back East. Hope you had a good time and got all caught on rest, relaxation and visiting.

I'm getting bushed sitting at home learning all the .net crap and am always anxious to get out for coffee or lunch. Let me know if we can catch a coffee sometime.

yah, let's get it out of the way.

Just talked to Rene.  He says he'll be home all night and that we can come
by any time after my hockey.  He says it might take a half hour or so
because he has to fill out stuff on the papers.  Should we go right after
hockey?

i'm glad you made it to yoga last night.  how did you think the space compares to YIM?  don't worry, you won't hurt my feelings...  they're very different and i'm always surprised when people prefer something like YIM, but yoga tastes vary widely.  i thought last night's class was excellent and i'm glad we all got to go.  i'm not sure why jai goes to yoga - i've been to a few classes with him and it's always the same deep frustration with poses, but ...  

yah, the jump thru to seated is fun, eh?  last night i was playing around with it following her directions and i realized how terrible it is to not be able to jump thru smoothly.  once you do it once you can do it forever.  also fun is to do the reverse - i think the mechanics are easier on the reverse and then you'll be able to do full vinyasa smoothly.

ian's email is indeed ian.cooke@enron.com

ceilis could be fun tomorrow.  let me know when you go.  this week has gone by quickly.  i can understand how you didn't see the scooby stickers on my car because it was dark, but what about the one on my forehead last night?

hey greg, 

happy new year.  i can't remember when you were taking your trip to france, but i hope things are going well.  i'm back in town now after a long and peaceful break - mainly just waiting to see what happens to the enron trading operations.  

where did you buy the hardware when you built your servers?  i'm thinking of building a database server and am not sure if its best to mail order or buy in person somewhere in town.  

hope you're well and talk to you soon,
cooper

hey craig,

happy new year.  thanks for forwarding me this - i'm investigating all career opportunities at the moment.  i hope you've been out skiing the last few days, it looks like its been puking.  i've been sick the last few days :(  first time in a year or so.  had a great break and i'm back taking care of all the little things waiting to see what happens to the enron trading operation.  we'll see ... 

hey, do you want to go to stronghold sometime?  be good to catch up.  i don't think i'm going to be healthy this week, but if you're interested next week would work.  i don't know how much time you're spending in calgary these days.

i'm at the place trying to arrange the cable modem install and forgot your address on a pad at my last appointment. can you send it to me again in the next 5 min (i hope).

Cheers GB

Hey Ethan,

I appreciate the look on this and am interested.  i'm investigating all alternatives and have been considering mainly calgary and portland as options.  it looks like there will be more clarity on the future of enron's trading operation soon, which should help solidify any job decisions.  my latest resume is at home and i will forward it on tomorrow and you can see what the fit is like.    

thanks for thinking of me and good luck with the business.

what up... let me know when you are getting into town so we can hook up. by the way, would your parents be interested in dropping by for a drink on Friday evening?  mike's parents and my parents are going to be coming by a little earlier, then we're going to kick them out and and get wasted - just kidding.  anyway, it looks like mara, quang, tasha, jeff, etc. are all coming over, should be pretty fun.  see ya

yah, i'm looking forward to yoga.  i didn't do anything over break and was really looking forward to starting up my practice again and went several times as soon as i got back, but then i got sick, so ... i may try to take a nap this afternoon before yoga.  i'm very bad with directions.  i have the address at home and can call you with it, but basically, i go east on 12th Ave, turn right on (i think) 8th Street and then turn left on (i think) 24th Ave (there's an asian restaurant at this corner) and then it's up on the right side.  there's a big block of warehouse buildings.  it's a little complicated to find from here actually, maybe you should pick me up and we can go together?  

i don't really shop for "yoga clothes" partly out of some sort of philosophical resistance and also because the women's stuff is so much cooler than men's stuff that i don't want to bother.  

dude, that 6:00am yoga story is brutal!  YIM is going downhill - i don't think rockne can hold onto his good instrucors.  i hope core yoga stays solvent!  

Hey Cooper, 
So are you getting ready for yoga tonight??  I'm really looking foward to it.  I haven't gone in over a week and I am having serious yoga withdrawl.  Did I tell you that I went, or I attempted to go,to a 6am yoga class at yoga in motion yesterday??  I psyched myself up to get up at 5:30am to go (which is extremly early when you start work at 8:30!) and the instructor never showed up.  So we all sat outside waiting. We all finally left and went home. So I got nothing accomplished.  I was tired,  but couldn't go back to sleep, and I didn't feel relaxed, as I usually do after a yoga practice.
Can you tell me where the Space is again???  I am meeting Jaimie after work at 5:30.  She has her car here,  so if you need a ride let me know.  I have to warn you...Jaimie is a brutal driver.  It's almost funny!
Not much luck finding yoga attire.  I have been to lululemon in Vancouver.  It's a super cool store.  Have you bought anything from there?  I regret that I didn't.....but now that I have internet access at work the possibilities are endless (not to mention, expensive!)
Enjoy the rest of your day! 

the first - just wanted to go thru whatever i was thinking last night.  it's no big deal.  

i think he would be the jackass we hate at earls.  but, i'm approaching him with the new jordey-inspired don't worry be happy mentality and its working great!  

i feel like i didn't get closure last night after seeing the place.  maybe that nook in the main room could be for a computer?  

have you told nicole about going to yoga tonight?

keep in mind that whatever you tell her seems to go straight to dorland and then i have to deal with it.  now he wants to pull an earls at joey's here downtown.  

i'm worried the place is too small.  

I'm going to call Rene this morning.  Let me know what you think I should
say to him about the walls (ie. painting)

although i like my yoga naked, i do like to put something on for savasana (corpse pose at the end), which is probly what she's thinking.  the latest in canadian yoga fashion can be found at www.lululemon.com 

give me a look on the movie if you end up going and want to see royal t's.  cell is 512 3312.  

After spending that long opening a bank account,  I would have settled for stashing my money under my matress.  My brother did that for a while.  Ya,  he's different,  but cool. 
I keep forgetting your American.  Your not a shitty american,  as long as you don't believe we live in igloos,  your fine.
Did Jai forward you Ingrid's e-mail from this morning about her "awful news?"  It's funny.  
Jaimie wanted to go see a movie tonight.  We were thinking maybe royal tannebaums.  I'm going to call her after my run because it's still up in the air.  She wants to go find some yoga pants...what part of "naked yoga" didn't she understand???!!!!  If we end up going to a movie we'll call you guys or maybe you want to come shopping with us???  Isn't that every guy's dream come true?

agh.  i just spent 2.5 hours opening a bank account!  banking in this country sucks.  i hate to be a shitty american and i do love canada, but the banking system is brutal.  yeah, working for a law firm is sweet, i see the same perks here working for a management consulting firm.  i'm glad you briefed the ladies on the naked yoga, maybe janice could give us a demo.  are you watching the royal tennenbaums tonight?  we talked about it long ago... and i do want to see it.  

glad to see you are breaking in your email account.  -c

Meeting at they Y sounds like a good idea. I did not know that you played
squash we should go sometime.  I love to play do not really know the rules
but I really like to play anyways and would love to learn how to properly
play.  Do you want to get together next weekend for a game as well?

i am playing squash at the Y at 2:30 on sunday, so maybe we could meet
after i play and before you play?  i would prefer that to meeting up with
you and a friend.  maybe grab some coffee?

i am part of the trading operations, so i would get sold with it and then i
would have to decide if i want to be part of whatever the new organization
ends up being.

   Okay sorry yes I guess my schedule is really full but I love it and am
   living the way I have wanted to for a long time.  How about Sunday we
   could
   get together in the afternoon or evening I am playing squash at the Y
   around
   4 I believe and am going to meet a friend of my at the Red Devil did you
   want to join us or maybe get together before that?  Possibly if that
   does
   not work for you then I believe next Sat or Sunday could be good as
   well.
   Are you still doing Yoga?  I have yet to give it a try I am working so
   much.
   I am going to the gym daily  though and am very happy with that.  Well
   write
   me soon and let me know what is happening with you.
   If Enron sells the trading operations what will you do then?

   well, i am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  there is
   not
   much to do and basically we are waiting around to see what happens to
   the
   trading operations, which are supposed to be sold to an investment bank
   in
   a week or so.  we'll see ...  at first it was refreshing to not have
   anything to do and a welcome relief from the frenetic atmosphere i'm
   used
   to here, but now it's a challenge to find productive ways to fill the
   time
   and i don't work very long days.

   i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of
   loving
   being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and
   needing
   to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving
   hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did
   very
   little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been
   away
   from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good
   to
   be back, too.

   your schedule sounds very packed - maybe you would like to suggest a
   time/place that fits in?  it's been forever since i've seen you and i
   would
   be up for anything:  coffee, lunch, dinner, drinks, basically anything.

   take care,

i only just started playing squash; are you a member at the Y?  do you want to meet around 3:30 or so?  

Meeting at they Y sounds like a good idea. I did not know that you played
squash we should go sometime.  I love to play do not really know the rules
but I really like to play anyways and would love to learn how to properly
play.  Do you want to get together next weekend for a game as well?

i am playing squash at the Y at 2:30 on sunday, so maybe we could meet
after i play and before you play?  i would prefer that to meeting up with
you and a friend.  maybe grab some coffee?

i am part of the trading operations, so i would get sold with it and then i
would have to decide if i want to be part of whatever the new organization
ends up being.

   Okay sorry yes I guess my schedule is really full but I love it and am
   living the way I have wanted to for a long time.  How about Sunday we
   could
   get together in the afternoon or evening I am playing squash at the Y
   around
   4 I believe and am going to meet a friend of my at the Red Devil did you
   want to join us or maybe get together before that?  Possibly if that
   does
   not work for you then I believe next Sat or Sunday could be good as
   well.
   Are you still doing Yoga?  I have yet to give it a try I am working so
   much.
   I am going to the gym daily  though and am very happy with that.  Well
   write
   me soon and let me know what is happening with you.
   If Enron sells the trading operations what will you do then?

   well, i am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that.  there is
   not
   much to do and basically we are waiting around to see what happens to
   the
   trading operations, which are supposed to be sold to an investment bank
   in
   a week or so.  we'll see ...  at first it was refreshing to not have
   anything to do and a welcome relief from the frenetic atmosphere i'm
   used
   to here, but now it's a challenge to find productive ways to fill the
   time
   and i don't work very long days.

   i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of
   loving
   being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and
   needing
   to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving
   hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did
   very
   little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been
   away
   from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  it feels good
   to
   be back, too.

   your schedule sounds very packed - maybe you would like to suggest a
   time/place that fits in?  it's been forever since i've seen you and i
   would
   be up for anything:  coffee, lunch, dinner, drinks, basically anything.

   take care,
   cooper

      Well I am in but not in.  I am going to Kelowna tonight and tomorrow
   but
      will be in town Sunday to Tuesday but I will be out again till
   Friday.
      I
      know I am in next weekend.  From there on I am not too sure what is
      happening but let me know if any of that works for you.
      How was your holidays.  How are things at work or are you working
   right
      now
      I heard a lot of people go laid off and others are still not steady.
   I
      see
      your address is still Enron.  Well let me know.

we should get on it ASAP!

do you want to set aside some time this w/e to look at places, or should we
wait until next week?  it may be a little late to schedule things.  altho,
we should definitely check out that place in kensington.

Greg,

do you know the status of VPN connectivity going forward for UBS employees?  

thx,
cooper

dear elissa-

it's great to hear from you and i'm pleased you thought of my on your christmas list.  it seems like we started to get in touch awhile ago and then i think i dropped the ball.  oops.  i hope you are well and happy new year to you too.  i am still working for Enron, a company you have perhaps read about in the news recently.  things are ok with that for the moment, but i don't really know what's in my future.  probly know more soon.  i live in calgary (did you know?) and have for the last year or so.  i like canada very much.  much more than i expected, although it is very cold here.  mostly the people i like, especially but not limited to all the comely young women.  

are you still in NC?  are you going to make Ben a respectable man anytime soon?  

i got back from almost three weeks vacation yesterday and am back at work, although i hesitate to call it that, since i do very little all day.  i had a good time back home, went thru my normal roller coaster of loving being back with my family, then feeling like i am going crazy and needing to leave the house for extended periods of time and then back to loving hanging out there.  caught up with lots of friends and in general did very little for 2 weeks, which felt ok.  it's been awhile since i've been away from my normal life for that long and it was refreshing.  

i wish you had sent one of those genero-grams in your holiday card so i would know what you're up to.  send a note when you get a chance.  

also, if you can think of it, reply to trycooper@hotmail.com as i'm better at keeping in touch from home.  

one big hug,
cooper

Apparently I'm not the brightest bulb in the
chandelier this morning.

ok. i'll keep it a secret.  i think lemonade will be a dead giveaway when he tastes it though.

Cooper,

ha ha!  Peeing on Jai's toilet seat would be hilarious (gross, but hilarious).  Maybe I will spray some yellow lemonade on the seat just so he THINKS that I peed on it.

It could be Auntie and SDC's private joke!

auntie:

i think it will be easy to get back into the swing of thigns -- sitting on
my ass for two months has been a nice distraction, but its gotten really
boring.  trading is exciting and i'm looking forward to it - should be like
jumping into a cold pool.  i'm actually doing real work lately which is
great.  i still have no idea what you do at work.  anything interesting?

yes, the new babe lair should be sweet - we'll need auntie's
recommendations.  just make sure you shit in jai's toilet.  it might be
harder for you than me, but peeing on the toilet seat is always a good way
to get your message across - as a woman, i think it would send an
especially clear signal.  are you stopping by this weekend?  i'm having a
couch delivered on sat between 10 and 2, so i think we'll be around then
for sure.

5 times a day is no problem, but 5 times a day seven days a week might be a
push, but with the right stimulation anything is possible.  is chrissy a
5x7 kind of chick?  wow.  and, of course, retention is always an
interesting experiment.

we'll have to go to big wally's - especially if its not my style.  i
haven't spent much time in kensington, but it seems like there are some
good spots there.

   Do you think it will be hard to get back into the "swing of things"?
   You know how it is when you return to work after holidays and it takes
   forever for the day to pass or for Friday to arrive?

   I am looking forward to seeing the new babe lair.  I will have to think
   of a very cool housewarming gift.  Oh yeah....you guys didn't buy ME
   anything.  Maybe I will just come by and take a dip in the pool and
   leave a shit in your toilet.

   Yikes!!!  Chrissy would llliiiikkkkeeee you.  Are you "up" to it 5 times
   a day?

   I like Big Wally's in Kensington.  Ever been there?  I'm not sure it's
   your style.  Ugly waitresses and a hundred degree above heat but I like
   it.  Always packed and a interesting variety of music.  I've never been
   to the Auburn Saloon.

   Eagerly awaiting a response.  Write SOON!

   i've been doing nothing for two months (literally) and should be trading
   again in a few weeks, so i've got to start preparing for that, which is
   a
   welcome change.

   what do you mean you're not doing anything this w/e?  i like the bar
   scene
   alot, but i have to be drunk to enjoy it.  i think one night a week its
   good if you have nothing better to do.  i think some of the boys from
   enron
   are going out this sat. if you end up having nothing to do.  we'll be
   moving in this w/e, you should come by and check it out.

   as for chrissy, that was the sound of my cock puncturing the desk and
   knocking my mouse on its side.

   dingy pub would have been good - do you have a favorite?  i like the
   auburn
   saloon, but jai hates it. so ...  it took us *forever* to get out of the
   parking lot.  brutal.

       -----Original Message-----
      SDC,

      I will have a 1/4 pound hamburger (I think) with ketchup, mustard,
      pickles, lettuce, and onions (wanna neck).  No mayo,tomato, or
   cheese.
      I will have fries and a coke with that please!

      This week-end probably not doing too much.  I like to hang out - not
      much for the whole bar scene.  You?

      How will things at work be changing?

      Yep, Chrissy is a very pretty/cute girl.  She's very horny too.
   Oh..was
      that the sound of your cock hitting the underneath of your desk?

      Sorry about Lucky.  The 4 of us should have gone to some dingy little
      pub and drank ourselves silly.  That would have been fun, huh?

      -----Original Message-----
      auntie,

      what are you having at burger inn?

      it has been too long - we'll have to fix it.  what are you doing this
      w/e?

      i feel like i've been sick for two weeks, and i haven't been doing
   much,
      mostly taking care of errands etc since i don't have much to do at
   work
      these days.  hopefully that will be changing soon.

      um, chrissy is much too cute to be playing with her toys alone.

      i'm not sure why lucky sucked - i think it was the crowd we met up
   with
      there.  you two should have come and it would have been more fun i'm
      sure.

         Sunday it is then.  I already know what I'm going to have!

         It was really great to see you on Saturday.  It has been much too
      long.
         What have you been doing with yourself?

         We didn't end up hitting Cowboys.  We were both a little tired and
   a
      lot
         cold.  I went home and watched a little t.v and it's a sure bet
   that
         Chrissy went home and played with her toys!

         Why was Lucky so terrible?

         absolutely.  i can't believe we haven't gone yet!  we should make

         great to see you on sat. night.  lucky was unbelievably lame.

Greg/Dan,

now that things are firming up, can you give me a summary of what is happening to all of the servers purchased for trading decision support (i.e., fundamentals).  the ones i had to get zufferli to sign off on purchasing were power-fs1, nacal-sqws001p, nacal-sqws001d and the 3 pizza boxes.  i know there is some shuffling around now, but i'd like to know what the plan is for these in the short term and long term (either estate/ubs share, estate only, or ubs only). 

thanks,

Cooper:

Did you say shopping?????  My eyes lit up as I read it accross the screen.  (Just kidding).  That sounds great.  I made some progress on the X-mas list on Friday, but still have some to go.  How about a combo - shopping + dinner OR shopping + drinks?  I am working with my research assistant today trying to get my data ready for input.  I forgot to recharge my cell battery - so if I am not home when you call, I will call you back.

very good about leaving work for awhile.  almost like being an

so, i'm flying out on wednesday and wondering if you'd like to get
together before i go?  i'm more or less free from sunday until i go.  
coffee sometime?  dinner?

can you move backups of production AlbertaPower and development AlbertaGas to i:\trading\newco\richey\db\?

thx,

cooper

can you add mark dupuy to the "caldata_pwrfund" NT group.  He needs to take over some of Karim's responsibilities.

thx,
cooper

i think i can get around this, but i need to install some software under local admin.  can you drop by and hook me up when you get a chance?

to obtain access to terminated employees H:\ drive and/or their email, you are to direct them to enter an eRequest. The eRequest is available under the "Access" portion and requires a VP level approval and also IT Security and Controls sign off.

damn!

do you use microsoft outlook?  or some bizarre Corel product?  yes, it would be terrible to allow employees access to a cd-rom drive.  productivity would plummet.  enron let their employees have cd-roms and look what happened to them!    

I don't see them but I don't have Corel installed on my computer.  It would probably work in a company who installs more software in their computers than just bare bones.  They even bought systems without cd-roms to serve a dual purpose:  1) lower costs and 2) minimize those pesky disractions so you can focus all your attention on your work.

If you're part of the CalData_GasFund NT group, you will have full access to Alberta Gas.

As for AlbertaPower, you have full access to the dev database, and the same access as Colin has for the Prod database.

For getting server access on OLAP, you'll have to talk to Greg, I believe.

later than i told you before.  either my booking got screwed up or i never booked the flight!
i think it got lost on the internet some where, but i can't even remember what airline it was
on, so it's impossible for me to check!  just booked a one week flight and i'll be coming 
out on the 19th.  i'm still going to take the days off from work and relax in calgary a little,
which is good.  

by the way, if you haven't already gotten me something, i thought of a xmas present.  
a squash raquet.  lots of people play here and i'm looking to get into it.

sorry for the delay and thanks for thinking of me.  

i missed you at thanksgiving as well!  canadians celbrate thanksgiving
in october!?!, but some friends had me over for "american" thanksgiving,
so i had a good time anyway.  

i'm hoping to catch up with you and kt over the holidays.  i'm planning on
being on the east coast from dec 16 - jan 3, mostly in northern va.  are you
going to be in bethesda at all?  also planning a trip up to NY.  

yes, enron is in a bad way.  i'm doing fine, but it hasn't been a pleasant 
month at work with layoffs and massive uncertainty about future of the
company.  i've resolved to not worry about it until the new year and it seems
to be working!  still planning on staying in calgary but who knows?  

let me know about your holiday plans!  

love,

Hi cooper,

just a quick note, because i don't know if i've
remembered your email address correctly: we were so
sad to not see you at our "regular" thanksgiving time.
:(

i keep seeing horrible things about enron: what is
going on with you? calgary? your job? your future?

we miss you!

Shortfall Procedures (POP 801) in accordance with Transmission Operating
Policy OP-107.  POP 801 contains several steps from the time all the energy
in the energy market merit order has been dispatched up, to the time when a
firm load directive will be issued by the System Controller to curtail firm
load. In order to gather the information required to develop the procedure,
would you please answer the following questions.  Any action you choose to
take is on a voluntary and best effort basis, without any obligation on your
behalf.

In an effort to reduce the amount of, or possibility of having to issue, a
firm load directive to curtail load, would you please reply whether you will
comply with any of the following requests from the System Controller prior
to the issuing of a firm load directive to curtail load.  Please reply not
applicable (N/A) to the questions that do not apply to you.  If you will
comply to any of these requests, we will include the request(s) in the steps
identified in POP 801.  Also, if you will comply to any of these requests,
please indicate the appropriate party for the System Controller to contact.
If you choose not to comply with any of these requests please reply that you
will not.  This will let us know not to make a request for something that
will not be provided, which otherwise could cause confusion and waste
valuable time during the management of this type of an event.

1. Would you provide available generation energy that was not offered into
the energy market merit order if requested to do so by the System Controller
prior to a firm load directive to curtail load?

Name of Plant:				Response (Y/N):
If yes, please indicate who the System Controller is to contact:

try having no work to do for two months and then having to stick around and "appear" busy...  i know what you mean, in some ways its harder when you're not used to not doing things.  i've gotten good at finding things to do with my time, but when i first had nothing to do, i was going crazy.  fridays are always slow around here and i'm guessing its the same there, although i don't know cnrl specifcally, oil and gas producer/marketer?  

in terms of what i do, before enron went under, i was the short term alberta power trader.  since then, i have been champion internet surfer and investigating local coffee shops in an ever-widening circle.  although, things are looking up.  

eze is (i think) an earls nickname -- pronounced easy-e.  although, they may just call her easy for short.  i'm sure she loves both names very much.  

i have a very important meeting at 5 with my massage therapist and i was thinking about stopping by after that.  should i call eze's cell?  or do you have a cell #? 

You know what the worst thing in the world is?  Having no work to do on a Friday but being unable to leave for hours.  I've been here for three months and this is the first day where I haven't been busy.  This is a Type A's worst nightmare.  E-mail is my sole consolation.
So what do I do, you ask?  I'm in Gas Operations, the marketer's right hand man.  I do logistics, volume and supply/demand analysis, nominations, monitoring of accounts, damage control...you know, more or less hold the company together.  What exactly do you do over there?
Everyone always sees Emmy at Banana Republic.  She's a staple there.  Where did you get eze from?  I'm sure she loves it.  She never gets very flattering nick names.
Well, I'm going to take off for lunch.  What time were you thinking of coming down for drinks? 
Talk to you soon 
Jill 
hmm, synapses not jumping - i know the feeling,  i think i have three 
neurons firing in my brain this morning... 

i know what you mean about getting soft - when i went home to virginia for 
christmas, my mom was like "it's cold out, shouldn't you put a jacket on?" 
and having been toughened by the brutal calgary winters (in addition to 
being the super tough guy that i am) i did go out --- naked almost every 
day. 

let me know when you'er heading over to bass brothers and i'll meet up with 
you - i have a few things to do but drinks after work should fit in. 

i ran into eze (aka emily) at banana republic last night - its such a small 
town! 

hey, what do you do at cnrl anyway?

   Good morning Cooper! 
   I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still refusing 
   to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed. 
   No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are in 
   town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've gone 
   soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two 
   colder people in my life. 
   Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work. 
   You'll have to tell him I say hi. 
   I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my 
   part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing most 
   of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers 
   tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming? 
   Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon. 
   Jill 

Hey Tim,

not sure what you guys are up to, likely making yourself pretty for potential investors?  

we're not quite at that point yet here, so things are very slow which has given me some
time to look into R (been on my list for quite some time).  It looks very good!  have you
had a chance to look into it?  i'd like to verify that it's worth putting some time into.  

hope things are going well and i'll give a call to chat sometime soon.  

cooper

                  I have a pair of shoe trees that are slightly too big for

sweet.  glad to hear things are going so well.  

yeah, things are ok here.  it's more boring than anything.  not sure what the
future holds ...

Coop,

I was actually meaning to get in touch to see how things were going for you
after the big fallout. I will be in town at least until the end of the year.
Things are going well. Living good, getting in shape(dropped 50 lbs.), still
at Callisma(shaky), and got a girlfriend(going on 5 months). Looking forward
to seeing you over the holidays.

i'm coming home dec 16 - jan 3.  are you planning on being around?  be
great to catch up on life.

i haven't talked to anyone from hs in the last year or so - feeling lame
and out of touch.  i hear howard is engaged.

things are going well for me, although job situation is somewhat
uncertain
at this point ...  i'm sure you've seen what's going on with enron.

how's callisma and life in general?

not sure - i have to do a walk thru on my old apartment at 3 and probly come back to work after that - what are you thinking?

what time do you work until?

ok.  i don't mind helping out - let me know if you need a hand.  cell is
512 3312.

    -----Original Message-----
   You know what Cooper, don't worry about it.  Chrissy said she can give
   me a boost.  Her booster cables are in her Jeep so it is probably easier
   for her than for you.

   Thanks for the advice though.  I will still buy you BI!

   -----Original Message-----
   I think you are right about the 30 minute rule.  I should have let it
   run longer.

   I'm not parked on a hill.  My jeep is out front of my apt.

   Would you consider giving me a boost?  I would really appreciate it.  So
   much, in fact, that I would buy you Burger Inn next time we went (if we
   ever go)

   -----Original Message-----
   i think you didn't let it run long enough after your boost.  i think 30
   minutes is the rule of thumb when you're battery is drained.  not
   turning
   over at all is not a good sign - one thing you can do is park on a hill
   when you're in doubt and then you can roll-start your jeep (if you have
   a
   standard) if you didn't let it charge long enough - if the battery is
   really, really dead, though, this won't work.  where's your jeep now?

       -----Original Message-----
      I left my headlights on overnight on Sunday.  When I went to start my
      Jeep on Monday, the battery was dead.  I got a boost but only let it
   run
      for about 5 minutes.  I shut it off and then re-started it - I
   thought
      everything was fine.  When I went to start it last night - same
   thing.
      Didn't even turn over.  I don't know if I wrecked my battery or if I
      need a new alternator.  Or maybe I didn't let it run for long enough
      after my boost.

      Jai says you are very mechanically inclined - any advice?

      -----Original Message-----
      i have them back at my old apartment, i think.  is your battery dead?

          -----Original Message-----
         Do you have booster cables?

auntie:

i think it will be easy to get back into the swing of thigns -- sitting on my ass for two months has been a nice distraction, but its gotten really boring.  trading is exciting and i'm looking forward to it - should be like jumping into a cold pool.  i'm actually doing real work lately which is great.  i still have no idea what you do at work.  anything interesting?  

yes, the new babe lair should be sweet - we'll need auntie's recommendations.  just make sure you shit in jai's toilet.  it might be harder for you than me, but peeing on the toilet seat is always a good way to get your message across - as a woman, i think it would send an especially clear signal.  are you stopping by this weekend?  i'm having a couch delivered on sat between 10 and 2, so i think we'll be around then for sure.  

5 times a day is no problem, but 5 times a day seven days a week might be a push, but with the right stimulation anything is possible.  is chrissy a 5x7 kind of chick?  wow.  and, of course, retention is always an interesting experiment.  

we'll have to go to big wally's - especially if its not my style.  i haven't spent much time in kensington, but it seems like there are some good spots there.  

	- c - 

SDC

Do you think it will be hard to get back into the "swing of things"?  You know how it is when you return to work after holidays and it takes forever for the day to pass or for Friday to arrive?

I am looking forward to seeing the new babe lair.  I will have to think of a very cool housewarming gift.  Oh yeah....you guys didn't buy ME anything.  Maybe I will just come by and take a dip in the pool and leave a shit in your toilet.

Yikes!!!  Chrissy would llliiiikkkkeeee you.  Are you "up" to it 5 times a day?

I like Big Wally's in Kensington.  Ever been there?  I'm not sure it's your style.  Ugly waitresses and a hundred degree above heat but I like it.  Always packed and a interesting variety of music.  I've never been to the Auburn Saloon.

Eagerly awaiting a response.  Write SOON!

Auntie

i've been doing nothing for two months (literally) and should be trading
again in a few weeks, so i've got to start preparing for that, which is a
welcome change.

what do you mean you're not doing anything this w/e?  i like the bar scene
alot, but i have to be drunk to enjoy it.  i think one night a week its
good if you have nothing better to do.  i think some of the boys from enron
are going out this sat. if you end up having nothing to do.  we'll be
moving in this w/e, you should come by and check it out.

as for chrissy, that was the sound of my cock puncturing the desk and
knocking my mouse on its side.

dingy pub would have been good - do you have a favorite?  i like the auburn
saloon, but jai hates it. so ...  it took us *forever* to get out of the
parking lot.  brutal.

    -----Original Message-----
   SDC,

   I will have a 1/4 pound hamburger (I think) with ketchup, mustard,
   pickles, lettuce, and onions (wanna neck).  No mayo,tomato, or cheese.
   I will have fries and a coke with that please!

   This week-end probably not doing too much.  I like to hang out - not
   much for the whole bar scene.  You?

   How will things at work be changing?

   Yep, Chrissy is a very pretty/cute girl.  She's very horny too.  Oh..was
   that the sound of your cock hitting the underneath of your desk?

   Sorry about Lucky.  The 4 of us should have gone to some dingy little
   pub and drank ourselves silly.  That would have been fun, huh?

   -----Original Message-----
   auntie,

   what are you having at burger inn?

   it has been too long - we'll have to fix it.  what are you doing this
   w/e?

   i feel like i've been sick for two weeks, and i haven't been doing much,
   mostly taking care of errands etc since i don't have much to do at work
   these days.  hopefully that will be changing soon.

   um, chrissy is much too cute to be playing with her toys alone.

   i'm not sure why lucky sucked - i think it was the crowd we met up with
   there.  you two should have come and it would have been more fun i'm
   sure.

      Sunday it is then.  I already know what I'm going to have!

      It was really great to see you on Saturday.  It has been much too
   long.
      What have you been doing with yourself?

      We didn't end up hitting Cowboys.  We were both a little tired and a
   lot
      cold.  I went home and watched a little t.v and it's a sure bet that
      Chrissy went home and played with her toys!

      Why was Lucky so terrible?

      Auntie

      -----Original Message-----
      auntie!

      absolutely.  i can't believe we haven't gone yet!  we should make it
   a
      tradition.

      great to see you on sat. night.  lucky was unbelievably lame.  yawn.

      how did the night go?  end up at cowboys?

sweet!

yah, jimi told me about the party and i will definitely be there.  

i'm not happy about you deploying though dude.  do you know what your role will be?

definitely catch up when i'm back.  

What up, man!

Things have been extremely busy during the past 90 days or so.  We are
preparing to deploy on 7 Jan.  I will be home with Tina from the 20th to the
27th.  I guess Jimi is having an engagement party on the 21st.  I would love
it if you could make it to that.  You will need to talk to Jim for details.

Yes, I am engaged.  Crazy, huh?  It feels good though.  Tina and I are
happy.  More to follow whence I see ya.

I have to run, but just wanted to let you know I was hanging in there and
doing well.

Peace, Howie

hey dude-

i hear you're engaged!  congratulations.  what's going on?  i haven't
been in touch with anyone in the last year or so...  things have been
going well in canada, but my company is melting down, so not sure what
i'm going to be doing and probably won't know for awhile.  i'm going to
be home dec 16 - jan 3.  are you going to be around?  looking forward to
catching up ...

IT has to hook up unreal because it requires local admin rights.

also, we don't have the disk anymore since colin left, so don't think
we hook up anymore.  unfortunately.

Hi,

I'm responding to an email sent by Tim Callahan on Nov 30 regarding questions on tax equalization.  I also left a voice-message for you.  

I'm in the Calgary office and paid out of the U.S.  I've been operating under the assumption that i 
wouldn't get hit twice on income taxes as there is a "credit" between Canada and the U.S.  However, after doing some reasearch on the IRS website, it seems there may be a cap to the "credit" that is allowable.  Do you know anything about this? or can you point me to someone who might be knowledgeable in such matters?  

thanks,
Cooper Richey

Hi Dawn,

haven't heard from you recently.  have you received anything from houston for me?  

thx,
cooper

hey dude-

what's new?  

i'm coming home dec 16 - jan 3.  are you planning on being around?  be
great to catch up on life.  

i haven't talked to anyone from hs in the last year or so - feeling lame
and out of touch.  i hear howard is engaged.  

things are going well for me, although job situation is somewhat uncertain
at this point ...  i'm sure you've seen what's going on with enron.  

how's callisma and life in general?

coop

eze:

its going well, thanks for asking - work is good - i'm getting excited to start trading again and i'm actually doing some real work!  feels good.  and i'm having fun with the whole exercise thing - i hope it sticks.  how are things with you - i know you are super busy, but it must be good to finally be starting a career?  

rockne is a special treat.  at least he isn't hairy.  i've found yoga to be a good antidote to modern life.  

i'm not excited to move at all, but i am looking forward to living in a new spot.  change is good.  i probly won't need your help moving, but i am planning on lifting some of those shelves from ikea, so i'll be sure to give you a ring for the install.  

great to see you last night at banana.  i can't wait to wear my blue pants, but it seems like they should follow the white pants rule, so i don't think i'll break them out until labor day.  definitely a good purchase, since i'll probably wear them twice (total).  

hope to see you tonight.  

cooper

hey Cooper, 
How's it going?  
I just had coffee with Jill....so early!! 
Let me tell you,  you missed quite the yoga class last night.  Rockne was in the class,  about 1 meter to my right  (which meant that I was facing him for the most of the class).  He took it upon himself to take his shirt off.  It was quite a treat!  I am still trying to block that sight out of my mind.  The instructor was good.  I've never seen her before,  but she was very mellow.  I was so relaxed after the class,  it was just what I needed. I have been super busy and kind of stressed out lately,  so this was just what I needed.  I would like to go to core again.  I would like to take Yanny there.  Speaking of Yanny,  I don't have her e-mail,  but you should call her.  I know that she would love to hear from you (686-8815).
Jai told me you guys went to earls bankers hall,  and that the service wasn't nearly as good (okay,  I added the last part!!).  You guys should come to Tin Palace (remember 251??,  or has it been too long?).  I'm sure all the lounge girls would love to see you.  It would be a good opportunity to catch up on all the latest (and greatest) Earls gossip.
Are you excited to move this weekend?  If you need any help just let me know.  Afterall,  I have quite a talent for assembling furniture (especially shelves)!  Anytime after 2am,  when I'm done working at Earls will work for me!!
Have a super day.  Friday is almost here.......... 
Emily  

hey dude-

i hear you're engaged!  congratulations.  what's going on?  i haven't been in touch with anyone in the last year or so...  things have been going well in canada, but my company is melting down, so not sure what i'm going to be doing and probably won't know for awhile.  i'm going to be home dec 16 - jan 3.  are you going to be around?  looking forward to catching up ...

coop

friend's wife owns)

interested?

not really.  i'm sure you've already been labeled a playboy (i feel you playboy!)

it depends how superficial and silly the men are there - my sense is that they
aren't, but i don't know.  

Do you think their would be some sort of advantage (from a career

definitely - i'm glad you want to talk more about it.  are you going to be downtown this week
at all?  should know more on wed/thu in terms of enron canada's future.

Hey Cooper-man,
Just wanted to further our discussion and express that we should keep in
contact;)
Keep me posted on your sitch........

ciao

definitely!  what more could you ask for?  

This is the response.  What do you think?

Glad you could come. Im sure we will have another soon! I really love

having friends over on that scale. We usually have a few in the summer.

You'll have to meet Andrea and I for a beer at Ceili's some Friday night- we

seem to be having as few too many these days.

hmm, synapses not jumping - i know the feeling,  i think i have three neurons firing in my brain this morning... 

i know what you mean about getting soft - when i went home to virginia for christmas, my mom was like "it's cold out, shouldn't you put a jacket on?" and having been toughened by the brutal calgary winters (in addition to being the super tough guy that i am) i did go out --- naked almost every day.  

let me know when you'er heading over to bass brothers and i'll meet up with you - i have a few things to do but drinks after work should fit in.    

i ran into eze (aka emily) at banana republic last night - its such a small town!  

hey, what do you do at cnrl anyway?  

cooper

Good morning Cooper! 
I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still refusing to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed.  
No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are in town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've gone soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two colder people in my life.
Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work.  You'll have to tell him I say hi.  
I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing most of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming?
Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon.

I don't know if you are speaking to me or not but what happened...You
missed a good one!

I went to my game at 10pm and got back to Tania's about 12:15 and started
to light it up with shooters.

We stayed up until 6am.  At about 4am one of Tania's grumpy lesbian
neighbors barged into her living room and told us that she hadn't been able
to sleep for the last 4 hours.  Needless to say Tania was not impressed as
the lesbian bitch could have just called.

Anyway I am going to get a coffee soon, don't know if you are interested.

great to hear from you.  someday we will talk - maybe today?  not sure if you're still in, but i'm at my desk.  number is 403 974 6946 
i believe it is the same country code as US, but not sure.  

it's been bad here at work for the last few weeks and its going to take awhile for things to get better, i'm just hoping it doesn't get any
worse.  it was very dicey for awhile - thought ene was going tits up.  

spanish desk sounds great!  say hi to kristian and paul for me, but we should catch up by phone, if possible, so i'll leave it there.

cooper

p.s. snow is just falling on the mountains and i'm getting excited for some good skiing.

Hey, how you doing ? Still hanging in there ? Is the snow on the mountains yet for Skiing ?

Back in London slowly getting to grips with the changes that have taken place, not quite visible at first...

I am working with Paul again on the Spanish desk along with Kristian and things are a little interesting in the market.

Been limited to plugging things together with Excel and not much database creativity, more analysis, which is good but a bit limiting at times with the internal Police preventing flexibility !

Are you in the office today, I have a question for you ?

Karl.

i guess not.  i'll remove the C++

Thanks mang............can you print it on Enron Letterhead and sign it for me.............Did I do C++ here??  :)

Thank you very much, Cooper.  I appreciate that immensely, and you probably don't know exactly how much that means to me.

Do you have a cell phone number I could use, if it ever came to that?

What happens to you, if things pan out that way?  Are you able to change jobs up here, or is your work visa void if Enron Canada goes under?  I would gladly do the same for you.

A new denial of service worm program, - like "sadmind", "nimda", etc. - has been discovered by the staff of SecurityFocus. This new program attacks Microsoft SQL servers that do not have a password set on their administrator accounts (named "sa"). Strange as it may seem, I know from experience that we have had a number of SQL servers at Enron that would be vulnerable to this (i.e., they don't have passwords on their "sa" accounts).

I am running a scan now on port 1433 only (where SQL server runs) to try to identify all vulnerable servers we may have. I will be providing this list to Eddie Ray and the EEL IT Security team for coordination of the remediation work.

Details on the worm can be found at <http://www.securityfocus.com/> on the front page.

there is a market surveillance summary for the alberta power pool 

at www.powerpool.ab.ca	with some spark spread stuff in it.  didn't
look at it, but if you're still looking at spark spreads, it would 
validate your method.  

yah.  the brutal part is that i'm sure those planes are no where near full.

that's brutal dude.  if we would have thought of this last week, they played

gotcha.  hood river would be a sweet place to live for awhile.  

alberta's great.  getting very cold here, but it's been puking in the mountains, so i'm looking forward
to getting out skiing, etc.  with the nosedive enron is taking, it's easy to blow out of work and head
to banff.  

alberta just built a 40MW wind farm (doubling wind capacity in the region) with more on the way.  should
be over 1% of installed capacity for the region soon.  

have fun in mejico.  

nope, I figure you've been busy, and I haven't actually had time to start
working on it.  I am heading down to mexico in a couple of weeks to
interview on a wind/solar/eco-design project down there. Relocation to
P-town tentatively planned for next summer. There are a number of
interesting projects on windpower in the hood river region that I am
investigating.  we'll see how that works out.

how'z alberta?

Thanks,

can you come over when its convenient?

excellent - really looking forward to dinner tomorrow!

 Just got off the phone with Colin, I pointed him at the code and gave him a short discussion of how the excel vba and dll work. He is going to investigate how things work and get back to me with any questions. Everything should be go to go into production with on the code, so he should not have anything to work on around this code.

Dinner is still on tomorrow. Just head out highway 1A (crowchild trail). After the end of the city, the highway will be a divided highway for about 12km, where it changes to a single lane highway. Keep goiung down that for about 3.5km. At about that time you should see a large radio transmission tower. Just past the radio tower you will see the GlenEagles sign on the south side of the highway. This is Gleneagles Drive. Take Gleneagles Dr. About 1 km down this road you will see a road to your left, go past this and take the next turn (about 1/3 of a mile) which is Gleneagles Blvd. This road is about 150yd long and and then turn to your left which will put you on Gleneagles View. Go to the end of this road about 1/3 of a mile and it will come to a tee. Turn left , you are on Gleneagles Terrace, we are the third house on your right 131 Gleneagles Terrace.

Things should start to happen about 5:00. Just bring your appetite.

Cheers, Greg

DBD::ODBC works like a charm.  if you're already using DBI, i don't think you'll have 
much trouble with the transition, assuming you're doing anything funky.  

OK, I have a question for the group.  I've got a Perl web-based
app which I've been using Mysql as the back end database.  The
plan was that this was going to be migrated to either Oracle or
DB2 as the back end, but I had a curve ball thrown at me, and
someone made a decision (a bad one in my opinion) that I would
have Microsoft SQL server as my database.  This isn't a decision
I am going to be able to change.

I've done some searching on the net and on CPAN for modules to
talk to the database (DBD drivers/etc), and I've found one module
called DBD::FreeTDS which can directly talk to MS SQL (however that
appears to not even exist anymore).

So, my real question is: what is the best method for being able to
talk to a MS Sql server?  Anybody with a fair bit of experience in
doing this?  Any gotchas I should look for?  Any books/websites I
should go to?

Thanks.

Hey Toby,

sorry to hear about the layoffs.  i think the hatchet falls around here next week.  

Chris Wiebe has been taking care of things here and interacting with Houston
a fair bit and I think he's been doing a great job with things, which is too bad 
since that means he forces me to play around in dev instead of prod ...

anyway, i hope we can enjoy a beer sometime and laugh about enron, but it
doesn't feel too good right now.  

thanks for the note.  

Hi Cooper,  

How are things going?  I presume not stunningly!  We have already canned 40% of IT staff and who knows what's going to happen next?

We are about to hand over support of the database servers in both Portland and Calgary to Paul Kane, as per his request,  but will still be happy to help out if it is required.

See ya

its a boring exchange - its hard to get motivated.  i thought i would be on the one a day plan

bitch, i could barely open the doors on the way back.

This sounds good dude, but you should push her a touch to see if there's any
interest.  Reply an hour after you get one - see what happens.  I'm
certainly not saying don't lose your mind like I've clearly done.  Aren't

Cooper! Are you still alive and well? We'll be here until Tuesday, then in
So Cal for a week, then back on Sat again. REPLY HERE AND LEAVE YOUR PHONE
NUMBER, or just actually call us. We miss you. (510) 848-1919. Love, Kate

hey japhet

did i ever get you the name of the wind guy at enron?  i forget now.  

Hi all,
wanna spend the winter leading eco-tours in the yucatan? check this out.

Background
CESiaK is located on the Caribbean Coast of Mexico, near the Mayan Ruins
of Tulum, south of Cancun. Still under development, the center is a small
ecotourism and education center that will serve as a model for sustainable
development in sensitive tropical ecosystems. The revenue generated
through tours and various on-site activities is used to fund conservation
and education programs within the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve. The Center
operates using ecologically responsible technologies, including systems
for wetland waste management, rainwater collection, and solar and wind
energy generation. It also focuses on community development, educational
outreach programs, turtle conservation programs, and biological research,
including propagation and  revegetation of native plants. CESiaK provides
a model for other sustainable development projects as well as an
informational resource for the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve.

Eco-Tourism Guide Position
At CESiaK we currently offer an all-day, educational, sight-seeing boat
tour through the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve and a shorter sunset tour
emphasizing bird-watching.

Highlights of the Tour include:
? Following the Mayan trade route used 1200 years ago
? Seeing abundant flora and fauna unique to Sian Ka'an
? Visiting unexcavated Mayan ruins hidden within the Reserve
? Floating down a freshwater river and swimming in natural sink-holes
? Learning the natural and Mayan history of the Reserve with experienced
guides

The primary responsibility of the tour guide is to lead these tours and
educate tourists about the unique diversity of ecosystems, flora, and
fauna found within the Reserve. Other responsibilities include preparing
food coolers for the tours, communicating problems with tour equipment,
and driving and maintaining the two tour vans. Depending on qualifications
and interest, the guide would also work with other staff members to carry
out other programs undertaken by CESiaK.

Qualifications
The ideal candidate would have an undergraduate or graduate degree in
biology or environmental science, as well as an interest and understanding
of general socio-economic issues of Latin America, including Mayan culture
and history. However, all candidates with a strong interest in learning
will certainly be considered. Once hired, the guide will be thoroughly
trained to lead the tours. Because in many senses the tour guide is the
face of the organization, it is crucial to have proven exemplary
communication skills, command of the Spanish language, an independent
motivation to self-manage the broad responsibilities of the tours, and a
dedication to conservation.

Cooper,
After you run your model later this morning, can you provide me with its outputs for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday?
Thanks,
MW

Good morning Cooper! 
I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still refusing to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed.  
No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are in town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've gone soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two colder people in my life.
Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work.  You'll have to tell him I say hi.  
I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing most of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming?
Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon. 
Jill 
did you see black hawk down?  i didn't like it that much, but i read the 
book awhile ago (really good) and its a hard subject to make a movie about. 
my brother is in the special forces, so it's scary to think he could be one 
of those guys. 

just finished playing squash with ian cooke  i'm guessing you know him too? 

i have so little to do at work these days, its hard to be motivated, but i 
suppose i could have worse things to complain about.  what movies did you 
rent? sorry if i'm nosy, but see previous sentence.

   Hi Cooper, 
   Friday night is always a good one.  This was a little better then some, 
   however, my Saturday morning made me regret the increase in the fun 
   factor. 
   My Saturday night makes your Friday look like a huge shaker.  I rented 
   movies and rarely left my couch.  I haven't had a Saturday like that in 
   months but its nice to take it easy once in a while. 
   How's Black Hawk Down?  I was going to see it tomorrow. 
   Have a good night.

     Hi Jill, 

     how was ceili's? 

     i ended up going home and taking a nap and then going to see black 
     hawk 
     down.  i think i was in bed by 10:30...  i'm sure you had more fun 
     than me. 
     overall, my w/e was fairly uneventful. you? 

     should go another time.

        Hey Cooper, 
        I wanted to thank you again for asking Emily and I to the wine 
     tasting 
        last night.  I had a great time (or as much fun as an uncultured 
     Calgary 
        hick can have) and think we should all do it again soon. 
        Also, I have been enlisted by Emmy to make sure you are coming to 
        Ceili's tonight.  She didn't get a chance to write this morning but 
        wanted to extend the invitation to you one more time.  She won't be 
     done 
        until 5 and so I think we'll head over around then. 
        Ah Ha!  Lunch time!  Hope to see you tonight and have a good rest 
     of 
        your day.

ok.  i don't mind helping out - let me know if you need a hand.  cell is 512 3312.  

You know what Cooper, don't worry about it.  Chrissy said she can give me a boost.  Her booster cables are in her Jeep so it is probably easier for her than for you.

Thanks for the advice though.  I will still buy you BI!

I think you are right about the 30 minute rule.  I should have let it run longer.

I'm not parked on a hill.  My jeep is out front of my apt.

Would you consider giving me a boost?  I would really appreciate it.  So much, in fact, that I would buy you Burger Inn next time we went (if we ever go)

i think you didn't let it run long enough after your boost.  i think 30
minutes is the rule of thumb when you're battery is drained.  not turning
over at all is not a good sign - one thing you can do is park on a hill
when you're in doubt and then you can roll-start your jeep (if you have a
standard) if you didn't let it charge long enough - if the battery is
really, really dead, though, this won't work.  where's your jeep now?

    -----Original Message-----
   I left my headlights on overnight on Sunday.  When I went to start my
   Jeep on Monday, the battery was dead.  I got a boost but only let it run
   for about 5 minutes.  I shut it off and then re-started it - I thought
   everything was fine.  When I went to start it last night - same thing.
   Didn't even turn over.  I don't know if I wrecked my battery or if I
   need a new alternator.  Or maybe I didn't let it run for long enough
   after my boost.

   Jai says you are very mechanically inclined - any advice?

i've been doing nothing for two months (literally) and should be trading again in a few weeks, so i've got to start preparing for that, which is a welcome change.  

what do you mean you're not doing anything this w/e?  i like the bar scene alot, but i have to be drunk to enjoy it.  i think one night a week its good if you have nothing better to do.  i think some of the boys from enron are going out this sat. if you end up having nothing to do.  we'll be moving in this w/e, you should come by and check it out.  

as for chrissy, that was the sound of my cock puncturing the desk and knocking my mouse on its side.  

dingy pub would have been good - do you have a favorite?  i like the auburn saloon, but jai hates it. so ...  it took us *forever* to get out of the parking lot.  brutal.  

SDC,

I will have a 1/4 pound hamburger (I think) with ketchup, mustard, pickles, lettuce, and onions (wanna neck).  No mayo,tomato, or cheese.  I will have fries and a coke with that please!

This week-end probably not doing too much.  I like to hang out - not much for the whole bar scene.  You?

How will things at work be changing?

Yep, Chrissy is a very pretty/cute girl.  She's very horny too.  Oh..was that the sound of your cock hitting the underneath of your desk?

Sorry about Lucky.  The 4 of us should have gone to some dingy little pub and drank ourselves silly.  That would have been fun, huh?

auntie,

what are you having at burger inn?

it has been too long - we'll have to fix it.  what are you doing this w/e?

i feel like i've been sick for two weeks, and i haven't been doing much,
mostly taking care of errands etc since i don't have much to do at work
these days.  hopefully that will be changing soon.

um, chrissy is much too cute to be playing with her toys alone.

i'm not sure why lucky sucked - i think it was the crowd we met up with
there.  you two should have come and it would have been more fun i'm sure.

   We didn't end up hitting Cowboys.  We were both a little tired and a lot
   cold.  I went home and watched a little t.v and it's a sure bet that
   Chrissy went home and played with her toys!

Hi Cheryl,

I'm not sure if I forwarded this or not, but I'm not sure what to do with this.  This is regarding the invoice I gave you a couple weeks ago.  It appears that Stan submitted two invoiced on the same day?  Let me know if there is anything I can do.  

Cooper

Cooper --  I received payment for invoice  #001 a couple of days after I asked you.  Thank you very much.. Not to  appear greedy but I have not received payment for # 002 which was submitted on  Nov 29 and again after Xmas with the # 001 documentation. # 002 is for  $1712.00 and covers work I did at the end of August to develop the plant  coefficents forwarded to you on Nov 29.  Please see what you can do &  let me know. Stan

eze-  i got your message and i might be up for yoga tonight.  i went to core last night and it was nice and mellow.  do you have any idea who teaches the 7:30 class?  i went a while back and it this hyper-active guy taught the class and it wasn't so good - adding that to the rockne risk makes it a dangerious proposition.  

do you happen to have janice's email address?  jai and i haven't been to earls in a long time and i was wondering how she was doing.  if you see her when you're working, tell her i said hi.

consider me a free call option

Trying to get tickets for tonight's hockey game.  Going to ask Krypto, but in the case she can't go, or heaven forbid, turns me down, can you be on call?  I'm trying to buy good seats for the reasonable price of $68/tick.

i can come now - what are  you doing for lunch?

Sure.  She can't enter unless she knows the highly secretive codeword.  The
codeword is the name of both occupants of the lair.  I don't think she'll be
able to pull it off.

Are you planning to stop by before noon to see the table.

His home number is 228-5771.  His cell number is 561-3759, but I don't know
if he's replaced his cell phone yet.

hows it going?  jai said you got into an accident - glad to hear you are ok and i hope it wasn't too stressful.  

thinking of going to yoga tonight at the space (5:30) - thought i would give you a look.

ok, fuckface. 

Dude....stuff it up your sensitive ass.

brenda was a test.  stratego failed.  this email is yet more evidence.

the fact that stratego was not aggressively machinating does not impress me
in the least.

the fact that you are still representing makes me sad.

asking for props?  please, dude, the depths of your selfishness have yet to
be established.

don't treat me like a fool or one of your bitches.  take a moment and peer
inside - that tinge of guilt?  that's what i'm talking about.

in any case, i don't plan on claiming anyone again.

         But, oh

         well.  I'm going to the game on Sat.  I won tickets through Molson
         Canadian!!  I'm pretty pumped!  It's the game against Anaheim.
   Isn't
         that
         the one that you were talking about?
         Well, have a great day!

Hi,

I work at Enron as a power trader and Gary Hagerty asked me to forward any prospects for a "junior power risk management" position at Epcor onto you. 

Michael Wong worked for us on booking the Sundance B PPA position and was let go soon after this was sold to TransCanada/Altagas and if you're still looking for someone, he would be worth investigating.

Hi Jill,

how was ceili's?  

i ended up going home and taking a nap and then going to see black hawk down.  i think i was in bed by 10:30...  i'm sure you had more fun than me.  overall, my w/e was fairly uneventful. you?

should go another time.  

cooper

  

Hey Cooper, 
I wanted to thank you again for asking Emily and I to the wine tasting last night.  I had a great time (or as much fun as an uncultured Calgary hick can have) and think we should all do it again soon.
Also, I have been enlisted by Emmy to make sure you are coming to Ceili's tonight.  She didn't get a chance to write this morning but wanted to extend the invitation to you one more time.  She won't be done until 5 and so I think we'll head over around then.
Ah Ha!  Lunch time!  Hope to see you tonight and have a good rest of your day.

hi Jill,

i'm glad you had fun last night and we should definitely do it again.  

I may stop by ceili's on the way home, but might also go home to bed.  undecided at the moment.  if i don't stop by, can i take a raincheck?  

i'm sure i'll see you soon either way.

I think I may be on an "immigration" list in houston, but based on the attached forms, it looks like they think i am a non-U.S. citizen residing in the U.S., rather than a U.S. citizen residing in Canada.  Should I get in touch with Karen Buckley?  please advise.

All,
 
For those of you who have not met  with UBS's Immigration Counsel, Kumar Kuman, please review the attached checklist and forward to me the relevant information.   Whilst Tindall & Foster  (Enron's Legal Immigration Counsel) will be able to forward most of this required documentation, it would assist with expediting matters if you are able to forward me this information.   My desk location is 3681c.
 
For those of you who have signed the release forms  (copy attached) your details on file  with Tindall & Foster will be forwarded to Fragomen (UBS Immigration  Counsel) shortly.
 
Please utilize me as your contact at this point and not the contact names on the checklist until/unless otherwise notified .

eze:  its at 7:30 and its usually $20.  all the money gets spent on the wine, so its a good deal.  its extremely casual and it would be great to see jill again. as for jamie, brokering is a slimy business and its hard to see how she fits in, but then i don't know her that well.  didn't see royal t's... i went home and went to bed (i'm sick! yuck).  dorland is chris dorland and a guy i sit next to at work.  he was there on saturday night.  i'm sure you'll run into him again.  i'll let craig know you are thinking of coming.  

	- c - 

I know you have had a hard time keeping up to my e-mails,  but I don't blame you.  We have a solid 2 to 1 ratio.  Not bad.  I talked to Jill last night and she wants to go to the wine tasting on Thursday.  What time is it at???  It sounds like fun.  Is it casual?  I haven't talked to Jaimie about it yet.  She has been going on dates with potential clients.  Funny,  I didn't know you could use those two words in the same sentence!  She never ceases to amaze me (that's what I like about her!).
How was royal t's?  Who's dorland?? 
Sorry about all the questions.  
See you on Thursday! 
eze 

Many thanks.  Your copy works like a charm.  I'll be more diligent in my archive search next time.  

Search the list archives, for this is an FAQ.

Hint: the copy of R.1.4.0 on CRAN compiled for Windows does not work
correctly with grid or lattice.  So either compile it yourself, or
get the copy announced by me about Dec 20.

Rgui and Rterm crash when I invoke "xyplot" or "trellis.device" commands (including the oft-used "quakes" example)

In particular, I get a message box from the windows OS with the following text:

this seems to happen right after the graphics window is spawned. 

I'm using lattice version 0.4-0 and grid version 0.5

am I missing some sort of prep work for lattice graphics?

thanks any help,

Hi Chris,
 
I'm deeply concerned about all of these points and think we should meet in person to discuss.  I'm free all day.  

Hey Cooper,
 
I would like to get your opinion and approval on a couple of things:
 
1) We'd like to get a development IIS server running, and so would also like to move your development from NETCo's only production IIS server, to this new server.  I believe Greg is setting this up shortly.
 
2) Since the PowerFS1 server is now the production web server for all of NETCo, we'd like to move the IIS administration duties to the IT team, which would most likely mean to me. (I'm assuming you have these duties right now?  If not, maybe you could point me in the right direction)
 
3) Also because of that, we need to move at least one web application on to PowerFS1.(Presenter is the one NETCo web app moving over that is in Production.  Origman will be there shortly as well.)  Since Pavel used MSXML3 with SP1 and would need it on the box, I was wondering what version are you running? (He tells me that multiple versions can be run at the same time, as they are separately named libraries and files).
 
Thanks for your time.
 
Let me know what you think about all of this,

hey emily,

don't think i can make yoga tonight - i went climbing last night and inflamed some tendonitis i have in my arm so i'm going to chill out for a few days.  however, i have made plans to see the royal t's with dorland tonight - so here's a look if you haven't already seen it.  

and to respond to your earlier email (i can't keep up):
the meeting i had on sunday was fine - it's always good to see what else is out there.  

the pipe and casing industry sounds fascinating - i can't wait until you're an expert and you can hold forth on the intricacies over some earls carrot cake.  and speaking of earls desserts, anything would be better than the gingerbread cake.  also, has earls updated the propaganda on the left hand side of the menu, specifically the "featured ingredients" section?  

not sure when you're going to get this, actually.  

oh, i'm going to a wine tasting at the double mo cafe on thursday night if you/jamie are interested.  do you interested in wine?  my friend craig's wife owns the cafe which is near the university.  i always have fun when i go, so give it some thought if you like wine.  i think it's going to be a new zealand/australian theme.

which one was sandy?

is the machination mad at someone else for being selfish and calculating?

I think there is a happy medium between our feelings for Emily.  Speaking as
a realist, I don't think she's as cool as you think she is.  She does some
stuff that seems selfish and calculating, which is totally different than
the person she "publicly" portrays.  That makes me suspicious.  Also keep in
mind that she treats me differently than she treats you.  I liked her a lot
better when she treated me like a friend.

Regardless, your advice seems sound.  AND, we will get another chance to
stare at Sandy's body.

at some point, you will stop demonizing emily and re-realize how cool she
is, bitch.

here's your chance to get out with your rep intact, you can blame
everything on the "complexity"

i would make it clean though, none of your half-assed bullshit.

   Jai,
   I haven't written you a long e-mail ina while, so I thought it was about
   time - just for old times sake!
   I guess there is also something I wanted to say...so here goes.
   When we first started e-mailing and hanging out,  you were alot of fun
   (well, you still are),  and I thought it was the beginning of a
   friendship.
   Then after a short time,  I realized that there was more.  I just went
   with
   it and went with what I thought felt right.  Recently,  for me at least,
   everyone seems have involved themselves in a simple situation ,  making
   everything more complicated and confusing (I guess this is my payback
   for
   being such a big mouth/ gossiper about everyone else).

   Now,  everything just seems weird.
    What happened to that "waitress/ customer" bond we once had???....(I
   thought I would throw that last part in here to lighten the mood of this
   e-mail).

   Everything just happened so quickly,  that looking back it's hard to
   believe
   that all this happened in a month.  I guess why I'm writing you this is
   to
   let you know that I think your an amazing person,  and someone that I
   consider a friend.  At the same time,  this friendship is not anything
   that
   I'm going to force.

   I'm not expecting a response from this e-mail and I'm not asking for
   anything.  I just wanted to let you know where I was coming from.  What
   better way to do it then over e-mail - afterall,  isn't that how this
   all
   started?

hi jill,

ah, i don't think you'll get this until next week, but maybe you're checking your email on the road.  hope your course is fun.  

how was it to see your family.  i've had my parents visit me up here and i was also down there over christmas break and i much prefer when they visit me rather the other way around.  i feel like i'm back in high school when i'm back home, i think, or something like that.  

don't tease me, what did you do on sat night?  

work is going really well - finally feeling some pressure.  

hmm, i don't know anything about painting pottery, but i'm interested. i've done it before and its harder than it looks and takes awhile, but could be fun with the right group of people.  

talk to you soon,
cooper

Hey Cooper, 
I hope you had a good weekend.  Emmy said you guys met up after I left.  My Friday wasn't a particularly exciting one.  I went out with the family (a five hour ordeal, for some reason my family is an anomaly when it comes to food consumption.  It's like being in the land of the sloth people).  Then I went home and crashed.  I made up for it on Saturday, which I regretted when I had to be up at 7am to see my dad off at the airport.
So, how's work going?  I'm busy b/c I'm going to be out of the office until Friday.  Their sending me to this gas marketing course for three days.  The itinerary doesn't look particularly exciting but I don't have to be there until 8am and I'll be done around 4pm.  It's sad that this is exciting to me.
So, I hear we're painting pottery?!  Are you going to come?  I have to admit its something I've never even thought of trying before but sounds like fun.  I'm not a very artistic person but I figure its hard to screw up painting pots.  But, you never know.
Have a great rest of your day 
jill 
try having no work to do for two months and then having to stick around and 
"appear" busy...  i know what you mean, in some ways its harder when you're 
not used to not doing things.  i've gotten good at finding things to do 
with my time, but when i first had nothing to do, i was going crazy. 
fridays are always slow around here and i'm guessing its the same there, 
although i don't know cnrl specifcally, oil and gas producer/marketer? 

in terms of what i do, before enron went under, i was the short term 
alberta power trader.  since then, i have been champion internet surfer and 
investigating local coffee shops in an ever-widening circle.  although, 
things are looking up. 

eze is (i think) an earls nickname -- pronounced easy-e.  although, they 
may just call her easy for short.  i'm sure she loves both names very much. 

i have a very important meeting at 5 with my massage therapist and i was 
thinking about stopping by after that.  should i call eze's cell?  or do 
you have a cell #?

   You know what the worst thing in the world is?  Having no work to do on 
   a Friday but being unable to leave for hours.  I've been here for three 
   months and this is the first day where I haven't been busy.  This is a 
   Type A's worst nightmare.  E-mail is my sole consolation. 
   So what do I do, you ask?  I'm in Gas Operations, the marketer's right 
   hand man.  I do logistics, volume and supply/demand analysis, 
   nominations, monitoring of accounts, damage control...you know, more or 
   less hold the company together.  What exactly do you do over there? 
   Everyone always sees Emmy at Banana Republic.  She's a staple there. 
   Where did you get eze from?  I'm sure she loves it.  She never gets very 
   flattering nick names. 
   Well, I'm going to take off for lunch.  What time were you thinking of 
   coming down for drinks? 
   Talk to you soon

     hmm, synapses not jumping - i know the feeling,  i think i have three 
     neurons firing in my brain this morning... 

     i know what you mean about getting soft - when i went home to virginia 
     for 
     christmas, my mom was like "it's cold out, shouldn't you put a jacket 
     on?" 
     and having been toughened by the brutal calgary winters (in addition 
     to 
     being the super tough guy that i am) i did go out --- naked almost 
     every 
     day. 

     let me know when you'er heading over to bass brothers and i'll meet up 
     with 
     you - i have a few things to do but drinks after work should fit in. 

     i ran into eze (aka emily) at banana republic last night - its such a 
     small 
     town! 

     hey, what do you do at cnrl anyway? 

     cooper 

         -----Original Message----- 
        Good morning Cooper! 
        I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still 
     refusing 
        to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed. 
        No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are 
     in 
        town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've 
     gone 
        soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two 
        colder people in my life. 
        Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work. 
        You'll have to tell him I say hi. 
        I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my 
        part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing 
     most 
        of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers 
        tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming? 
        Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon. 
        Jill

are you in the office today?  yoga tomorrow sounds great.  i went last night to a beginner YIM class with a friend from work who wanted to check it out.  it was crowded - are the w/e classes the same/better/worse?  i somehow always try to show up early to yoga but never manage to, but YIM may leave me no choice.  i feel like i'm in san francisco three years ago the way yoga is taking off here.  i love carrot cake.  ceilis sounds good - i'll see you there.  i like how you send each email with a takeaway thought.  i'm actually busy this morning, but wanted to reply sorry for the sound bites -- see you after work.  - c -

Hi Cooper!! 
Well, it's finally Friday!!!  I hope work is going well....I just glad I don't work for Arthur Andersen,  otherwise we probably wouldn't be allowed to e-mail each other.
YIM this weekend sounds great!  How about the 11:15 class tomorrow???  I am running at 9,  so I should be done in time for yoga.  I'll call Yani.  About tomorrow night,  it's not so much a wine and cheese, 
 but more of a mix any kind of drink that people want to drink.  Whatever you want to call it...it will be fun!! I'll talk to you tomorrow about directions to Jaimies and times etc.  
Yes,  I am working at Earls this weekend.  I am working Sunday night. Speaking of Earls,  I know how much you liked the gingerbread....but the feature dessert just changed to carrot cake!  You'll have to come in and try it.
I a going for drinks this afternoon with Stephanie, Jaimie, and Sandy(I think you met her on Saturday at Lucky).  I think we're going to Ceilis after work.  You should come for a drink...afterall,  a drink with friends is a perfect compliment to a long work week!

i missed yoga last night too - do you want to try to YIM this weekend?  saturday night sounds good.  i'm not sure what's going on with crantina and its not too personal nor a secret.  i'll pass the book along to jai.  are you working at earls again this w/e to support your shooter-lifestyle?  - c -

Hey Cooper, 
I don't know if I can make yoga tomorrow...I might have to work late.  But I'll have a better idea by tomorrow afternoon.
I'm glad that you liked Tuesday's with Morrie.  You can pass it along to Jai.  I have promised that book to so many people,  so I just hope that everyone reads it quickly so I can pass it along to the next!  The wine party is still on for the weekend, and of course you are invited!  It should be fun.  Alot of Earls people will be there but also alot of other fun people.  We are all going to the Whiskey afterwards,  so tell everyone to meet us there afterwards.  You can bring whoever you want to the wine party.  Speaking of bringing someone...whatever happened to that girl that you went on that date with, you know, the one who ordered the crantini??  I hope that isn't getting to personal...but come on, you can tell me, we're friends.  I promise I won't say anything.(even though you may think I have a big mouth, I can actually keep a secret...sometimes!!)
By the time you read this it will be Wednesday, so...Happy Hump Day!(that was just too cheesy)

i've been playing around more with R (doing some reading and installing the basic package) and it looks fantastic.  in particular, the database connecticity package ("RODBC") works right out of the box!  very impressive.  in a couple of lines, i can get data from a table in a SQL server database into a dataframe and more importantly, result sets from stored procedures can be returned to data frames as well.  and its free!  

hi mom,

i'll let you know when i get the package - thanks for sending it.  

things are ok, just waiting to see how things shake out with the enron-ubs deal., it looks ok, but i'll know more later this week.

Hi!

              I know your probably mad at me but I took vacation on Friday 
and could not get my husband interested in coming downtown ( I know your 
thinking yeah right)!  Scott said it was fun!  Just because I didn't make 
your party does not mean you are out of sight  -  out of mind!  I wish you 
much happiness and a very bright future.  Take care and come to see us often 
(we are still waiting).

Ignore my comment about being a one day deal!  Sorry!

Can you tell me anything more about the deal - date & price?  Hopefully I can 
help with additional information.  Is this a one day deal?

Hi!

                     How was your lunch with Dan?  I hope you had fun!  
Thanks for going with me to the YMCA - I can't wait untill we get into the 
routine we talked about. When do you want to start?  Next Monday?  

                                                                              
                               Love You Much!!!

Hi!

         How are you?  I wanted to call you this week-end but I had such a 
bad one that I never had time.  First, I made a mistake at work that caused 
several people to have to work extra time on Saturday so I was on the phone 
with them all day ( I felt bad).   Sunday we went to brunch at Pappasitos and 
I left my retainer wrapped in a napkin on the table  -  so it cost me $800.00 
to replace - I was so mad at myself (you know how cheap I am).  I was off 
Monday & Tuesday and had four doctors appointments so that was fun.  I 
finally got my bookcases cleaned (there were spider webs all over them) and 
my Halloween decorations that Mom made me up.  My house looks really nice (to 
nice for us actually).  We finally got our chandelier for the dining room - 
it is so beautiful.  I made reservations for Thankgiving and was sad when Don 
told me this week-end that they are not planning on coming home because Lynn 
has to work.  I hope we can stay with you as I understand Carla & Russ are 
not doing well.  Maybe we can eat at the Rose - just  you & me.  Well better 
go.  Love you and take care of yourself.

A beautiful woman loved growing tomatoes, but couldn't seem to get her 
tomatoes to turn red. One day while taking a stroll she came upon a 
gentleman neighbor who had the most beautiful garden full of huge red 
tomatoes. 

The woman asked the gentleman, "What do you do to get your tomatoes so 
red?" The gentleman responded, "Twice a day I stand in front of my tomato 
garden and expose myself, and my tomatoes turn red from blushing so much." 

 The woman was so impressed, she decided to try doing the same 
 thing to her tomato garden to see if it would work. So twice a day for two 
weeks she exposed herself to her garden hoping for the best 

  One day the gentleman was passing by and asked the woman, "By the way, 
How did you make out? Did your tomatoes turn red?" 

"No" she replied, "but my cucumbers are enormous!"

Hi!

                  How is your day going?  Yesterday was better for me!  The 
vote for who did better in the debate last night seems to be Gore.

                                                                              
                                            
                                                                              
                                            Love You!

Thanks so much - your the best!

Hi
     
     I guess this is a case of be careful of what you ask for!  Since you 
helped me last week delete all products except physical gas from the All 
Products
section of stack manager ,  I can no longer select a financial swap product 
as a link to my physical products.  For example, I would like to link my 
HEHUB physical 
rest of month product to the gas daily HEHUB swap product.  Can you help me 
once again or refer me to someone who can?  Sorry, I did not realize these 
options were connected.

                                                                              
                                      Thanks in advance for your help!

I do not show I did any deals outside of EOL with Koch at the Sabine Hub 
during this time frame.  Sitara deal #369260 refers to EOL deal ID 369298. 

I was told you may be the person to help me.   I am a trader on the East gas 
desk working for Scott Neal.  When I was originally set up to operate on EOL  
I  was set up with many more products than I needed.  I am having problems 
with my system being very slow and the suggestion was made to delete 
everything from All Products in stack manager but US Gas.  Are you the person 
who can help me accomplish this?  All other attempts to speed up the editing 
process have been unsuccessful.  Even if this does not help improve the time 
it takes to change a price I would still like to delete these product options 
because it takes me to long to find my products each day. 

                                                                              
                                                                              
               Thank You! 

Please set me up for Thursday at 2:00.  

                                    THANK YOU!

                        Volume:  400,000MMBtu during the month of August,

                        Price:  Fixed price  as agreed by both parties at 
time of  request  by Duke for a firm price equal to the September NYMEX  +$.01

Hi!

           I'm so glad everything is going well with the kids - what is Jay 
going to study?  I am worried about Dani driving too - just don't tell me - 
there's no need for both of us to worry (just kidding).  When do they start 
back to school?  Some kids in Houston started this week already.  I so enjoy 
the summer when the traffic is lighter.  I have started getting to work 
earlier between 7:00 - 7:15 so that helps some.  Dick told me his brothers 
Charles & Russell and families are planning to come to Houston for Christmas 
- I started sweating immediately.  What will we do with all these teenagers & 
ANDREW?  

                                                                              
                                                                              
    Love you & take care of yourself!

you two weeks' notice. There should be severance pay,  and before they leave 
you, they should have to find you a temp."

ADVICE TO GIVE YOUR DAUGHTERS

1.  Don't imagine you can change a man, unless he's in diapers.

2.  What do you do if your boyfriend walks out? You shut the door.

3.  If they put a man on the moon, they should be able to put them
all up there.

4.  Never let your man's mind wander, it's too little to be out alone.

5.  Go for younger men. You might as well, they never mature anyway.

6.  Men are all the same, they just have different faces, so that you
can tell them apart.

7.  Definition of a bachelor; a man who has missed the opportunity to
make some woman miserable.

8.  Women don't make fools of men, most of them are the do it
yourself types.

9.  Best way to get a man to do something is to suggest they are too
old for it.

10. Love is blind, but marriage is a real eye-opener.

11. If you want a committed man, look in a mental hospital.

12. The children of Israel wandered around the desert for 40 years.
Even in biblical times, men       wouldn't ask for directions.

13. If he asks what sort of books you're interested in, tell him
checkbooks.

14. Remember a sense of humor does not mean that you tell him jokes,
it means that you laugh at     his.

15. Sadly, all men are created equal.

Thought you would get a "kick" out of this

	
	

The 5 questions most feared by men are:

1. What are you thinking about?
2. Do you love me?
3. Do I look fat?
4. Do you think she is prettier than me?
5. What would you do if I died?

What makes these questions so difficult is that every one is guaranteed
to 
explode into a major argument if the man answers incorrectly (i.e.,
tells 
the truth). Therefore, as a public service, each question is analyzed
below, 
along with possible responses.

QUESTION #1: WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT?
The proper answer to this, of course, is: "I'm sorry if I've been quiet 
dear.  I was just reflecting on what a warm, wonderful, thoughtful,
caring, 
intelligent woman you are, and how lucky I am to have met you."

This response obviously bears no resemblance to the true answer, which
most 
likely is one of the following:
1. Hockey.
2. Sex.
3. How fat you are.
4. How much prettier she is than you.
5. How I would spend the insurance money if you died.

Perhaps the best response to this question was offered by Al Bundy, who
once told Peg, "If I wanted you to know what I was thinking, I would be 
talking to you!"

QUESTION #2: DO YOU LOVE ME?

The proper response is: "YES" or, if you feel a more detailed answer is
in 
order, "Yes, dear."

Inappropriate responses include:
1. Oh Yeah, shit loads.
2. Would it make you feel better if I said yes?
3. That depends on what you mean by love.
4. Does it matter?
5. Who? Me?

QUESTION #3: DO I LOOK FAT?

The correct answer is an emphatic: "Of course not!"

Among the incorrect answers are:
1. Compared to what?
2. I wouldn't call you fat, but you're not exactly thin.
3. A little extra weight looks good on you.
4. I've seen fatter.
5. Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking about how I would 
spend the insurance money if you died.

QUESTION #4: DO YOU THINK SHE'S PRETTIER THAN ME?

Once again, the proper response is an emphatic: "Of course not!"

Incorrect responses include:
1. Yes, but you have a better personality.
2. Not prettier, but definitely thinner.
3. Not as pretty as you were when you were her age.
4. Define pretty.
5. Could you repeat the question? I was just thinking about how I would
spend the insurance money if you died.

QUESTION #5: WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF I DIED?

A definite no-win question. The real answer, of course, is "Buy Corvette
and Boat". No matter how you answer this, be prepared for at least an
hour 
of follow-up questions, usually along these lines:

Woman: Would you get married again?
Man: Definitely not!

Woman: Why not? Don't you like being married?
Man: Of course I do.

Woman: Then why wouldn't you remarry?
Man: Okay, I'd get married again.

Woman: You would?(WITH A HURT LOOK ON HER FACE) Would you sleep with her
in our bed?
Man: Where else would we sleep?

Woman: Would you put away my pictures, and replace them with pictures of
her?
Man: That would seem like the proper thing to do.

Woman: And would you let her use my golf clubs?
Man: She can't use them; she's left-handed.

Woman: ---silence---
Man: shit

	
	

   One day when I was feeling gloomy, And in a melancholy mood, I heard a
  voice from out the gloom say 'Cheer up, things could be worse.'  So I
  cheered up and sure enough, things got worse!"
  
  THE NEXT TIME YOU THINK YOU ARE HAVING A BAD DAY:
  
  Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned out
  section of  forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The
  deceased
  male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba tanks on his
  back, flippers, and facemask.
  A post-mortem revealed that the person died not from burns, but from
  massive internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive
  identification.
  Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clad diver
  ended up in the middle of a forest fire.
  It was revealed that on the day of the fire, the person went for a
  diving trip off the coast some 20 miles from the forest. The fire
  fighters, seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, called in
  a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from
  the ocean and then flown to the forest fire and emptied.
  You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the
  Pacific, the next he was doing the breaststroke in a fire-dip-bucket 300
  feet in the air. Apparently he extinguished exactly 5'10" of the fire.
  Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed.
  (This article was taken from the California Examiner, March 20,
  > 1998)
  STILL THINK YOU ARE HAVING A BAD DAY?
  
  A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in
  the kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle when it
  accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the handle
  bars, was dragged through the glass patio doors and along with the
  motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house.
  The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room and found her
  husband lying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle lying next
  to him, and the shattered patio door.
  The wife ran to the phone and summoned the ambulance.
  Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the
  several flights of stairs to the street to escort the paramedics to her
  husband.
  After the ambulance arrived and transported the man to the hospital,
  the wife up righted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas
  was  spilled on the floor, the wife got some paper towels, blotted up the
  petrol, and threw the towels in the toilet. The man was treated and released
  to come home.
  Upon arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the
  damage done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went to the bathroom,
  sat
  down on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the cigarette,
  he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while seated.
  His wife, who was in the kitchen, heard the loud explosion and her
  husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband lying
  on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering
  burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs, and his groin.
  His wife again ran to the phone to call the ambulance. The very same
  paramedic crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The
  paramedics loaded the husband on to the stretcher and began   carrying
  him to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street
  accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the
  husband had burned himself.
  She told them, and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of
  them slipped and tipped the stretcher, dumping the husband out. He fell
  down
  the remaining stairs and broke his arm.
  
  (Taken from a Florida Newspaper)
  
  Having a bad day? Just remember, it could be worse.....
  
  A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen, shaking
  frantically with what looked like a wire running from his waist towards
  the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current
  she whacked him with a handy plank of wood by the back door, breaking
  his  arm in two places. Until that moment he had been happily listening to
  his Walkman!
  
     And finally.......
  Iraqi terrorist, Khay Rahnajet, didn't pay enough postage on a letter
  bomb. It came back with "Return to Sender" stamped on it.  Forgetting it
  was the bomb, he opened it and was blown to bits.
  Now, your day's not so bad, is it .........................? >>
 
 

	
	

  Young King Arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a 
   neighboring kingdom.  The monarch could have killed him, but was moved 
by 
   Arthur's youthful happiness. 
   So he offered him freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult 
   question.  Arthur would have a year to figure out the answer;  if, after 
a 
   year, he still had no  answer, he would be killed. 
   The question was: "What do women really want?"  Such a question would 
   perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and, to young Arthur, it seemed 
an 
   impossible query.  Since it was better than death, however, he accepted 
the 
   monarchs proposition to have an answer by year's end. 
   He returned to his kingdom and began to poll everybody: the princess, 
the 
   prostitutes, the priests, the wise men, the court jester.  In all, he 
spoke 
   with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer. What 
most 
   people did tell him, was to consult the old witch, as only she would 
know 
   the answer. The price would be high, since the witch was famous 
throughout 
   the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged. 
   The last day of the year arrived and Arthur had no alternative but to 
talk 
   to the witch. She agreed to answer his question, but he'd have to accept 
her 
   price first:  The old witch wanted to marry Gawain, the most noble of 
the 
   Knights of the Round Table and Arthur's closest friend! 
   Young Arthur was horrified: she was hunchbacked and awfully hideous, had 
   only one tooth, smelled like sewage water, often made obscene noises. He 
had 
   never run across such a repugnant creature.  He refused to force his 
friend 
   to marry her and have to endure such a burden. 
   Gawain, upon learning of the proposal, spoke with Arthur.  He told him 
that 
   nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to Arthur's life and the 
   preservation of the Round  Table.  Hence, their wedding was 
   proclaimed, and the witch  answered Arthur's question:  "What a woman 
really 
   wants is to be able to be in charge of her own life." 
   Everyone instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and 
that 
   Arthur's life would be spared.  And so it went. 
   The neighboring monarch spared Arthur's life and granted him total 
freedom. 
 What a wedding Gawain and the witch had! Arthur was torn between relief 
and 
   anguish.  Gawain was proper as always, gentle and courteous. The old 
witch 
   put her worst manners on display.  She ate with her hands, belched and 
passed 
   gas, and made everyone uncomfortable as ever. 
   The wedding night approached:  Gawain, steeling himself for a horrific 
   night, entered the bedroom.  What a sight awaited!  The most beautiful 
woman 
   he'd ever seen lay before him!  Gawain was astounded and asked what had 
   happened.  The beauty replied that since he  had been so kind to her 
(when 
   she was a witch), half the time she would  be her horrible, deformed 
self,and 
   the other half, she would be her beautiful maiden self.  Which would he 
want 
   her to be during the day and which during the night? 
   What a cruel question!  Gawain began to think of his predicament: 
   during the day a beautiful woman to show off to  his friends, but at 
night, 
   in the privacy of his home, an old spooky witch?  Or would he prefer 
having 
   by day  a hideous witch, but by night a beautiful  woman 
   to enjoy many intimate  moments? 

 What would you do? 

   What Gawain chose follows below, but don't read  until you've made your 
own 
   choice. 

   The Answer: * * 

   Noble Gawain replied that he would let her choose for herself. 

   Upon hearing this, she announced that she would  be beautiful all the 
time, 
   because he had respected her and had let her be in charge of her own 
life. 
   What is the moral of this story? 

   The moral is that it doesn't matter if your woman is pretty or ugly, 
smart or 
   dumb. Underneath it all, she's still a witch.

Breaking News : Transco's Sundance Project Gets Green Light 
posted 10:11 AM (CST) Mar 28, 2001 

Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line's $134 million Sundance expansion project was 
approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission today in a draft order 
issued at the Commission's regularly scheduled meeting. The looping and 
compression project will provide an additional 236,383 Dth/d of firm 
transportation capacity to the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.

About 38 miles of new pipeline along the company's existing mainline system 
will be installed along with modifications to existing compressor stations in 
Alabama, Georgia and North Carolina, according to the project plans. The 
project will go in service in the spring of 2002.

Robust economic growth in the Southeast and development of significant new 
gas-fired power generation were the main forces driving the expansion. 
Southern Co. and Carolina Power and Light (CP&L) agreed to purchase most of 
the capacity of the project. Southern purchased 140,000 Dth/d. CP&L signed up 
for 75 MMcf/d. CP&L also is planning to build a $100 million, 82-mile 
intrastate lateral downstream of Sundance between Iredell and Richmond 
counties in North Carolina. The 30-inch-diameter lateral would have an 
initial capacity of 200 MMcf/d with expansion capability up to 700 MMcf/d. 
  
 

Hi!

        Your not going to believe this but I just opened your email from a 
month ago.  Apparently I had so many at one time I thought I was seeing them 
all  but I wasn't.  It is (was) so good to hear from you!  I'm sorry about 
all the problems PG&E has had but I hope it hasn't dampened your spirits to 
much.  It will all work out in the end.  Dick & I are still here.  We were 
not smart and only sold about a third of our Enron stock when the price was 
above eighty so we have just been riding it down.  I guess we will be here 
for awhile.  I'm glad you got your house done - that is such a good feeling.  
We only have a few things left to do inside.  Then we get to start on the 
backyard and patio.  It never ends!  We had a very mild winter and it is just 
starting to get warm - I'm already dreading the heat.  I hope you can find a 
place to do ceramics.  I used to go with my mom every Saturday when I lived 
in Omaha.  At first I just went to spend time with her but I ended up really 
enjoying it - very relaxing.  I was very slow - in the year I was there I 
only finished two projects.  I still display them proudly on the appropriate 
holiday.  Are you going home for Easter?  This Friday I am going to have 
nasal surgery - something I have been putting off for years.  I am not 
looking forward to it.  Once again this highly predictable market is moving 
so I better go!  Take care and I'll try to call you when I get back from R&R .
Sorry it took so long to write!

Hi!  Do you still have all the notes I gave you on how we should break this 
out?  This is the deal from hell!  Thanks.

I had Lee ann Chance reallocate the volumes for Louis Dreyfus and we still 
could not come up with the $ totals Louis Dreyfus invoiced us for. So I had 
Carla McLaughlin of Louis Dreyfus fax me the files they used to calculate 
their invoice on these deals. Please review the attached files and let me 
know if this is the way this deal should be calculated. Thank you.

The article just discussed on CNNfn.

Has unify been changed?  I thought you told me a couple of weeks ago that 
everything had been changed.  Please let me know - thanks!

I still do not see this adjustment in Unify. What is the status?
	
	

Have these deals been corrected in Unify? Please let me know. Thank you.

This is incorrect.  I started in 1976 -  I believe in June.  Please recheck.

                                                               Thank You!

	
	

Taking a break from their first day of work, George W Bush and Dick Cheney  
go out to a restaurant near the White House.  
The waitress comes over and asks them what they would like. 
Dick orders the "Heart-Healthy" salad. 
The waitress turns to Dubya and asks him, "What would you like, Mr.  
President?" 
"I'd like a quickie." 
The waitress is shocked and astonished. In a huff, she exclaims, "I thought 
you were going to bring a new era of moral rectitude to the White House! 
Now I see that you, like all politicians, were lying! I'm sorry I ever voted 
for you!" and storms off. 
Bush sits there, stunned for a moment. 
Then Cheney leans over and says, "George, I think it's pronounced QUICHE."

 ?IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND LIFE, JUST ASK THE KIDS 

A mother was preparing pancakes for her sons, Kevin, 5, and Ryan, 3. The  
boys began to argue over who would get the first pancake. Their mother saw  
the opportunity for a moral lesson. 
"If Jesus were sitting here, He would say, "Let my brother have the first  
pancake. I can ?wait." Kevin turned to his younger brother and said, "Ryan,  
you be Jesus.

A father was at the beach with his children when his four-year-old son ran  
up to him, grabbed his hand, and led him to the shore, where a seagull lay  
dead in the sand. 
"Daddy, what happened to him?" the son asked. "He died and went to Heaven,"  
the dad replied. 
The boy thought a moment and then said, ?"Did God throw him back down?" 

???____________________ 

After the church service a little boy told the pastor, "When I grow up, I'm  
going to give you some money." "Well, thank you," the pastor replied, "but  
why?" "Because my daddy says you're one of the poorest preachers we've ever  
had." 

?____________________ 

A wife invited some people to dinner. At the table, she turned to their  
six-year-old daughter and said, Would you like to say the blessing?" "I  
wouldn't know what to say," ?the girl replied. "Just say what you hear Mommy  
say," the wife answered. 
The daughter bowed her head and said, "Lord, why on earth did I invite all  
these people to dinner?" 

?____________________ 

A mother was teaching her three-year-old The Lord's Prayer. For several  
evenings at bedtime, the child repeated it after the mother. Then one night  
the child was ready to solo. 
The mother listened with pride to the carefully enunciated words, right up  
to the end. 
"And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us some e-mail"... 

?____________________ 

A little boy opened the big and old family Bible with fascination, and  
looked at the old pages as he turned them. Suddenly, something fell out of  
the Bible, and he picked it up and looked at it ?closely. It was an old leaf  
from a tree that had been pressed in between the pages. "Momma,  
look what I found," the boy called out. "What have you got there, dear?" his  
mother asked. 
With astonishment in the young boy's voice, he answered: "I think it's  
Adam's suit!" 

?____________________ 

Six-year-old Angie and her four-year-old brother Joel were sitting together  
in church. 
Joel giggled, sang, and talked out loud. ?Finally, his big sister had enough. 
"You're not supposed to talk out loud in church." "Why? Who's going to stop  
me?" Joel asked. 
Angie pointed to the back of the church and said, "See those two men  
standing by the door?  
They're hushers."

A father was reading Bible stories to his young son. He read, "The man named  
Lot was warned to take his wife and flee out of the city, but his wife 
looked  
back and was turned to salt." 
His son asked, "What happened to the flea?" 

?____________________ 

A three-year-old boy went with his dad to see a litter of kittens. On  
returning home, he breathlessly informed his mother,"There were 2 boy 
kittens  
and ?2 girl kittens." 
"How did you know?" his mother asked. "Daddy picked them up and looked  
underneath," he replied. "I think it's printed on the bottom." 

?____________________ 

Another three-year-old put his shoes on by himself. His mother noticed that  
the left shoe ?was on the right foot. She said, "Son, your shoes are on the  
wrong feet." 
He looked up at her with a raised brow and said, "Don't kid me, Mom. They're  
the only ?feet I got!."

On the first day of school, about midmorning, the kindergarten teacher said,  
"If anyone has to go to the bathroom, hold up two fingers." A little voice  
from the back of the ?room asked, "How will that help?"

A mother and her young son returned from the grocery store and began putting  
away the groceries. The boy opened the box of animal crackers and spread 
them  
all over the table. 
"What are you doing?" his mother asked. "The box says not to eat them if the  
seal is broken" the boy explained. "I'm looking for the seal."

An elderly woman and her little grandson, whose face 
was sprinkled 
with bright freckles, spent the day at the zoo. ?Lots 
of children 
were waiting in line to get their cheeks painted by a 
local artist 
who was decorating them with tiger paws. 

"You've got so many freckles, there's no place to 
paint!" a girl in 
the line said to the little fella. 

Embarrassed, the little boy dropped his head. His 
grandmother knelt 
down next to him. "I love your freckles. When I was a 
little girl I 
always wanted freckles," she said, while tracing her 
finger across 
the child's cheek. "Freckles are beautiful." 

The boy looked up, "Really?" 

"Of course," said the grandmother. "Why just name me 
one thing that's 
prettier than freckles." 

The little boy thought for a moment, peered intensely 
into his 
grandma's face, and softly whispered, "Wrinkles."

Hi!

           Rod Banks at Mariner Energy, Inc. requested I send you a note to 
confirm that for the month of January, 2001,  Enron did not purchase any of 
Mariner's interest in Garden Banks 236.  Enron did have a nomination in place 
for 1MMBtu/d and was allocated 42MMBtu.  This nomination was an error.  Enron 
and Mariner would like to have this reallocated to Mariner's current 
purchaser.  Please call me at (713) 853 - 5775 if this would be a problem.

Hi!

               I submitted the claim by mail earlier this week - this is the 
third claim in a row I have had to send more than once.  I have only 
submitted three in the last several years and have had problems with all of 
them.

                                                                              
      Thanks for listening!

I resubmitted the claim by mail and have not heard anything  -  the service I 
have received from the customer service department in the last six months has 
been terrible - one delay after another  - lost claims.  It is very 
frustrating.  I will let you know when I get a response.  

                                                                              
                                                                Thank you!

This is wonderful - thanks for the memories!  Love ya! 

Beverly -  once again thanks so much for your help on this.

?????????????PAKISTAN HOLIDAY VACATION 

?????A married couple were on holiday vacation in Pakistan. They were 
?????touring around the marketplace looking 
?????at the goods and such, when they passed this small sandal shop. From 
?????inside they heard a gentleman with a Pakistani accent say, 
?????You foreigners! Come in. Come indo my humble shop." 

?????So the married couple walked in. The Pakistani man said to them, "I 
?????have some special sandals I tink you would be interested in. Dey make 
?????you wild at sex like a great desert camel." 

?????While, the wife was really interested in buying the sandals after what 
?????the man claimed, her husband felt he really didn't need them, being 
?????the sex god that he was. 

?????The husband asked the man, "How could sandals make you into a sex 
?????freak?" 

?????The Pakistani man replied, "Just try dem on, Saiheeb." 

?????The husband, after much badgering from his wife, finally conceded to 
?????try them on. As soon as he slipped them onto his feet, he got this 
?????wild look in his eyes; something his wife hadn't seen in many years-- 
?????raw sexual power. 

?????In the blink of an eye, the husband grabbed the Pakistani man, bent 
?????him over a table and yanked down his 
?????pants. He then ripped down his own pants and grabbed a firm hold of 
?????the Pakistani. 

?????The Pakistani then began screaming, 
?????"YOU HAVE DEM ON DE WRONG FEET!"

Hi!

            The sitara deal # is 527410.

                                 Hope this helps!

I THINK THIS IS THE SAME GUY WE HAD IN OMAHA - HE WAS VERY ENTERTAINING WITH 
SOLID INFORMATION.

Hi, ladies,  I just finished taking the most amazing self-defense
class, sponsored by Shandwick, and I wanted to share some really 
valuable info with you before it goes out of my head.  The guy 
who taught the class has a female friend who was attacked last 
year in the parking garage at Westport Plaza in St. Louis one 
night after work and taken to an abandoned house and raped.  
He started a women's group and began teaching these classes
soon after. This guy is a black belt in karate and trains twice 
a year with Steven Segall. He and the  others in this group 
interviewed a bunch of rapists and date rapists in  prison on 
what they look for and here's some interesting facts:

The #1 thing men look for in a potential victim is hairstyle.  
They are most likely to go after a woman with a ponytail, bun, 
braid or other hairstyle that can easily be grabbed.  They are 
also likely to go after a woman with long hair. Women with short 
hair are not common targets.  

The second thing men look for is clothing.  They will look for 
women who's clothing is easy to remove quickly.  The #1 outfit 
they look for is overalls because many of them carry scissors 
around to cut clothing and on overalls the straps can be easily cut.

They also look for women on their cell phone, searching through their
purse or doing other activities while walking because they are off
guard and can be easily overpowered.

The time of day men are most likely to attack and rape a woman is
in the early morning, between 5 and 8:30 a.m. The number one place 
women are abducted from/attacked at is grocery store parking lots. 
Number two is office parking lots/garages. Number three is public 
rest rooms.

The thing about these men is that they are looking to grab a woman
and quickly move her to a second location where they don't have to
worry about getting caught.  Only 2% said they carried weapons 
because rape carries a 3-5 year sentence but rape with a weapon 
is 15-20 years. If you put up any kind of a fight at all, they get 
discouraged because it only takes a minute or two for them to 
realize that going after you isn't worth it because it will be 
time-consuming. 

These men said they will not pick on women who have umbrellas, 
or other similar objects that can be used from a distance, in
their hands.  Keys are not a deterrent because you have to get 
really close to the attacker to use them as a weapon.  So, the 
idea is to convince these guys you're not worth it. 
Several defense mechanisms he taught us are:

* If someone is following behind you on a street or in a garage
  or with you in an elevator or stairwell, look them in the face 
  and ask them a question, like what time is it, or make general 
  small talk, I can't believe it is so cold out here, we're in 
  for a bad winter.  Now you've seen their face and could identify
  them in a lineup, you lose appeal as a target.

* If someone is coming toward you, hold out your hands in front 
  of you and yell Stop or Stay back!  Most of the rapists this man
  talked to said they'd leave a woman alone if she yelled or showed 
  that she would not be afraid to fight back.  Again, they are 
  looking for an EASY target.  If you carry pepper spray (this 
  instructor was a huge advocate of it and carries it with him 
  wherever he goes), yelling I HAVE PEPPER SPRAY and holding it
  out will be a deterrent.

* If someone grabs you, you can't beat them with strength but you
  can by outsmarting them. If they grab your wrist, pull your wrist
  back so your hand is in waving position (palm facing forward) and
  twist it toward yourself and pull your arm away. It is hard to 
  hold onto wrist bones that are moving in that way. They stumble 
  toward you and you stumble back, so you can use that momentum to 
  bring the same out and backhand them with your knuckles in the 
  forehead, nose or teeth.

* If you are grabbed around the waist from behind, pinch the attacker
  either under the arm between the elbow and armpit or in the upper
  inner thigh. HARD. One woman in a class this guy taught told him 
  she used the underarm pinch on a guy who was trying to date rape her
  and was so upset she broke through the skin and tore out muscle 
  strands - the guy needed stitches.
  Try pinching yourself in those places as hard as you can stand it.
  It hurts.

* After the initial hit, always go for the groin. I know from a
  particularly unfortunate experience that if you slap a guy's balls 
  (sorry to be graphic) it is extremely painful. You might think that 
  you'll piss the guy off and make him want to hurt you more, but the 
  thing these rapists told our instructor is that they want a woman 
  who will not cause a lot of trouble.
  Start causing trouble and he's out of there.

* When the guy puts his hands up to you, grab his first two fingers
  and bend them back as far as possible with as much pressure pushing 
  down on them as possible. The instructor did it to me without using 
  much pressure and I ended up on my knees and both knuckles cracked 
  audibly.

Of course the things we always hear still apply.  Always be aware of
your surroundings, take someone with you if you can and if you see 
any odd behavior, don't dismiss it, go with your instincts. You may 
feel a little silly at the time, but you'd feel much worse if the guy 
really was trouble.

Please forward this to any woman you know, it's simple stuff that
could save her life.

Elizabeth,

           Sorry it took me so long to respond to you - use the prices 
Altrade is indicating - I probably just wrote them down incorrectly.  I have 
found in past experiences with discrepencies that Altrade is usually correct 
and this is not a large amount in question.

                                                                              
                                                             Thank You!

Sorry,
    

                    I changed the deal ticket to $10.50.

Each quarter I will evaluate the classes (mainly attendance) to see how well 
they are performing.  Then I will be able to make adjustments to the schedule 
accordingly.  Our goal is to get people to try new things and not just go 
back to what they did before.  We have spent a lot of time and money getting 
brand new weights, spinning bikes and cardio equipment in here and want you 
all to have a chance to try it out.  Just give this schedule a try for a 
while when we open and keep me posted with your feedback.  Thanks!

Ann, do you think if there is not as many people participating in the 
spinning classes at lunch, you would offer additional spinning classes in the 
evening?  I noticed there is a spinning class offered every day at lunch but 
only one class offered in the evening.   There  are numerous people who were 
hoping to enjoy spinning two times a week but due to our work environment we 
are only able to work out in the evenings, period.     In addition,  we were 
hoping to do Bootcamp the other two remaining evenings, which looks like 
right now it is only offered on Monday and previously it was offered both 
Monday and  Wednesday.   

Is it possible that  if you do not have very much participation for the 
"total body conditioning class"  on Tuesday & Thursday you could replace it 
with another spin class and another bootcamp class.    Or maybe the "total 
body conditioning class" could be moved to  Monday and Wednesday and then it 
would free up the studio to have Bootcamp on Tuesday & Thrusday.   Then if 
you hopefully add another spin class you could insert it on Monday so you 
would be offering an evening spin class both Monday and Wednesday.   That 
would be wonderful.    

Also do you think before the spin class (s) in the evening  an "ab lab" class 
could be added before the beginning of class like at 5:30 pm?   

Any feedback you have would be great.   For a lot of us who have to work-out 
in the evenings only we hoping to be able to at least do a spin class  
acouple of times and then a boot camp a couple of times.     If  there is 
enough particiaption for this do you know how long it will take to get set 
up?   

Thank you for all of you help, comments or suggestons.

A beautiful woman loved growing tomatoes, but couldn't seem to get her 
tomatoes to turn red. One day while taking a stroll she came upon a 
gentleman neighbor who had the most beautiful garden full of huge red 
tomatoes. 

The woman asked the gentleman, "What do you do to get your tomatoes so 
red?" The gentleman responded, "Twice a day I stand in front of my tomato 
garden and expose myself, and my tomatoes turn red from blushing so much." 

 The woman was so impressed, she decided to try doing the same 
 thing to her tomato garden to see if it would work. So twice a day for two 
weeks she exposed herself to her garden hoping for the best 

  One day the gentleman was passing by and asked the woman, "By the way, 
How did you make out? Did your tomatoes turn red?" 

"No" she replied, "but my cucumbers are enormous!" 

Hi!

            You must have ESP!  Last night I told Dick I needed to call  and 
see how you were and what you were doing for Christmas.  We have to work on 
the 26th (even though it's an ENE holiday) so we would have to come back on 
Christmas day if we went home.    We decided to stay in Houston.  I'm so glad 
you are going home but to tell the truth I feel like you do about traveling 
during the holidays.  Nothing new with us - just about finished decorating 
the house but sometimes I think I'll never get done.   I have not bought a 
thing for Dick yet - still do not know what to get him!  I guess I'll be one 
of those crazies out shopping on Christmas Eve.  We went home for 
Thanksgiving and I caught a cold that I'm just now getting over.  Will you be 
coming to Houston in the near future?  If you do you are more than welcome to 
stay with us while your here - we would love to have you!  Better go but 
let's meet like this more often!  Take care and have a very Merry Christmas!

Please plan to attend a meeting to discuss PSEG, Intra Day Option. The 
meeting will be on Monday, December 18 @ 4:00 PM in conference room EB 3243b.

To all,

             If you would like to contribute towards a gift for Scott Neal 
and/or Kimberly Brown, please drop your contribution by my desk.  Would like 
to collect $20 for each but any amount would be appreciated.  I will take a 
check and would like to receive by Tuesday!  Thanks in advance!   

Hi!

                 These sales to Torch are valid.  Accounting is going to 
correct.  If you do not see this happen soon - please let me know.

                                 
                                                                              
                                Thank You!

this is cute.  

  Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting ready for his annual
  trip...but there were problems everywhere. Four of his elves got sick, and
  the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so
  Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule.

  Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming to visit. This stressed
  Santa even more.

  When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were
  about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven
  knows where. More Stress.

  Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the boards cracked and the
  toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys.

  Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a
  shot of whiskey. When he went to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit
  the liquor and there was nothing to drink. In his frustration, he dropped
  the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the
  kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the
  straw it was made from.

  Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed on his way to the door.

  He opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas
  tree.

  The angel said: "Where would you like to put this tree fat man?"

  And that my friend, is how the little angel came to be on top of the
  Christmas tree.

A Preacher wanted to raise money for his church, and being told that there 
was a fortune in Horse Racing, he decided to purchase a horse and enter him 
in the race.  However, at the local auction the going price for horses was  
so steep that he ended up buying a Donkey instead.  He figured that since he  
had it, he might as well go ahead and enter it in the races, and to his  
surprise, the Donkey came in third. 

The  next day the racing form carried this headline, "Preacher's Ass shows". 
The Preacher was so pleased with the  Donkey that he entered it in the race 
again, and this time it won.  The next day the form said, "Preacher's Ass, 
out in front!"

The Bishop was so upset with this kind of publicity, that he ordered the 
Preacher not to enter the Donkey in another race.  The newspaper printed 
this headline; "Bishop scratches Preacher's Ass." 

This was just too much for the Bishop, and he ordered the Preacher to get rid 
of the animal. The Preacher decided to give it to a Nun in a nearby convent. 
The headline next day read, "Nun has the best Ass in town." 

The Bishop fainted. He informed the Nun that she would have to  
dispose of the Donkey. She finally found a Farmer who was willing to buy 
it for $10. Next day the paper said, "Nun peddles her Ass for ten bucks." 
They buried the Bishop the next day.

Hi!

              Are we still on for dinner?

Hi!

                   Juniper is an Enron owned company that seeks and finds new 
wellhead production and sells it to ENA (in most cases).  The Koch Midstream 
gas  Joe nominates is on a lateral that can only be delivered into Tennessee 
Pipeline which is a East Desk Pipeline - I believe the Texas desk asked that 
we be respnsible for this volume.  I hope this helps!  Sorry it took so long 
to get  back to you!

Hi!

             I gave his resume to Scott Neal.  He is going to look at it and 
pass it on to the appropriate people.  It looks like his backround includes 
more origination experience than trading.  

                                                                            
Take care!

Ok-I know you are probably mad at me because I have not contacted you since 
I've been here.  Believe me it is not because I haven't thought of you.  I 
thought for sure I'd run into you somewhere in the building but never have.  
Anyway I'm sending you a note to tell you to be on the look out for an 
invitation to a Nebraska Football party we are having on the 11th.  I am 
putting it in the interoffice mail this morning.  Hope you can make it.  

Dana 

Thanks for the invite but we already have plans for the game.   Hope you have 
a good time and Nebraska wins!

Hi!

          It's great to hear from you!  I am so happy you are back at Enron.  
I would love to go to dinner with you and Cindy and catch up.  It's hard for 
me to go to lunch these days due to EOL.  They bring lunch in everyday and we 
generally stay in to run our products.  Just let me know when & where you two 
can meet.  Maybe we can do it soon and  celebrate the upcoming  holiday 
season!  Take care!

                                                                              
                                                      Andy

This will make your day!

Hi!

         Sandra Brawner trades the Gas Daily Finantial products for the Gulf 
Coast.  She will be on vacation tomorrow and has asked me to run these 
products for her.  I need to be able to manage these products.  I can already 
manage the Henry Hub (Griff Gray set this up for me).  Please call if you 
have any questions.  Thanks for your help! 

Hopefully this will cheer you ( just a little)!

Just it case it is true!

I didn't see where Lucille sent this to you and I wanted to make sure you
knew about it.  Please tell everyone you can--especially my nieces.

 
Dont know if this is true...but with everything going on...its better to

I checked this out at an urban legend site and I found no evidence
of this being a hoax.. I pray it is.. However, just as a precaution.

Laura lives near L.A. and tells me that to the best of her knowledge 
this is true; however, it could still be a hoax, it's up to you if 
you take it to heart or not. 
 
Peggy 
 
All, My friend Megan here at work called the lady at the end of the
email who confirmed that this is a legit email....she's very skeptical
as well but decided to send it anyway.....SCARY, HUH....Mon 

 
I called and emailed the creator of this message and it is true.
Thanks,
Megan 
 
 
FYI - I was very skeptical of this e-mail so I called the telephone
number and it really was Laura Katsis at work.  She said that she did 
write and send the e-mail in reaction to what her girlfriend told her.
This could still be a hoax, but I am taking it a little more seriously 
knowing that Laura is a real person who admits writing the e-mail and 
who stands behind what she wrote. ----- Forwarded by Lisa Kent/US/Fabtech

Hi All - 

I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the
reactionary thing and send out anything that crosses my path. This
one, however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough
credibility in my mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to
all of you. 

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a
month ago.
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up.  She was
understandably upset and went to his home to find it completely
emptied.
On 9/10, she received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he
wished he could tell her why he had left and that he was sorry it
had to be like that.  The part worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her
not to get on any commercial airlines on 9/11 and to not to go any malls
on Halloween.  As soon as everything happened on the 11th, she called
the FBI and has since turned over the letter. 

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on. This
came from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last
night. 
 
I may be wrong, and I hope I am.  However, with one of his warnings
being correct and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the
second and wanted to make sure that people I cared about had the same
information that I did.

Dear Supplier:

Dominion Energy Consulting is the Fuel Manager and Agent for E.R. Carpenter Co..
We  are soliciting supply offers from your company on the attached load profiles
for  the  term  period  November 1, 2001 through March 31, 2002.   We understand
each  supplier  cannot  serve  all locations, so bid only on those where you are
competitive.

Your  offers should include Full Firm Requirements NYMEX basis to the City Gate.
The  location  and  LDC  is  included with each plant

 Hi!
            The sitara deal # is 1068979.
                                        
                                                   Thanks!

Andy,

Please forward the deal number(s) for the Oct Nymex match-ups - thanks !

Andy, I have completed negotiation with TBG on the Settlement.  TBG has exe=
cuted the documents and Louise and John have approved the deal.  In short, =
I want to make sure that you understand the effect on you.  Attached is a m=
ore detailed summary but generally I removed all swing flexibility from the=
 deal.  They have baseload obligations of 12,500 MMBtu per day.  We can del=
iver at any of the delivery points identified in the Agreement ( I will giv=
e you a copy of the Agreements) however the primary delivery point is Stati=
on 65.  That is the location for all price settlements.  If we delivery at =
an alternate location we receive additional basis differentials for moving =
downstream ( Station 85 )  and we pay the basis differential for moving ups=
tream ( Sta 45, 30 ). TBG has the right to move our deliveries back to Sta =
65 at anytime, if we are delivering at alternate locations. I want to check=
 with you one more time before I execute the final documents.  I think that=
 this is a great trade for ENA if I do say so myself.  My next effort is to=
 clear up any issues with Trigen.

Hi Susan, 

             I have not really been MIA just taking some time off.  I received an offer to trade for UBS which I have accepted. Our desk will be very small to start out.  Brad did not accept his offer and is moving to Kansas City to work for Aquila.  Pete quit before he was made an offer to work for a bank in New York City.  I am so happy for him.  All that is left are me, Scott, Judy (working full-time), Chuck, Sandra and Jon McKay.  Scott wants to trade all the points we were trading before so it should be interesting.  He is going to trade the Hub physical and financial.  Judy and I are going to split up everything else. Chuck is going to trade market area.  Frank Vickers, Jared and Craig are all that is left of origination.  Jared had a baby girl on Thursday.  Her name is Kendall Gill (do not know where the Gill came from)  and everyone is doing fine.How are you doing?  

Andy

Hi, Andy!  Are you still around there?  I  had reports that you were MIA.  How's the UBS thing going?  I heard  some folks have already quit and some were laid off.  Are you  OK???
 
Susan

Yes - I received it last week.

Pls confirm that you have received your new WCom calling card.   Thank you.

	Andy - I have not been willing to give up the wheel chair because I have been told twice in the past two (2) years that certain signs regarding my health could be early signs of M.S.  I do not accept this I think its stress but who knows.  I have not told the kids or Bob.  I would appreciate it you didn't either so please don't telling anyone else.  Love You - Mish

Hi!=20

         Sorry it has taken so long to respond but I took a few days of vac=
ation.  Happy New Year to you too and I hope it is a better year for all of=
 us.  Today they announced that UBS Warburg has purchased the trading compa=
ny.  This is good news except we do not know any information about how the =
company will be structured so I still do not know if I will have a job.  Th=
is is stressful because it has been going on for so long.  I wish something=
 would happen good or bad.  Originally I thought this would be a terrible t=
hing to not have a job at Enron or in the energy sector but as time goes on=
 I have come to think maybe it would just force us to do something else wit=
h our lives.  Something we have thought about for a long time. It is a trag=
edy that after 25 years of service we will get no severance.  I feel so sad=
 for all those people who lost everything including a job.  Dick has been r=
etained as a key employee for EES to help close down the business so his jo=
b will eventually end.  We have no time frame for him.  Hope everything is =
going well for you and your family.  Take care!

Hi Andy,  Just wanted to tell you Happy New Year and that I hope you and Di=
ck are doing ok with all that's been going on.  It's been a tough couple of=
 months hasn't it?  Are you guys ok job wise?  I've been thinking about you=
.  Let's hope 2002 is a better year!!

Read each sentence slowly and think about it.

Love starts with a smile, grows with a kiss, and ends
with a tear.

Don't cry over anyone who won't cry over you.

Good friends are hard to find, harder to leave, and
impossible to forget.

You can only go as far as you push.

Actions speak louder than words.

The hardest thing to do is watch the one you love,
love somebody else.

Don't let the past hold you back, you're missing the
good stuff.

Life's short. If you don't look around once in a while
you might miss it.

A BEST FRIEND is like a four leaf clover, HARD TO FIND
and LUCKY TO HAVE.

Some people make the world SPECIAL just by being in
it.

BEST FRIENDS are the siblings God forgot to give us.

When it hurts to look back, and you're scared to look
ahead, you can look beside you and your BEST FRIEND
will
be there.

TRUE FRIENDSHIP "NEVER" ENDS. Friends are FOREVER.

Good friends are like stars....You don't always see
them, but you know they are always there.

Don't frown. You never know who is falling in love
with
your smile.

What do you do when the only person who can make you
stop crying is the person who made you cry?

Nobody is perfect until you fall in love with them.

Everything is okay in the end. If it's not okay, then
it's not the end.

Most people walk in and out of your life, but only
friends leave footprints in your heart.

Send this on to everyone special in your life, even
the
people who really make you mad sometimes and to the
people whose lives you want to be in!!!

And send it back to the person who sent it too you
if they mean something to you !!

Remember, every minute spent angry is sixty seconds of
happiness wasted.

AWESOME PRAYER:
May today there be peace within you. May you trust
God
that you are exactly where you are meant to be. "I
believe that friends are quiet angels who lift us to
our
feet when our wings have trouble remembering how to
fly."

Just send this to (4) people and see what happens on
the
fourth day. Do not break this, please. There is no
cost,
but lots of rewards.

 

Hi!
     
        Sorry it took so long to respond but I took a couple of days off.  Tuesday is fine for dinner - looking forward to it.  It looks like UBS Warburg is our new owner.  We do not have any information yet from our management so I can't tell you any more about the structure of the company.  Hopefully I'll know more by Tuesday.  Let me know what time on Tuesday. Maybe we could eat somewhere closer to the loop since we only work until around 3:00 right now and you are out that way and Cindy has to go that way.
                       
Hey Andy,
 
I talked to Cindy and next week Tuesday sounds good  to her.  How about Ruggles again?  Let me know.

Hi Steve,
             
                I spoke to Jeff Hodge this morning. Jeff asked that I provide to you the pipeline contracts we will need to put into place for the East Trading desk as soon as possible after  we find out who is going to buy us.  As expected the pipelines would only provide us will shell sgreements but we would like to get a step ahead by having legal review them so we can hopefully turn them around quickly when credit is established with the new entity.  You should receive them this afternoon.  I am at X35775.

                                                                                                                    Thank you!

Per our verbal discussion of Friday January 4, I requested 2000MMBtu/d of storage gas for the period January 5-7 to serve an existing market on Florida Pipeline. Ragan Bond at Bridgeline informed me that my request would be denied.  ENA needed to purchase pre-paid gas from Sequent to fulfill the market's request for additional supplies.  ENA did not attempt to schedule the delivery of gas out of storage after Bridgeline informed me they would not perform on our request because we would have needed to request the customer to submitt a nomination for a delivery that would not be confirmed.  Please let me know if you need additional information concerning this transaction.

Hi Aunt Mary and Uncle Bob,  

            Sorry it has taken me so long to write.  Life is not good here at Enron.  I have been asked to stay on until the company I work for is sold.  I have been told I will be a part of the new company in it's proposed format.  Many things can change between now and then and I am very skeptical as the company has told so many lies to so many people.  It was so sad the day they let all those people go.  I felt sad and guilty because I still had a job.  Dick's company has basically been shut down.  He was asked to stay on as a key person to help close down the business.  His job will eventually end but we have no time frame.  I know you are probably wondering about our financial situation.  We had sold all our Enron stock in our 401K some time ago so we have done ok.
             It is so wonderful that you will get to see everyone sometime during the holidays.  Please tell them hello and MERRY CHRISTMAS.  It sounds like everyone is doing well.  Michele is disappointed we are not coming home for Christmas but Dick is on call and he wants to work as long as possible.  He keeps saying he is going to retire but I think he will get bored and end up going back to work especially if I am still working.  I wish I could say more but for so long now our lives have been consumed with being part of the biggest bankrupcy in history and it has become very depressing.  Take care.

All our love.

P.S.  Next time I write I promise to be more upbeat.
Dear Andy, 
Have been reading about the troubles at Enron, hope this hasn't affected your job. 
Are you and Dick going to Omaha for Christmas? Lisa, Billy and Madison will be here on the 23rd and stay for about a week. Steve, Lenora and the boys can't come until the week after Christmas. It's a very busy time of year for Steve, at work.  
Lori, Jeff and their families will be here as usual. 
Did you have a good Thanksgiving? We had a nice quiet day, just Lori, Jeff and their families. Lisa and Billy stayed in Austin this year as it has been a very busy football season for them. 
Jeff and Marsha are back together and seem to be getting along very well. They got a new puppy last week. It's an 11 week old female, yellow Labrador. They named her Gypsy. She is really cute but is going to get pretty big. Oh well, not my problem. 
Hope this finds you and Dick doing well. 
Love, Aunt Mary Lou 
P.S. Uncle Bob sends his love. 
P.P.S. Come see us anytime!!!! 

Hi!

       It is so nice to hear from you!  I am trying not to think of all that is going on here - but it is not fun.  Seeing you next week,  however, will be.
Would you have any free time to go to lunch or dinner maybe on Wednesday?

                                                                                Let me know - sorry for the delay in responding I just opened your note.
 	
Hey Andy,

How are you?  I saw Stephanie a couple of weeks ago in Napa and asked about
you.  Then, I meant to send you a note before now, but better late than
never.  I've been thinking of all of you this week, and hoping that
everything is going ok.  I remember what it is like to have your company the
focus of lots of analyst and media attention, and I hope it turns out fine
you all there.

I don't have any news to tell.  I am doing good, enjoying a beautiful fall
here, but not looking forward to winter.  I may be coming down to the
Nutcracker Market in a couple weeks.  Any chance that you will be there?

Susan

Re: Organizational Changes

Over the last several quarters, EES has successfully implemented a number o=
f new business models, organizational structures and processes.  The result=
 has been tremendous customer contracting in the U.S., Canada and Western E=
urope in 2001.  In all cases, EES's large consumer market share has expande=
d and we have rapidly increased our market penetration in the small consume=
r market - Enron Direct.  This effort, in itself is impressive, especially =
given that at the same time, EES has had to significantly restructure and r=
e-tool its execution capabilities, systems and mid and back offices.  I can=
 assure you that these processes, systems and capabilities are improving.  =
This is only the result of a lot of hard work from back to front across EES=
, EES risk and Enron Networks.

In that light, I am pleased to announce a number of organizational changes =
which demonstrate our continued commitment to the European market and the c=
reation of a new exciting channel in the Enron Direct USA business.

A)=09EES Europe:

Effective immediately, Sean Holmes will be moving to London to manage EES E=
urope.  We believe that Sean has the broad based experience in the EES busi=
ness model, products, retail energy risk management and demand side managem=
ent to take the European business to next level. Charlie Crossley-Cooke wil=
l manage our small consumer (Enron Direct) franchise.  This franchise has c=
ontinued to grow, in the UK and on the continent, and has provided signific=
ant income to EES in 2001. Enron Direct will also continue to provide mid a=
nd back office services to EES Europe. Paul Turner will manage our large co=
nsumer business in Western Europe.  Paul will be replacing Stuart Rexrode w=
ho will be returning to EES in Houston.  Over the last few quarters, our pe=
netration of this market, primarily in the UK, has grown dramatically with =
completed contracts with Sainsbury, Guiness, Kraft and Pirelli.  Many of th=
ese transactions include gas, power and demand side management.  We would l=
ike to thank Stuart for all his hard work toward the continued growth of th=
e European franchise.

We are also pleased to announce the formation of the European Product Group=
 led by Roy Poyntz.  This group will lead the development of new products a=
nd services for both the large and small consumer markets.  As in North Ame=
rica, its main role will be to ensure viable and innovative products are co=
ntinually available in the pipeline to ensure the continued growth of the E=
uropean business. The Product Group will also ensure product diversity betw=
een gas, power and energy efficiency products.  We continue to be committed=
 to the development of the demand side management aspects of our business t=
o differentiate us from our competitors. On a final note, the EES Europe co=
mmodity structuring and DSM groups will now report to Sean in addition to C=
harlie, Paul and Roy.=20

As part of this change, Deb Merrill will be assuming the lead role in Deal =
Management in EES USA replacing Sean.  Deb has been an integral part of EES=

Effective immediately, Stuart Rexrode will manage this new sales channel in=
side Enron Direct USA.  Stuart will be building this new more sophisticated=
 agent selling channel by creating franchise like relationships with numero=

 the mass market agents but provide a more sophisticated agent in front of =
larger clients in order to sell higher value products that include gas, pow=

Rogers,

Enron Energy Services, Inc. ("EESI") submitted application to become a NEPO=
OL member, to be effective January 1, 2000.  EESI was approved by the NEPOO=
L Participants Membership Subcommittee at its January 24, 2000 meeting.  On=
e requirement of NEPOOL membership is to satisfy the Financial Assurance Po=
licy for NEPOOL Members.  EESI, Enron Energy Marketing Corp, and Enron Powe=
r Marketing, Inc. are all members of NEPOOL and have chosen to satisfy the =
Financial Assurance Policy by issuance of Performance Bond(s), rather than =
corporate guaranty, due to Enron's disagreement with the Form of Corporate =
Guaranty required by NEPOOL.

EESI, via Fireman's Fund Insurance Company, issued a Performance Bond in th=
e amount of $8,000,000 in June 2000; the Performance Bond was reissued in J=
une 2001 in the amount of $8,000,000.  EESI received a letter from ISO New =
England dated October 10, 2001, addressed to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements)=
 and received by Becky probably October 12, 2001, indicating that EESI's cu=
rrent Performance Bond was insufficient and that EESI needed to increase th=
e amount to $11,703,018.75 to cover EESI's current activity level.  Becky d=
elivered the October 10th letter  to my attention whereby I took the letter=
 to EESI Legal Department (Karen Cordova) and informed Karen that EESI need=
ed to increase the Performance Bond to $20,000,000.  Karen requested Credit=
 Department (Nichole Gunter) initiate an increase in the Performance Bond t=
o the $20,000,000 level; to the best of my knowledge the initial conversati=
on with Credit Department was October 12, 2001.  In telephone conversations=
 with ISO-NE, Enron's Credit Department personnel were informed by ISO-NE t=
hat in order to avoid Financial Assurance Default the matter needed to be r=
esolved within ten (10) days of the date of the October 10, 2001 letter (Oc=
tober 19, 2001), however the letter did not indicate such.=20

I was notified by Credit Department on October 16, 2001 that the bond compa=
ny Enron utilizes for performance bond(s) would not process our Performance=
 Bond request for increase until Enron paid the bond company for outstandin=
g invoices for "other" performance bonds (bond  renewals), approximately $1=
50,000.  The "other" performance bond invioces had been bounced around EESI=
, since June 2001, to various individuals (i.e. Greg Sharp, Mark Mueller, J=
eff Golden, Scott Mills) and had still remained unpaid.  Payments for the "=
other" performance bonds were made and the bond company processed our reque=
st for increase in the EESI NEPOOL Performance Bond to $20,000,000, which w=
as issued by the bond company on October 23, 2001, executed by EESI on Octo=
ber 23, 2001 and forwarded via FAX and Overnight Mail to ISO-NE on October =
23, 2001.  EESI was unable to comply with the October 19, 2001 deadline to =
resolve the Financial Assurance Default due to complications with the bond =
company as mentioned above.  Credit Department personnel informed ISO-NE pe=
rsonnel that EESI would not meet the October 19, 2001 deadline, but was wor=
king diligently to resolve the matter; Credit Department personnel sent via=
 FAX, a copy of the request to the bond company for revisions to the Perfor=
mance Bond to ISO-NE personnel on October 19, 2001. =20

I notified Dan Allegretti, (Enron Government Affairs & Chariman, NEPOOL Par=
ticipants Committee) of the entire situation prior to October 19, 2001.  Da=
n indicated that he did not think there would be any problems, but to get t=
he matter resolved as quickly as possible. Dan advised me that the implicat=
ions of the Financial Assurance Default would result in communications to t=
he Membership Subcommittee and that when the next letter was published, the=
 following month, EESI would no longer be listed as being in default.  On O=
ctober 19, 2001 another letter was sent to Becky Pitre (EESI Settlements) f=
rom Edward McKenna, Vice President & Chief Financial Officer informing EESI=
 that "Enron Energy Services, Inc. has not maintained the required level of=
 financial assurance for 10 days or more, and has had a total combination o=
f 3 financial assurance and/or payment defaults in the last 12 months, whic=
h qualifies them as having 2 (two) Level 1 defaults.  The ISO has been in c=
ontact with Enron Energy Services, Inc. through multiple telephone communic=
ations, and to date the financial assuvance default has not been cured.  Th=
erefore, per the established procedure, we are forwarding this information =
to the NEPOOL Membership Subcommittee for action by them."  According to Da=
n Allegretti the Memberhsip Subcommittee reports to him, as Chariman of the=
 Members Subcommittee, and he would discuss the issue with them.  The previ=
ous two Financial Assurance Defaults mentioned the October 19, 2001 letter =
occurred (i) December 2000, when payment was received 1-2 days late and was=
 automatically resolved when payment was received and (ii) September 2001, =
when Financial Assurance Default occurred and was resolved through market a=
ctivity.  To the best of my knowledge, EESI was unaware of either the Decem=
ber 2000 Payment Default or the September 2001 Financial Assurance Default,=
 and no information was received by EESI from ISO-NE relative to either inc=
idence.

According to (i) Protocal for the Initation of Membership Termination Proce=
edings and (ii) conversations with Dan Allegretti, the issue should be reso=
lved with the receipt on October 24, 2001 of the Performance Bond by ISO-NE=
.  I have also advised the ISO-NE, in the future, to send communications to=
 EESI's Credit Department and not EESI's Settlements.  Also, Dan Allegretti=
 is investigating the facts leading the the October 19, 2001 letter with re=
presentatives from ISO-NE.

I left message for Molly Harris as you requested. I was able to speak to De=
nise Furey and Nichole Gunter, who both indicated that they would speak wit=

I talked to Richard and he would be very interested in talking with Dale Osburn.  Can you send him the number?

Hope all is well....

Bill

Kay,

Here is the information that we discussed.  I will work with you on this regarding renewable energy.

Richard

The EPA Houston, Texas facility has issued a renewable power Request for
Information (RFI).  This RFI is attached and is posted at
http://www.fedbizopps.gov , under Solicitation Number GS-00P-02-BSD-0001.

Responses are due November 9. Respondents to this RFI will be kept informed
of the EPA Houston, TX renewable power purchase plans.

Let me know if you want to be removed from my renewable power purchase
mailing list.

Chris,

I have reviewed the Confirmation Letter and have the following comments and/or questions:
PREAMBLE
PARAGRAPH ONE
Company name should be Riverside County Waste Management Department.

PREAMBLE
PARAGRAPH TWO
There are various references to "this SC Agreement", which is not a defined term anywhere; should the reference to "this SC Agreement" really mean "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement"?

ARTICLE 2
SECTION 2.1 has a reference to SCE1 which appears to be different that the reference to the Delivery Point, which is defined as SP-15?
SECTION 2.2 has a reference to to Attachment 1and there is no Attachment 1.
SECTION 2.4 (v) was deleted and SECTION 2.4 (vi) was renumbered as SECTION 2.4 (v).
SECTIOM 2.4 (v) indicates that the Index Price shall be the Dow Jones Index NP-15; why is this the case when earlier in SECTION 2.1 the Delivery Point is defined as SP-15?  The last sentence indicates a name of "Hanson" which I believe should really be "RCWMD".
SECTION 2.5 again has reference to "this SC Agreement", which I believe should be "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement".  Also, there is a reference to "RCWMD's usage", shouldn't the terminology in the case of this contract be "production" and "deliveries"?

ARTICLE 3
SECTION 3.1 should have the following added to the beginning of the sentence "RCWMD".
SECTION 3.2 again refers to terminology "energy deliveries and usage" which I believe should be "energy production and deliveries".

ARTICLE 4
SECTION 4.2 refers to "consumed" which I believe should be "delivered" or "produced".
SECTION 4.5 has a reference to Attachment 2 and there is no Attachment 2.  There is again a reference to "receive" and "consume" which should probably be "deliver" and "consume".
SECTIOM 4.7 refers to "Term Purchase", which is not a defined term, at least in the Confirmation Letter.  There is also a reference to Exhibit A and there is no Exhibit A; we previously referred to Attachments rather than Exhibits so we need to make sure that we are consistent.

ARTICLE 5
SECTION 5.1 contains language regarding Scheduling Coordination services, is this fee normal and did you intend for it to be included in this contract.

ARTICLE 6
SECTION 6.1 contains reference to "this SC Agreement", which I believe should be "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement".
SECTION 6.2 contains reference to "this Agreement", which I believe should be "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement".
SECTION 6.6 contains reference to "this Agreement", which I believe should be "this Confirmation Letter" or "this Master Agreement".
SECTION 6.8 contains reference to "Schdule ____", which appears to be absent.

When you get this e-mail lets talk about the comments.  I would like to have a conference call with Riverside on Wednesday October 31st.

Regards,

Richard

Peggy Mahoney asked me to forward this to you.

FYI - Here is a link to the Boston Globe article I have discussed with most of you. After numerous conversations and plenty of information proving otherwise, the reporter unfortunately decided to do this article based upon recent happenings. It is clearly a cheap shot.

 

On a happier note, here is a good article about our relationship with Quaker Oats in the Chicago Sun-Times.

 

Thanks,

Peggy

F-7:  While we are very pleased with the Division's inclusion of banking, w=

so ask that you not limit the ability for Suppliers to transfer banked Rene=

he Division should encourage as much liquidity as possible in the Renewable=
 Energy Credit market.  We understand the Division's concern regarding tran=
sferable banking and potential problems with market power, however, we feel=
 that the GIS Administrator is charged with closely monitoring potential ma=
rket power situations.  We would prefer that the Renewable Energy Credit ma=
rket be allowed to operate as indicated above from the beginning and if it =
is determined that market power issues exist then appropriate changes to th=
e market can and should be implemented.  We feel that markets operate best =

Chris,

Kathleen Croissett, Enron Wind Development Company, had contacted me asking me whether or not the agreement(s) were terminated.  EESI did not terminate the agreement(s) and EESI had not received any termination notices from Green Power Partners which is why I was trying to find out from you what you knew regarding the delivery of power from such facilities.

Late Friday I received a call from Lisa Pitts, Enron Wind Development Corp, however she did particularly say what she wanted.  I did leave a voice mail message for Lisa Pitts, however as of yet have not received a call back from her.

Richard   

Richard:

Has Enron Wind told you they wanted to change SCs?

C

Hi Chris, Garnet has indicated that they will be changing to APX.  We will
need a letter from you agreeing to release the resource to them for trade

The Agreements between Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Green Power Partners I LLC, are for a term endinging December 31, 2002.  The Agreement between Fetzer Vineyards and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending April 30, 2002.  The Agreement between Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia) and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending December 31, 2002.

Additionally,  Enron Energy Services, Inc. has entered into various agreement(s) with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. to sell additional "green tickets" from the Greeen Power Partners I LLC facilities in California:

EESI sells to EPMI, 1MW ATC, through December 31, 2001 (EPMI sells to EEMC)
EPMI sells to EEMC, 1MW ATC, through June 30, 2003
EESI sells to EPMI, 21 MW's, Sundays Off Peak, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)
EESI sells to EPMI, 14 MW's, Sundays ATC, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)

I do not know for sure how whether or not EPMI still plans to deliver to EEMC and/or LADWP, however if they plan to continue these sales and depending on our decision relative to Fetzer Vineyards and/or Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia), we may want to keep the Green Power Partners I LLC Agreement alive.  I have discussed the EPMI deals with LADWP with Chris Foster, EPMI Portland Office and am currently awaiting an answer from Chris as to the current status with LADWP.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Richard Ring
 

In this case there is a product element because at least the 2 retail contracts I named require us to serve green. If we assume them, we have to have green to serve.

I thought the call on whether a contract is rejected was an economic call and not a product call.  If this is not the case then could we be forced to swallow the other discount off tariff contracts we  intend to reject?

Further, we need to know what the revenue is against this purchase to make a call on the economics.  

Richard - Do you have the Patagonia Contract? And/or any of the other green power transactions that EES has entered into with customer's?

Sounds like the economic justification for rejection is clear.  However, we need to be sure that we are not going to keep any customers where we have a contractual requirement to serve green power (Fetzer; Patagonia).  If we are comfortable that we are not, I think we can reject.

MDS

take a look at this. Unless there is a customer or regulatory reason to keep this, PPA, it would seem to me that we would want to reject this contract.

Thoughts/comments so we can proceed.

Murry,

Our forward curves show SP-15 power at $26.57/MWh for the period 02/01/2002-12/31/2002 (note that this does not include the discount for unit-contingency that usually accompanies wind power).  Green tags trade in the market for about $1.50/MWh.  Under the "Green Tickets Sales Agreement" it appears that EES has agreed to pay $39/MWh minus the market price of power, which is approximately $12/MWh for Green Tickets using our forward curves.

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Todd

Attached you will find two agreements EES has with ENRON Wind. 

1- Green Ticket Purchase Sale Agreement (PPA)
2- Scheduling Coordinator Service Agreement

With EES & ENA bankruptcy and the fact that Enron Wind has not been paid for the generation back to the month of November through current, Enron Wind is attempting to move their needs to APX for SC Services.  I also think they were looking for someone else to purchase their energy.  

I put a temporary stop on their actions but we are going to need to review these contracts to determine if we want to continue operating under them.

Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.

Thanks - MO

aka Enron Wind.

There was a problem with this message previously.  I was not sure who received it previously therefore I have sent again.

The Agreements between Enron Energy Services, Inc. and Green Power Partners I LLC, are for a term endinging December 31, 2002.  The Agreement between Fetzer Vineyards and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending April 30, 2002.  The Agreement between Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia) and Enron Energy Services, Inc. is for a term ending December 31, 2002.

Additionally,  Enron Energy Services, Inc. has entered into various agreement(s) with Enron Power Marketing, Inc. to sell additional "green tickets" from the Greeen Power Partners I LLC facilities in California:

EESI sells to EPMI, 1MW ATC, through December 31, 2001 (EPMI sells to EEMC)
EPMI sells to EEMC, 1MW ATC, through June 30, 2003
EESI sells to EPMI, 21 MW's, Sundays Off Peak, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)
EESI sells to EPMI, 14 MW's, Sundays ATC, through December 31, 2002 (EPMI sells to LADWP)

I do not know for sure how whether or not EPMI still plans to deliver to EEMC and/or LADWP, however if they plan to continue these sales and depending on our decision relative to Fetzer Vineyards and/or Lost Arrow, Inc. (Patagonia), we may want to keep the Green Power Partners I LLC Agreement alive.  I have discussed the EPMI deals with LADWP with Chris Foster, EPMI Portland Office and am currently awaiting an answer from Chris as to the current status with LADWP.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Richard Ring
 

In this case there is a product element because at least the 2 retail contracts I named require us to serve green. If we assume them, we have to have green to serve.

I thought the call on whether a contract is rejected was an economic call and not a product call.  If this is not the case then could we be forced to swallow the other discount off tariff contracts we  intend to reject?

Further, we need to know what the revenue is against this purchase to make a call on the economics.  

Richard - Do you have the Patagonia Contract? And/or any of the other green power transactions that EES has entered into with customer's?

Fish, Potato Salad and Fun in abundance.

The perfect combination will take place on Feb 3rd at the Bledsoe residence.  We are combining a Fish Fry with the big game.  Due to the fantastic fishing the past few months the freezer is full of Trout and Redfish and it's time to make some room for the excellent fishing coming up in the next few months.

Kay,

Based on our conversation it looks like Kinko's would be interested in purchasing approximately 8,800 MWh's per year for a three year term (approximately 26,500 MWh's) over the term of the deal.  Our offer price for Texas Renewable Energy Credits (sourced from within the State of Texas) would remain at $6.00 MWh.

Richard

 

Kinko's wants their pricing refreshed for their Reliant and TXU sites only.
I need to know the fixed $MWh price if we assume a 50% renewable product in TXU
and a 100% renewable product in Reliant's service area.
I am trying to fill out the attached template that Larry sent to me with my gen only price refreshed,
some Price to beat estimates I ran for him and your new renewable power quotes.
Thanks
Kay

Deb,

Attached is a spreadsheet that shows my analysis of the Enron Wind Development Corp (Green Power Partners) contract(s).  The asumptions contained in the analysis assume that the following contracts remain in effect through December 31, 2002:

EESI's sale agreement with Lost Arrow, Inc. (Green Power Partners) and Patagonia
EESI's sale to EPMI for resale to EEMC (1MW ATC)
EESI's sale to EPMI for resale to LADWP(1) (21MW Sundays Off Peak)
EESI's sale to EPMI for resale to LADWP(2) (14MW Sundays ATC)
EESI's sale to various retail small commercial customers and Fetzer Vineyards

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Mike,

The "deal" is between EESI and Riverside County Waste Management Department (RCWMC) is dated April 17, 2000 and the term commenced on Sepetmber 1, 2000 and ending on September 1, 2010.  Based on our bankruptcy filing RCWMD stopped delivery of power on December 6, 2001; RCWMD invoiced EESI for power production for September 2001, 0ctober 2001 and November 2001.  I do not know if they were ever paid by EESI.  I do not know of any invoice for the first six days of December 2001.

EESI (myself) and EPMI (Chris Foster) were in the process of renegotiating the above referenced agreement with the plan for EPMI to take over the purchase of power and scheduling services with EESI being the purchaser of the "green tickets"  from EPMI associated with the power production.  There were some major issues to overcome in the renegotiation regarding the "fixed price", "volume committments" and "penalties".  I do not know who, if anyone, is currently looking at this agreement to make any kind of determination EESI's and/or EPMI's desires for the future of this agreement.  

RCWMD sent various letters dated December 10, 2001, December 13, 2001, and January 8, 2002 requesting response from EESI.  The December 10, 2001 letter indicates that RCWMD considers the agreement terminated effective December 2, 2001.  I had previously spoke to you about this agreement in December 2001.  

It is my opinion that we should not continue this agreement and we should consider RCWMD's offer to terminate the agreement with the exchange of the non-performance panalties for the termination payment.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,

Richard

   

Richard--what do you know about this deal?  Do you have paper on it?  Is this a purchase deal that we want?  Are we buying under it now?

The customer is pushing me to give them some answers.  Thanks.  MDS

Mike,

The agreement covers multiple projects; to date there is only one project that has come on line.  For the one project that has come on line during the non-performance penalty could be in the range of $150,000 to $640,000, depending on the resoultion of the "effective online date" for said project.  The non-performance penalty was our strongest negotiating point in the ongoing effort to restructure the agreement as there is a potential for penalties for each project for each year of the contract.  The agreement contained some fundamenal flaws in order to be able to book the mark-to-market for the agreement.  

I do not have a good handle of the "early termination payment" except to say that there are approxmiately 390,500 MWh's.  The average contract "fixed price" is $33.10 MWh.  I would need to find out what the nine year fixed price from the power curves is to estimate but my best stab would be to estimate the nine year fixed price to be $25.00 MWh which would result in "early termination payment" of approximately $3,200,000 ((390,500*33.10) - (390,500*25.00)).

Richard  

Thanks.  Can you get a bead on the relative value of the ETP and the non-performance penalties?

Total annual MWh's is approximately 8,800.

I think we should keep the $6.00 offers. Natsource can get us done at $5.00 Do you remember what the total volumes are for this deal?

Kinko's wants their pricing refreshed for their Reliant and TXU sites only.
I need to know the fixed $MWh price if we assume a 50% renewable product in TXU
and a 100% renewable product in Reliant's service area.
I am trying to fill out the attached template that Larry sent to me with my gen only price refreshed,

Based on our bankruptcy filing RCWMD stopped delivery of power on December 6, 2001; RCWMD invoiced EESI for power production for September 2001, 0ctober 2001 and November 2001.  I do not know if they were ever paid by EESI.  I do not know of any invoice for the first six days of December 2001.

EESI (myself) and EPMI (Chris Foster) were in the process of renegotiating the above referenced agreement with the plan for EPMI to take over the purchase of power and scheduling services with EESI being the purchaser of the "green tickets"  from EPMI associated with the power production.  There were some major issues to overcome in the renegotiation regarding the "fixed price", "volume committments" and "penalties".  I do not know who, if anyone, is currently looking at this agreement to make any kind of determination EESI's and/or EPMI's desires for the future of this agreement.  

RCWMD sent various letters dated December 10, 2001, December 13, 2001, and January 8, 2002 requesting response from EESI.  The December 10, 2001 letter indicates that RCWMD considers the agreement terminated effective December 2, 2001.  I had previously spoke to you about this agreement in December 2001.  

It is my opinion that we should not continue this agreement and we should consider RCWMD's offer to terminate the agreement with the exchange of the non-performance panalties for the termination payment.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards,

Richard

   

Richard--what do you know about this deal?  Do you have paper on it?  Is this a purchase deal that we want?  Are we buying under it now?

The customer is pushing me to give them some answers.  Thanks.  MDS

Tina,

Please let me know when the move to ECN is expected to take place as I will be out of the office Feb 6th thru Feb 8th.

Thanks,

Richard

Thanks,
I will submit it today and let you know the move day.
Tina Holcombe

Tina - Please move Richard Ring to ECN 623a.  Liqun Pan is also on the fifth floor in ECS.  You can move her to ECN 680a.  Oliver Jones has already communicated his move location to the move team.  

If you have questions call me at x.35330.

Richard, Rick, and Paul:

Can you please go scope out a spot on 6 in ECN as soon as possible (today).  Please notify Tina Holcombe of the location so that she can designate for the upcoming churn (computer and telephone move). Once on ECN6 Deb will work to finalize a permanent floor plan.

Deb - Richard is out today.  Could you please locate a spot for him and notify Tina.  Deb - also, if Liqun Pan, Oliver Jones and others have already moved to ECN 6 and still have phone lines and computers in ECS 5 you may want to forward their info (locations - old and present) so that they can be included on this churn as well. 

Thanks everyone,
Rogers

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  

Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

I'm now trained to avoid harrassment.   Actually it wasn't as bad as I 
thought it'd be...not that it was exactly interesting, but it could have been 
much worse.  I was going to leave, but I just found out that Laura's in 
Houston.  Not only is she in Houston, she's in a conference room on this 
floor.  I keep peeking in the window to see if she's still in there.  I'm 
just hanging around now hoping to get a chance to talk to her.  

Talk to ya later.

When David told me I had to go, I told him I already knew how to avoid 
harrassment...just stay away from he and Jeff.  But I guess since I have 
nothing else to do I might as well go.  

Gabriel Monroy
02/20/2001 11:14 AM
Muahaaaaaaa, that is me laughing. I really laughed when i received this 
email.  No, nobody harasses me, so I am not going. I think somebody is 
harassing you. I will be here. Have fun, and save me some of that cake. 

Gabriel

Hey do you have to go to the harrassment avoidance seminar?  We got an email 
saying we were required to attend one of the sessions.  So that's what I'm 
doing this afternoon.   Yippee!  

About the third time I read your email I understood it.  I kept reading Jaime 
as the English name Jamie (Jay-me).  I had no clue what you were talking 
about.  But don't worry I'm caught up now.  

And I thought I had bad eating habits...I've never had pepperoni pizza for 
breakfast.  I still have half of this king cake left, and I'm not  taking it 
home b/c I have another one there, so you need to come get some.  

I'd have a little fun with your friend before you tell him the truth...that 
you blew him off.  

R

Gabriel Monroy
02/20/2001 10:31 AM
Jaime just sent me an email apologizing because he could not find me. He said 
that he asked everybody (friends you have not met). A couple of Nicaraguans, 
and  some other colombians.  Before Jaime, Hector and I moved out of Austin, 
I used to hang out with all these people. Harry does not particularly like 
them, but Ramiro was also part of this group.  Anyways, Jaime kept asking for 
Harry's phone number and nobody knew his phone number, so he thinks he stood 
me up. 

Hmmm, what should I say. Should I say I was waiting for his call all weekend 
long, or just tell him the truth?  

Yeahh I want to try your King cake.  I am not hungry at all though. OUr 
assistants kept getting creative every day and our breakfast was getting 
better and better. I am not sure what happened last time they ordered. They 
must have been stoned. We had Peperoni calzone for BREAKFAST!!!!!!!. The 
worst part is that I ate one. My stomach is a little upset.  Too much junk 
food in less than 24 hours. 

I think harassing me is a very popular pass time around here.

Gabriel Monroy
02/20/2001 10:08 AM
hey, not much here.  None of my bosses are here, however, Tim left me some 
work to do and I am having a hard time comparing my results to what the 
analysts say they should be.  Tim would be disappointed if this is not 
finished by tomorrow. At least that is what I think, so I am keeping myself 
busy.  I have time to check my e-mail though, so keep writing.   For example, 
you can lie to me about how beautiful Lake Charles is, oopsss.  I think Jeff 
enjoys harassing you very very much. 

Anyways, if you find something interesting to tell me, let me know. 

Yeah, I already told Jeff I was going to have to log on and ask Charlene 
what's wrong with the Analyst HR.  I can't wait.  But it's like I told him, 
if you ask her a questions she doesn't want to answer (which is almost any 
legitimate question) she just pretends you asked something else and answers 
that.  

I have King cake down here if you want some.  It's pretty good, but I've had 
better.   Alejandra was asking me if I had dinner last night.  I told her 
about our cooking experience.  Don't worry I told her it was good.  

Do you have lunch plans?

I hate Canada.

What goin' on?  It's all quiet down here.  In fact, even Jeff is just hanging 
out.  He sat by me and made fun of Lake Charles for half an hour or so.  So I 
don't feel so bad about not accomplishing a whole lot today.  

Hope you're having a good day.

She does seem pretty impressed that she's effectively the first person we've 
told.  I think she feels priviledged.

I got you now.  Was she surprised that we keot it a secret for so long?

Thanks,

... is saved for the 15th.
-Brian

Apparently she thought Valentines was like a first date.  Now she knows we've 
been dating since December.

Binh Knows...she quizzed me as soon as I sat down.

Jeff said if we were going to spend that much we should go to the Carribean, 
so I'm going to research that further.  Let me know if you have any 
destination suggestions.

RR

Hey,

Everyone's asked me how the happy hour was last night.  What a joke.  
Apparently everyone left about 9:00.  And here's the best part...Brad (new 
guy) was walking up as everyone was leaving.  Wasn't it nice of him to call 
and tell us that everyone was gone?  Or at least telling the bozos leaving 
that I was planning on coming so that someone would have called?  I told Jeff 
he owes me a Happy Hour b/c that definitely didn't count.  He said we'd have 
to do a Happy Hour that was for Susan and me.  I told him I wanted my Happy 
hour on the beach in Cancun.  I searched the internet for flights and sent 
him an email with the flight information.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

PS  Have you decided where we're going for lunch?

I'm just glad you sent it to the right person.

promise you... I didn't!  Are you going to the happy hour at the races 
tomorrow night?  I am.  Talk to ya later.

Apparently you can't open the link so here's a print screen of the website.

I'm trying to schedule a time and place for our farewell Happy Hour.  Let me

Hey Lynn,

Thanks for checking up.  Laura and I spoke Tuesday.  She was going to contact 
HR and get back to me.  That's the last I've heard.  

Robin

Robin,
Did you get everything worked out with Laura,
Just checking on the status.

Lynn

Nancy,

I've discovered a basis book with the attribute problem we corrected for the 
Physical book below.  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS was set up to replace IM-EMWNSS1-BAS 
for credit purposes.  However, the correct region code is still being applied 
to the old book.  Here's what I need to happen.

BOOK ID   CURRENT REGION CODE  CORRECT REGION CODE

INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS MIDWEST    MDWEST

IM-EMWNSS1-BAS  MDWEST    MDWEST_OLD (This region code really doesn't matter 
as long as it does not                               duplicate a currently 
used region code.)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help,
Robin

Robin Rodrigue
02/12/2001 04:46 PM
Nancy,

The new attributes you have assigned to the IM-EMWNSS2-PHY  book are 
duplicating the attributes of the INTRA-EMWNSS1-PHY book.  Per my original 
request please change the region code for IM-EMWNSS2-PHY to Midwest_Old, 
since it is my understanding from Burton that this book should no longer be 
used.

If you have any more questions, give me a call.
Robin

   

Robin:

Per your request, the attributes on FT-IM-ENOV-PHY have been changed as 
follows

	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	1	E	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST

In order to prevent duplicate book attributes,  IM-EMWNSS2-PHY attributes 
were also changed as follows:

	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST1

These changes will properly report the ERMS positions in the FT-IM-ENOV-PHY 
book as apposed to IM-EMWNSS2-PHY, which should have no positions.

If you have any questions, please call me at ext 54751

Nancy

PLEASE NOTE:  THE FIRST RACE DOES NOT START UNTIL 7:05 PM.
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BE THERE AT 5:30 PM, ONLY IF YOU ARE ABLE TO.

THANK YOU

So you really were working on something and not just making up stories so I'd 
think you had a job!!  Authur Andersen has everyone checking up on a certain 
Enron subsidiary you might have some interest in.

I've decided that I'm going to quit worrying about them.  I finally heard 
from the VP yesterday.  Her son has been in the hospital, so she's been out 
of the office ever since I went up there.  So basically we've made no 
progress.  She's back now, though, so I'm hoping I'll know something soon.  
If I do end up going which is very likely I'm going to leave pretty soon.  
That's  the main reason I'm going home this weekend.  I'll let you know when 
I hear something.

Sounds good.

I'd like to be there around 7 if that's when it starts.  But we probably 
don't need to leave here until 6:30-6:45ish.  Just call me before you go to 
class and let me know when you'll get out and I'll meet you downstairs.  

I'm probably going to leave around 3:30 if things stay this calm.

  TAKING TESTS & DRILLS ONLINE
  -----------------------------
  Students taking GMAT, GRE, and USMLE courses will take all of
  their computerized diagnostic tests on the web. Offering
  tests online makes it possible to always ensure that you have
  the most  up-to-date questions available that reflect the
  current make up of the test. It also makes it possible to
  provide detailed analysis of your performance to your
  instructors.

  SAT students can find a plethora [if you don't know this word,
  look it up now!] of drills which target certain problem types.
  If you want to find an extra set of medium geometry questions
  or hard average problems, check out the online drills! You can
  also check out our multimedia versions of the same techniques
  you've been learning in class, to help you remember what you've
  learned.

  GRE and GMAT students, please hold off on taking any online tests
  or drills until your course starts.  Your Princeton Review
  instructor will assign each of the online tests and drills during
  specific points during the program.

  USMLE students, please take Test 1 online prior to attending your
  first class.  Your Princeton Review instructor will assign each of
  the remaining online tests and drills during specific points during
  the program.

  LSAT students, although you will be taking your course practice tests
  in a proctored environment (the LSAT is still a pencil-and-paper test,
  after all) the website does contain detailed explanations for every
"real"
  LSAT problem you will be doing in the course.  Further, if you
supplement
  your course materials with additional real LSATs, you will find online
  explanations for these questions as well.

  TECHNICAL SUPPORT
  ------------------
  Tech support is available at no charge to all Princeton Review
  course students Monday through Friday from 10am until 11pm
  Eastern and Saturday from 12pm to 6pm Eastern. You can reach

  well on the way to higher scores!

Nancy,

The OPTIONS-EXOTIC-PRC book should not have EXCELSHEETS as the database id.  
This post id is calced and officialized in ERMS.  The book administrator 
informed me that this post id contains only option premiums and does not

Hope that answers your questions.

All:

Can you please review the attached and provide assistance in resolving.  We 
are trying to resolve why these postids did not get captured by  RisktRAC for 
Dec 29, 2000                   

1) For the Gas-Chase9 books does anyone know when the database ID was changed 
to ERMS OLD? Are these accrual books?

2)  Does anyone know why the Options-Exotic-PRC  book has a database id of 
EXCELSHEETS?  Is the book uploaded as a spreadsheet or is it suppose to feed 
from RisktRAC?

3) For the FT-EAST-BAS book, which is the correct postid?

4) For the Weather book does anyone know why the PostID was not 
officialized?  Does it need to be officialized?

Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.  They are in the 
process of tying out the Annual report and need to resolve these issues.

Regards,

Nancy

I'm glad to know your sister has a sense of humor, and that I can quit 
looking over my shoulder all the time.  So what's going on down there today?  
So far my day's much quieter than yesterday...THANK GOODNESS.  Everyone and 
their brother harrassed me yesterday.  Here was the best one though.  A 
manager in another group told one of his analyst to give me his(the 
analyst's) password to the VAR system so I could print some reports for 
him(the manager).  He wanted me to do it so that he could have them on his 
desk when he gets here at 7:30.  Here's the best part though it takes about 
30 minutes to print all these reports.  So essentially he was asking me to 
come in at 5:00 so that neither he nor his analyst had to come in until 
7:30.  I told the analyst to tell him, "Not just no, but HELL NO!!  I don't 
work for him, and  I have more important things to do.  If he had any 
questions to give me a call and I'd be glad to explain further."  Funny, I 
didn't hear from him yesterday.  I was actually hoping he'd call because I 
had had enough of doing other people's jobs yesterday and it would have been 
nice to chew someone out.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Thanks!

Sorry to hear you're having a bad day.  If it helps mine's not much better.  
I've been harrassed by at least half the company, I think.  Frank's out of 
the office, so I've got Sunil's replacement (who doesn't have a clue) calling 
me every two minutes, as well as Vlady calling, and the out of Control group 
calling, and Canada calling trying to get their p&l right......it's been 
nuts.  I was hoping today would be boring so I could do GMAT homework.  I 
would love to get out of the building for a little while.  Some lady just 
asked me for directions to get off this floor...  Does this seem scary to 
you??  Especially when you consider she was facing the neon EXIT sign down 
the hall.  Wow!!  Apparently everyone's lost their mind today.  

Hope your day gets better.
Robin

Burton,

The book INTRA-ONT-CAD-GDL  is in the AGG-GASlI portfolio, not in the AGG-GAS 
III and IV portfolios.  Please add this book to both the AGG-GASIII and 
AGG-GASIV portfolios.

Thanks,

We saw an even better one the other day.  Someone was trying to sell a 1972

While waiting for the computer guy to fix my software connections I went 
browsing on the "For Sale" bulletin board.  Some lady is selling a Ball 
Python.  The high points of the snake included the comment that it has "never 
bitten" anyone and that it come with an exercise stick.   If you were a 
snake, would you bite someone with an exercise stick?  Sounds like a time 
bomb to me.The stupid snake also comes with a bed and a light!  Is that so it 
can read in bed?  Who cares about a stupid snake.  The things people try to 
sell.  FYI.  B

Hey Lynn,

Is Laura back in the office?  I was hoping we could start working with HR 
early this week, so there would be a possibility that we would have a 
decision made by the end of the week.

Are you going to be able to leave anytime soon?  If you are I'll give you a 
ride.  Let me know.

Nancy,

The new attributes you have assigned to the IM-EMWNSS2-PHY  book are 
duplicating the attributes of the INTRA-EMWNSS1-PHY book.  Per my original 
request please change the region code for IM-EMWNSS2-PHY to Midwest_Old, 
since it is my understanding from Burton that this book should no longer be 
used.

If you have any more questions, give me a call.
Robin

   

Robin:

Per your request, the attributes on FT-IM-ENOV-PHY have been changed as 
follows

	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	1	E	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST

In order to prevent duplicate book attributes,  IM-EMWNSS2-PHY attributes 
were also changed as follows:

	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
OLD ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST1

These changes will properly report the ERMS positions in the FT-IM-ENOV-PHY 
book as apposed to IM-EMWNSS2-PHY, which should have no positions.

If you have any questions, please call me at ext 54751

What's going on?  Are you busy?  I'm going to try to get out of here early 
again today.  If there's any chance you can get away by 5 let me know and 
I'll hang out.

RR

Stacey,

I have a couple of questions for you to ensure that we report the positions 
correctly.  First, is this a Power East or Power West book?  Second, when can 
we expect to be reporting positions in this book?  Finally, who is the trader 
for this book?

Thanks for your help.
Robin

   

Stacey:

Can you please confirm that new book PWR-NY-GAS-MTM should be included in the 
AGG-PWRII portfolio for VaR purposes?  Can you further indicate into which 
subportfolio of AGG_PWRII the book should be added?

Robin:

In order for you to capture the positions for the GAS bench, does the book 
need to be included within any GAS portfolio?

I look forward to your responses.

Nancy

Hey girl,

I'm really in about the same position I was in on Monday.  I've talked to the 
people in the office and they promise me they are still interested in having 
me up there.  But HR seems to be impeding the process at this point.  I'm 
just waiting for them to get back to me.  And the VP's son had surgery this 
week and apparently it was much more serious than they expected, so she's 
been unavailable all week.  She's supposed to be back in the office on Monday 
so hopefully she'll shake things up a little.  I definitely won't leave 
without saying goodbye.  We'll have to get together for lunch once I have 
some definite plans.  

Talk to ya later...Enjoy your day off.
Robin

Hey Robin- 

        I was just wondering how the plans were coming along for Chicago.  
Don't run out of here without saying bye to me, OK!   What date are you 
planning on starting up there? 

Talk to ya later.  (but not Monday at Spanish class because I am taking the 
day off)
Alicia

Tom,

It looks like everything ran perfectly.  I have attached a copy of the 
positions that were loaded into the system.  Let me know if you see any 
problems, but they seem to be in line with what you expected.  

Let me know if you have any questions.
Robin

Good morning,

Here is last night's benchmark report which includes our latest intramonth 
deals.  I also made the changes you suggested.  You should see MTM of around 
(79,000) and a volumetric position of approximately (600,000) for the 
intramonth deals.

Please test the file at your first convenience.

Thanks,

Tom

Huh?

Gabriel Monroy
02/09/2001 10:42 AM
thanks.  You should initiate a newswire service. You are very efficient. 

Here's the extent of what I know about Chicago.
Hi,
I just spoke with Laura.  She said she was going to try to call you today, 
she is in transit back to Chicago.  She apologized for the delay, but things 
were worse than expected with her son.  Let me know if I can help.
So sorry

Lynn

Thanks for the update.  

Robin

Please confirm...I'm still confused.  So you're coming, right?  You would 
have fun if you come.  Becky always tells stories about either her family or 
her husbands.  Since her family is from the hills of West Virginia and her 
husbands is from the swamps of Louisiana, she always has funny stories.

Let me know if you change your mind.
Robin

That was too weird...great minds think alike I guess.  I think our emails

Someone delivered an envelope for you.  I put it in your top right desk 
drawer.

Robin

Guten Morgen!!!  I've decided to learn German since I'm not having any luck 
with Spanish.  Oh my goodness....some "lady" just walked by with her pajamas 
on I think.  And apparently they were her pajamas from when she was in high 
school b/c not only are they hideously ugly they don't fit anymore!!  It's 
really scary.  

Someone just called with work for me to do, so I'll talk to ya later.

I'm going to lunch with Shannon and Becky today if you want to come.  And yes 
you are really invited.  So let me know if you want to come and please be 
specific!!

Robin

Ladies,

Could you please provide Tammie with a copy of the reports every morning.  
Tammie is the assistant for Louise Kitchen and will require the same report 
distribution that John receives.

Currently, Tammie is located on 27 however within a week (after Dave moves 
next week) she and Louise will be moving to 33.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Hey, 

Any news?? 

I heard from the admin in  Chicago.  She said Laura (the VP) is going to call 
the HR people and then call me sometime later today.  Maybe we'll actually 
make some progress today.  I'll let you know if I hear something.  

Now get back to work!!

Yes I did get an apartment.  They are still doing some renovations, so I'll 
probably be in a hotel for a few days.  The owner said he would try to have 
it by the 12th, but you know how that goes.  I should be able to move in no 
later than the 16th though so that's not too bad.  If you could recommend a 
hotel I'd appreciate it.  

Thanks,
Robin

The garage we park in is full, I am waiting to hear back from 2 others.  I 
will let you know as soon as I find out.  Did you find an apartment?

Lynn

Frank, 

I don't think the issue is how the books are calced/officialized on those 
days.  Here why.  The same calc is used the day before and for the rest of 
the following month.  The physical calc is simply copied each day.  On Jan. 
31, extending the expert clause to include Feb is the only change made.  Once 
Feb rolles to intramonth the "From date" on the calc is changed from the Jan 
1 to Feb 1.  Since January has already rolled off this should have no effect 
on the positions.  Also, the positions for prompt month were correctly 
captured by Risktrac, which leads me to believe that problem is with the VAR 
calc not the post ids.  

Let me know if this doesn't answer your question. 
Robin  

   

Wei,
I appreciate your help. If I hear you right, it appears it may have to do 
with the way post id's and books are officialized.  Thanks for your help.

Robin,
For whatever reason, we didn't pick up VaR for Feb intra-month on Jan 31, and 
on Feb 1, a lot of intra month hit.  I've been investigating, with Bharat, 
and RAC initially thought it had something to do with the code and that GRMS 
didn't roll in physical until the first of the month (I guess).  Now it seems 
like it may have something to do with the way Post id's/books are 
officialized. (I guess).  Please give this a looksy and let me know.

Nilay,
Thanks for your help, any ideas on why would be helpful.

Let me/Bharat know if we should bring ERMS into the picture.

Thanks,
Frank

   
	
	

Bharat,

First I checked VaR number for this portfolio_id since 26-JAN-01.  Notice 
there was consecutive VaR jump from 26-JAN-01 to 1-FEB-01.

PORTFOLIO_ID    EFF_DT        DOWN95       UP95
Then I checked sum of delta_position and gamma for book_id INTRA-WEST-PHY on 
those dates.  Since I notice that VaR had a big jump from 26-JAN-01 to 
29-JAN-01, so I also group by reference data on those two dates.

  1  select ref_dt, strip_flag, sum(delta_position), sum(gamma)
  2  from rms_open_position
  3  where eff_dt = '&1'
  4  and book_id = 'INTRA-WEST-PHY'
  5  and nvl(strip_flag, 0) >= 0
  6  group by ref_dt, strip_flag
  7* having (sum(delta_position) > 0 or sum(gamma) > 0)

Effective_dt 26-jan-01

REF_DT    STRIP_FLAG SUM(DELTA_POSITION) SUM(GAMMA)
Effective_dt 29-jan-01

REF_DT    STRIP_FLAG SUM(DELTA_POSITION) SUM(GAMMA)
REF_DT    STRIP_FLAG SUM(DELTA_POSITION) SUM(GAMMA)
REF_DT    STRIP_FLAG SUM(DELTA_POSITION) SUM(GAMMA)
The following is the list of sum of delta position on those dates without 
group by reference_dt:

EFFECTIVE_DT STRIP_FLAG SUM(DELTA_POSITION) SUM(GAMMA)
It looks to me the trend on VaR change is very similar to the trend on delta 
position change.  If you want to know why delta position went higher from 
26-JAN-01 to 01-FEB-01, we need to get ERMS people involved.  RisktRAC 
basically just pulls position from ERMS.

Thanks,

Wei

What's up?  Are you sore from all that hard work on the soccer field 
yesterday?  I'm bored today.  So tell me something.  Do you think I should 
pull rank on Binh for Valentines day and just tell her "I've been here 
longer, so you can work Valentines night."  The only thing that makes me feel 
bad about that is that she's had that day scheduled for vacation for a 
while.  

Jeff is probably wondering why he pays me today.  I went for a 30 minute 
coffee break with Alejandra and I haven't done anything constructive since 
I've been back.  Oh well.  I really don't have anything to do though.  

Te quiero.

Gabriel Monroy

At that rate you will pay to get out of Houston right?     No worries, there 
is still another game on the 20th and the Season begins Feb 27th (this one is 
for points. The other two are Pre-season but still very competitive because 
they are organized by the league).  By the 27th, maybe you will already have 
finished GMAT. 

So, I guess I should not even worry about having told Purvi right?    Well, 
if you finish the benchmark early, you know where to go, but don't worry. I 
won't be expecting you. Let me know what you hear from Laura (if that is how 
you spell her name).  I will talk to the MD after lunch I guess. I'll let you 
know what the outcome was. 
There is absolutely nothing to do. I am educating myself by reading some 
things about Acquisitions. 

Gabriel

Hey,

It doesn't look like I'm going to make your soccer game tonight.  In fact, I 
won't make the GMAT class either.   Rock officially resigned yesterday, which 
means there's no way they'll let him back in the building.  So I'm now 
running the bench again.  At least until I can get Binh comfortable running 
it.  Maybe that offer in Chicago wasn't so bad after all.  

Enough whining for now.

Talk to ya later,

Wei,

I am showing a position for the book id listed below when I query RMS Open 
Positions, but I don't see the positions when I query Benchmark Agg_View.   
Can you refresh the table to see if this position will pull into the 
Benchmark Agg_View table?  I am including the book id, post id, and position 
from yesterday.  Let me know if you need any more information.

BOOK ID   POST ID POSITION
INTRA-ONT-CAD-GDL  1062779 -477.7 contracts

Thanks,
Robin

You are one sick puppy!!  I hear your boss revoked your eating privileges.  
Let me know when you get them back and we'll go to lunch.  

Yeah, give me a call.  I'm headed home to do GMAT homework.

Yes, Do you want me to call you after French so you can tell me all about it?

Yeah, I heard.  It took an act of Congress and I'm not exactly thrilled.  
I'll tell you all about it later.  Do you have French tonight?

I already checked the blue book for the Chicago area and it's exactly the 
same as for Houston.  Which means that the prices should be comparable, so 
I'll probably try to sell it here first.   I just found out that I should 
have the "offer" in a couple of hours.  It's a big mess.  I'll have to tell 
you that story later.  My blood pressure surely shot up after talking to the 
analyst HR moron.  If you need any help cracking some heads I'm certainly in 
the mood for it!!

I'll let you know what I find out.  
Robin

Well,  you are in a good position because you could sell your car but you 
don't necessarily have to.  In Enron terms this would be called a put option 
and we charge for it, so make sure you pay me premium.    The actual 
paperwork takes no time. It could be done in a day. Now, if your question was 
the time that you can actually find a potential buyer....well, that really 
depends on how much you want for it.  Have you decided on a  "floor".  In 
other words, decide how much is the minimum you would accept for your car.   
Another thing I would do is check the prices in Chicago.  Prices for cars 
vary a little  depending on the city. So see if comparable cars in Chicago 
are selling for less, that way, it might be a good opportunity to try to sell 
it here.  SInce you don't have to sell it, I would check the market very very 
well.  You don't need the money, and you don't need to sell it. You have the 
power. If you decide to advertise it,  don't mention anything about Chicago. 

I'll help you with research later. 

Gabriel

You're right...that sounds just like Becky.  At least no one's sick this 
time!!  I can't believe Zach ran the car into the house.  And equally amazing 
is that Emily finally finished high school.  

I still haven't heard anything about Chicago.  I finally got the name of the 
HR rep here in Houston, so I'm going to begin the irritation tactic shortly.  
I'll just call every few minutes until they get tired of hearing their phone 
ring and finally answer.  And if that doesn't work I know where this lady's 
office is so I'll go pay her a friendly visit.  I'm determined to find 
something out.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Hey, 
I thought you might enjoy reading this if you have a few minutes to spare.  
It's from Becky, and it sounds just like her.  I thought you might get a kick 
out of what we are missing around there.  

Enjoyed lunch the other day.  We'll do it again sometime.  
Did you find out anything else about going to Chicago?  Keep me updated.

Later,
JoAnne
Hey yourself,
Glad you've gotten to work and have gotten settled.  Of course, now you're
one of the working class.....sounds like you're gonna be busy.  We have been
here-if anything, we're busier than ever.  The auditors are
here ---yuck...and will be til the end of the year probably.  Oh well,
nothing to hide.
Emily is enrolled here-can you believe it?  and Zach decided to help out by
cranking my truck last week.  Emily had left it in gear so now my utility
room has a large opening in it that was not previously there.  He was used
to cranking his dad's automatic car and  boy, did he get a surprise...Oh
well, he's not hurt and the truck and utility room can be fixed.
Had a birthday yesterday.  Jake took me to the Warehouse last night and I
stuffed my face.  Really good.  Seems like you had one a few weeks ago,
yourself.  Happy belated birthday.  Hope it was a good one.  Sounds like
things are going great for you two-buying a house and everything.  Where is
Shannon working?  Is he having to drive far to get to work?
Guess I better get some of this junk rounded up.  Maybe he'll let us go a
few minutes early.  I could handle that...some of my birthday money is going
for a massage in an hour or so...Let us hear from you...send me your address
and I'll add you to my book..
Bye for now, tell Robin hi for me and you keep in touch also.

Becky

Hey,

I checked out the Houston Chronicle website and there were two Preludes that 
would be comparable to mine.  One was advertised for $21,995(which is the 
blue book) and the other was advertised for $18,900ish.  Of course both were 
being sold by dealers, so I probably couldn't get quite that much.  But I can 
probably get enough to make it worthwhile to go ahead and sell my car.  I 
just wonder how long it would take before it actually sold.  

That's what I've accomplished since lunch.  Talk to ya later,
Robin

Lynn,

Have you heard anything from HR?  Is there any hope of me knowing something 
today?

Thanks,
Robin

Good b/c I didn't really feel like going anyway.  

Gabriel Monroy
02/05/2001 09:34 AM
Whaaatt, you are not going, Why?? Ok, ok, don't worry, I won't feel bad if 
you don't go to Spanish. 

I'm surprised you invited me to the class!!

If you wanted to see me for lunch you should have just said so.  There's no 
need of going to the extreme of having a Spanish class...people are going to 
get suspicious.

RR

Monica,

Please remove me from your distribution list.  I have moved to another job.

Thanks,

Please add Bilal Bajwa to your distribution list.

Are you ready to leave right now?  

Are you going to be here much longer??  I'm going to leave pretty soon.  Let 
me know if you want a ride.

That was hilarious.

What are you still doing here???

Kathy,

I have attached  a copy of the P&L that was reported as of January 31 for 
Canada.  You will notice that Disturnal's P&L is no longer reported as part 
of Canada, however I have included his p&l  for tieout purposes.  If you have 
any questions please let me know.

Robin

Kathy Reeves
02/02/2001 04:12 PM
This is what I have for Canada's p&l for January 2001.  Can you let me know 
what you reported so that we can make sure that it is the same?  

Kathy

So all those West Virginia stereotypes are true after all!!!  I think all my 
family has their own teeth.  Even my grandparents have their own teeth.  You 
know I always thought I had good family stories, but you definitely outrank 
me there.  

Have a good weekend. 
Robin

Becky Pitre
02/02/2001 03:22 PM
Something else weird about my sister and her daughter ( the ones who live in 
the sticks in W.Va.).  They both had all of their teeth pulled and then got 
dentures.  Janey is 46 and Missy is 24 years old.  Isn't that icky?  Missy 
told me that she liked her dentures because her teeth no longer hurt!  And my 
sister, I hate to admit this, says she likes them because she can take them 
out and clean them every few days!  Dang!  If they had used good, or even 
fair, hygiene then they could still have their real teeth.  So, brush, brush, 
brush.
Now that you have picked yourself up off of the floor, stop laughing!
Do you have a family story to top this one?  Hope not.
Becky

Let's just meet in the Enron Lobby.  Right around the escalators.  

See ya at 11:30.
Robin

Ramesh/Wei,

I just wanted to know what your estimated time was for implementing the code 
to apply basis roll off to the benchmark quantity as well as to the open 
position quantity.  The timing is not critical for our purposes.  I just want 
to make sure it will be available before March bidweek.  If you need any 
information please let me know as soon as possible since  Thursday will be my 
last day in this group.  If you need anything after Thursday please contact 
Binh Pham.  

I have enjoyed working with you both.  Thank you for all your help.

Robin

I AM important around here.  I am definitely up for lunch.  How's 11:30 suit 
you?  If that's not good just give me a time.  

Talk to ya later,

have plans.  I could probably do Friday though.  Let me know if you can fit 
me into your busy schedule.

Robin

Joanne Smith@ENRON
01/31/2001 11:08 AM
I didn't think you could forget me!  I actually do have lunch plans already 
(SORRY), but maybe tomorrow or Friday we could go.  I have been in Houston 
since the first of the year.  Shannon (my husband) and I bought a new house 
in Katy.  It's a long drive, but we really like it there.  Got to go.... 

Talk to you later,
JoAnne

Of course I remember you...I'm not that much of a flake.  How long have you 
been back in Houston?  I actually saw you fighting the elevator crowd in the 
lobby several days ago.  We should definitely get together.  Do you have 
lunch plans for today?  

Robin

Joanne Smith@ENRON
01/31/2001 10:34 AM
Hey Robin,
It's been a while since I have talked with or seen you.  In case you forgot, 
we worked together at LA Tech for Becky.  I am back permanently now as a tax 
analyst.  I am in the rotation program and am working in 3AC for what used to 
be EI for my first rotation.  I thought maybe we could get together sometime, 
go to lunch, and chat.  I would love to hear from you.

JoAnne

I can't wait!!  

Becky Pitre
01/31/2001 08:35 AM
OK, we're on.  Lunch tomorrow at Luthers.  Let's meet in the lobby at 11:30 
AM.  B

I'm in.

That works for me.

Becky Pitre@ECT
01/31/2001 07:58 AM
OK, I smelled Luthers this morning.  It was killing me.  Yum, yum.  How about 
lunch tomorrow?  B

You were right.  That was pretty sick!!!

Hey, let's all get together for lunch sometime.  When would be a good day?

Becky,

It's good to have you back...I don't think I've eaten at Luther's since the 
last time we all went together.  Tomorrow's good for me.  How's it going 
being back at work?  Did you have 50 million emails to plow through?  

Becky Pitre

Robin,
Could you please send me Canada's p&L that you are reporting.  The same file 
that you sent last month is fine.  This is what our income should be.
Kathy

I'm coming to visit.

Are you busy?

I hadn't thought about that scenerio yet.  Actually no one's asked that, but 
everyone's asked me when I'm going to Chicago.  There certainly aren't any 
secrets around here.  I never told anyone except Jeff, David, Rock and Binh 
that I was going to Chicago and yet everyone on the floor knows.  

They're putting out the food for today.  And they brought flowers for the 
tables!!  I'm so impressed.  The food's probably not very good is they're 
going to so much trouble to dress it up.  I think it might be tortilla soup.  
Actually, I just found out we're taking Crystal out to eat since tomorrow's 
her last day.  I would invite you but then you'd just be disappointed when we 
left without you.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Ps  Your boss actually has a reason to be stressed today!!  I wouldn't want 
to be in that meeting.  

What's up?  Nothing too much going on here.  I'm hungry, but that's about the 
most exciting thing I have to tell you.  

Just wanted to say hi.

me nervous.

No I did not send the postid's Robin and Rahmann.  I did not realize I needed 
to do this every night.  We can send you our postid sheet everynight if this 
is 
what you need.  When can we expect to get these books off the list?  I keep 
offocializing but they keep showing up on the list.  The physical books may 
not be showing up 
because, as per a previous memo from you, the book names are actually 
INTRA-MONTH-CANADA, and then there are desks are CAN-WEST, CAN-BC and 
CAN-BCPIPE

Kathy:

the following Canada intramonth books were on our unoofficialized list this 
morning.  Can you please provide postids for the the books.  I noticed that 
for Basis books the related Prc book did receive a post ID.  Were the post 
ids for the PRC books sent to Robin and  Roc so that they could override the 
basis information with the post ids?  Please advise as soon as possible.  I 
will be in class today, but please communicate with Burton regarding the 
status of these books.

Hey,

Several of us are going to lunch today.  It's kind of a combination birthday 
party and going away party for Crystal.  Oops I shouldn't have told you she's 
coming...just kidding.  You're invited if you want to come.  But I understand 
if you are too busy today to take a long lunch.  Let me know if you want to 
come.

Lynn,

I spoke with Laura Luce on Friday, and she asked me to coordinate with you to 
arrange a visit to the Chicago office.  We tentatively discussed scheduling 
my visit for Friday January 26 to Monday Jan 29.  Please let me know if these 
dates are still convenient and who I need to contact to make all the 
necessary arrangements.

Thank you for your help,
Robin

Any hope yet?

Hey Becky,

Shannon forwarded me your last email.  I'm so sorry.  I wish there was 
something I could do or say, but I know that I can't really say anything that 
would help.  Just know that I'm thinking about you guys.  I'm glad to hear 
you got to go running.  I'm sure that was a great stress relief.  How's your 
knee doing by the way.  

I'm still spending most of my days answering stupid questions.  Some people 
just drive me nuts.  They come freaking out telling me something's wrong.  
And if they just relax a minute I can usually explain the problem.  Most of 
the time it's not even wrong they just don't understand the reports.  They 
finally announced that we're selling HPL today.  It's about time that that's 
actually going to happen.  

You'll be glad to know that since I had way too much free time lately (I mean 
I been getting at least 4 hours of sleep lately...way more than any one 
person should have) I'm taking a GMAT review course.  We'll see in a couple 
of months if I have any hope of getting into graduate school.   You wanna 
hear the latest breaking news in my career?  If not skip the next couple of 
sentences.  Shannon doesn't even know this yet.  She might have if she'd quit 
blowing off our lunch plans.   I'm going to visit the Chicago office to talk 
to them about me working up there for a year.  I've talked to a manager in 
the office and the VP over the office already and the job sounds really 
interesting.  But I'm going to go up there and see if I think they are lying 
to me.  We'll see how that goes.  I'm not sure what I think about living 
somewhere that cold.  I'm not sure I even have clothes to go for the 
interview, much less to live up there.  

Has Shannon told you about the guy I'm seeing?  She doesn't think he's too 
bright.  He didn't exactly make the best first impression on her.  He really 
is smart no matter what she tells you.  He's a super nice guy, much nicer 
than me (I know, I know that's not saying much).  But the best part is we 
really have a lot of fun together.  We're always laughing and cutting up when 
we're together.  He's from Mexico and we worked together until the end of 
October when he moved to another group.  Then he came home with me for 
Thanksgiving, but we were still just friends then.  It was pretty obvious 
that there was more there though.  We started dating the next weekend.  It's 
been kind of crazy though.  Since we worked together and we had to review 
each other and we didn't want everyone in our business we haven't told anyone 
we work with that we're dating.  So that's been pretty interesting.  No one's 
said anything yet, but I know there are plenty of rumors going around.  It 
really wouldn't bother me if people found out now since reviews are over and 
he and I are comfortable enough with each other that we can take all the 
questions and harrassment from everyone in risk.  

Well my boss has walked by about 10 times and seen me doing nothing but 
sending emails each time, so I probably better get back to work.  I'd love to 
hear from you if you have time.  If not I understand.  

Robin

I'm in no hurry.

What's he doing now?  Let me know when you can get away for a second and 
we'll go buy stamps.  I just surfing the web to see what I can find out about 
Chicago, so my schedule's pretty flexible.

So, I take it your having a bad day.  Don't let him stress you out.  Is there 
anything I can do to help?  I'm headed downstairs to buy stamps later.   Let 
me know if you want anything from downstairs.  

No one's asked the questions I was expecting.  I think Anne was too drunk to 
remember asking.  I'm sure it'll come back up eventually.  

Are you still planning to go work out at lunch?

Hope everything gets better.
Robin

I told Gabriel about your hairdryer story.  He was appropriately disgusted.  
I'm writing procedures for what I do...ya wanna come help me?

Harry,

A little birdie told me today was your birthday!!  Unfortunately the little 
birdie gave me the wrong email address the first time or you would have had 
this email earlier.  Anyway, I wanted to wish you a very Happy Birthday.  
Hope you have a great day and we'll see you guys this weekend.

Robin

Are you sure about that email address???  I sent one and it bounced...or was 
that just another test?

Harry,

A little birdie told me today was your birthday.  Happy Birthday!!!  Hope you 
have a great day and we'll see you guys this weekend.  

Robin

You know what would have been a fabulous piece of information to go with this 
email??  Harry's email address.

Stop by on your way home and I'll give you a piece.  

Chris,

Below Wei explains what the option class cd column should contain. Please fix 
this error before saving the file out tonight.  If you have any questions let 
me know.

Thanks,
Robin

Robin,

I have set it up for this spreadsheet and I already ran it in stage 
database.  The only error message I got was 'OPT_CLASS_CD INVALID'.  
Option_class_cd should be one of the following: 'AMR', 'ASI', 'ASM', and 
'EUR'.  'USD' in the spreadsheet is more like a currency_cd.

What's going on?  Nothing is happening down here.  I know I whine when I'm 
too busy, but frankly I'm having trouble thinking of things to do today.  Are 
you guys busy?  Is your boss freaking out today?  I just got a call from AA, 
so I guess that'll keep me busy for a while. 

Do you have lunch plans?  I'm thinking about just a trip to the cafeteria.  
Let me know if you want to join me.

Thanks.
K.

My social schedule isn't the problem...that one's pretty clear.  But I'll 
look at my work schedule and have my people call you.  As far as I know any 
day next week should be good for me.  Just give me a call.

Be nice to me or I'll change the p&l again and you'll never be able to close 
the year.

You don't talk to me for months and you email just to give me crap!!  What's 
up with that?!

Thanks,

It wasn't just me changing plans.  All I ask is that sometime over the 
weekend we see Finding Forrester.  And of course get my car aligned Sat. and 
a tuneup Monday.  Now that I'm thinking about it I'm going to be spending a 
lot of money this weekend on things that aren't exactly fun.  Oh well.  

I'm planning to get out of here around 4:30ish if nothing goes wrong.  So 
just call me at home when you get home.  Oh, yeah....Chipper means happy, or 
in a good mood, kind of in a bouncy mood.

Talk to ya later,
Robin

You sound chipper anyway.   I'm actually bored today.  We haven't had any 
problems today.  I'm not used to that so I really know what to do with my 
time.  That and it's Friday and I don't really want to do anything.

How did you get back to your desk that fast?

How's you day going?  Mine's much better.  Haven't heard from Canada all 
day.  Did you come in early today?

As an update on Canada, I replied to Kathy's email and told her we weren't 
going to change 2000.  So she fired off an email to Jeff and made him mad.  I 
told him they wouldn't listen to me and his comment was "They'll listen to 
Sally."  Hehehe.  We'll see, but I'm not convinced that Canada will listen to 
anyone.

So what's the verdict?

Kathy,

The 2000 DPR is closed.  Therefore no more changes can be made.  As I stated 
in my earlier email, either the 4.1 million adjustment was never actually 
made to the DPR or it is included in our number because the trading and 
origination p&l that I am reporting ties with what the DPR is reporting.

Robin

Kathy Reeves
01/10/2001 04:57 PM
Robin,
$4.1 M was to have been reduced from our Q1 trading income to break out the 
origination correctly.  It looks like this was never done in your report.  I 
thought it had been based on previous Emails.  I don't think the p&l in your 
report is correct as it is $4.1M too high.  This is what our trading income 
at Dec 31 should be.  Note:  the DPR was never adjusted because the LTD and 
YTD numbers do not exclude orgination income.  It also looks like the break 
out by trader is not quite right

Kathy

Robin Rodrigue

Kathy,

I am attaching a copy of the NGPL that was reported as of this morning.  If 
you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by 
approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million 
year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million 
variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the 
Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations 
and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either 
our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination 
adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, 
I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for 
December.  

Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a 
call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances.

 

Thanks,
Robin

Kathy Reeves
12/07/2000 06:46 PM
Robin
I would like to make sure before year end that the p&l being reporting for 
Canada ( trading profits only) equals what I think it is as per attached:

Would you let me know what you are currently reporting for Canada.

Thanks
Kathy

Here a quick summation of my morning...CANADA SUCKS!!!!  First they 
rearranged their P&L file and moved the order that the traders appear and 
don't bother to tell us, but here's the fun part they didn't rename the 
columns.  So they had McKay's P&L reported in a  column that was titled 
Lambie.  Makes perfect sense right?  Then they call me and tell me that they 
need to move Disturnal's position and VAR under John Arnold, but they want to 
keep his p&l in Canada.  Another fun bit of Canadian "logic."

And here my favorite.  I got an email from Kathy this morning in reply to an 
email I sent her on December 8.  She told me that the p&l we reported for the 
first quarter of 2000 was wrong and we need to change our numbers by 4 
million to match was she thinks it should be!!!  She said that they adjusted 
the DPR in the summer to move 4 million from trading to originations.   As if 
that isn't bad enough, consider the fact that I've already explained to her 
at least twice that she's completely high b/c I tie to the DPR for Canadian 
p&l and for the originations total.  

Excluding canada (I've decided they don't deserve to have their country 
capitalized) my day's been good.   I'll have to fill you in on all the EMT 
stories my friend told me.  They were really funny.

I'll whine more later,
Robin

You never told me about the glass eye. That must have been a very embarrasing 
situation. I wonder if  that is painful. I imagine not. Maybe it was painful 
to EMT's pocket since I am sure they paid for the replacement.

Hey, are going to Jeff Skilling's Analyst kick off ?   How's your day? Mine 
is going to be pretty good as long as I stay away from embarrasing 
situations.

 I appreciate everyone's help in making sure that all the information for 
Lagrasta's originated is deals is accurate.  He is now receiving a daily 
report with all originated deals.  

 He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has 
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to 
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if 
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put 
all the relevant information into the origination file and just put a $0 for 
the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Oohhh that is fine. Not a problem.  I love biiiiigggg breakfasts in NIICE 
restaurants. 

What is up with me in this group. They are definitely going to fire me. We 
were in a conference call with  the CEO of the Transportation company. His 
counselors, his tax lawyer, his investment bank, my boss, our counselor, our 
tax expert, and other very important people. Actually the conference was very 
very interesting. We (they, I just listened)basically talked about what to do 
with the unvested options of all the employees from the transport company, we 
talked about how the deal was going to change from a Stock purchase to a 
Merger. We talked about tax strategies, etc. It was very interesting.  HERE 
is the funny part. When we were discussing about all these things, I decided 
to stretch my leg  and guess what? "I unplugged the phone line".  Yeahh we 
missed some of the conversation.   My boss was like "ohhh sh.....".  I 
thought it was funny, but obviously he did not think so. 

Oohhh you know what. I actually work Monday. My boss decided to veto our 
holiday Monday.   I am going to come in just to sort out all the due 
dilligence paperwork. It will be for a couple of hours only. YOu can take my 
car, and when the car is ready, you can probably pick me up and we'll go and 
pick it up.   

Gabriel

 I couldn't schedule my car appointment for Sat.  They were booked.  So I had 
to schedule it for Monday, and you'll love this.  I need to have it there by 
9am!!  So, if you're still willing to take me to drop it off I'll buy you 
breakfast and then we can go home and take naps.  

I'm leaving now.   Goodnight.

Canada officializes one calc that includes both their price and basis 
positions.  Risktrac only recognizes the book id to which it assigns the post 
id.  Since the Canada post id includes two books ids,  we manually assign the 
same post id to the basis book so that both books are picked up.

   

Robin,
I have to get this email out and I'm looking for your help. Can you proof 
read what I wrote and "correct" things that are wrong...

Thanks,

Frank

Debbie,

I spoke with Robin and she confirmed that:
One post id for both price and basis books
She overrides the price book

The reason is that Risktrac needs unique book id/post id combo's.  However, 
the price book comes in no matter what, so she overrides the price book in 
order to pull in the basis book...She added that she also did not understand 
why they use one post id..

Yeah, you are way too excitable in the mornings.  I get dizzy just reading 
your emails.  

I'm on my way home.  Give me a call at home if you guys decide to go do 
something.

Looks like there might be hope of me leaving sometime tonight.  I'm hoping 
for around 9-9:30.  I'll page you before I leave.

PS. I'm still not awake.

Great.  We're never going to get to eat are we?  I was actually thinking of 
taking a long lunch and then dropping you off back here and I'd disappear for 
another couple of hours.  However, Lavo just called and wanted Jeff in his 
office, so I'm not sure I'm going to get to leave at all.  I'll let you know 
when Jeff gets back.

As you are aware, Enron signed an agreement with Blockbuster Inc. last summer 
to launch an entertainment on-demand service.  We announced today that we are 
discontinuing our exclusive relationship with Blockbuster in order to expand 
the offering by developing direct relationships with content providers and 
distribution partners.

We have made tremendous progress toward our goal of becoming the leading 
provider of entertainment on-demand over a digital platform.  We rolled out 
the trial service in Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City and New York in 
December, and today subscribers are buying movies on-demand using the service 
we created.

However, the exclusive relationship with Blockbuster has not yielded the 
quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting, new 
on-demand service.  Now that we have proven the concept, we want to take our 
service to the next level by adding content and subscribers on an accelerated 
basis.  We feel that this can be best achieved by pursuing entertainment 
on-demand independently.

We intend to initiate discussions with various content providers for 
delivering their content over the Enron platform.  We remain very positive 
about the potential of this business for EBS and Enron and will keep you 
apprised of our progress.

Hey Lynn,

Were you ever able to find a parking space for me?

I definitely want them.  We had several questions last month about why some 
curves where included where they were.  So it'd be nice to be able to blame 
someone else!  How's your day going?  How long did it take you to get up the 
elevator?  I made it in before the crowd backed up.  But apparently one of 
the elevators got stuck.  You know Dave Delainey's admin, Beverely.  She said 
she was stuck in the elevator for about 45 minutes this morning!!  She didn't 
seem too excited about it either.

Talk to ya later,

Hey,  I have the original list of physical curves for the basis report that 
we divided up in  East, West, Central and Canada.  Remeber? It is the one 
that Gossett helped us divide into all these regions.  I also have the one 
where all the desk leads wrote their physical curves on.  If you want them 
I'll keep them, if not, they will be autodestroyed in 5 seconds.

again. Take care.                             P.S. I am writing this from my

Good morning.  How's your day going?  Mines pretty good...no screaming yet.  
But then there's still plenty of hours left in this day.  Could you send the 
the procedures you wrote for this job.  Don't you think it's about time I 
figured out what I was supposed to be doing?  

Thanks,

I'm doing my best to be out by 6.

Unfortunately YES.

I wish I had left.   I'm in Disable HELL.

What???  Why did he call you?  NGPL related or Trucking P&L related?

Virendra,

Several books were set up in Risktrac will incorrect names.  Is it possible 
to simply change the names of the books already set up or do we need to have 
new books set up?

Thanks,

I saw the article but it wouldn't load the picture of the volcano.  You

I'm going to throw up!!!  I don't know who this chick is down here, but Rock 
is telling her about the Bench.  And of course he's telling her how important 
he is and what a great job he does.  I don't think I can stay quiet much 
longer!!!

He managed to screw up 3 days worth of Basis Reports on Friday!!  How I have 
no idea.  I had already rolled everything.  All he had to do was query and 
calc it.  Go figure.  

Robin

Yeah, I know...I'm a grown woman I don't you telling me what to do! Just 
kididng.  I just completely forgot about it this weekend.  I meant to drop it 
off Sat. and then us go shopping.  Oh well.  If I don't get to it I'll have 
it done as soon as I get to Lake Charles.  The other stuff shouldn't take 
that long.  It's just a matter of actually making myself go do it.  

Call me when you get out of French.  I'll probably still be packing, so you 
can stop by and visit.

RR

I was just thinking about emailing you...no I really was.  It's scary, we 
think alike.  I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow.  I have soooooo much to 
do today.  Well a lot of it probably won't get done at this point.  I've 
pretty much given up on most of it getting done before I leave.   After work 
I'm going to find a notary so I can drop all this ticket stuff off.  And I 
have to get my oil changed, and if I have time I'm going to go get my 
brother's cd.  Oh and I have to pack...can't exactly put that one off any 
more.  But other than that I'm free this evening.  Do you have French?  

I'll call you later.

It was hard to wake up after that dinner though.  Was it hard for you?  I

My boss is sick again today.  Now, the outcome of that is really uncertain. 
He will either delay the whole due dilligence  process or maybe he will want 
to catch up and have us work even harder during the weekend.  

PS if you catch the cruise in New Orleans  after Christmas, do you think 
you'll make it to Veracruz for New Year's Eve.

Gabriel

Are you inviting me or just asking if the boat will make it on time?  If you 
invitingme I'd love to come but....I have to be back here the day after 
Christmas.  And Rock's off that week so there's no chance I could take off.   
I'll just have to stay here all by myself.  

If we go to lunch today, it'll have to be kind of quick.  I have my meeting 
with the analyst people at 11:30 and another meeting at 1:00.

than Tech.  Well I'd write more but I have to go home for my nap.  I'm 
working a double shift so I'm leaving for a nap from about 10-2.  It makes 
the day pass much faster.

This is like a little college campus. Once you're
here, you're here. If I had a car, I'd drive into town
and explore a bit.

Hopefully there won't be too many delays tomorrow when
I am leaving.

Any last words for your car before I leave for my nap??  Don't worry I'm a 
"safe driver."  I'll sleep a little extra for you.  

How's everything going this morning?

Hey Becky,

I haven't heard from you in a while.  I know, I know, you haven't heard from 
me either.  I wanted to check in and see how you're doing.  I talked to 
Shannon and she filled me in on how Megan's doing.  I want you to know my 
family and I are praying for you guys.  I know everyone says this but if 
there is anything I can do I'd love to help out.  I'm going Christmas 
shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.  I've got 
to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.  He had a 
hip replacement in October and is still hobbling around.  He's actually doing 
really well considering he had major surgery.   I think he expected to be 
running marathons by now.  

I'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right 
now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right 
now...WORK.  I think my other group members are trying to kill me this 
month.  We have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each 
day.  Well, I have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one 
week this month.  So that's pretty much all I have time to do now.  In fact 
I'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this 
afternoon.  That is the one bonus of this split shift day.  

Let me know how you're doing when you get a chance.

know she's the best risk person we have, but give me a break!
Kathy Reeves
12/13/2000 06:31 PM
Robin,
As of the end of the 13th Clark had a Sumas Intramonth Position of 2 
contracts.  

Regarding prompt physical and gas daily positions I don't think that the risk 
is being correctly reflected on the basis reports for Canada given the way 
our market trades (despite what Lavo says he wants).

Kathy

Robin Rodrigue
12/13/2000 07:00 AM
Kathy,

I added Clark's Aeco position, however I don't show a Sumas Basis position.  
Let me know how much of a sumas basis position he should have and I'll try to 
find it.   As for the prompt physical and gas daily positions, Lavorato 
requested that those positions be shown for intramonth only.  We have other 
traders in Houston that have prompt physical and gas daily positions that are 
not shown on this report.  

Brian,

I adjusted McKay and Lambie's positions, so they should be correct now.  Let 
me know if we are still off.   I have attached a copy of the report 
containing December 12th basis positions.  

Thank you for your help.
Robin

Kathy Reeves
12/11/2000 05:34 PM
Robin,
I have reconciled the positions for Clark and Cowan.  Brian Gillis will do 
Disturnal, Lambie & McKay

I believe that Clark & Cowan's positions were incorrect because of the 
following:
1)  Clark has positions at Sumas and Aeco/Stn2.  This is not reflected in the 
spreadsheet.
2)   Our basis positions for the prompt month in our Intramonth books are not 
being picked up any where.  Because our IM traders actually trade for this 
month AND the prompt month their physical and gas daily positions should be 
picked up as basis positions for the prompt month as well as intramonth.  For 
example, Cowan is long 189 contracts physically Aeco for January.   Our IM 
traders trade prompt and well as intramonth because of the way our Aeco 
prices settle (ie:  during the month preceding, not during bidweek).

Kathy

Robin Rodrigue
12/11/2000 07:58 AM
Brian/Kathy,

I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every 
morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points.  
Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders 
are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are 
added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for 
intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month 
position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other 
time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a 
call.  

Thanks,
Robin

I remember when I was Looking for an apartment the locator always made a sale 
pitch on the fireplace. I always said I didn't care. This is the time  when 
you regret that, but anyways.   I first thought of just going to dinner, then 
I thought of maybe doing something else.  Now, I don't know anything.  Why 
do  you need to know if we do something else?   Do you worry you might go to 
bed a little late?   I do not want you to not get a good sleep just because 
of my birthday!!

I'll keep thinking. I will be here and probably will not go to my french

I hate to disappoint you, but I made it alive. With no
delays actually. I'm now staring out of a window
watching it snow (that's the cold white stuff that you
see on TV). They're expecting 6" today ontop of what
is already here. Everything is white...it looks like a
postcard. Wish I had thought to bring a camera. The
temperature when I landed was ZERO degrees. Today will
reach a balmy 22 degrees.

I'm finally finished with Defensive Driving.  What a complete waste of my 
time!!  I passed though.  Can you imagine failing and having to take it 
again?!!  I think I'd rather just pay the extra insurance than sit through 
that again.   It turns out that I only had about 20 minutes left to watch.  
If I'd known that I would have finished it yesterday.  

Have you decided what you want to do tonight?  I had a great nap, so I'm up 
for whatever you want to do (within reason that is). 

Gotta go Canada's calling.
Robin

I'm headed to become a "safe driver."  

Robin

I thought about giving you a personal Happy Birthday wake up call this 
morning when I got up, but I thought after the night before you probably 
needed all the sleep you could get.  So see here I was being nice...there's 
just no pleasing some people.  

I got home about 10 last night which I was pretty excited about.  But no 
sooner did I get comfortable as I got a call from Rock.  AAAAAAHHHHHHHH.  
Sorry that just slipped out.  I'll have to vent later.

I'll give you a birthday call later.

Don't you think that you are going to get away with just leaving a message.  
I am waiting for a more personal Happy Birthday call. 

Thanks anyways. 

What time did you get out of here yesterday?

Gabriel

Kathy,

I added Clark's Aeco position, however I don't show a Sumas Basis position.  
Let me know how much of a sumas basis position he should have and I'll try to 
find it.   As for the prompt physical and gas daily positions, Lavorato 
requested that those positions be shown for intramonth only.  We have other 
traders in Houston that have prompt physical and gas daily positions that are 
not shown on this report.  

Brian,

I adjusted McKay and Lambie's positions, so they should be correct now.  Let 
me know if we are still off.   I have attached a copy of the report 
containing December 12th basis positions.  

Thank you for your help.
Robin

Kathy Reeves
12/11/2000 05:34 PM
Robin,
I have reconciled the positions for Clark and Cowan.  Brian Gillis will do 
Disturnal, Lambie & McKay

I believe that Clark & Cowan's positions were incorrect because of the 
following:
1)  Clark has positions at Sumas and Aeco/Stn2.  This is not reflected in the 
spreadsheet.
2)   Our basis positions for the prompt month in our Intramonth books are not 
being picked up any where.  Because our IM traders actually trade for this 
month AND the prompt month their physical and gas daily positions should be 
picked up as basis positions for the prompt month as well as intramonth.  For 
example, Cowan is long 189 contracts physically Aeco for January.   Our IM 
traders trade prompt and well as intramonth because of the way our Aeco 
prices settle (ie:  during the month preceding, not during bidweek).

Brian/Kathy,

I have attached a copy of a report that is given to John Lavorato every 
morning.  This report shows basis positions by trader for specific points.  
Please let me know if the positions we are reporting for the Canadian traders 
are correct.  If you unhide columns C-S you will find the curves that are 
added in each section.  The curves highlighted in green are used for 
intramonth positions and the white are the basis curves.   The intra-month 
position that shows is a combination of  physical and gas daily.  All other 
time periods are only basis notional.  If you have any questions give me a 
call.  

Thanks,

your friend Charlene just met with Tim. I don't know why. 

I had to look for something in my sent mail earlier.  At least half, if not 
more, of the emails I send are to you!!

I didn't make it to the final test.  I didn't get out of here until after 
11:30.   So I only wasted two hours of my life this afternoon.  I still have 
one section left.  If I can get out of here at a decent time I'll finish it 
tonight.  Otherwise I'll finish it tomorrow at lunch.  I have to finish it by 
tomorrow or I'll have to pay another $40!  So it's not safe to ride with me 
yet.  Not that my car ever really leaves the Enron garage!  

I'm glad you'll be getting out of here early.

No.  That's not the gossip.  I probably have you more excited than you should 
be now.  It's not as interesting as you're probably thinking now.  I spent 
three hours dozing through defensive driving this afternoon.  It's horrible.  
They just keep saying the same things over and over.  

What time do you think you'll get out of here tonight?  At the rate we're 
going I'm never going home.  No one is finished yet.  Talk to ya later.

Gabriel Monroy
12/11/2000 04:40 PM
I hope the gossip is not about Jennifer  finding out about you know what.  We 
did not have Spanish. Even though I am not busy we were kind of determined to 
finish fixing the model. We are tired of it.  I am also tired of looking at 
it. Did you start watching Defensive Driving?

No not the HR Spy.  I was in the middle of emailing you when Jennifer walked 
up to chit chat.  I didn't even think about it and left my email up the whole 
time she was here.  But I went back and read it and I hadn't written anything 
incriminating yet.  

Talk to ya later.  How was Spanish?

Gabriel Monroy
12/11/2000 10:30 AM
C'moon tell me. What happened? What do you mean you almost got busted? Spy?

Just hoping I guess.   B/c mom already told me I wasn't getting anything from 
them, and I haven't picked out anything from the Grandmas, so even if I do 
get something it just means I'm going to have to find some corner of the 
closet to hide it in!!  How was that for a run on sentence!  I'm not sure I 
believe we're going to have sleet here tomorrow.  It's still hot and muggy 
outside now.

Before you go mail me your house keys and tell me where you've hidden my 
Christmas presents.  Sorry we won't get to see you for Christmas.  Hope you 
like Chicago.  Maybe you'll make it back by Easter.  

Ruston was good.  The game was awesome!!  It was so loud in there my ears 
were ringing when I left.  We lost but it was a much closer game than I 
expected.  My favorite part was when Pat Summitt was whining and the crowd 
starting chanting "Sit down, Pat!" 

Keith and Susan was crazy as usual.  I had a blast over there.  

Talk to ya later.  Good luck with your trip.

So how is Ruston? Anything exciting going on?

I'm heading to Chicogo this week. (St. Charles
actually) I'm hoping that I will even make it. The
weather is so bad up there that they are cancelling
flights now. And what am I supposed to do once I'm
there? Do you think that this poor little Texas boy
has ice and snow clothes? What use would I have for a
wool coat down here. I'm going to freeze my tushy off.

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  

Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name

FL Sup. Court overruled the Appellate Court decision. They are going to do a

How about that??

If we'd known that we could have stayed longer and had a few drinks.  I 
haven't accomplished anything since I've been back so it wouldn't have

Robin,
Could you please send me Canada's p&L that you are reporting.  The same file 
that you sent last month is fine.  This is what our income should be.
Kathy

Kathy,

I am attaching a copy of the NGPL that was reported as of this morning.  If 
you look at the by Trader P&L, we are off from your spreadsheet by 
approximately $3.6 million USD for December and approximately $7.6million 
year to date.  The $7.6 consists of the December variance and the $4 million 
variance that we discussed earlier (originations).  However, I spoke with the 
Chris Able from the Controls group, what we are reporting for originations 
and for Canadian p&l ties to the DPR.   This leads me to believe that either 
our number already includes the origination adjustment or the origination 
adjustment was never made to the DPR.  To help resolve the December variance, 
I have added a tab to your file to show what we have reported each day for 
December.  

Remember the p&l we are reporting by trader excludes originations.  Give me a 
call when you have time and we can try to resolve these variances.

 

Thanks,
Robin

Kathy Reeves
12/07/2000 06:46 PM
Robin
I would like to make sure before year end that the p&l being reporting for 
Canada ( trading profits only) equals what I think it is as per attached:

Would you let me know what you are currently reporting for Canada.

Thanks
Kathy

Thank goodness she's in when Congress will be a complete deadlock on every 
issue that is brought up!!  I really don't want  a government that can't even 
manage their money or make a decision in under a year deciding what doctor I 
can see.  It probably will reduce medical cost significantly.  People will 
just die before they can wade through the red tape to go to the doctor!!!

Later,
Robin

What CRAP!!!  They have no political voice and the machines are old, give me 
a break!  They didn't have a problem electing more blacks to their 
legislature, so I guess they weren't denied the right to vote.  That last 
quote by Jackson!!!  Oh my goodness, cry me a river.  

I can't believe they can even say all this crap with a straight face.  But 
then I'm sure I'm prejudice.  

Don't send me any more of this crap today.  I'm trying to enjoy my Friday.  
I'm headed to Ruston this weekend.  I'm going to see Tech and Tennessee.  I 
think I told you that already.  I'm going to visit Fake family while I'm 
there of course.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

I have to clean out my inbox every few minutes so someone doesn't see my 
email pop and see all the emails from you!!  Our "privacy" is definitely not 
going to last long.

I think this is a good chance to get back on our Monday schedule.  Not that I 
don't want to have Spanish, but.....  If we didn't have Spanish you and I 
could go to lunch.

Robin

That was the whole purpose of it, so maybe you'll change your mind and stay

think if we are going to have Spanish or not. Fridays and Spanish don't get 
along.

I am planning on going downstairs to grab a sandwich?   Do you have time? If 
you are doing something don't worry (honestly).  I did finish, but it was 
funny the way I finished it. 
Thanks for asking. You are so nice!

How's everything going?  Did you finish on time?

Most of the time we meet these deadlines.  Several days the P&L hasn't been 
exported by 7:20 b/c I was waiting for the Management p&l changes, so that 
there wouldn't be such large changes between our preliminary and final 
p&l's.  If you rather I didn't wait let me know.  There have been a couple of 
days I've just forgotten, but that's not a regular occurance.  

Robin

Jeffrey C Gossett
12/07/2000 10:48 AM
Are we missing any of these "deadlines" and, if so, Why?

Over the past few weeks, we have not been receiving information from the risk 
management groups on a timely basis.    This memo serves to convey our 
deadlines to you and to reiterate deadlines for the risk management group.

Our reporting is as follows (Houston time):

7:45 - posting of preliminary DPR to website (needed to be done prior to RAC 
8am meeting)
7:45 - 2:00 - preparation of the violation/notification memos
2:00 - finalization of the DPR & memos

In order to meet these deadlines we need the risk management departments to 
meet the following deadlines (Houston time):

before leaving to go home (Houston): officialization of books (to ensure 
information is captured in VAR engine and Credit AGG)
4:00 (London):  officialization and sending of feeds to IT
7:20 (all): export of preliminary information
7:20-3:00: support on explanations of violations/notification memos
11:00 (London only): export of final information (needed at that time for 
Merchant Asset group)
12:00 (Houston only): export of final information
 
Everyday at least one group misses the deadline, which is unacceptable.  
Please ensure deadlines are met going forward.  Remember, the DPR cannot go 
out until all information is received and final so one group holds up the 
whole process.

Thank you,

Shona Wilson

No Problem!

Hope everything's okay today.

anything and be done with it.  There's no chance I'll get promoted

etc.  Goss thought it was hilarious.

I'll let you know how everything's going, or I'll call you when I leave.

What did you charge $1,000 for?  I haven't gotten anywhere on my 
accomplishments.  Right after I emailed you we discovered some major issues 
with the basis report, so it looks like I'll be doing accomplishments 
tonight.  I'm still hoping I can come to your game though.  It doesn't start

Hi Robin,

Who all initially need access to the new report?
Who will be publishing the report?

Thanks,

Annemieke

How did you start your accomplishments?  About the only thing I'm coming up 
with is "Once upon a time I didn't work in risk and I had a life."  There's 
probably a better way to do it though.

Yeah you're gonna have to explain that one...I'm confused.  I didn't go last 
year so I don't know how they check everyone at the door.  

I know what you meant in your earlier email.  That was kind of strange.  
Hopefully I'll get out of here at a decent time.  And if I can get my 
accomplishments done during the day today that would be fabulous.  Maybe I 
could even come watch you play soccer.   But all that hinges on my 
accomplishments.  And of course since I put it off until today, we violated 
every limit we have this morning!  Well we didn't violate p&l, just VAR and 
positions.  So I'm sure I'll spend most of the day answering questions.

See you at lunch.

I can't believe it...I just saw Phillip Allen laugh!!!  Like laugh out loud!  
Shocking isn't it?  I don't know what caused this phenomenon but I thought

Thank you to those who have already RSVP'd for this informative brown bag

insight into our business.  Please RSVP ASAP, Okay?

Jen Fraser, Director of Origination in EGM - December 5 from 12 to 1 in 30C1

Of course I remember.  I have a great Spanish teacher.   I'm RSVPing as soon 
as I send this so I'll see you tomorrow at lunch if not before.

Te quiero tambien.

Gossett officially asked me for my accomplishments today.  I have to have 
them done by tomorrow night.  So I guess that's what I'll be doing the rest 
of the day(not that I've had that many accomplishments just that it'll take 
me that long to think of something.)  I knew I might as well add that last 
crack b/c if I didn't you would have!

Robin

I wish you would have sent me this BEFORE I ran into her today.  I had no 
idea if you'd talked to her or not so I wasn't going to say anything and make 
her made at you.  Anyway, I guess she's going to be good at keeping in quiet 
b/c I didn't know if she knew or not.  And as for the admitting in front of 
other people, I did tell you about this.  She asked me if you had left for 
Austin yet and I said no.  And then someone asked me what I was doing for the 
weekend and I said I was going Christmas shopping in San Marcos.  No mention 
of you or Austin.   Oh well, I guess we'll see how long the "secret" lasts.  
Was she mad at you?

Talk to ya later,

You really want to leave badly, don't you?  I don't think I have anything you 
can do though.  I packed when I went home for my nap, so as soon as I can get 
out of here I'm ready to go.  So go home and watch a couple of movies and 
then I should be ready to go.

What you talkin' bout Willis?  Actually I just got back about 3.  I went home 
and took a little nap!!  It was awesome.  But to answer your question yeah 
I'm ready to go.  I probably shouldn't leave, but I'm definitely ready!!!  

Gabriel Monroy
12/01/2000 03:41 PM
Are you almost done with everything?  Ready to go!. HE HE HE

You don't have me beat.  We have them delivered at least a couple times a 
year.  The first time I saw the lobby filled with Krispy Kreme's I thought I 
must have died and that was heaven.  They were handing out boxes to people as 
they got of the elevators.  If they did that everyday I would be more excited 
to get here. of course then I'd have to take the freight elevator b/c 
anything else would be too small.  I got to work at 3:45 this morning, so I'm 
actually going to leave pretty soon.  Unfortunately I'll be back later.  One 
of our people is on vacation so I'm covering the night shift tonight.  So it 
should be a nice 20 hour day today. 

I'm going Christmas shopping this weekend, so let me know if you still need 
something for mom.  Not that I have any great ideas, but I'm hoping I can 
find her some clothes.  If all else fails I'll get her blue earrings!!  I'm 
tempted to find somewhere where I can buy blue and red earrings in bulk and 
give her a couple dozen pairs of each.  

Are you watching CNN right now?  One of the protestors is holding a sign that 
has Gore's name written with the communist sickle as the G.  It's pretty 
funny.  I also like the Sore Loserman signs.  

Enjoy a doughnut for me.
Robin

Paul Rodrigue <paulrodrigue@yahoo.com> on 12/01/2000 09:08:20 AM

had over 50 dozen delivered here this morning. yum yum yum...

Hey Girlie,

Well, it's official.  I'm moving to Chicago.  This is my last week in 
Houston.  I start work up there on March 12th.  If your free for lunch 
sometime this week let me know.  

Robin

Unfortunately I'm afraid that your last estimate is probably the most

Vern,

I am now responsible for publishing the EES Gas Position Report.   It seems 
that the websave version that I received in the attached email is not updated 
to publish the EES report.  Could you please send me an updated version or 
let me know what I need to do so that I can publish this report?

Thank you,
Robin

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  

Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

You mean I'm not half-way yet???!!  I was planning to go home about 11.

You didn't expect me to be awake in Spanish did you?

Gabriel Monroy
11/30/2000 08:23 AM
4:15 am?? wow, you are you pretty much getting ready for your mid-day break?

   

Would you copy the code from the macro you use to push your spreadsheets into 
the Executive reports and send it to me (you can send it in a Word document)?

Thanks.

Debbie,

Thank you for returning my call.  I went to the eRequest to submit a request 
for Risktrac but the only option was to get access to the application.  I 
already have the application I merely need access to the VAR module.  
Therefore, I did not submit an eRequest.  Please let me know what I need to 
submit to ensure I get the proper access.

Thank you,
Robin

Now's the time to buy stock...before we report this year's earnings!!

Vlady,

Here is the P&L breakout you requested.  If you have any questions give me a 
call.

He he, I sent you a call from somebody with a really weird name. Your friend 
Kathy wants to see a report.  Now I know who you are talking about.  Isn't 
she annoying?  

A meeting with Disable.... can't wait to have that much fun?

My day has been great. Well, more and more I realize that my stress is all my 
boss' fault.   Now that I have the associate with me I realize that he (my 
boss) does not explain things the way they should be explained.  The 
associate does not understand a lot of things because our boss hasn't come up 
with many of the assumptions needed for the project we are working on....... 
and I thought it was all my lack of knowledge.  Anyways, I think I just need 
to learn how to work with my new boss. I need to come up with my own 
assumptions. 

Hey, did those initials mean something? or were you just typing?  How is your 
day??  Are you excited you are going to get out of here at a descent time?

GM (is that better?)

I was trying to tell you that the blonde chick from Donna's group is down 
here.  The woman that's always whining about something.  She's driving me 
nuts.  That and the fact that I had a long meeting this morning with your 
other buddy, Chris Disable.  All we did was go in circles for about 45 
minutes.

How's your day going?

Don't make the changes to the portfolios yet. We have been looking at these

opposed to adding it in Agg-Gas...
Lets talk about it before we add these books!

You might as well write your name as to put your initials!  

All I know is no one is here to answer my questions and they are all in the 
same PRC meeting.  I don't know if it's just the leads or if it's an HR 
meeting for all the departments.

Interesting though isn't it?

All of the leads are in a PRC meeting today...do you think that means we 
don't need to do our accomplishments?

Actually I already have plans with the "girls" from Accounting.  I think 
we're going to Lupe's.  You are invited if you want to come.  But give me a 
definite yes or no...none of this "I'd like to" crap.  

We're going to leave at 11:30.

Aleluya, my boss talked to one associate in the group so he can sit by me and

explain everything from scratch. Anyways, just wanted to let you know. 

Bye. 

Brooklyn,

What's going on?  How was your holiday?  I thought about you this weekend.  
We had fried turkey.  It was sooo yummy.  I was going to bring you some, but 
there weren't even crums left.  

Well, I just wanted to brag.  So I'll leave you alone.

By the way, how was your trip to Kinder?  Did you have trouble finding the 
hotel or resturant?

Later,
Robin

Sorry to hear you're being hazed today.  I'm glad to know he thinks you are 
worth something.  You can be pretty certain I won't be coming to join your 
new group when I rotate.  I think I'm going to rotate to the Controls group 
so I don't have to do anything.

Yeah, I was way too excited to sleep last night.  Just thinking about all the 
fun I'd have this week.  Oh, here a highlight for your day.  I was excited 
today b/c I'd only have to work one shift this week.  I forgot Binh has today 
off too.  She won't be back until tomorrow, so I have another two shift 
day...YUCK!!!  And to top it off Irena just came by with the December 
calendar.  Binh has a week off and Rock has the last week of Dec through the 
first week of Jan off.  I'm sooo excited.  

Enough whining for now.  Are we having Spanish class today?

Bye-bye.
Robin

I am glad everything is fine on your side.  I am sorry you did not get much 
sleep.  It is a mistery why sometimes you have those nights where you wake up 
looking at the clock. I am sure your problem was due to your  excitement to 
come back to work. You could not wait any longer. Well, I am definitely not 
glad... the hazing started again, and I think it doubled.  If we look at it 
in an optimistic way, having me do these exercises that are really hard mean 
his expectations have not been lowered.  He still thinks I am worth 
something. 

Talk to you later. I am being subdued right now.

What...A tax book not helpful?  Aren't you glad you didn't have to suffer

rebuild the bench and the basis report but that's all!!  Lavo seemed happy 
with everything this morning.  No screaming anyway.   And no I didn't get 
much sleep last night, but it wasn't really your fault.  Even after I went to 
bed I just kept waking up.  It was one of those nights where you wake up and 
look at the clock at least once every hour.  I feel a little dazed but other 
than that I'm okay.

And no I'm not glad to be back at work.  Are you?

How is it possible that my Financial Statement Analysis book was more helpful

It was not even worth carrying that heavy book. Just kidding, thank you very 
much anyways.  Was everything ok this morning?

I felt bad I left really late last night. I hope you got some good rest. 
Glad you are back at work?

Brian, please see the file below.  It  represent an example of a spreadsheet

correct.  Call me if any questions.

Kathy/Brian,

As I'm sure you know we are trying to determine what is causing the Canadian 
VAR to be so high.  One possible cause that we would like your help 
investigating is the Curve Codes that are being loaded in the position files 
that are manually loaded into the system each night.  It is my understanding 
that positions will be correct even if the curves loaded are spelled  
incorrectly. However, incorrect curve names will result in the positions not 
being captured in the VAR calculation.  Please verify that all the curves are 
spelled correctly in all position files.  

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Robin

Will,

Please send me the official book names so that I can set this up in the

FT-Peoples needs to be removed from P Keavey - Currently it is being double

FT-CAND-EGSC-OPT-BAS 
FT-CAND-EGSC-OPT-PRC

I spoke with Annemieke and she said that you would be the person to contact 
about adding a report to the executive viewer.  We need to add a gas report.  
The title of the Report will be Natural Gas Basis by Trader.  I am attaching 
a copy of the report that will be published.  Please let me know if you need 
any additional information.

I spoke with Bilal.  It is our understanding that the morning VaR report 
regarding Canada represents how we are capturing positions right now.  We are 
currently decomposing/reconstructing Disturnal's book to capture by region 
code (overall positions would remain the same).  This would impact Disturnal 
positions which will be moved to either McKay or Lambie.   From our side we 
are waiting on  the  IT resolution..  We have set a deadline of the last week 
in November to get this in motion.   On Monday, Bilal will give you a detail 
breakout of the deadline for Canada.

Regarding the the Canadian P&L report, I left a message for Gillis to get the 
numbers out there.

Additionally, last week we resolved the Canadian derived curve problem 
(derived curves were improperly mapped and position was not be captured....)  
We re-ran VaR and the e-mail below summarizes the breakout.  Overall, desk 
VaR decreased because Canadian VaR increased (hedges out portfilio).

Hope this gives you an idea of our progress.
Frank
PS. We will be moving Enovate out of Hunter Shively's VaR and give it is own 
place on the bench. This will probably impact the Central Desk VaR by approx. 
200K

Jeff,

I took care of the Executive Viewer.  I talked to Frank and apparently 
Lavorato wants to see the Canadian breakout next week.  I already have 
everything set up to do the positions, but we need to work on Canada to get 
the P&L.  Intra-Canada has a breakout but it's only in Canadian dollars.  I 
left a message for Kathy to call me.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.

Talk to you Monday.

My management line is hidden on my hard copy report but not on the executive

Don't worry there's no rush.  Take your time and exhaust all your other 
options...don't worry it doesn't hurt my feelings that you are trying 
desparately to get out of spending the holidays with me.  Just kidding.  

Have a good weekend.
Robin

Me polite??  I think you have me confused with someone else.  You  are 
definitely invited.  And as for my family and friends, if you think you can 
stand them you're welcome to come along.  Some of my friends usually end up 
at my parents house anyway.  There's only one friend that'll I'll probably 
try to catch up with over Thanksgiving and we usually just go to dinner and 
catch a movie, so you are welcome to come.  

What'cha doing for lunch?

Robin

Gabriel Monroy
11/17/2000 11:26 AM
Robin, 

I thought you were just being polite and you felt bad because it was going to 
be a lonely Thanksgiving for me.  So, you were serious about it?   I really 
appreciate that you still keep me in mind, and I apologize for not having 
told you anything. I am sure you probably need to know to plan ahead. 
Ok, here is the plan. Let me make a few phone calls b/c  my best friend  from 
Cd. Juarez (border with El Paso, TX) said he  was going to Austin for that 
weekend  but nothing is for sure. Also, Ramiro was planning a trip, but I 
don't feel that bad If I decline b/c you know he loves finding foreigners to 
travel with. He actually already found somebody.   

Honestly, I did think about it, and I was a little worried that maybe you 
want to spend quality time with family and friends and I will be a perfect 
stranger there. (Ok, here is your chance to say "yeahh,  maybe you are right" 
"I want to spend time with my F & F)  Or if you are still being polite, then 
let me get bactk to you on that after I make those phone calls. 

THank you.

Time spent actually typing, procrastinating, or staring blankly into space??  
I spent the most of the morning Wed. on evaluations.  Of course I had five to 
do and plenty of little tasks thrown in the middle.  So it probably took me 
about 20 minutes per evaluation.  Some I had to think about a little harder 
than others.  It all depends on how many comments you write.  Mine took me 
the longest and I'm still not happy with it.

Outside of moving the deals to another book, I don't think you can avoid 
liquidating at the end of the month.  So I'm going to leave these in the 
portfolio.

Thanks for the info.

Robin, the book for Todd Richardson is technically dead.  We are the deals 
that are in there monthly.  Is there a better way to do this?  We hate having 
to remember to liquidate it at the end of the month.  I think it deals in 
there until Aug 2001.

Here's a mental picture for you of me when I got to the chafing part of your 
email...thumbs in ears, remaining fingers covering eyes, and repetitive 
chanting of la,la,la,la,la,la........  

I'm so disappointed but I won't be able to join you for the "fun run" on 
Thanksgiving.  I'm headed home to see the family.   I really wish you were 
here right now.  You are one of the few people that would truly appreciate 
how irritating this guy that sits next to me is!!!  He just asked someone how 
Chi-COG-OOOO was.  How do you accent every syllable (and then really drag out 
the last)???  Unfortunately that isn't nearly the most irritating thing that 
he does.  I'll update you as he provides me with more stories.

As for the food in Australia...it's really not all that different from here.  
I mean Sydney is a big city so they have just about every type of food.  They 
have a lot of American fast food chains.  The one that surprised me though 
was KFC...it's everywhere.  It's a lot more popular there than it is here.  I 
guess some of the biggest differences are that they eat pumpkin as a 
vegetable, and they put beets on their hamburgers, and they eat a lot of 
lamb.  Lamb is about as cheap and common as chicken is here.  And they eat 
meat pies....yuck.  The pastry is good on the pies but there's no flavor to 
the meat...it's just greasy ground beef.  I think they still have a little 
too much of a British influence in their food...they don't believe in 
seasoning.  

I saw quite a few good looking guys.  There was a lifesaver training course 
going on at Bondi while I was there.  That provided some great scenery!!  But 
then the problem is that the men don't realize when to stop wearing the 
speedos!!  The young guys look good in them, but after 30 they shouldn't be 
worn in public...and after 60 they shouldn't even be considered as underwear 
under six layers of clothing, but they especially shouldn't be worn on the 
beach!!!!  I saw one old man whose belly hung so low that I wasn't even sure 
he had a suit on, and I was scared to look too close for fear of what I might 
see and for fear he'd think I was interested.

Gotta go to a meeting.
Robin

Mike Pitre <pitre@ev1.net> on 11/13/2000 08:38:10 AM
Wow, what a trip.  Wish I could have been there to be with all those old
people.  I do have specific questions about Australia though.
How is the food?  Weird, good or just not worth eating?  What do they eat?
What did you eat?
See any good looking guys?
Did you make them speak just to hear the accent?  Did they make you speak
just to hear your accent?
Going back?
Megan enjoyed your email  message.  Needless to say so did I.
Ann and I ran a 25 K (15.5 miles) yesterday morning.  Got a T-shirt and a
banana for the run.  Neat, huh?  I was nine minutes slower this year than
last year but it doesn't bother me.  I had fun but at about mile 13 I was
definitely ready to cross the finish line.  I just had a couple more miles.
 My shorts chaffed the inside of my inner thighs and that was/is painful.
Is that too much information?  I can walk this morning but my legs are
fatigued.  I couldn't run from the front door to pick the newspaper off of
the front lawn this morning.  Pitiful.  Too bad you can't see and hear me
moan.  I'll just write it a couple of times.  Moan, moan.  There, that's
better.
Plans for Turkey Day?  Want to run a 5 K with Ann and I?  It'll be fun.
Let me know.  You know, I think Ann is going to Michigan, so it'll just be
me.  Maybe I'll just stay home and stuff my face.
Megan is very weak.  I sure do love that kid.
Well, don't work too hard.

Hopefully no food list will be unhappy with this

A CHANGE IN PLANS

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. I'm telling you
in advance, so don't act surprised. Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming, I've
made a few small changes:

Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries. After a
trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of flaming
lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.

The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china or
crystal goblets. If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone
will
get a fork. Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the
plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.

Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I
promised. Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration
hand-crafted from the finest construction paper. The artist assures me it is
a turkey.

We will be dining fashionably late. The children will entertain you while
you
wait. I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I have made
regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims and the turkey hotline. Please remember
that
most of these comments were made at 5:00 AM upon discovering that the turkey
was still hard enough to cut diamonds. As accompaniment to the children's
recital, I will play a recording of tribal drumming. If the children should
mention that I don't own a recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal
drumming sounds suspiciously like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore
them. They are lying.

We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start
of our feast. In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method. We've
also
decided against a formal seating arrangement. When the smoke alarm sounds,
please gather around the table and sit where you like. In the spirit of
harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate table. In a separate
room. Next door.

Now I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in
front
of a crowd of appreciative onlookers. This will not be happening at our
dinner. For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private ceremony.
I stress "private" meaning: Do not, under any circumstances, enter the
kitchen to laugh at me. Do not send small, unsuspecting children to check on
my progress. I have an electric knife. The turkey is unarmed. It stands to
reason that I will eventually win. When I do, we will eat.

Before I forget, there is one last change. Instead of offering a choice
between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the
traditional
pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small fingerprints. You will
still have a choice: take it or leave it.

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving. She probably
won't come next year either.

I am thankful.

Hey Becky,

What's going on?  Things are completely crazy as usual around here.  I need 
another vacation!  I never told you about my trip did I?  I've told everyone 
else that stood still for more than 10 seconds.  It was so much fun.  The 
olympics were so awesome.  I got to see the US women's basketball team play 
Australia for the gold medal.  The crowd was soooo wild...that is until we 
won.  And I got to see Cathy Freeman and Marion Jones run.  The whole first 
week of my trip was spent at the olympics everyday.  And the second week I 
spent touring all the beaches that I could find.  Oh, here's a funny story 
for you.  Okay I'm halfway across the world in a country known for bronze, 
muscular sufers, right?  So I take a day cruise around the Brisbane waters 
one day.  These cruises are scheduled everyday and each ship holds about 
80-100 people.  As we board the captain tells us that there will be 85 people 
on the cruise.  Here's the fun part....80 of the 85 people were from a WWII 
veterans reunion!!!  I was on a boat full of grandpa's.  Actually it was 
pretty funny.  This one old man sat next to me and started telling me why 
they were having the reunion and what thier batallion had done during the 
war.  Then he tells me (keep in mind this man's at least 70) that he was a 
lifesaver (lifeguard) on one of the local beaches until the year before when 
an injury forced him to retire!!!   Then he starts telling me about the war.  
He said, "Yeah, I was a POW for about 9 days but they weren't feeding me very 
well so I left."  He had escaped from a Nazi POW camp and fled to Greece 
where he joined the Greek reserve forces.  Because he fought with Greece in 
the war he's now a Greek citizen.  Then after the war he and some friends 
bought a van and traveled all over Europe and Asia.  When they ran out of 
money they'd just stop and get jobs until they could save some money and then 
they'd start again.  I hope one day I have stories even half that 
interesting!!  But leave it to me to go halfway around the world and hang out 
with old people!!  

How's everything going at your house?  What's up with this election?  That's 
all anyone's talking about around here.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Jeff Gossett has indicated to me that you are the person responsible for the 
Benchmark and NGP&L cost center (cc107074). I left you a voice mail 
indicating that I would send you a copy of energy operation's activities.  We 
are still in a phase-in process where we are trying to make this process as 
efficient and easy for you as possible. 

For now, if you could:
Identify the activities being performed by your team (cc107074), and the 
hours worked during the month of October
Identify drivers for your activities. This would be things that affect your 
workload, for example, in RM Texas the driver is # of deals; please call me 
if you need further clarification
Identify the commercial teams that you guys support

Our goal is to have this information by Wednesday, Nov. 8, if this is going 
to be a problem, please let us know.  Next month, you will be able to access 
cc107074 through the normal survey, which is through MS Access.

Please call either myself, x3-597, or Shari Mao for further information.

Thanks,
Jen Reside

I paid about $94 Austalian which is around $50.  It was a pretty big, and 
definitely awkward (that word doesn't look right) that's why it flew home on 
it's own.  Besides I already had my luggage allotment.  My box wasn't nearly 
as heavy as yours is.  What kind of tree did you buy???  What is it an iron 
statue of a tree?  

Are you leaving tomorrow?  I know I've asked you this before but I can't 
remember.  If you don't have any plans let's go to lunch.

Robin

Thanks,  I'll send this to Ibrahim and he will then send that to the guy in 
EBS.  I have a few  questions for you.  How much did you pay for the box that 
was sent to you from Australia?  Why did you not take it with you? 

Ok, this is the story. My mom asked me if I could buy a Christmas tree,and of 
course, being a super duper nice son as I am, I was stupid enough to buy it. 
Well the box is about 63 lbs. and 57 x 14 inches . I called Continental and 
they said they would accept it.  Well, I am not sure about the whole thing. 
First, it is so big that it doesn't even fit in my car. I had to take it home 
with the trunk open. I'll see how I can figure this out, but I just wanted to 
ask you about the box from Australia. 

Anyways, I hope I can see you before I leave for Mexico. I probably just drop 
by and say bye. Of course I have not packed and still have to buy a few 
things. Have a nice day. I'll let you know about the whole EBS thing. 

Gabriel 

Monica,

I never received your basis positions for Lavorato.

Spanish. Please respond to this email.

Sorry to hear about your airport travels.  Has Alejandra found a place to 
live yet?  When is she starting on the east desk...they need help!!  They 
screwed their position up again today.  

My weekend was really good.  Of course it could have been better without the 
rain.  Saturday my friend and I sat around and gossiped most of the afternoon 
and then went out to eat and to a movie.  Then Sunday we went to visit some 
friends of ours in Sugarland that just had a baby.  So we spent most of 
Sunday afternoon playing with the baby.  The dad is hilarious.  He's the type 
that seems really quite but when he says something he just cracks you up.  He 
was talking about the baby monitors they got.  He said he was going to put a 
message on it that said, "Hi, Brianna.  This is your parents.  We aren't 
available right now, but it you leave a message we'll get back to you."  

Are we having Spanish class today?  

Robin

  Rest of Saturday was good I went out with some friends to this place I 
really like. However, Sunday was  not so good. I went to IAH (airport) twice. 
So, that was almost like going to Austin, plus on the way back rain was very 
very bad (The 10:30 pm. rain).  For the second time, Alejandra's plane was 
delayed, but this time it was more than 5 hours delayed. She got stuck in 
Dallas and of course I knew once I was already at IAH.  How about you? 
Hey, My right shoulder is a little sore (Golf). Is your's sore? or am I just 
a little rusty.

Gabriel 

Thanks.  How was the rest of your weekend?

RR

Yeah, but you know I can't resist an opportunity to make a sarcastic remark.

Gabriel Monroy
11/03/2000 02:14 PM
See now I think you should stay with risk. Yeahh.I think you are better off 
there. he he he. You know this means that if you go to EBS our stock can 
actually go down. No, what it really means is that I might have to help the 
new person if you are really busy. Personally I do not like the idea.  

Ok, I'll ask Ibrahim about this friend of his.  

As for golf practice, we'll see if the weather turns out to be ok. I'll send 
you an email once I know this guy's name, ok?

I was asking what you thought about  the whole EBS thing, not about my 
nervousness. 

Gabriel

Frank,
Please find enclosed the PL/SQL scripts that are called from the two C 
programs below. The ERMS packages handle all of ERMS positions, with specific 
handling of Canadian and Intra month positions. The power package handles all 
of ENPOWER databases(Australia, Europe and US) and EXPOWER(US only). The 
spreadsheet handling is an entirely different process which specifically 
handles text files extracted from spreadsheets.

The 'C' programs control the calls to the PL/SQL packages. The ERMS package 
also decides on the strip flag for intra month positions.

Regards,
Ramesh

Roll-Off logic as requested by you.

Ramesh

   

Jeremy,

Here is the roll-off logic for 'NG':

1.  For regular ERMS books (not Intra Month book),  first we get the promptDt,

 promptDt := TO_DATE('01'||TO_CHAR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(p_effDt,'J'),1), 
'MONYYYY'), 'DDMONYYYY');

 Then if p_commodity_cd = 'NG', we go get the cutOff date,
  SELECT exp_dt
           INTO expDate
           FROM egs_expiration_dates
         WHERE expiration_rule_cd = 'Natural Gas Futures'
             AND ref_period_dt = promptDt;

 IF (TO_DATE(p_effDt, 'J') > expDate) THEN
        cutOff := ADD_MONTHS(promptDt,1);
      ELSE
        cutOff := promptDt;
      END IF;

 The strip flag, when populated into rms_deal_legs table, is computed using 
the following DECODE statement,

 DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - 
TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(cutOff,'J'))),-1,-2,NULL).

 Positions with strip flag as -2 will be rolled off by V@R program.

2.  For Intra Month books, first we get the nextMonthDt,
 nextMonthDt := 
TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(TO_DATE('01'||TO_CHAR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(p_effDt,'J'),1),'MM
')||
        TO_CHAR(ADD_MONTHS(TO_DATE(p_effDt,'J'),1),'YYYY'), 'DDMMYYYY'),'J'));

 Then if book flag is 'P', the strip flag, when populated into rms_deal_legs 
table, is computed using the 
 following DECODE statement,

     if pub cd starts with 'GD', then the positions are taken in as 
'FLOATVSFLOAT', and strip flags for
  two legs are,
  DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - nextMonthDt), 1, -1, 0, 
-1, -1, -2, NULL) and
  DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - nextMonthDt), 1, 1, 0, 
1, -1, -2, NULL),
  respectively.

     else if pub cd does not start with 'GD', then only positions with 
swap_cd as 'S' are captured as    'SWAP'.  The strip flag is,
  DECODE(SIGN(TO_NUMBER(TO_CHAR(ref_period_dt,'J')) - nextMonthDt), 1, 1, 0, 
1, -1, -2, NULL)

 Else if book flag is 'G', the strip flag in rms_deal_legs is hard coded as 1.

Thanks,

Wei

  
 

 

   

What do I think about what...the fact that you're now the one that's a little 
stressed?  I think that's kind of funny!!  Just kidding.  I have a friend 
coming in town this weekend, but she's not coming until sometime Sat. 
afternoon probably around 3-4ish.  So if you want to go to the driving range 
around noonish on Sat. we could do that.  Although I think it's supposed to 
rain all weekend so we might just end up back at the movies.  

As for the rotation, I wouldn't exactly say I know Brian but I met him at the 
Morton's dinner.   I guess I'd be as well off starting with him as to call 
Ibrahim's friend, since I don't know Ibrahim or his friend.  Well actually, I 
might know Ibrahim's friend.  Ask Ibrahim his friend's name and if I don't 
know him I'll call Brian on Monday and see exactly what it is that they do.  
Thanks for the help with this.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin  

Gabriel Monroy
11/03/2000 12:59 PM
Well, We can go different routes. Do you know Brian Hoskins?  If not, I know 
him well. Well, he works in that group. He can tell us what it is about. The 
last time I talked to him, he did mention something about customers (big 
customers); but honestly I am not sure exactly what it is. Then what we can 
do is ask Ibrahim the name of his friend. We'll ask Brian if he knows him ( 
Brian, by the way, loves to help people. but only good people : ( 
 and we can go from there. 

If not, we can just go trhough Ibrahim. Once that is done, We'll figure what 
to tell Gossett (ouchhhh) . Uppsss, I do not want any oart during this stage. 
He will probably kill me if he knows I told you about this group.

Ibrahim is leaving next week. He had told me that he was going to stay about 
3 more weeks, but his new group wants him. Uppsss  I feel I have SOOOOO Much 
to learn. I really feel behind. There will be a lot of reading this weekend 
but of course I might take a break and go to the drive range if you want to 
go. You never responded me. Ok, ok, maybe you do not want to go. I'll go on 
my own and hit the ball with my tennis raquet.

Anyways. who said there was no stress level here. I am getting kind of 
nervous because it is a little complicated.  Tell me what you think. 

Gabriel

So what you're telling me is that you're intentionally trying to bait me.  
Apparently you haven't figured out yet that it can be hazardous to your 
health to make me mad!!  And I know you well enough to know that my last 
statement will only serve as a challenge to you.  You're going to spend the 
rest of the day trying to irritate me.  Don't deny it.  I know you too well.  
So where are we going to watch the game?  If I understood soccer a little 
better I'd be more involved in the trash-talking.  But I'll just leave it at 
this...the US could kick Mexico's butt at anything!!  Mexican men can't even 
knock down an American girl even when they are given 13 whole seconds to 
try!!  How could you possibly expect a group of these weaklings to beat a 
group of top quality American athletes.

Bye.

PS Have fun in all those meetings.  Pretty soon you'll be going to more than 
Gossett.

Gabriel Monroy
02/28/2001 11:55 AM
Oohhh that one, it was cancelled.  I am becoming more bureaucratic now, so I 
had a meeting at 10:00 with Treasury, then I was supposed to have this one at 
1:00 and there is another one with Corporate Finance at 2:30.  To tell you 
the truth, the one at 10:00 I was clueless and then I found out I was the one 
that was supposed to kind of give all the information. (information I of 
course did not know). It was a good learning experience because we called 
somebody else that I told them had the information.   

Thanks for asking.  I am getting ready and pumped up because I think today at 
6:30 we are going to kick some gringo butt.  What do you think?  You need to 
get upset, because otherwise this is not going to be fun. 

Gabriel 

PS.  Tell him I'm definitely interested.  

Yeah that very interesting.  What exactly is the origination team doing now 
that they've already signed the deal with blockbuster?  Are they trying to 
sign up customers or providers or what?

RR

I don't think most people would understand the humor, but I thought it was 
really funny.  Especially after the week I've had!!

It works...that's pretty neat by the way!  See ya Friday (It'll be your turn

I didn't want this just popping up on your screen.  

So far it's just getting worse!!!  I've already been up there three times 
today and of course each extra trip lowers the P&L.  He must think I'm the 
biggest idiot in the world.  I'm going to have to change my name to get 
another job after he fires me.  When he saw me standing outside his office 
this last time he just spread his hands like what could possible be wrong 
now!!  

If you want to make a lot of money and are willing to take this job back 
now's your chance.  I think John would pay you $100,000 to take back over.  

Talk to ya later,

Attached is the latest version of the Add-In for publishing Executive 
Reports.  It contains the "Pulp & Paper P&L", "Pulp & Paper Position", "Pulp 
& Paper Price", "Emissions Summary", and "Natural Gas Net Fixed Price 
Positions By Book (Ignores Correlation)" subroutines.

John Lavorato is expecting to see these publish reports in the updated viewer 
tomorrow morning!

To use this latest version of the Add-In:

Close all instances of Excel.
Detach the attached websave2.xla file into the Microsoft Office's Library 
directory.  Usually this is C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office\Library
Launch Excel.
Under the Tools menu selection, select Add-Ins...
In the "Add-Ins available" list, look for "Websave."  If present, uncheck 
it.  This is the old version of the add-in.
There should be a "Websave2" in the list.  This is the current version of the 
add-in.  Check it and click the OK button.

I've also attached a workbook containing a buttons for the new reports that 
you can copy and paste into your production workbooks.  

Here are the named range values and the sheet names for the reports:

Named Range	Sheet Name
nr_NGFixPB  	Natural Gas Net Fixed
nr_EmSum  	Emissions Summary
nr_PPPL  	Pulp & Paper P&L
nr_PPPos  	Pulp & Paper Position
nr_PPPrice  	Pulp & Paper Price

For those tired of the usual "friend" poems, a touch of truth!

When you are sad,.............I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.
When you are scared,.........I will laugh at you and tease you about it
every chance I get.
When you are worried,.........I will tell you how much worse it could be and
to quit complaining.
When you are confused,........I will use little words to explain it to your
dumb butt.
When you are sick.........I will hold your hair while you pay homage to the
porcelain god.
When you fall......I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt.
This is my oath...............I pledge this till the end.
Why you may ask?...............Because you're my friend.

Hope it made you laugh - but you know I got your back!!!!!!!!

Chris,

Here is our explanation of the 5 Day loss violation.  Let me know if you need 
any more information.

Due to a forecast for mild November weather, futures prices have fallen 
sharply over the last five days.   Nymex futures prices have fallen a total 
of $0.68 over the last five days.  The Gas desk's loss is primarily driven by 
a long price position held by the Financial desk, which averaged 7, 295 
contracts over the same period.

Done.

You probably know the times that will be good for me better than I do.  As 
for day of the week, I'd rather the first half of the week, nothing after 
Wed.

Done.

Friday's no good.  I'm going to Chicago to look for an apartment.  I'm 
leaving as soon as I pass out all the reports Friday morning.  How about 
early next week?

Thursday sounds good to me.  Bring your pictures and I'll bring mine.

I'd like to have Dec.20-22 off if possible.  I also need to take Thurs. Oct. 
26 off.  Thanks.

Robin

   

It's unfortunate that the markets will be open right after Thanksgiving and 
Christmas but they will be (bidweek).  I need to know who will be around 
during those times to help keep the ship sailing.  Now, I will try to 
accomodate all requests for vacation time but I may not be able to let you 
off.  Please let me know soon.

Dave

Lunch sounds good to me.   Name a day and chances are I can make it.

For those tired of the usual "friend" poems, a touch of truth!

When you are sad,.............I will get you drunk and help you plot revenge
against the scum sucking bastard who made you sad.
When you are scared,.........I will laugh at you and tease you about it
every chance I get.
When you are worried,.........I will tell you how much worse it could be and
to quit complaining.
When you are confused,........I will use little words to explain it to your
dumb butt.
When you are sick.........I will hold your hair while you pay homage to the
porcelain god.
When you fall......I will point and laugh at your clumsy butt.
This is my oath...............I pledge this till the end.
Why you may ask?...............Because you're my friend.

Hope it made you laugh - but you know I got your back!!!!!!!!

Phillip,

FYI  I will be on vacation from 9/22 until 10/11.  

See you in two weeks.
Robin

Dawn,

Doesn't it suck to be at work and know that someone else is out of the 
country?  I just want to let you know how much I suffered while you were 
gone.  I realize now just how bad you must want out of this group.  Without 
you or Jennifer there was no real conversation the whole week!!  Chris just 
works quietly.  Jason interrupts the quiet with inane comments that I have no 
idea how to respond to.  And Anne...well I can't even explain that.  

Let me digress for just a moment to talk about work.  Nothing really 
happened.  All was quiet.   If anyone was upset about anything they didn't 
tell me about it.   I did get an email from Frank Cernseck(or how ever you 
spell his name).  It seems we took too much as broker fees in July.  I 
haven't researched it, but from what Victor tells me that's an adjustment 
that needs to be made on last day P&L.  I'm sure I'm not telling you anything 
you don't know.   

Just wanted to let you know I'm glad you're here and I'm not.  

Hope you enjoyed your trip.

Robin

Hey Greg,

I just got you email, but I do want to be in on the gift for Becky.  Count me 
in for $20.  I'll bring the money down in the morning.  Where are you located 
now?

Thanks,

See you tomorrow.
Robin

I'm not here...at least my mind anyway.    I take it you aren't too busy 
today.  We need to plan on going to lunch sometime soon.  My last day is next

Sorry I missed you guys for lunch yesterday.  I didn't get your email until 
yesterday afternoon.  I've been in class for two days...Derivatives I.  It's 
really hard to sit still and think about swaps and options when I'd rather 
think about Sydney!  But I guess it's better than being at my desk all day.  
The days are pretty slow.  It doesn't really get busy here until 3:30 or so.  

Bye,

PS If I forget my bras, I'm just not going to bother!!  

No one would notice if I forgot my bras!!!!  Thanks for the well wishes.  
I'll take lots of pictures so you can see them.  

I can't wait for this week to be over...only one and a half days!!

Okay, here's a trivia question for you.   There are two siblings.  One's an 
engineer and one's an accountant.  One works for a natural gas company and 
the other works for an accounting firm.  Which one works for the accounting 
firm?  

Do you see the absurdity of our lives???  Level III, huh?  I don't know 
anyone over level II.  Well, except Mr. Kirkpatrick's friend that's a partner 
in New Orleans.  

I dreamed the other night that I was outside the Swimming venue in Australia 
and the American coach heard me talking and realized I was an American.  He 
told me I had to swim an event b/c all the swimmers were either sick or 
injured.  I never did get to swim, though.  The alarm went off before I even 
found out what event I was swimming.  I hope it's not butterfly...I wouldn't 
be very competitive if I had to swim butterfly.  Not that I'd even be 
competitive if I was swimming freestyle at the olympics, unless it was the 
special olympics...then I might stand a chance!

Congrats on the job.  
Robin

We actually got some significant rain...up to 8 inches in some areas. Of 
course there was none at the airport, so officially it didn't rain yesterday. 
I was in FortWorth while it was raining here, so all I got was the spray from 
the wet roads making my car dirty.

When do you leave for Australia. Bring me back something nice.

I'll be an Experienced Consultant Level III in the Supply Chain service line 
with Arthur Andersen. It sounds like a really fun job, and they made an offer 
I can't turn down.

>>> <Robin.Rodrigue@enron.com> 9/12/2000 3:33:27 PM >>>

Glad to hear you haven't dried up and blown away.   They said we got rain
here, but being from LA I say we got a little drizzle.  Just enough to make
my car look like I went driving through mud puddles.

What kind of job did Aruthur offer?  Once again let me point out that I
enjoy the fact that this is on your company email.

I'm spending my time these days checking the official Olympics website and
dreaming.  I'm trying to get fired so I can just stay in Australia.  I
don't think it's working though b/c I just keep getting more jobs.  I have
two right now.

Be nice and I might at least think about you while I'm in Australia.

Talk to ya later,
Robin

I leave for Sydney a week from Saturday.  I already have orders to email my 
parents while I'm there to let them know what's going on.  And you're right 
there's no hope for keeping me in line!  I think I'll just retire early and 
stay over there.  I would make a very good beach bum.  Of course with my 
complexion I'd look like a tomato in a matter of hours (plus I already have 
the soft and squishy part down).   I went shopping and spent way too much 
money this weekend buying things for my trip.  I'm having to buy clothes.   I 
don't seem to own casual clothes anymore...especially not spring clothes.  
I'm used to only two seasons, summer and suedo-winter.  It'll be spring over 
there and I've been checking the temperature.  It's been between the mid 40's 
and the low 70's.  I'm going to have to pack everything I own.  

I'm really sorry to hear about Megan's prognosis.  I know you hear this all 
the time but seriously, if there's anything at all I can do let me know.   
And I want you to know you guys are always in my prayers.

We should go to lunch sometime now that I'm working daylight hours.

I'm hoping they have good movies on the flight!  But I'm also bringing a good 
book, and I'll probably bring a pair of headphones...even if I don't plug 
them into anything.  I think I'll have them as a decoy in case I end up with 
an annoying neighbor for the flight.  Everyone around me knows my travel 
plans as well as I do.  I think I must have become a little annoying myself.  

Well back to work.

R

It's nice to know I have good tastes. I think I did a good job picking out 
both b-day presents. Do you want me to mail a check or do you take Visa?

I decided to let you use them. It's too hot up here to use them. Maybe if it 
ever rains. If you like them, I got them at a store up here for a really good 
price, but you probably have such places down there too. You won't become a 
golf junkie after you find out how much they want to actually let you play 
golf on one of those nice green courses. It's a little more than the driving 
range.

Glad to hear that you're really not a vampire.

My company was named one of the 100 Best managed manufacturing companies by 
Industry Week. It's been a real joke around here. We're not sure what they

You got her a $100 gift certificate to Talbot's (a women's clothing store).
You did a very good job picking it out.

Thanks for the golf clubs by the way.  I thought you weren't going to send
them, so I was surprised when Karon told me she had them.  I'll hold them
for ransom until I get paid back for the birthdays!!  I actually went to
the driving range this weekend.  I definitely think I could get hooked on
this sport.  Hopefully I won't become one of the "golf junkies" but I'm not
sure you can avoid it.  I was watching a golf infomercial the other day
thinking "I need that!"

Well back to work.  Did I tell you I'm working daylight hours again?

I actually just did it for my mom...otherwise she wouldn't have gotten a gift 
at all!!

I thought you'd appreciate this email from my brother.  It's the best family 
email I've gotten lately.  I'm such a great sister...I bought the present, 
wrapped the present (or at least watched while the clerk wrapped it), and 
delivered it to my mom for her birthday, and I was nice enough to put my 
brother's name on the gift.

for...number 24 to be exact.  They are pushing for #1 next year.   I think 
it's the Analyst program that's holding them back right now!!!

Thanks,

So are you going to enter???

Gabriel,

I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the 
Canadian origination variance.  You may already be aware, but on the Orig 
Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day.  
However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate 
applied is the average rate for the month.  Therefore these values will never 
be the same.  Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada 
on Monday.  Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so 
that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate.   If you haven't 
recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward 
the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris.  

Thanks,
Robin

Nicole LaPorte
08/24/2000 01:20 PM
Robin,
I spoke with Kathy regarding the problem we are having with origination. Her 
explanation is as follows:
This is an fx issue. Because origination is denominated in a currency (USD) 
which is different than our functional currency (CAD), origination expense 
will be comprised of not only origination but also currency gains and losses 
on origination. Everyday orig. is retranslated in C$ using the current rate 
and any fx gains or losses relating to that is added to origination.  
Therefore, the total origination as per the "origination" tab will NOT equal 
the origination as per the "report" tab. Robin should add in the translation 
gains/losses to get it to reconcile. 
I hope this explanation makes sense and is acceptable. I know you're used to 
the two numbers reconciling but since we were asked to denominate our 
origination in US dollars (about 2 months ago) these two numbers will never 
again be the same.
Please call if you have any questions,
Nicole 

How scandulous of your mother!!  My mother would never use sucks...but my dad 
told me something pissed him off one time.  I was completely shocked...I 
didn't even know what to say.  I know it's hard to imagine me speechless, but 
I was.  

You should know by now that I'm heartless and that my grandmother will have 
to go the hospital all alone.  I had to listen to her last time whine about 
how no one respects her.  It took everything I had not to say, "Of course we 
don't respect you.  We all know you're crazy."  

What are you doing for lunch Friday (as in probably the day you're reading 
this)?  I'm going to come in early b/c I've been bombarded as soon as I walk 
in the door the last two days.  

Let me know if you want to go to lunch.  I'll call you when I get in.  

I'll be praying for Megan.

Gary/Susan,

It came to our attention yesterday that the PWR-GAS-LT-MGMT-PRC book is 
included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  This book is officalized by Jenny 
Latham and the position is not reported on the benchmark.  Therefore, I don't 
believe it should be included in the POS-GAS-TRD portfolio.  Also please 
ensure that this book is not included in the AGG-GAS portfolio.  

Thanks,
Robin

Kathy,

Here is the detail and position for IM Canada yesterday.  It seems that the 
price txt file didn't get run last night (our fault).   I'll make sure that 
gets done tonight.

Let me know if you need anything else.  

Yeah,my family's pretty entertaining!!  I went home last weekend for my mom's 
birthday.  We had all gone somewhere and when we were about to turn the 
corner on our street we were all praying and holding our breath hoping my 
grandmother wasn't at our house!!  She's been driving my mother crazy (it's 
my dad's mom by the way).  She's now determined that there's something 
terribly wrong with her.  She has a doctor's appt this week and says she's 
going to convince the dr to send her to the diagnostic center of houston.  My 
dad informed me that she told him she'd just fly here...so I'm guessing she 
actually thinks I'm going to take off work for a week to shuttle her back and 
forth to the dr.   She's wrong of course!  

Well enough rambling for now.  If I get any good family emails I'll let you 
know!

I thought you'd appreciate the humor in these.  Actually the first one's kind 
of scary!!  Just in case you think I made this stuff up the web site's at the 
bottom.  

The U.S. Department of Agriculture is actively proposing that animal 
carcasses with cancers,
     tumors or open sores be regarded merely as unaesthetic but safe for 
human consumption as
        long as the offending part is cut away. The proposal is part of a 
general loosening of
     slaughterhouse inspection standards, whose public comment period ends 
Aug. 29. One critic
    already weighed in, saying she did not want to "eat pus from a chicken 
that has pneumonia," but
    also included as benign by the proposal are glandular swellings, 
infectious arthritis and diseases
                             caused by intestinal worms.

                               In Their Own Words

     Hubert Penrod Jr., on why the May promotion he had scheduled for his 
Huge Hooter Haven
     strip club in Nashville had failed to attract men who had come to town 
for the Billy Graham
    Crusade that weekend: "I know all the porn stars, but I don't exactly 
keep up with preachers.
     Hell, I thought Billy Graham was some singer or something. It never 
entered my mind that (it
                was) some preacher (who) was filling up the football stadium."

A Charlotte, NC man, having purchased a box of very rare and expensive
   cigars, insured them against fire, among other hazards. Within a month,
   having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made
   even
   his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against
   the
   insurance company. In his claim, the man stated that the cigars were
   lost
   "in a series of small fires".
   The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that
   the
   man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The man sued ... and
   won! The ruling judge agreed that the claim was frivolous. He stated,
   nevertheless, that the man held a valid policy from the company in which

   it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that

   it would insure against fire, without further defining what would be
   considered to be an "unacceptable fire," and was obligated to pay the
   claim. Rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the
   insurance company accepted the ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the
   rare cigars he had lost in the "fires".
   And now the good part...After the man cashed the check, the insurance
   company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson. With his own insurance
   claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the
   man was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and
   sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine.

No prob, bob.

Also, Brad you need to request access to the O:/Bench directory so that 
you'll be able to save a copy of the NGPL in this directory each night.  

Bilal, you'll need access to the O:/Gas_Trad and O:/Bench directories.

It sounds pretty good, but I'd rather talk to mom and see if there's 
something specific he wants before we get that.  B/c for all his talk about 
using the computer he usually ends up using his books instead.  

I'll call mom either tonight or in the morning.  I'll let you know what I 
find out.

Robin

Hey,

I did think of something Dad might want.  He was really excited when mom gave 
him the Biblical reference book for Father's day, so maybe we could get him 
something like that.  Call mom and ask her what he wants.  

Authur Anderson, huh??  You do know they are slave drivers, right??  Of 
course I'm sure it's no worse than my current job!!  I find it pretty funny 
that you wrote that to my from your work email.   

Well it's about time I got started working today.

Robin

Yeah, like this week.  And no I have no ideas...not even bad ones.  And I 
can't seem to find my catalog to order mom something.  I requested a new one 
but I don't know if we'll get it in time.  You need to just go wander around 
a home depot and find Dad some useless gadget.

Brian,

Well, we're a lot closer, but we're not exact.  I'm attaching a copy of what 
I pulled when I loaded the new files.  

Thanks for your help,

Robin

Brian,

Just a couple of things.  First the risk type on the spreadsheets needs to be 
the same as on the files I sent to you.  Second, I am attaching a copy of the 
positions that I queried out of GRMS after I loaded your text files.  The 
positions aren't even close to the IM Positions file you save out to our 
directory.  I have also included the detail that supports the GRMS position.  
Our goal with the text files is to eliminate the need for plugging your 
positions and to ensure that your correct position is included in the VAR 
calculation.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help you resolve 
this variance.  

Thanks,
Robin

Let me know how we did.  

Robin

Brian,

Everything was fine with the file.  From now on could you please divide it 
into three separate files?  I've attached the files that I loaded for the 
17th, so if you just keep the same name (just update the date everyday) that 
would help me a lot.   As for the master deal id, as long as they are all 
unique what you had was fine.

If you have any more questions just give me a call.

Thanks,
Robin

Sorry it took so long.

Robin

Kathy,

Please review the spreadsheet guidelines I sent.  I am having to recreate 
your text files every night.  Specifically, the master deal id should be a 
unique number (an NA is not acceptable here), the date must be in the d-mm-yy 
format not a julian date format, and there can be NO commas in any numbers.

Thanks,
Robin

Mac&Cheese huh?  Eating a light lunch?  When I was at Tech I complained about 
the food one day (well actually I complained a lot, but one day I made an 
official complaint).  Anyway I was telling the guy over the food service that 
the food was overpriced and the quality was pathetic.  And he told me they 
were actually losing money.  All I had to say to that was if you can charge 
$6.50 for Beanie Weenies (actual price of an actual dish passed off as an 
entree)  and lose money you must be the worst businessman in the history of 
the world.  I don't think he appreiciated me sharing my opinion with him.

Kathy,

I spoke with the system administrators today and they gave me several more 
guidelines for the text files.  

1) The Book ID must be an existing book (Please use the same book id every 
day).  Also please Sort the Book Id by risk type (ie IMCan-Erms-xl-GDL, then 
IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PHY, then IMCAN-ERMS-XL-PRC.)

2) The Master Deal Id must be a unique number per line.

3) The reference date must be in the following format D-MMM-YY.

4) MTM Value Amount must be a NUMBER.  If there is no position please use a 
zero.  

5) The GROSS POSITION and DELTA POSITION must be a value.  No commas, no 
dashes, no links, and no #REF errors.  Again if there is no position please 
use a zero.  

The guidelines apply to all text files that must be loaded into GRMS.  If you 
have any question, please give me a call.

Thanks,
Robin

Kathy,

Here is the FT Can Position including the Exotics file.  Let me know how it 
looks.  I'm having trouble getting the IM position to pull in, so if I don't 
send you a file soon just assume I'll plug the numbers to match the excel 
file that Brian saved in the directory.

Thanks,
Robin

Please format the text files to be processed through GRMS in the following 
manner.  

1) Sort by book id, then by master deal id, then by reference date.  
2) The dates must be in the following format.  4-Mar-97
3) The book names must be the same every day.  
4) If the cell should contain a number please put a zero if there is no 
value.  GRMS will not recognize a N/A in a field that is supposed to contain 
a number.
5) Please name the files in a manner consistent with those below.  

If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.

Thanks,
Robin

Let me know how it looks.  Is Kathy going to send text files tonight?

Thanks,
Robin

That sounds fine to me.  If I'm reading it correctly, we are actually 
changing the other Gas Daily books to have the same logic as the Gas Daily 
Options book currently has.  If my understanding isn't correct please let me 
know.  But I think everything thing should be okay to implement tomorrow.

Thanks,
Robin

   

Robin,

The current logic for processing Gas Daily books is as the following:

 If it is a Swap deal (swap_cd is 'S' in ERMS), we check two date conditions 
(ref_dt > eff_dt and ref_dt < nextMonthDt);
 If it is a Option deal (opt_cd is 'O' in ERMS), we only check one date 
condition (ref_dt > eff_dt).

That's why you saw prompt month positions for 'GAS-DAILY-OPT-GDL', those are 
all from Option deals.  Other Gas Daily books either don't have prompt month 
positions or the delta position is zero, so you don't see it.

The proposed logic change is even for the Swap deals, we only check one date 
condition (ref_dt > eff_dt).  I don't think there will be any double counting 
for books like GAS-DAILY-OPT-GDL after the change.

Let me know what you think.

Thanks,

Wei

Chris,

The Power Book shows a MTD origination variance of $17.5.  This is shown on 
the origination file(Power Tab) and will be picked up on the NGP&L today.  
However it is still not being added into the MTD tab because the book 
administrator added the originator's name to the same cell as the origination 
category.  It is just a concatenate problem, but I don't have access to that 
file.  If you or Michael could fix that I would appreciate it.

Thanks,
Robin
x57478

The Gas Spec (Oil NG Hedge) book will show a MTD variance of $819,000 today.  
When the Power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not 
divide by 1,000.  Therefore the incorrect p&l was reported.  However, John 
Lavorato was given a corrected report, so this variance will not be included 
in today's daily p&l on the NGP&L.  

If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.

stupid humor, which I was.  However the language and the "sons" got on my 
nerves.  Usually language doesn't bother me at all , but that was a little 
excessive.  Especially the marriage proposal!!  

Well I better get busy.  Bye.

I just wanted to let you know that the INTRA-TEXAS-GDL booked pulled in a 
July fixed price gas daily position last night.  Maybe you could apply the 
same logic that is used to pull this position to the Gas Daily books that are 
not currently pulling in the fixed price gas daily positions.  The books that 
had fixed price position for 6/26 that did not pull in are listed below.  

BOOK ID  POST ID  JULY FIXED PRICE POSITION(in contracts)

GD-MARKET-GDL 819207   92.9

GD-CENTRAL-GDL 819212   263.3

GD-TEXAS-GDL 819657   (15.5)

If there is any more information that will help you develop the correct logic 
please let me know.

Thanks,
Robin

Here you go!

David,

Here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark.  

1)  Once a book is officialized it must be loaded into GRMS BEFORE the 
positions can be pulled into the benchmark.  

2) With everyone officializing books around the same time the GRMS que is 
overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into GRMS.  

3)  GRMS processes books in the order that they are officialized.  If one of 
your books is officialized behind either the Nymex, Power, or Canadian books 
your book will not  be loaded into GRMS until these books are finished.  This 
process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.  

4)  I have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not 
designed to handle.  These files must then be loaded into GRMS.

4)  I have to manually override Post-IDs that for one reason or another do 
not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly.  

5)  The benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.  The more 
books that are officialized, the longer the query takes.  

6)  When books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends 
that book to the back of the GRMS que.  This means that the entire process 
must be started over.

7)  Now that plugging positions is no longer an option, I have to spend time 
researching any variances that arise between the GRMS position and the ERMS 
position.

8)  If the book admin and I cannot solve the problem, then I have to contact 
the GRMS support team.  Since this usually occurs after their regular hours 
it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me.  

9)  I cannot query new data while I'm researching variances or on the phone 
with GRMS support because I need access to  the information that is currently 
in the bench.  

10)  Finally, this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and 
have to shut down.  Even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is 
lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen 
it. 

If you have any more questions let me know.

Robin

back Sat. afternoon.  If I can get an apartment Friday I'll probably try to 
fly standby and come back earlier Sat.

Virendra,

Please check the set up of the book listed below.  I am having to manually 
override that post-id everyday.  

Let me know if there's anything I can do to help you.

BOOKID  6/23/00 POSTID

INTRA-MKT3-PRC 818797

Thanks,
Robin

 Virendra,

Let me know when you are available to discuss the Gas Daily GRMS logic.  It 
is my understanding that GRMS currently will only include those gas daily 
deals that are intramonth deals with an effective date greater than the 
current date.  However, we should also include any deals in out months that 
are fixed price gas daily deals.  

Thanks,
Robin

Here are you positions.

Gas prices are so high that when I pulled into a station this morning and
asked for a dollar's worth, the attendant dabbed some behind my ears.

Could you please ensure that these books are set up the same in GRMS as in

Hey Guys,

We are still not pulling the Intra-Cand-West-Phy book into the benchmark.  I 
have talked to the systems administrator and he thinks it might be in how the 
book is set up in the system.  I have attached below a copy of the screen 
that shows how we have desigated the various codes for this book.  Please 
look at this and verify that we have it set up properly.  If you have any 
questions feel free to give me a call.

I am also attaching the detail that I pulled out of the GRMS system.  Please 
take a look at it and help me identify what is causing our variances.  For 
instance I am pulling a position of (245) contracts for July Price and you 
show a position of long 241 contracts.  

Thanks,
Robin

Tomorrow I'm going to be here really early in the morning, so I'll probably 
be tired tomorrow night.  But I could go to the concert if you can get 
tickets.  B/c Thursday I'll have to pack and get some sleep for my flying 
trip to Chicago Friday.  

Bye,

Kathy,

As you know we are trying to eliminate all the plugs on the Gas Benchmark.  
Therefore we would like to begin pulling your positions from the GRMS 
system.  I have attached a file that shows the position that I got when I 
queried GRMS for the June 14 position.  I have also included the detail and a 
copy of what you reported.  

As you will see these positions are significantly different.  Please look at 
the detail and let me know if you see the reason for the descrepancy (ie 
books that we have omitted).  Let me know if you need more information.

Thanks,

1.  I have learned how to prepare the NGP&L.

2.  I have gained an understanding of the originations process in order to 
properly represent originations on the NGP&L.

3.  I have learned how to prepare the Benchmark.

4.  I have reduced the time spent at night running the Basis reports by 
consolidating the Shankman, Fletch, and Lavorato reports into one file so 
that the information                need only be queried once.  This was 
accomplished by creating multiple Date Bucket designations in a single file.  

5.  I updated the Greg Pos. Report, so that it ties to the Benchmark in total 
and reflects the Lavorato time buckets.

6.  I updated the Gas Detail Tab of the Benchmark to include new books that 
have been added to the Benchmark.  This enabled me to tie the Greg Pos Report 
to the Benchmark.

7.  I created an additional section of the Gas Detail Tab to calculate the 
fixed price positions.  This section is used to report the total fixed price 
position by seasonal buckets on the Lavorato Basis report.  

I have not included any accomplishments from my former group.  If you would 
like to see them also please let me know.

Mary Lynne was calling Stacey B. from Carla's desk (I don't know why) but he 
chose not to answer.  She's standing there going "he's at his desk, pick up" 
which was aggravating to her.  Oh well.
Eric is putting his storage entries in today.  Shannon has to manually key 
them in the matrix.  She's not happy.  I wouldn't be either.
Tony has put in a million entries and so have I.
It is still a zoo here.  What's up with all this chaos?  It's more than 
usual.  B
PS The candy idea is the best.  A nice sample of chocolates and sugar.

GOING????!!!  How about completely gone!  I've only been here an hour and a 
half and already we've had two major crisises!  Doesn't that sound like fun?  
Have you thought of a gift I could give to my friends in Australia yet?  You 
really need to get on that.  I'm going shopping this weekend.  I have to buy 
a mother's day gift for my mom (I know a little late, but I haven't seen her 
yet) and a birthday gift for my younger brother (can't call him little 
anymore, he's as big as me) and I think I'm going to go ahead and get a

What were you doing here Sunday???  There's no reason to have to be here on 
Sunday in that group. And I definitely agree that food is not payment for 
overtime! We played our softball tournament yesterday.  I'm so sore today I 
can barely walk...and it hurts to take a deep breath!  I'm really out of 
shape.  And yesterday they had me batting in front of a guy that would hit 
these great hits and runs really, REALLY fast.  So I ran most of the day it 
felt like.  

Let me know how the MRI comes out.  I do want you to keep me informed with 
how she's doing, but I'm not going to be one of those people that's always 
asking and driving you crazy.  

Don't work too hard.  And tell what's her name now (wedding girl) I said hi.

Hey, the wedding girl is back in the office today.  She says she needs a 
couple more days off!  After a week of partying how could you need more time 
off?!
Some one butchered Carla's hair.  Poor thing.  I think I'd go to another hair 
dresser.
Megan's getting an MRI this morning.  
I need another day off because I worked so much Thursday, Friday and Sunday!  
And food is not payment!
See ya.  It's a zoo here.
B

Here are your positions.  I checked the conversion factors in our system.  I 
had the factors that you sent me, so I don't know why we are pulling 
different factors.  

Let me know how the position looks tonight.

year...again!!!  Have fun with that entry.

These are revised schedules for Jan, Mar, &  Apr 2000 and the estimate 
(scheduled) volumes for May.
The prices were revised to capture Texas General storage revenue (fuel 
retention) in Jan, Mar, & Apr.  The fuel volumes are shown as a zero buy 
price for the storage book.
The April also has volume true-ups due to actual metered volumes. (Schedule 
6).  Another adjustment was made in April to true up the cumulative facility 
balance, (4,295 mmbtu).

Thanks,
Kenny

It's official.  I'm going to start up there March 12th.  As for a place to 
live, I'll probably make a quick trip up there sometime next week to look at 
apartments.

Robin

The sooner the better.  Do you have a place to live yet?  

Let me know when its official, so I can tell the group you're coming.

Hey Richard,

I think we've finally gotten an answer out of the analyst program.  I'm just 
waiting on the paper work now.  I spoke to Laura yesterday about a possible 
March 12th start date.  Let me know if that date's okay for you.  

I'll let you know if anything changes.

Robin

What's going on?  I haven't heard from you in awhile.  Laura indicated to me 
that she was able to do something with the analyst program to hopefully solve 
your cost of living issue.  We would still love to have you in Chicago.  Let 
me know what you are thinking.

You may have told Laura, but I haven't spoken to her much in the last couple 
of weeks and we were all wondering up here in Chicago.

Richard

I'm going.

Thanks,
Robin

Ivonne,

Thanks for the information.  Will I receive the $3,500 automatically on my 
paycheck, or do I need to submit an expense report to be reimbursed for any 
expenses I incur?  If I do need to submit an expense report, who should I 
turn it in to?

Thanks,
Robin

   

Robin,

You will be receiving a cost-of-living adjustment of 20% when you relocate to 
Chicago plus an additional $1,000 per month.  In addition, we will provide 
relocation assistance for your household goods and car transportation.  

Allowance
$3,500 will cover expenses which are outside the movement of your household 
goods.  (This amount is before taxes.)

Household goods move
Option 1 - Full service of household goods
Option 2 - Self move / $1,500  (This amount is before taxes.)

Please let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks,
Ivonne Brown

They're great...awesome country music.  Don't be too scared.

I don't know I haven't heard anything today.

Don't be scared...I'm just kidding.

Kathy,

I discussed the $35K variance with Brian yesterday, and the adjustment will 
be made on the last day of March.  That will ensure that we tie to your 
number for the rest of the month.  Then we'll do a top level adjustment on 
the last day P&L to clear the variance from last month.  I've talked with 
Brad Jones (the person preparing the NGP&L) and Brian Gillis is supposed to 
remind him at the end of the month.

I start my new job in Chicago next week.  Bilal Bajwa will assume my 
responsibilities.  Here are everyone's numbers.

Bilal Bajwa x713-853-3409

P&L-  Bradley Jones  x713-345-8960

Positions- Binh Pham x713-853-5791

Thanks,

Oh we're going now...I have the tickets.

Do you want to go?  I got the impression you were not so convinced. 

Got 'em.  Let me know when you can get out of here.  I guess we'll have to 
ride the bus.  I'm not sure.  Unless you want to try to bribe the parking 
people again.

Wanna go to the Rodeo?
	
	

I have approximately 25 tickets for tonight's rodeo performance of Lonestar & 
Brad Paisley. If you are interested please come by my new location of EB1190A 
and pick up your tickets.

Thanks!

I sent Charlene an email this morning and surprise, surprise I haven't heard 
anything.  Not too much going on right now.  Talk to ya later.

I spoke with Monica about this issue yesterday.

The gas group stopped publishing it to the website, but I am not sure if they 
use the info for other purposes.  Maybe Robin or David can respond to that 
issue.

Chris, most of the remaining people on the distribution list are EES 
management.  Does Corp no longer require the Basis position report to be 
prepared daily?  If so, we will no longer send it.

Thanks,
MYH

Chris Abel@ECT
02/16/2001 10:26 AM
You can take Michael Benien and myself off of the list, as we no longer use 
this report.   Additionally, you should remove Rahmaan Mwongozi and Gabriel 
Monroy as they no longer work in the gas group.  You might want to check with 
the others to see if the report needs to continue going to them also.

Thanks,
Chris

Please find the attached EES Basis Position Report.

Thanks, 
Monica

Did you see?  She completely blew me off.  I submitted a more specific 
question this time.  

Thanks for the explanation b/c I was completely clueless.  They are 
definitely censoring.   She hasn't answered anything other than the program 
requirements, etc.  What a waste of time.  But I guarantee you they'll bring 
this up as something great they've done to improve communication.

R

Are you watching this eSpeak?  Either no one is asking interesting questions 
or they are censoring them.  I asked about why we have arbitrarily assigned 
PRC reps, but she hasn't answered that yet.

My day sucks so far...how about yours?  I caught a million dollar mistake 
this morning and was feeling pretty proud of myself.  That is until John 
called and said there's something wrong with the P&L.  It was only an $87 
million mistake.  I don't know what the big deal was.  Anyway, things are 
calming down a little now.  I'm just still irritated.  That mistake was 
something I should have caught.  Oh well I'm leaving soon.  

That's enough whining.  So what are you up to today?  I'm looking forward to 
actually being able to go home at a decent time today and having nothing that 
has to be done tonight.  I'm just going to kick back and watch TV.  I might 
call Ragini and Sabina and see if they want to come over for king cake.  
You'll be invited too of course.  

I'm starving.  Do you have any calzones this morning?

Talk to ya later

Kathy,

I am attaching a revised P&L by Trader.  I moved the Term_GD p&l from Lambie 
to McKay.  We are, however, still off $35,000 on McKay.  It looks like the 
file got updated after we pulled in the final Feb. p&l.  Since we've already 
reported Feb, I can't restate something that would change the total p&l.  An 
adjustment will just need to be made in March to correct the Feb. variance.  

Robin

Now that that lady is irritating you maybe you'll finally miss me.  Well, I 
might finally be getting somewhere on my move.   I now have an informal offer 
that is acceptable.  I just need it in writing now.  But it looks like I'll 
be in Chicago by March 12th.  Yikes...I have a lot to do before then.  We 
need to all go to lunch before I leave.  

Good luck ignoring your neighbor.  RR

Becky Pitre
02/21/2001 10:28 AM
Need something to do?  The lady that sits in your old spot is helping her 
brother with his divorce.  In fact he may not have to anything but show up in 
court!  The details I don't care to hear, but I can't help it.  I can hear 
everything and every day there is some new personal matter that needs to be 
taken care of.  Maybe if she stuck to just her own business she wouldn't be 
on the phone so much and I wouldn't have to hear all the junk.  Gag.  B.

As long as he leaves after me I think it's great!!!  

Hahaha.  That was pretty funny.  I have a feeling that's the reaction my 
grandmothers will actually have.  

I thought you  comments about the "flexibility" of the program were 
hilarious.  I just talked to Laura.   I'm moving to Chicago.  I'll give you 
all the details and dates later.  

Susan,

The NG-PRICE-PRC book will now be calculated using two post ids.  Therefore, 
we need an additional RisktRAC book id for the Price book so that we can 
capture both post ids.  Please set up an NG-PRICE2-PRC book with the same 
attributes as the NG-PRICE-PRC book.  The new books needs to be added to the 
AGG-GAS, AGG-GASIII and AGG-GASIV portfolios.  In AGGIII and IV, please set 
up a separate portfolio for the new book.  The new portfolio should be named 
M_Maggi.  

If you have any questions, give me a call.
Thanks,
Robin

Yeah right!  Nice try - Geek!

I was just talking to Fred Mitro and he says you have put together a couple 
of different models on coal.  Can you please send me those models, so I can

I talked with Don Miller and Mitch Robinson and it seems that they have also 
covered your other concerns.  They were the ones who I contacted with your 
concerns regarding your demin water, tax abatement and electricity questions.

Gus:
Are you able to assistance me in answering #2.  I have already received 
Dave's comments.  Thanks
Ben

Amy:
Here are the answers to your questions.
With regards to the air permit to construct application, Jinsung will send it 
to you by email today, if he hasn't already;
The Petition for Alternate testing, has been sent to you;
3.     This is a one time report to the State's emergency planning committee, 
the local emergency response department, and the local fire department 
declaring the presence of sulfuric acid and lead in quantities greater than 
500 lb and 10,000 lb, respectively.  These notifications are being mailed out 
today. 
4.     We are in the process of tracking down the analytical data associated 
with the Lake Acquisition property and will hopefully have that to you later 
today.

I hope this helps and please give us a call if you have any more questions.  
Thanks!
Ben

John:
With regards to the Demin water system, there are no capitalized charges in 
these cost figures - everything is expensed.  With respects to the 
Electricity, there is a Demand Charge included in this numer, which makes up 
approximately 50% of the cost.  The rest is attributable to energy costs.  
These costs are levelized for the full 12 months of the year.  Please let me 
know if you have any other comments.  Thanks!
Ben

This attachment now has a completed answer for question #4.  Let me know if

Don:

To confirm that we have scheduled a nominal two hour call on Monday (10/30)
at 1:30 CST to warp up the Peaker operational due diligence.  Duke has
arranged for a call in number  800/473-8492.  The conference host is Joe
Synnott.

Our focus on this call will be to review the status of our outstanding
requests and open questions.  An example of the former category are the
inspection reports at Gleason and the gas questions.  In the latter
category we still have some confusion about the units actual vs. guaranteed
performance data, status of the warranty items, historic transmission
performance, and relationship between the facility operations team and the
asset management function in Houston.    In addition our insurance staff
will be participating and will have some questions about the casualty loss
histories at the facilities.

Organizationally: please make available people on your team knowledgeable
in the operation and asset management of the facilities.  I would suggest
Ross, the plant managers, Mitch, and your environmental team.

Any questions, please don't hesitate to give me a call at 713-627-6579.

Ron: 
It looks like Jane has not received these questions.  Let me know where they 
are in terms of being answered.  Thanks!

Thanks for the response.  We had previously received the response regarding
the SPCC plan issue but I had not seen the responses for the Lincoln
facility (although I had received Gleason last week).  Just to confirm what
is outstanding:  The questions relating to all facilities sent on 10/23,
the questions relating to Wheatland sent on 10/23, the questions relating
to LV Cogen I and II sent on 10/23, and the questions relating to the LV
Cogen I and II schedules sent on 10/25.  Please let me know if this is not
consistent with your understanding of what is outstanding.  Thanks.

P.S.  You had also indicated in your 10/25 email that the letter from TDEC
regarding the Subpart GG variance would be faxed to me.  To date, I have
not yet received it.  Thanks.

The following questions were raised by our review of the draft
environmental schedules on Dealbench.

LV Cogen I and II

1.  Schedule 4.1(i) references an annual audit of the CEM system in May
2000.  Is this audit on Dealbench and/or can we get a copy of it?

2.  Please provide a copy and/or reference to a Dealbench document for the
Phase I referenced on Schedule 4.1(n).

3.  Please provide copies and/or references to Dealbench documents for the
items listed as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on Schedule 4.1(u).  [Note that we have
reviewed the 1995 storm water permit, but did not see an indication that it
is automatically renewed.  Is this reflected elsewhere?]

Wheatland, Gleason and Lincoln

1.  We noticed that Schedule 4.1(u) for each facility indicates that an
SPCC is needed but not currently in place.  What is stored that triggers
the SPCC requirement?  How long have these materials been stored at the
facilities?

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions or if you would like
to discuss these issues in further detail.  Thanks.

Charlie:
Sorry for the delay with the e-mail, I just got back into the office from

Hey Dan:
It was good to see you the other day.  It's funny because I had tried to send 
you an e-mail, after talking to Andrew about the paper.  It's great eveything 
is going well.  I'm running the NYC Marathon in two weeks so my weekends are 
mostly about running, but after that I would like to get together for some 
golf.  Talk to you soon.

The water analysis that I sent you is for Gleason.  Over the weekend we put

Amy:
If I could take the class beginning on November 18th, that would be great.  I 
think it would really help me get some problems I've been having worked out.  
Thanks again for taking the time to get back with me, I greatly appreciate it.
Regards,

Ashley:
Thanks for sending this e-mail so quickly.  I would like to suggest a couple 
of changes to your resume just to "tighten" it up a little bit.  These are 
just minor changes that will make it look more consistent.  I also talked to 
a women who sits two seats down from me, who is a recruiter for another 
group.  She wanted to take a look at your resume once it was ready.  Let's 
try and talk about this later today or this weekend, so you can make these 
changes. Once we get things going internally, I know we can get you over here 
at Enron pretty quickly.  If I don't hear from you later today, please try me 
at home which is (713) 355-8738.  Talk to you soon.

Don,

As a result of our review of the information and documents on Lincoln we
are requesting additional documents which are not in the data room.

1.   Relating to the plant's PSD:

     The Mostardi & Platt emissions test protocol for the May 2000
     emissions test
      A report to Illlinois EPA containing the emission test data
     Continuous Emission Monitoring (" CEM") Data ( all data
     developed since start-up)
     Any reports to IEPA required under the permit pertaining to
     exceedances, or
     start-up, breakdown & malfunction ( we have internal memos indicating
     that there
     was a breakdown at # 7 on July 5,2000)

2. Also, we don't have any permits for wastewater discharge. We have been
told that there is no wastewater discharged except
sewage/office wastewater which is going to a septic field. But we have no
verification of this at this point.

Thank you for your attention to these items.

Hey Ashley:
Please give me a call at 713.853.7998, which is my work phone at Enron.  I 
look forward to talking to you about Enron.
Regards,
Ben

Hey Alli:
I hadn't heard from you in a while and wanted to see how evergything was 
going.  Are you in David Cox's group and if so, how are things going?  Let me 
know if I can be of any assistance.  Talk to you soon.  
Ben

Hey Dan:
Just wanted to drop you a line.  I hadn't talked to you in quite some time 
and wanted to see how everything was going.  I had lunch today with my 
friend, Andrew Slocum, who I think you know.  He talked to his good friend 
Adam Wexslur (sp) and said things were going well with the paper.  He told me 
that everything seemed to be going great and that the paper has been out on 
print for a little while now.  It sounds great!  Please let me know how 
everything is going, because I think its awesome what your doing.  Hope to 
talk to you soon.
Ben 

Thanks for the quick reply.  I live within inside the loop on Buffalo 
Speedway near 59.  I think lunch next week sometime would be great.  I can 
come up to the Woodlands and we can meet up for lunch.  Let me check to see 
what day is best and I will send you an e-mail later today to confirm.  Hope 
that works and I'll talk to you soon.
Ben

Sounds Good!

Charlie:
 It was a pleasure meeting you yesterday afternoon at the Columbia Business 
School information session.  As you probably noticed through my enthusiasm, I 
really enjoy working in the energy-finance industry, especially with Enron.  
Working in this sector, at this time, has created many new opportunities.  I 
am interested in talking with you to see if we can do some type of 
transaction with you guys.  It sounds like you have a lot going in areas that 
we might be interested in.  If you could send me a business proposal or 
summary of what your doing, that would be helpful.  
 With regards to Columbia Business School, I applied last year and did not 
get in due to my GMAT score.  I decided to take a graduate level finance 
class this summer, which I received an A.  I am currently taking another 
graduate finance class this semester.  I am also retaking the GMAT, with the 
hopes of increasing my quantitative score.  
 Last year, I was asked back for an interview, which I felt was a good sign.  
I heard from one of my recommenders that the only thing that I needed to 
improve on was my GMAT score.  Recently, I wrote a brief letter to the Dean 
of Admissions, Linda Meehan, informing her of my recent actions as well as my 
continued interest with Columbia.  I hope that these actions will help me get 
into Columbia this year.  My desire to go to Columbia, stems from their 
network, location, reputation and curriculum.  Since growing up in Pelham,  
it would be nice to get back to New York for a little while.
 As you can see, my desire to go to Columbia is very strong.  I hope this 
brief e-mail has provided some insight into what I'm doing to get into 
Columbia.  I hope we can meet for lunch sometime soon either up in the 
Woodlands or downtown.  Again, thank you for your interest and I look forward 
to talking with you about Columbia and future energy transactions.
Regards,

Ben Rogers

Gentlemen,

Attached is a list of due diligence questions for the Enron generation
assets (Wheatland, Lincoln, Gleason and LV Cogen).  We would very much
appreciate your help is getting answers for by Friday, 10/20 if possible.

Unfortunately, we are still having significant difficulty in accessing
documents on DealBench.  The download time is usually several minutes to a
half hour per document and often the larger documents will not fully print
out on our systems.  Two of our consultants have experienced similar
difficulties which suggests that whatever problems we are facing are not
unique to systems at PECO.

We are concerned that the limited information will impact our ability to
bid on the assets.  Would it be possible to receive from you either a print
out of the documents or the documents on CD ROM?

Mike Cazaubon

I wanted to reply, even though I have called recently.  Work has slowed down 
a little bit, but will probably pick up in a week or two.  I have traded 
calls with Kara the past two days, so I haven't talked to her in some time.  
Anyway, I hope your figuring out where we should go for a trip this sping.  
We will have to know whether Megan and I need to work on our golf games or 
not.  We have been thinking maybe you guys are thinking about going to 
Ireland or England to play some of the old courses of this world.  Or maybe 
you have been thinking about going to Paris to visit the city of love.   
Anyway, these are just some of the thinks we have been thinking about.  Talk 
to you soon.
Love 
Ben

Amy:
Forgot to mention timing.  I can do nights and weekends, but mainly as much 
time with them as possible. Thanks
Ben

Golf sounds like a great idea.  I will talk to meathead - "Brandon" about 
playing.  By the way, do you have Jason Staebels' address or phone number.  
Thanks
Ben

Thanks for the reply.  I can understand your position.  I am looking more for 
a refresher course.  I am planning on taking it around mid December or as 
late as mid January.  I am beginning to start studying again on my own, but I 
wanted to get a little more help.  Thanks for your call!
Ben

Hey:
That sounds good.  How does Thursday work?
Ben

Jinsung and Don,

We are continuing to have difficulties accessing data from DealBench.  The
response times from PECO, PricewaterhouseCoopers and other high speed
internet connections have been very slow (sometimes 5 minutes or more to
retrieve a single 10-15 page text document).  It would help us greatly in
our due diligence efforts if this material could be made available on CD
ROM as has often been done with other deals we have been involved with.
Please advise if this is possible and if so, when the CD's would be
available.

The following is an update on Enron's sales process, including several
additions to DealBench.

1.  The Purchase and Sale Agreement ("PSA") for each asset has now been
posted to DealBench under the New Document section.  Please review the
instructions attached to each PSA.

2. The Management Presentations (with audio) have now been posted to
DealBench under the Management Presentation(strikethrough: s) section.
When attempting to view the presentation, please log onto DealBench using
Microsoft Internet Explorer. Once in DealBench, you will most likely need
to download "Flash Player" (free download).  You can do this by clicking
"Macromedia Flash Player download center" in the Linked Documents section
of DealBench.  The download usually takes less than 30 seconds.  After the
download, return to the Management Presentation section of DealBench and
click on the Management Presentation (with audio).   A power point
presentation has also been included in the Management Presentation section
of DealBench.   A detailed instruction guide "Instruction for Viewing
Management Presentation" has been posted in New Document section of
DealBench.

3.  Please be sure to consistently review the New Documents section on
DealBench for any new documents that have been added to DealBench.  Also, a
running black line Due Diligence Index is posted in the Due Diligence Index
/ Plant Pictures section of DealBench.

4. Any drawings or CDs that you need from the Due Diligence Indices may be
requested by sending an email to don.miller@enron.com or jhoff2@enron.com.

5.  Any problems or issues that you may be encountering need to  be
directed to Jinsung Myung at 713-853-7330.

6.  We are prepared to schedule Q&A sessions.  Please contact Don Miller at
713-853-0492.

Regards,

Don Miller

Hey Mike:
Marlon and Marissa's wedding was alot of fun.  Megan and I sat at the married 
table, which had Pete and Amy Fullem, Kit and her husband, Marc, Sammy and 
her husband, Jon and Dana Corpina, Dana Schuster and her husband - so as you 
can see it was pretty interesting.  The other table was Mike, OB, Choby, 
Tina, and Patty Donahue.  Mike, OB, Choby, Patty, Megan and I took a limo 
from the city to the wedding and had the limo tell 12:00, then went out till 
5:00am.  I love going to that evil city, but I love leaving it even better.  
Overall, it was fun and seems like everyone is doing well.  Dana and Jon just 
had their baby, its a girl.  I also ended up seeing Alan Waugh and Tim 
Hurley.  Hurley has gained about 200 pounds - the man is huge.  Anyway, I 
hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.
Ben

I will be attending the Columbia Business School session this Monday in 
Houston.  Thank you for the invitation.

I received your e-mail regarding this years Super Saturday's.  I am currently 
an Associate, but as an Analyst I participated in a couple of Super 
Saturday's, but haven't done any in a little while, so I wanted to offer up 
my services.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do, because I'll 
be more than happy to help out again.  Thanks!

Robbie:
I was in your class that you taught for the Princeton Review at Enron just 
recently.  What I'm looking for is a private Math tutor.  I wasn't sure if I 
had to go through the Princeton Review or if I could talk directly to you.  I 
liked the way you taught the class and wanted to see if you taught one on one 
sessions. If you could let me know, I would appreciate it.  Thanks!

I am putting together that right now.  Thanks
Ben

 Just wanted to give everyone a update on where we were with all the site 
visits to the plants.  As you already know, site visits begin this Thursday 
and runs through the 27th of October, so its a pretty tight schedule.  In 
terms of who will be specifically covering which plants, this is the 
following: Gleason will be Dave Kristich; Lincoln will be Fred Mitro; and 
Wheatland will be Ross Newlin.  These guys will cover the site visits the 
next two weeks, but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed.
  While on the site visit, please make sure that the companies do not take 
any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager.  
Most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per 
day.
 I hope all of this is clear and if you have any questions about scheduling 
please give me a call.  Again, thank you for your help with these issues.
Regards,

Ben

Thanks for your request.  Those dates are good for you to visit the plants.  
If you could e-mail a list of the names visiting the site and I will do the 
same for you.  Please let me know the exact times that the teams will be

Michael:
Duke is presenting their final bid this Sunday, so I think its even more 
important to get the PSA signed by tomorrow, so that there is no chance to 
try and retrade the deal.  I don't know how things ended up yesterday, but I 
think things need to come together very fast.

Here is the confidentiality agreement we used to send out to all the 
bidders.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!

The presentation I sen you yesterday needs to be broken up into three 
different presentations.  You can see that there is a cover page for each 
presentation.  The first presentation is from page 1 to 18; second 
presentation is from 19 to 36; and the third presentation is from 37 to 55.  
Please give me a call idf you have any questions. Thanks

Dad:
The industry is getting beat up a little bit, but I hope this isn't slowing 
you guys down at all.  I talked with Mike M the yesterday, he said that his 
meetings with you guys seem to go well.  I think that doing that deal would 
be quite beneficial to both companies over all strategies, regarding power, 
gas and cash flow.  Megan and I will be in NYC this weekend for a wedding.  I 
would like to talk to you pretty soon anout a couple of things.  I have 
decided to stay at Enron at least till this project is over, which will be 
early next year.  The more experience I have with another company, like Enron 
the better.  I am also going to reapply to just The Texas Business School.  
Things are going well with my communication with them this year.  I have 
already talked to one of their professors that I talked to last year and have 
gotten an e-mail from the director of the admissions program.  The both feel 
I have and are currently doing the right things to get into the school next 
year.  So things are going well so far.  I am contining with my other class 
and going to take the GMAT one more time.  
I have said a little more than I would have liked but I just wanted to give 
you the laod down of what I have been thinking.
Regards,
Ben

Hey there: 
The industry is getting beat up a little bit, hope that is not effecting any 
of your plans with anything.  I talked to Mike 

 Thanks for your quick reply.  With regards to the classes, I looked into U 
of H for summer classes and they did not provide graduate level summer 
classes.  The only school that provided graduate level summer classes was the 
University of St. Thomas.  It would have been nice to take these classes at U 
of H, because our Chairman and CEO and my recommender to The Texas Business 
School, Ken Lay, received his PhD from there.  
 Thanks again for your response and advice and hope all is going well.

Regards,
Ben 

Thanks!

I will do that first thing on Thursday.  I will call you with the results.

Dr. Harris:
 I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it did not go too quickly, as I felt 
mine did.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in 
attending the Business School.  
 I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class 
(Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with 
myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I 
have also decided to take another graduate level finance class 
(Macroeconomics), which I am currently taking.  
 I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try 
and receive a "special testing status" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting 
to hear back from them with their decision.  When I hear back from GMAC, I am 
planning on re-taking the GMAT to try and increase my score.
 As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business 
School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to 
increase my application profile. 
 Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to 
enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look 
forward to hearing from you soon.

I will be sending you the CA's some time this morning.  I needed to wait till 
we had our conference with the investment bankers, CSFB, to know which 
companies were going to the second round.  I did not want to send you the 
CA's of companies that were not going on to the second round.  Please give me 
a call if you have any questions.
Ben  

Well, I am.  It's like this everynight.  I thought that you guys going back 
to Bermuda would be fun.  I hope Kara finds a way to battle the problem she 
has.  I tough for me to imagine what kind of place she's in right now.  Talk 
to you soon.
Ben

Yes you have passed the test - Congratualations.  We have been working very 
hard on our sale and wanted to let you know that your guys came back with a 
very good bid.  We will inform you probably this afternoon or tomorrow that 
you will be making the short list.   We will probably have a short list of 
about 5-7 companies.   You guys are in the top three! I think you guys have a 
very good chance at getting these plants, which I think is an excellent 
opportunity.  Hope all is going well and your other talks are going in the 
right direction.  On a side note, from what I've heard from my parents in 
Boston, Kara seems to be doing pretty poorly.  She is clearly going through 
some very difficult times.  Talk to you soon.
Love,
Ben

This is a test to see if you are checking your e-mail these days.  I have a 
feeling that you have not been, due to your board presentation last week.  
Mike M. tells me he will be up there today - hope that goes well for you 
guys.  I really think there could be something there.  Please give me a call 
sometime soon.  Things are going well here and we have been quite busy.  Give 
me a call sometime.  The number is (713) 853-7998. See ya!

Professor Titman:
 I hope you had an enjoyable summer and it didn't go too quickly.   I hope 
you remember who I am from last years application process.  I enjoyed meeting 
you last year and talking with  you regarding the curriculum and admissions 
process.  I wanted to let you know that I am still very much interested in 
attending the Business School.  
 I took your advice this summer and took a graduate level finance class 
(Financial Management), which I received an A.  I was very pleased with 
myself, because I had not taken this type of class in quite some time.  I 
have decided to take another graduate level finance class (Macroeconomics), 
which I am currently taking and runs through December.  
 I also sent my information regarding my learning disability into GMAC to try 
and receive a "special testing status" for the GMAT.   I am currently waiting 
to hear back from them with their decision.
 As you can see, I am still very much interested in attending the Business 
School for next year and I'm in the process of doing whatever I can to 
increase my application profile.  I am also sending an e-mail to Carl Harris, 
who heads up the admissions process  to inform him of these recent 
developments. 
 Please let me know if there is anything else you think I need to do to 
enhance my application profile.   Again, I hope all is going well and I look 
forward to hearing from you soon

Good to hear from you.  Yes, it was a wonderful weekend to work all weekend.  
Were very busy at work and will continue to be so through the rest of the 
year.  It is very upsetting to hear about Kara.  Seems like she has a long 
way to go to recovery, but I'm optimistic that she can get to where she needs 
to be.  I talked to her Sunday morning.  She seemed upbeat.  I hope the place 
she is staying at is giving her a glance at how bad it could be so that its 
kind of a wake up call.  Let me know how Megan and I can help.  Megan is 
going to get this really good book on Manic Depression.  Hope we can talk 
about this soon.
Love,
 Your Son  

Sorry to hear that.  I called Patty again to ask her brother if he knew 
anybody running the marathon.  I also called Megan's sister, Deirdre to see 
if she knows of anyone not going to run, but signed up.  I hope this helps.  
It would great for you to be in it, running it.
Ben

Thanks, C

Cliff:
Do you have Dierdre's address in NYC.  Megan and I are staying there next 
weekend and are getting picked up at the airport and need to tell the driver 
where were going.  How is everything going?  Slow down the traveling yet?  
Make sure you include yourself in the Turkey Run on Thanksgiving in Chicago.  
Talk to you soon.

Dave:
Just wanted to remind you about the call I received from Paul Cavicchi with 
Tractebel.  He was calling to ask about an extention to the bidding on the 
assets.  I basically said that there are no extentions except for bids that 
are strong bids that come in on Monday or Tuesday of next week.  He sounded a 
little disappointed that they got the book so late, but still seemed 
interested in the assets.  Hope this helps. 
Ben

Squeeze in some golf or bet on the horns -  I sure we can find some "other" 
activities to keep you, I mean us, out of trouble.

Here is the latest version of the management presentation.  We are contining 
to update and fill in the holes.  Please give myself or Don a call if you 
have any questions.  Thanks
Ben

Guys:
Don Miller and I would like to set some time up with you, today if possible, 
to talk about state and local tax issues for the 2000 peakers.  I will talk 
with Don about a good time to meet and let you know.  But let me know what is 
a good time for you this afternoon.  Thanks for your time.
Ben

Michael:
Just wanted to let you know that I just talked to Don Miller, the lead guy 
from our side, regarding a different matter, but he mentioned to me that 
things seemed to be not going so well in the PSA discussions.  I didn't have 
time to see what the issues were, but I will when he calls back.  As you 
already know, these assets are yours to lose and I would hate to see you guys 
lose these assets to legal issues.  I know we both can come to some middle 
ground before people lose their patience.  My only advice, for what its 
worth, is to keep talking with Delainey and to make sure the lawyers don't 
run away with the issues and forget whats at stake on the commercial side.  
Hope this helps.
Ben

Here you go!  Again, good to hear from you.

you have it or do you know who does?  Thanks

It wasn't like I was neglecting you.  You must understand that e-mail is 
faster than sending a letter and its slower than calling someone, but there 
is not always an immediate return.  Some people are lazy with returning 
e-mail.  It has been really busy here.  We are working long hours and this 
project is trying to close by the end of the year.  It's a $1 Billion 
project, so it takes alot of work.  Talk to you soon.
Ben

I know how e-mail is suppose to work, but its been so crazy here that I 
haven't even been able to do that.  We were here last night till 10:00 and it 
looks to be the same tonight and potentially for the rest of the year.  This 
project is going to kill me.  I glad to see that you are active on the net.   
I'll keep in touch a little better. Love
Ben

I spoke to Aquila again today.  They are planning to submit bids on Friday
for Gleason, Wheatland and Pastoria.  They already have a tolling agreement
in the Lincoln area and don't want more capacity there.

Aquila's question:

They questioned the development costs for Pastoria - look very high.  I
noted that it includes the ERC's.  They would like a breakout of the
development costs

PG&E's question is below.  Are you comfortable disclosing this at this stage
or is this a phase II due diligence item?

Since we do not have to accept the NEPCO contract, can you break out the
cost and scope of equipment (Enron uses the term "power islands")?  Can we
get this information tomorrow?  Both cost and scope of this is important to
be able to assess the "EPC" price and determine bid price.

I talked with Theresa Voss about the insurance on the peakers and she said 
that they have been making payments on the peakers and that this "billing 
separately plan" on the peakers will last until March of 2001.  At that 
point, an umbrella plan will cover the turbines.  Regarding the balance 
sheet, they have been accounting for it under prepaid insurance and have been 
amortizing it each month as its been paid.  

Let me know if you need anything else.
Ben

Thanks for the info.  We found the org charts. 
Ben

Ben,

Can we get the answers to these also.

Thanks,
James

Some additional questions.

1) do the capital cost of linears (gas, transmission and system upgrades)
include tax gross ups relating thereto?

2) Is the cost of backup power (for startup and station service) included in
the variable O&M estimate, or is it included in one of the fixed charges.
Please tell us where it is and how much it is expected to be annually?

Thanks.

PG&E Gen is most interested in Pastoria and had several questions/concerns
that they asked about during my discussion with them:

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.
* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?
* They also questioned whether there would be any "agricultural
restrictions"?

David Parquet asked me to forward these answers to you:
Question:
Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term
Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with
PEF?
Answer:  We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do 
not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.  The maintenance 
reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.

Question: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in 
the
capital cost estimate or are they assumed to be purchased through the
maintenance reserve estimate (i.e. the LTSA) charge?

Answer:  The maintenance reserve is intended to include parts and labor for 
the overhaul.

My responses to one set of PG&E questions would be as follows.  Dean is 
answering the other one and will send back to you directly.

* What is Enron's intent re: continuing involvement?  PG&E is
concerned about any potential requirements that they might be required to
either purchase fuel from Enron or engage Enron as the power marketer.

RESPONSE: Enron is very flexible re continuing involvement:  scheduling 
coordination, fuel supply, power marketing, etc.  We are also flexible re the 
time period and the terms of the continuing involvement.  Whatever 
arrangement is developed would be mutually beneficial.

* What is status of EPC negotiations.  Will they be required to engage
NEPCO as the EPC contractor?  Does the EPC contractor have control over the
turbines?

RESPONSE: o EPC negotiations are complete with NEPCO.  Contract has not been 
executed, but has been "put on the shelf" awaiting decision on successful 
bidder for the purchase of the Pastoria project from ENA.  Successful bidder 
and NEPCO will each have the option of executing the EPC agreement.

  o Successful bidder is under no obligation to engage NEPCO.

  o West LB has control of the turbines.  They can be assigned either to the 
LLC or to ENA.  (If assigned to ENA, it was because the successful bidder for 
the Pastoria project did not want the turbines with the acquisition.)  If 
assigned to the LLC as part of the acquisition, the LLC can then assign the 
turbines to the ultimate EPC contractor.   

* They also questioned whether there would be any "agricultural
restrictions"?

RESPONSE: The project site is presently under a Williamson Act contract to 
maintain agricultural use in exchange for lower taxes.  Last week, the Kern 
County Board of Supervisors voted to cancel the Williamson Act contract to 
allow for industrial use, which started a 180 day public comment period.  
However, the Governor has on his desk a bill for signature that would reduce 
the public comment period for the cancellation to the same time frame as the 
request for rehearing period for the CEC Final Decision.  (The Governor has 
until 9/30 sign the bill and is expected to do so because of the overwhelming 
support of the bill in the Assembly and the Senate.)  The cancellation will 
be contingent upon a successful CEC decision and a payment of a Williamson 
Act cancellation fee.

I received a call from Tom Favinger at PG&E today.  He is looking for the
responses to his questions from last week and also has a new question.  He
would like to get a breakout of the $10.25 million item in the Pastoria
capital budget labeled Pre-Commercial Operations Costs.

I also spoke to Darryn O Llegas from PECO today.  They are planning to bid
on the peakers and LV Cogen on Friday.  His questions are:

Peakers

* Will Enron's control area dispatching/scheduling software be
included in the property conveyed with the peakers?
* Do the Peaker's permits make any allowance for combined cycle
operation or would they need to re-start the permitting process?
* They would like clarification concerning the joint ownership of gas
interconnects - what is owned, cost to maintain, etc.

LV Cogen

* Update on status of Phase II permitting?
* Update on status of development process?
* Are there any tax abatements of any type for the Phase II project?

Additional Comments from PECO:

* Don't have price curves yet for all of the peakers markets - will
need to develop prior to final bid.
* May have a concern re: market power for the peakers as a result of
the PECO/Unicom merger.  They will be comfortable enough to bid this week
and don't expect it to be a concern for the final bid.
* They will probably submit a bid with separate values for: Wheatland;
other peakers together; LV Cogen.
* They are working their bid from two perspectives: replacement cost
plus a premium and discounted cash flow.  DCF will obviously change as they
get their price curves updated.

David Parquet asked me to forward these answers to you:
Question:
Is the major maintenance reserve estimate based on a negotiated Long Term
Services Agreement (LTSA)?  If so, will it be in place and transfer with
PEF?
Answer:  We have not negotiated an LTSA with anyone at this time, and we do 
not expect to have one in place to transfer with PEF.  The maintenance 
reserve is our estimate based on industry data and information from GE.

Question: Are spare parts for the first major overhaul included anywhere in 
the

Answer:  The maintenance reserve is intended to include parts and labor for 
the overhaul.

Quick comments.  Mike, what are your thoughts on my answer in O5?

I'll provide start numbers for O5 later today.

E2.  No; however, CFR60 subpart GG short term limits still apply 
(approximately 90 ppm NOx) which are well above the turbine emissions.

T1.  "on any asset" should read "of any asset"

O5. Since commercial operations, the Wheatland facility has averaged xx 
starts per machine, and the Lincoln facility has averaged yy starts per 
machine.  The start-up and commissioning process followed a normal startup 
progression.  The Lincoln facility experienced a generator failure in unit #7 
during the first run season.  General Electric replaced the generator under 
warranty provisions.  Sratification of gas flows was observed in the stacks 
at the Wheatland facility during CEMS certification.  The CEMS certification 
was then postponed until Summer '01.

O6.  Wasn't it a strip mine?  I didn't think it was a coal mine.

Luke:
How are ya?  How is the DC area these days?  Houston is still fucking hot and 
Enron is still doing well and the price is still screaming so things are 
good.  In response to your inquiry regarding Homecoming.  Megan and I are 
actually, if you can believe it, going to Marlon and Marissa's wedding the 
first weekend in October in NJ.  Also, OB, Chobu, Mike, Corpina and Danny, 
Patty D, Sammy, Amy, etc. are going as well - should be interesting.  I 
haven't seen some of those people for quite awhile.  I was trying to set 
something up, but that came up as well as I'm running in this year's NYC 
Marathon, which is the first Sunday in Novemebr, so trying to arrange 
something became even harder.  I still want to get together with you guys, 
but trying to figure out when and where.  Suggestions are welcomed.  Hope all 
is going well and talk to you soon.
Ben

(713) 853-7998 Office Ph.

Hey Mike:
You won't believe whose wedding Megan and I are going to in early Oct. - 
Marlon and Marissa's.  As well as OB, Choby, Mike and like Patty Donahue, 
Sammy, Amy, etc.  It should be pretty interesting to say the least.  I am 
also running in this year's NYC Marathon which falls on the first Sunday in 
November.  So trying to get to the east coast for a third time has been tough 
to arrange.  How was Patty's wedding -it looked like alot of fun.  I still 
want to meet up with you guys somewhere, but I'm just not sure where at this 
point - I still think DC.  Let me know what you think.

How the hell are ya?  Wanted to drop you a line and see how you were doing 
and let you know that Brandon and I continued the tradition and went to the 
DMB concert last night.  Must say that it wasn't the same as being with you 
in a limo, but we still had fun.  Wanted to get your number up there, b/c I 
will be up in Chicago for Thanksgiving and was hoping to meet you in Chicago 
then.  Gotta run, but I hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.

Ben,

As requested I have attached BPI's 2nd QTR EDR reports for your review, 
comment and record.  I do not have a "Final" or accepted 3rd QTR EDR from the 
EPA yet.  

Respectfully Mitchell

There is only one quarterly report required for Brownsville. This is the EPA 
electronic data report (EDR) which we generate from the CEMS system and 
submit electronically to the EPA. 

Mitchell - Since you are generating the 3rd quarter reports to the EPA today, 
would you please copy Ben on the submittal. Thanks.

Mr & Mrs. James Rogers
6 Noel Lane
Cincinnati, OH 45243

Just wanted to keep you all informed of my recent discussions with Kinder 
Morgan regarding potentially selling them 4 LM 6000's.  At first they were 
interested in some of the development sites, but became more interested in 
the equipment.  They are trying to get their hands on as many LM 6000's as 
possible, because of their plant configuration utilizing 6 LM 6000's per 
plant.  With my last dicussion as of yesterday (Tuesday the 5th), I gave them 
the approximate price at which they could buy the turbines for - $15,000,000 
per turbine.  Their comment was it was a little on the high side, but they 
still sounded interested because of the quick time frame of receiving them - 
1st Qtr. '01.  If they are still interested they will get back with me with a 
non-binding term sheet within the next couple of weeks.  Please let me know 
if you have any comments.  Thank you!

Enron news release

FYI

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement
said to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.  In the deal, Enron will
provide
both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout and
under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy monopolist
Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said
Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While
eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable
fuel
resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my
boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just like the way they do business."

A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
together during negotiations.  According to the company, "The deal fits
both companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and
retain new customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for
millennia to come."  According to several energy industry insiders,
Hades' high heating demand with very little need for summer air conditioning
make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.

Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained
high growth rates over the last two thousand years.

Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications
companies. The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and
communications assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best
100
Companies
to Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A
Week," and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked
by customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply
contracts.

Doc 01.07.02  - Talks about a 15% assessment for as valorem taxes.
Doc 01.07.02.01 - Property tax estimates - estimates from 2001-2019  (tax +
pilot payments) are $1M a year till 2009 and then to ~$1.4 M for next few
years beg 2010, dropping back down to $700K level.

In 2000, the property tax was just $500K, as there seems to be no pilot
payment until Jan 2001.

My questions are -
   Confirm that the 15% assessment in first doc is included in the estimate
   The schdule of estimated payments is all inclusive of the payments
   relating to property taxes
   Refer me to doc that talks about the pilot agreement or any other tax
   abatement docs

I was thinking Otto's Burgers out on Memorial.  Should I pick you up in front 
of your building?  If s,o what street?

Are you able to go off campus for lunch?  I was thinking about just driving 
by and picking you up.  Let me know where.
Ben

Stan:
I just wanted to touch base with you and let you know I am still with Enron 
and still enjoying the experience and currently working on selling some of 
our power plants with the Generation Investments Group.  I also wanted to say 
congratulations on the birth of your twins - thats great!  If there is any 
chance to have lunch I would greatly look forward to having lunch with you.  
By the way, I had a really good conversation with Rocky Storie the other 
day.  He was my representative for my performance review and I felt he did a 
great job and I greatly appreciated it.  Hope all is going well and I look 
forward to talking to you soon.

Friday it is!  By the way, I heard Mark Warner left The Big E!  
Ben

Sorry about that!  I started on around May 8th and I plan on rotating around 
the end of the year.  Thanks and sorry for the delay. 
Ben

Charlie:
I got your message this morning.  Since we were so successful in selling some 
of our peaking plant last time, we have decided to some some more - so we are 
running like crazy to close these deals this year.  I want to let you know 
that I talked to both people at KinderMorgan and Cinergy about your company 
and the types of transactions that you guys are doing.  I have not had the 
chance to follow up, but plan to real soon.  I just tried to call you about 
10 minutes ago, thus the e-mail response.  I will try again in a little bit.  
Hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.
Ben

How does Wednesday sound?

Hey:
My office number is 713-853-7998.  Lets try and go to lunch this week.  Talk 
to you soon.

Count me in for the game tonight!
Thanks!

Michael:
I hope you have received the FedEx that I sent you yesterday as well as the

to you in the near future.

Just wanted to see how everything is going over there at EBS.  I had lunch 
with Andrew today and he was asking how everything was going.
Ben

Hey man - good to hear from you.  It must be rough house sitting in River 
Oaks, just remember to leave the furniture before you go back to school.  
Next week would be great to get some brews.  My wife and I are moving this 
weekend so it is quite hectic this week.  I will need a lot of booze after 
this move!  How's Chase?  I'll talk to you soon.
Ben

I talked with Choby and OB yesterday and it looks like our old apartment 
(Q42) as well as John, Alan and Jimmy's old apt (Q44) will be attending their 
wedding.  I can already begin to see the craziness.  See ya
Ben

I know that you are disappointed about his move.

Chris:
Tom Swank (3-7194) isa Director in the Midstream group under Ed Baughman.  
The company he is on the board of is Pennaco Energy, Inc.   The company may 
or may not be looking for capital.  Tom knows alot about gas and is a good 
guy to bounce ideas off of.  Lets head to lunch on Friday.   See ya!

Thanks!

Here you go!

Let's try the week after next.  I will be in Martha's Vineyard all next week 
for a little R&R.  See ya
Ben

RIGHT!!!

My shares are just as worthless as the next guys...After announcing 27% 
increase in earnings, but on the same day overshadowed by the REI deal, they 
are certainly needing some deals to do.  My advice...execution, execution, 
execution, of DEALS. that is.

Ben

Dave:
Just wanted to say thank you for the invitation to Cafe Annie next Wednesday, 
unfortunately I will not be able to make it.  I can't tell how much I enjoy 
working within ENA and in particular the East Origination Group and with 
Genco.  Thanks again for the recognition and for giving me this opportunity 
to work in ENA.

Michael:
How's your summer?  Are you in Delaware now?  I am going to set up a weekend 
in DC in the Fall and I will probably do it around homecoming weekend.  I 
want to try and set it up for most of the people will huge out with, but will 
take other suggestions.  I will be sending out e-mails to everyone informing 
them of the weekend.  Choby is going to set up a bar to rent out for Saturday 
night.  In the past, you have sent me e-mails with a bunch of different 
e-mail addresses attached to it.  If you could send me a list of the e-mails 
you have for our friends that would be great.  Thanks for the help and lets 
talk about this further.  Talk to you soon.

Professor Ueng:
Hope all is going well and you have either finished or are almost finished

More Questions:

Both Plants

1.  What are the short term NOx and CO emissions during startups, and are
there limitations during start-ups.

2.  Are industrial stormwater permits required at either site?

Caledonia

3.  In Caledonia, what is the custom fuel sampling schedule?

Brownsville

4.  What is the agency's response to the Enron letter regarding the 2nd
stormwater NOV?

5.  Has there been any further action by the agency since the 1st stormwater
NOV was never responded to?

6.  One memo stated that the stormwater is channeled to a wetland.  Was that
during construction only or is it ongoing?

7.  Were there any further problems with the B T Readymix concrete dumping
issue?

Thank-you!  I am very much aware that he is sensitive to people looking at 
this report. 
Ben

Amy:
Here are my answers  to your questions:
1.  Yes I think its a good idea, because you are able to reach a wide 
audience with this advertisement.  
2.  I don't think the contest should be limited to just these 
schools/conferences.  You probably should open it up to all schools to get an 
even wider reach of potential candidates.
3.  I would think that if you had a certain amount for the cash prize that 
people would take it seriously to try and win the cash.
4.  Please let me know if I can support you in any way.
Thanks

Dr. Ueng:
I wanted to mention this to you yesterday after the test, but didn't have 
time.  I was taking this course because I am applying to another business 
school and since I have been out of school for six years I wanted to provide 
the other schools with a recent academic record.  I was trying to get an A in 
the class, but my first test was not my best work. I feel that I did much 
better on the second test and that Brandon and mines case studies and my 
class participation were good enough to get me close to the A level.  That 
said if I am also able to get a recommendation from you I would greatly 
appreciate it.  I know that you are extremely busy now, so if I could get in 
touch with you at your earliest convenience that would be great.  Thanks for 
making the class educational and quite enjoyable.  Hope to talk to you soon 
and hope you can enjoy the rest of the summer.

Bill:
Here are the two CA's we are currently working off of.  The first one is 
Enron's latest draft and the second one is Cinergy's latest draft.  Enron 
usually does not get into stand-still agreements, but we decided to in this 
case.  We have been exchanging comments for two weeks and now we need to sit 
down and discuss these points from a commercial stand-point to get over these 
differences.  Please give me a call when you get this so we can go through 
these issues.  Thanks for your time with this issue.

Regards,
Ben 
713-853-7998

Enron's version  Cinergy's version

Here is a clean version of Cinergy's latest comments.  
Ben

Jerry:
Here is the latest "CA" with everyone's changes.  I feel that this is pretty 
close to the best we can offer in terms of the stand-still and 
non-solicitation agreements.  Enron usually does not get into stand-still 
agreements, so doing this one was a big step for Enron.  Look forward to 
talking to you tomorrow morning.  Thanks for your patience.  Again, this is a 
draft copy for discussions purposes only.
Regards,
Ben

I just talked to Mark Metts and he has officially signed off on the CA.  
Could you send me down a clean, draft version of CA4.  I will run this by

I am pretty sure I have a copy, but it is really old and out of date, but I 
will try and find it ASAP and send it on to you.  Thanks!
Ben

Dave:
I talked with the legal guys at Cinergy and after further discussions with 
Mike Cyrus, they felt that since these discussions were at a high level and 
very early in discussions that a "CA" at this time was not needed.  There 
were two sticking points that I was trying to get them to backdown from: 1) a 
stand-still agreement and 2) a solicitation agreement.  They were not willing 
to back down from these, thus they concluded with suggesting no "CA".  Let me 
know if this is your thoughts as well.  Thanks!
Ben

Hey Jon;
Just e-mailing to see how everyone is doing.  Megan and I are going over to 
Austin to a resort to celebrate our 1st anniversary - I can't believe it.  
I've been trying to work on the golf game, but I'm taking a couple of 
graduate business courses at night so that keeps me pretty busy on the 
weekends as well.  Hope all is well and I'll talk to you soon.
Go Sox!
Ben

Here are some of the points Cinergy will cover on Monday.  They are coming 
down with a team of 4 or 5 people -Mike Cyrus, Bill Greilis, Chuck Winger, 
Art Vivar and Brian Stall.  
Ben

Mike:
Just a thought regarding Kinder/Morgan.  These guys mainly care about the gas 
pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to 
increase throughput.  These plants that they want on their lines are 
currently in construction or development.  Their only operational plants are 
in Colorado.  They have a good generation team, but I fell that they do not 
want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as 
long as somebody wants to put them along their lines.  If you guys offered to 
buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and 
stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their 
projects to put on their lines.  Hope this helps.
Ben

A very good time was had by all.  I for one lost some shorts and a voice, but 
it was well worth it.
Thanks Miguel and everyone else.
Ben

Mike:

Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last week.  I left you Rich 
Kinder's number on Thursday with your assistant, Sheilla - hope you got it.  
Again, I think a deal between or three companies is something to really look 
at.  I think it creates a great story to the street.  Kinder/Morgan brings 
the growth story, the gas pipelines for the convergence play and the 
development team, Enron brings the MW's and trading and Cinergy brings MW's, 
trading and operating expertise.  I feel that Enron and Cinergy can work 
togther with regards to the trading.  I am sending you an anayst report I 
just finish reading regarding generation spinoffs - I think it will be 
helpful.   Also, Kay Chapman, Dave's assistant informed me that you were 
coming up next week, and I wanted to know if you wanted me to be there or not 
or if you wanted me to prepare anything for you for the meeting.  

Hope you had a good weekend and I look forward to talking to you soon.

Hey Jon,
Again Congratualations on your baby, that's great.  My sister just had her 
second two weeks ago.  Megan and I will be in DC the weekend after the 4th of 
July for a wedding, will you guys be their that weekend, if so it would be 
great to see you guys?  Hope all is going well and talk to you soon.
Ben

713-853-7998 - Work  

Megan will be at the wedding that weekend, but I will not be able to make 
it.  Megan is going to spend most of July up in New York.  How is the 
fundraising business going?  I heard that Clinton's fundraiser tonight will 
bring in $23 million which will be $2 Mil. more than George W., which would 
be pretty impressive.  
Ben

Yes, she had a boy - Will Rogers Morgan.  Are you going to be in the Hamptons 
for the July 4th holiday?  Megan and I will be up there for 4 or 5 days 
around then.  Talk to you soon.
Ben

Hey there, 
Have I got a potential job opportunity for you.  My neighbor at work since 
this business plan to me to see if knew anyone who would be interested in 
joining this company and believe it or NOT, I thought of you.  Give me a call 
when you go through this BP.  Keep this confidential.  How did you like those 
pics from Chobs of the girls on the beach.  Have you taken them home yet and 
done unspeakable things to them? See ya!

Here is the latest model.  It was only used for the project cost analysis and 
nothing else, so some are are not fully completed.  Let me know when you 
would like to talk about the deal or model.  Thanks
Ben

Great PICS.  When do you get back?  I want to see if we can get together up 
in NYC or DC with OB and Mike.  I will be in the Hamptons for July 4th 
weekend.  It's starting to get hot down here in Houston.  Things are going 
well.  I have moveed into a new group (Enron's M&A Group) - were looking at 
some interesting deals.  We are looking at taking a company public which I 
may go work for if I can get enough equity in the deal.  The other thing that 
might happen is finally going to my pops company at a much higher position 
than I am at now, which would be great, but I would be in Ohio, booooooo.  
That way Megan and I could buy a house and potential go and get an executive 
MBA from Kellog, but these are all scenarios and if any of these play out I 
would be amazed.  My golf game is ok, but my training is starting to get 
better.  I did see that none of us made the NYC Marathon on the first go 
around.  Did you see that Jon and Kati had their baby-I didn't even know she 
was pregnant.  Shit were getting old!!!!!!!!!!   Hope all is going well and 
I'll see ya.

I talked with Thomas Suffield and he wants Miguel Vasquez to run the numbers 
on the Florida model., since they have been running numbers on the Plano 
model for a little while now.  I walked Miguel through what I had done and 
how they should look at running the model, based on what Thomas found out and 
what you have said in the past.  I also gave them the numbers that the desk 
has given based on the simple cycle case (5 year number) and combine-cycle 
case (5 year number).  From this they have modeled and graphed these 
different scenarios.  I also worked on getting a bid and ask from the desk, 
but you may need to talk to Berney because they are not giving out the ask at 
this time.  
Hope this helps and please give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks

Question 1

Case 1 at 20F and 60% RH CTG would have net unit output of 46,726 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,183 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean
Case 2 at 90F and 54% RH CTG would have net unit output of 43,220 kW at a 
heat rate of 10,804 Btu/kWhr HHV new & clean

Case 1 has gas compression, no chilling/heating, Case 2 has gas compression 
and chilling. Both cases include simple cycle CTG aux and expected steup 
transformer losses. Back pressure is based on 14" HRSG.

Question 2

For case 2, Sprint water injection is 1915 lb/hr +/1 20%, we are also water 
injecting for NOx control 21,981 lb/hr so total is 23,896 lb/hr. Currently 
cannot Sprint with DLE combustor.

On the Wisconsin Public Service deal (WPS) please consider the following:

1.  One LM-6000 to be sited near Green Bay Wisconsin
2.  Will be configured in combined cycle mode with a HRSG
3.  100% of the output will go to an industrial customer of WPS

Key Questions

1.  What is the heat rate and Mw rating of our turbine at site conditions (20 
degrees winter and 90 degrees summer)

2.  What is the water consumption with Sprint verses water injection

3.  What is a 10 year fixed gas price at chicago starting 6/1/01 on a 
baseload volume of 10,000 mmbtu/d

Here is the other information on PJM.

Here is the latest PJM pricing from the bus point used for Don Black's

Hey:
Sorry about not getting back sooner - I have been traveling and was away for 
Thanksgiving.  Megan and I went up to Chicago to visit one of her 5 sisters.  
M&M's wedding was fun, saw some people I haven't seen since college - pretty 
scary.  If "W" wins this election Megan and I are coming to DC to watch the 
Inaugeration and maybe go to a ball or two, so we should diffinently get 
together.  I will work on that when the time comes.  Besides, this election 
is absolutely crazy - Gore he working himself into complete retirement with 
all this contesting.  How is everything going?  What are you guys doing for 
the holiday?  Megan and I are going out west to do some skiing in Beaver 
Creek - I'm praying for powder.  Again, I hope all is going well and I'll be 
better next time about getting back to you.  Good to hear from you!

Dave:
 I was talking with my brother-in-law who is Kinder/Morgan's VP of Corp 
Development and they would be interested in talking with us about 
contributing their 5,000 MW's of generation into a JV/Partnership to lead 
into a public offering.  We are still under several different CA's with them, 
due to our past conversation's regarding generation.  
 With our previous discussions, Rich Kinder had suggested to Kevin Hannon if 
Enron would be interested in buying the whole Orion  Project, but at that 
time ENA was only interested in the first couple of projects, due to the 
delivery of the turbines.  
 In light of our past discussions and KMI's desire to exit the generation 
business, this JV would give them the perfect "exit strategy".  Also, it 
would give us a better growth strategy, with respects to our talks with other 
parties.  I know that bringing in a potential third party would complicate 
the deal structure, but I think that it would build a much better growth 
story to Wall Street.
 If you think this would be a good idea, I can begin to set up a meeting as 
soon as possible with Kinder/Morgan.  Thanks!  
Ben
 

Hey, sorry its been a little while but I've been traveling and keeping some 
late hours on these generation projects.  With regards to UT, I am going to 
stay at Enron for another year.  I feel that the thing that hurt me from 
getting in the schools I wanted to get into were my undergraduate grades.  So 
I have decided to take a couple of graduate level finance courses this summer 
and re-apply next year.  Actually, I'll apply to Columbia this Sept to get 
into their January program, which goes for a year and half.  

So lets get together for lunch before you head off for B-school this summer.  
Talk to you soon.

This is a revised Plano we did late yesterday. It was adjusted from Lowell, 
Mass Nepco estimate and we changed format to more closely match  Homestead 
form.

Biggest differences 'tween original Plano and original Homestead were:

Homestead had dual fuel     +4M
Homestead had additional piling and foundation bulks  +1.8M
Homestead was connecting to a complicated t-line config +1.5M
Homestead had an FPL substation    +5M
Homestead did not need as much gas pipeline    -2.1M
Homestead used 6% margin     +4.4M
Homestead had lower capacity due to additional chilling  +1.5% (not capital 
cost but does change $/kW)

Differences from original Plano to new Plano is that Nepco has estimated a 
union job for Lowell. This impacts indirects upward by about $5M and 
construction up above my earlier guesstimate by about $4M. I had doubled the 
cost per manhour which Nepco also did but additionally they added manhours 
for productivity loss. Additionally I moved new Plano margin to 6%.

New Homestead went up due to raw water pretreatment and first stage RO but we 
dropped the substation cost so total estimated cost went down by a coupla of 
million.

Numbers still just should be used for screening, no commitment. 

These summaries should not be passed around.

Bruce

Here is the e-mail that Bruce just sent me.  Make sure that you do not use 
this for any binding agreements or client discussion purposes.  These are the 
numbers I have used in my model and here are the new Plano numbers.  If you 
have any questions please give me a call and I will walk you through the 
changes.  Thanks

Here is the Goldman Presentation

Basic summary for Teco:

Still working with Finance Group to come up with different finance structures.
Working with Insurance group (weather desk) to wear the risk of the project, 
since the Power desk will not wear that type of risk.
Pricing of the put, call and spread option values is still not finalized, 
because Kevin Presto has said that he does not put much value into these 
plants in Eastern PJM
Don Black is beginning to look at other companies for his price risk 
management product.  
He feels he will not be able to get a deal done with Teco at this point in

going out to Colorado this summer to play some great golf.  They have some 
fantastic courses.  Other than that - work is going really well and Enron 
stock and company culture is really getting noticed by Wall Street, which is 
great for future job opportunities.  I'm playing a lot of tennis, golf anf 
basketball as of late and its been quite fun.  Hope all is going well and

swing and base load levels very easily.  They are looking for a 3 year  term

My thoughts on the Central Iowa Power Cooperative RFP

Let me know what you think

1.  We will develop two GE 7 EA's.  Unit 1 operational 5/1/01.  Unit 2 
operational 5/1/02

2.  We will use the Ogden/Boone County Site being secured by John Moore.  The 
site is 1/4 mile from Northern Natural Gas Mainline.  Also, Ameren 345 Kv and 
Alliant 115Kv line onsite.  Assume interconnects to both of these systems.  
Please break out cost for each.

3.  Assume no fuel oil back-up

4.  Assume no black start

5.  Design the units to be later converted to combined cycle.

6.  Assume water injection for nox control.

7.  Assume portable de-min water facilities

8.  Assume Enron does EPC

9.  Assume CIPCO will finance and own the plant  through ther term of the PSA 
and thereafter

10.  Assume CIPCO will execute a power sales agreement (PSA) with Enron from 
5/1/01 through 10/31/07

worked in the past now sits next to me - Michelle Parks.  Give me a call.  
Hope all is well and lets talk about going up to the Vineyard the same time 
this summer.  See ya

Here is the VOM and Heat Rate for the Little Rock, Ark. site located in 
Entergy (Entergy Hub).  The site is on Entergy's 500 kV line and on NGPL's 
pipelines.  VOM and H.R's are the following:

VOM = $1.00 w/o major maintenance
There are four levels of running the configuration:
Full Output with Duck Firing: 542 MW's/ 8,842 Heat Rate
Full Output wothout Duck Firing: 422 MW's/7,907 Heat Rate
One GE 7EA: 105 MW's/8,251 Heat Rate
Warm running GE 7EA: 59 MW's/ 9,831 Heat Rate

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!

Dr. Harris:
 In my pursuit to strengthen my application profile for next year I have 
explored taking two graduate level night courses this summer and I wanted to 
know what courses the admissions committee would suggest that I take this 
summer.  I wanted to make sure that I was taking the courses that were most 
appropriate with regards to my application. Just to let you know, I was 
planning on taking two finance courses.  Thanks in advance for your 
suggestion with this matter.  
 I was in Austin yesterday for the completion of the MS 150 Bike ride, but 
was not able to stick around.  Hope all is going well and hope to hear from 
you soon.  

Regards,
Ben Rogers

Here is the latest model.  Per the document I sent you, the new deal 
structure is not in there yet.  I will be in on Sunday to finish it up.  If 
you have any questions please leave me a message on my voice mail.  Thanks
Ben

Do you actually have the Henwood report.  It looks like you sent me the RW 
Beck report or a letter pertaining to the Henwood report, but not the actual 
Henwood report that I was looking at in the meeting.  Thanks!
Ben

Here is a brief list of the projects I have worked on in the first quarter of 
this year.  Just to let you know, I am technically in Mike MIller's IPP 
origination group.  I moved over to this group last week.  I am still going 
perform the same function as I did in CTG, but now from the IPP group.  
Thanks!
Ben

Here is the model we were just looking at.. Again, it will be changing!  
Thanks
Ben

I have a meeting with Thomas Suffield and Rich Park at 5:00pm and I will get 
to it right after that.  Thanks!
Ben

The Teco meeting will be held Monday at 2:00 pm in room 3125.  If you have 
any questions please give me a call.  The main issue will be the current 
assumptions in the models and the output prices from those models.  Thanks!

Here is the list of questions Yvan sent to Chris Smith and his responses.=
=20
Ben

YVAN CHAXEL@ENRON
03/21/2000 11:01 AM
Chris,

Hopefully the following points should answer your questions. Feel free to=
=20
call me (34292) if you still have any question.

Yvan

1_  We will value Teco as a series of hourly Spread options.=20
Legitimate points of concern:=20
a) Are we valuing an index deal or a physical deal?
  b) If it is a physical deal can the plant realistically react on an hourl=
y=20
basis?

Answer: The deal Enron enters into is based on an spread between PJM index=
=20
and the appropriate OIL curve (New York Harbor + basis). However, the trigg=
er=20
for the default of the contract (which is really what we are concerned with=
)=20
is a function of the plant cash flows compared to the debt level. The plant=
=20
cash flows depend on the physical operations of the plant and its capacity =
to=20
dispatch during the most expensive hours of the year. Therefore the questio=
n=20
of whether the plant can or cannot ramp up quickly enough to dispatch=20
economically is very pertinent to our valuation.=20
I would argue that the plant will always (or almost always) be able to=20
dispatch economically for the following 2 reasons. In the first place, its=
=20
operational ramp up time is only 10 minutes. Secondly, the scalar curve we=
=20
use is fairly well behaved and doesn=01,t swing around a mean position (see=
=20
graph below), hence allowing sufficient preparation for the dispatchers. Th=
e=20
chances of dispatchers being caught by surprise when prices spike up or dow=
n=20
should therefore be relatively small, and the plant should be able to follo=
w=20
the real time prices pretty well.

2_ The power curve we use is PJM west. Even though the plant is located in=
=20
the south east end of PJM (i.e. the del Marva peninsula), we prefer not to=
=20
use the east curve which is too thinly traded to be meaningful.=20

4_ So far we have only used monthly vol for power. Should we start using=20
daily vol as well, then the blending formula would be:
'fvol =3D Sqr((dblMvol * dblMvol * (jDate - jToday) + dblDvol * dblDvol * 1=
5) /=20
(jDate - jToday + 15))

with  jDate the first of the considered month of dispatch
 dblMvol the monthly vol
 dblDvol the daily vol

6_ We are assuming 50% flat correlation for 20 years (a much more=20
conservative assumption than 15%). However we run sensitivities where the=
=20
correlation goes from 30% to 70%.

7_ Yes, we are deducting all operative expenses from the valuation.=20
Origination is currently trying to reconcile the differences in operations=
=20
expenses between their numbers and those used by credits.

8_ The valuation model (coded by Alex Huang, Research) is based on a=20
bidimensional tree, and therefore doesn=01,t use the SPRDOPT function. Howe=
ver,=20
we checked that the SPRDOPT function from the structuring model and the tre=
e=20
based model yielded the same values for the spread option.

9_ The strike for the spread option is the sum of the OIL price + the VOM.

Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see=20
associated with the heat rate spread option.  I want to make sure that I=20
understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this val=
ue=20
would be booked.  As such, please provide the following detail:

Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of=
=20
daily call options?
What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?
Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to=
=20
value the deal?
What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities=
=20
or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me=
=20
what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th=
=20
of the relevant month, and for daily options?
What correlation are you assuming, 15% flat for twenty years?
Are you deducting all operating expenses from the value of the option?
Are you using the "SPRDOPT" Exotic Options function to value the option?
Are you using the $/MWh VOM dollar amount as your strike?
Has Don provided the fixed payment stream?  This stream should be covering=
=20
both P&I and not just principal.

Yvan, and Ben, please provide answers to these question via written=20
correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding. =
=20
Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far.  Furthermore, I=
=20
would like to reiterate that RAC's goal, prior to quoting any credit reserv=
e,=20
is to be 100% confident that: (i) the methodology that is being employed is=
=20
consistent among the internal groups; and (ii) the inherent value of the=20
price risk management contracts matches.  This enables RAC to manage the=20
associated risk during the life of the transaction both effectively and=20
appropriately.

Christopher

 The meeting Don and I had with Kinder/Morgan to discuss his Price Risk 
Management Product went really well.  We met with Park Schaper (CFO), Anthony 
Lannie (President of Power Group) and Jay Hopper (VP and General Manager) was 
on the phone from Denver.  They were very interested with regards to 
potentially replacing long term tolling agreements with this product.  Enron 
could provide a five year toll and the product would begin in the sixth year 
through year 15 or 20.  
 We talked very little about their existing projects; Little Rock and 
Michigan.  They do have all the permits for the Little Rock site and are 
moving forward with the Michigan site and still do not have any tolling 
agreements in place for those projects. 
 The ball is currently in their court and were going to get back with Scot 
with respects to the projects and with Tom on the PRM Product.  Please let me 
know if you have any questions with this matter.  Thanks!

I talked to Tom Swank this morning on UAE and he feels that we need to have 
Nepco still send out their best EPC number to UAE.  Tom said he can buy some 
time from UAE, so that Nepco can send out the number the middle of next 
week.  I talked to Bruce this morning and he was having Nepco continue to put 
information together on UAE.  Thanks!

First of all, I am going to run the NYC Marathon and kick both of your 
asses.  Lets put a little wager on this.  I headed to the Final Four this 
weekend and for a little opening day at Cinergy Field to see Ken G. knock 
some homers.  A lot is going on with work and I'm also trying to figure out 
about grad school.  I potentially have an offer to go work at an investment 
bank in NYC (Merrill and CSFB)  Need to figure this out soon.  Those pictures 
looked great from Bahrain and those other places.  Hope all is going well and 
keep in touch.  See ya
Ben

Here is the latest Kinder-Morgan update from Scott.  As you know, these guys 
have alot of generation and are under pressure to get several projects done 
soon.  I also think that your price risk management structure would be a good 
product for them.
Ben

I spoke to Jay Hopper again at KN.  Here are the results of my conversation:

1.  Entergy Project--I told Jay that our immediate interest would be to 
purchase the Jackson project with the outside tolling bid in place.  Given 
their immediate focus is to finalize the tolling agreement for the project, 
he suggested that we revisit this topic in 3 months.  He sounded a bit 
nervous.  Perhaps there is an opportunity to swoop in later.

2.  ECAR Projects--Because these projects are 4th and 5th in their cue, he 
would like to discuss our involvement at a later date.

3.  7FA versus 7EA turbines--It turbines out that KN's Illinois turbines are 
7EAs (six of them).  I told him that we would still be interested in making a 
joint venture proposal for the turbines to them.  He is going to have Chuck 
Walker from his Chicago office call me. 

Here are the Regional Heat Rates that should help you with the structuring

First of all you may be skinny, but your a skinny geek - oh does that sound?  
I am sending in my application in this week.  Regarding grad school, I have 
gotten a couple of no's, but haven't heard from all the school's, but I am 
considering a position with an investment bank in NYC in their global power 
M&A Group.  Good money but I would put off grad school a couple of years and 
by that time who knows, maybe night school at that time.  I am training for 
the MS 150, which is th 170 mile bike race to Austin.  And you call me 
fatty!!  I'm heading the the Final Four next week - I ended up getting Mike 
Gioffre's Dad a couple of tickets, so he will in Indy.  OB and I went out to 
dinner in NYC when I was up their last week.  We went to a really expensive 
sushi place - it was awesome.  He seams to be doing well - he is considering 
going to a dot.com.  Gotta go!  I'll talk to you soon.

Mike:
My Dad has the tickets and is going to keep them with him.  He doesn't want 
them to get lost in the mail.  We are staying in Cincinatti and are driving 
over Sat and Monday for the games.  The best thing to do is meet at a certain 
gate # or the "will call window".  I will call your Dad next week and set 
things up on a meeting place before the game.  Leave me your Dad's home 
number so I can call him next week.  These guys are going to have a great 
time that weekend.  Talk to you soon.

Dr. Harris:
 I would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review 
my application. Though I am disappointed with the results I am still 
determined to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of Business next year.  I 
understand how competitive the process has become, but I felt that with my 
work experiences, recommendations, personality, extracurricular activities, 
etc. that this would compensate for my disability.  After talking with 
Professors Titman, Ronn, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that the School was 
the right place to get the education I was looking for.  
  I am still certain that the School is the best place for getting a great 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do 
whatever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three 
graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and 
Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions committee that I can compete at the 
graduate level. I also plan on retaking the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, 
this will be a monumental task; but I am determined to prove to the Committee 
that I can be successful at The TEXAS Graduate School of Business.  I would 
like to come down to Austin this spring to meet with you to further discuss 
my application file and to personally meet you.   
  If you think of anything else I can do to strengthen my overall application 
file for next year, please let me know.  Take care and hope to hear from you 
soon.

Sincerely,

Ben Rogers
  

Professor Ronn: 
 I would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the MBA 
Program.  In the end, the results were not favorable.  I understand that it 
is a competitive process, but I felt that with my work experiences, 
recommendations, extracurricular activities, etc., that this would help my 
chances and possibly compensate for my disability.  After talking with you 
and Professors Titman, Brown and Jemison, I was sure that UT was the right 
place to continue learning about energy-finance.  
  I am still sure that UT is the place for getting an excellent 
graduate-level education, so I want you to know that I am going to do 
whatever it takes to get in next year.  I plan on taking two or three 
graduate level finance courses at the University of Houston this Summer and 
Fall to demonstrate to the Admissions office that I can compete at this 
level. I also plan on trying to retake the GMAT test.  Due to my disability, 
this will be a monumental task, but I am determined to prove to the 
Admissions commitee that I can excel with the work at The Texas University 
Graduate School of Business.  
 Thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.  It has been a 
pleasure meeting you and I hope we can continue to talk about energy and 
finance in the future.  Also, if you can think of anything else I can do to 
strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know.  
Take care and hope to hear from you soon.

Please send me an excel spreadsheet which depicts the value that you see 
associated with the heat rate spread option.  I want to make sure that I 
understand exactly how you propose valuing the transaction and how this value 
would be booked.  As such, please provide the following detail:

Will we be valuing/booking a series of monthly call options or a series of

What power curve are we valuing the deal against - PJM East or West Hub?
Please send me the current fuel curve that you are converting to $/MWh to

What volatilities are you using to value the options - monthly volatilities 
or intra-day volatilities or a blend of the two (if blending please show me 
what formula you using to blend the two vols)?
What expiration date are you using, i.e.: for monthly call options the 15th

Yvan, and Ben, please provide answers to these question via written 
correspondence so that their is limited probability of misunderstanding.  
Thank you both very much for your time and help thus far.  Furthermore, I 
would like to reiterate that RAC's goal, prior to quoting any credit reserve, 
is to be 100% confident that: (i) the methodology that is being employed is

Hey!  How was DC?  Did JV get to meet the woman of his dreams?  Megan went to 
NYC for the week - its her spring break.  I am finding out whether I can send 
your parents the tickets early or if we will meet them at the "will call 
window" at the RCA Dome.  These are box seats so I don't know if we can get 
them earlier or not.  Looks like it going to be a very interesting Final 
Four.  See ya!

Since I am a eternal optimist, I always feel I can strengthen my skills in 
most everything I do, but under these circumstances with the GMAT (timed 
exam) combined with my disability, I feel this is my best representation for 
this exam.  Also, I know that you would not what me to take the exam just to 
retake it, but due to my strong desire to attend The TEXAS Graduate School of 
Business, I would try to provide any additional information you needed to 
help strengthen my overall application file.  Again, thanks for the fast 
response to my e-mail.  Hope to hear from you soon!

Sorry for the delay, I have been traveling with work and I just got back an 
hour ago.  I can try and retake the GMAT exam if this will help my overall 
application file.  I must say, due to my disability, I don't think my score 
would improve dramatically.  I can also send you a summary (or the whole 
report) on my disability from the professional examiner to further explain my 
disability.  I can also provide addition recommendations from my colleagues I 
work with to further demonstrate my achievements at work.  If you could let 
me know what information would help best  explain my disability, I would 
appreciate it.  Thanks again for your e-mail and sorry for the delay.  
Ben 

I have been out of the office until now, so I will talk to you later today 
about the model.  Thanks
Ben

Sorry for the late reply, I was in NYC and Boston on one of my deals.  The 
two companies I talked about was Relient and Entergy.  Relient ended up 
buying 19 LM 6000 turbines and Entergy ended up buying 28 LM 6000 turbines.  
They both plan to put them into customer deals, just as we are doing - so 
there is a little competition.  The delivery dates are a little further out 
than ours but they all are probably delivered by 2003.  Hope this helps. Talk 
to you soon.
Ben

I will be back Wednesday night.  Please leave me a message if you need 
anything. Hope your presentation goes well!
Ben

I just wanted to let you know that I sent this letter to Dr. Harris addresses 
his concerns and stating my commitment to succeeding at The Texas Graduate 
School of Business.  I hope I have done what it takes to prove that I can 
succeed at the School.  Thanks again for your help and interest. 

Sincerely,
Ben

Just wanted to let you know that I joined the ECC and so I get their 
messages  know.  Thanks for keeping me in the loop.

Just to give you an update, I reeived an e-mail from Dr. Carl Harris, who is 
currently in charge of my application in the admission's office.  He wants me 
to answer a few questions to make sure I can handle the coursework.  That is 
why I wanted to meet with you and Professors' Titman and Brown, to discuss 
the coursework and to talk to you about my strengths and weaknesses.  I know 
that with my financial modeling and accounting skills, energy-finance 
background, and the Business' School's team-oriented approach to learning, 
that I will excel in this type of learning environment.  I hope things work 
out and thanks again for your help.

Ben:  Because of the short time frame I am just forwarding the questions from 
our broker (representing the surety) concerning your request for bid bond.   
Very valid questions and also will impact your performance bond should you 
win and need one.  Please try and get back to me asap as this is a very short 
time frame for the bond.  Thanks.
Teddy-We are preparing the bid bond based on the request received yesterday 
evening.  The bid specifications indicate liquidated damages in the amount of 
$2,375,000 PER DAY.  I assume Enron will not accept damages at this level.  
Please check to determine if the bid will be qualified in this area-and what 
alternative damages may be offered.  Due to the unusual size of the penalty 
relative to the contract value, this could have an impact on reinsurance.

The contract indicates a normal one year warrenty from the contractor.  The 
charge for this warrenty is included in our standard performance bond rate.  
I have bonded a number of generator contracts similar to this, and frequently 
there is an option for the contractor to offer an extended warrenty up to 5 
years.  Since this would impact the premium charged, you may want to check to 
see if this option exist so we can get the pricing correct in your estimate.

Thanks.

Meg:
I would like to make sure that I have fully explained the reason for my GMAT 
score.  If the admissions office needs me to provide documentation on this 
disability I can do that.  Due to this disability, the GMAT score is not a 
good indicator of how I will do at UT.  Through what I have learned in my 
work experiences with State Street Bank and Enron, I know that I will be able 
to successfully do the work that UT requires.  If you could let me know what 
I can do to further explain my GMAT score I would greatly appreciate it.  If 
you think it would be better to talk to Dr. Harris-I will do that.  Thanks 
again for taking the time to help me with this issue.  
Ben

Professor Titman:
Thank you for talking with the people in the admissions office.  I wanted to 
ask you what you think I could do at this point to help the admission's 
people understand the reason for my GMAT score.  I know that this is a poor 
reflection of what I can actually achieve and I know that I will do well and 
be successful in the learning environment at UT.  If I need to, I can provide 
the admissions office the documents stating the disability.  If you can let 
me know what you think I can do, I would appreciate it.  Thanks agin!
Ben

Here is the latest model.  Let me know if you have any comments.  Then we

I will still kick your ass anyday of the week - dirtbag!  I have done three

would be hearing from them this week.  I hope things work out and I can be 
contributing to and learning from the program next year.  Thanks again for 
all your help.  Hope to hear from you soon.

DO YOU THINK HE WOULD??
Ever since I saw Al Gore give that uncharacteristically statesman-like speech 
defending the integrity of the Electoral College system under the 
Constitution of the United States, I've been scratching my head trying to 
figure it out. 

Who was this guy? Was this the same Al Gore who has demonstrated -- time and 
time again -- so little respect for the Constitution during the last eight 
years? Why was he giving up on the idea of a challenge to the Electoral 
College, when it seemed many in his camp were banking on that as their last 
line of defense? 

Well, I think I have figured it out. Actually, there are two possibilities. 

The first thought that came to me was that this was Al Gore's 
"Don't-watch-the-man-behind-the-curtain speech." While he was extolling the 
virtues of the Constitution, his minions in Florida -- from Bill Daley to 
Jesse Jackson -- were busy subverting it by any means necessary. It was Al 
Gore's way of establishing public plausible deniability. He stood above the 
fray, while his cohorts did the dirty work. 

But, more recently, another thought has occurred to me -- a darker, more 
sinister thought. I hope I am wrong. I pray that, this time, I am 
overestimating the deviousness of Al Gore. But that, of course, is always a 
difficult task. 

Think, for a moment, why Al Gore would suddenly be reading and citing the 
Constitution. 

The answer is that, in this instance, it gives him all the power. What do I 
mean? 

Who is it, under the Constitution, that is specifically charged with 
certifying the Electoral College votes of each state? You guessed it. The 
president of the U.S. Senate, which also happens to be the vice president of 
the United States. That's right. The day those Electoral College votes go to 
the Senate to be counted and certified to choose the next president of these 
United States, Al Gore will be holding all the cards. 

"Oh, Farah," you say, "you don't think Al Gore would tamper with the results 
in any way with the whole world watching, do you?" 

Well, let's think about what has been happening in Florida for the last 
several days. Al Gore's campaign managers have been whipping up hysteria 
stating that the will of the people in that state is being subverted. 

They are filing lawsuits. They are organizing marches. They are all but 
accusing the Bush campaign of voter fraud. 

Listen to what Bill Daley has to say: "More than 100 million Americans voted 
on Tuesday and more voted for Al Gore than George Bush. Here in Florida it 
also seems very likely that more voters went to the polls believing that they 
were voting for Al Gore than for George Bush. If the will of the people is to 
prevail Al Gore should be awarded a victory in Florida, and be our next 
president of the United States." 

They've decided that no matter what the actual vote count shows, Gore wins. 

Now, all Gore has to do on that fateful day in the U.S. Senate is reject for 
certification the Electoral College votes of Florida, and he wins the 
majority and becomes president. Sorry, Bush fans. I don't think there's a 
thing you can do about it other than protest, complain and stomp your feet. 
Better start planning your legal strategy now. I'll bet Al Gore's transition 
team is already hard at work. Barbra Streisand is probably making plans to 
sing at the Inauguration. Alec Baldwin is unpacking his bags. This could be a 
fait accompli. I guarantee you a counter to this bold move is not in the Bush 
campaign's playbook. 

The Gore campaign, still working overtime, has laid the groundwork for the 
challenge. The Florida vote is tainted, they say. It's too close to call. Too 
many irregularities. The vote can simply be dismissed by the constitutional 
authority -- Vice President Al Gore. 

Would you put it past him? I sure wouldn't.

Things are going well here in the States.  Work is very busy right now and i 
am actually training to  do the MS 150 Bike race.  It a race from Houston to 
Austin.  It's a 170 mile, two day ride with about 5,000 bikers.  It's on 
April 16th and 17th.  I rode this weekend only 40 miles.  Yes I am going todo 
the NYC Marathon and for you virgins, I will kick your fat asses.  Darnit, I 
wanted a pet Camel for our apartment.  Yes I got your message last week - I 
had just stepped away from my desk and just missed you.  When do you get 
back?  Sometime in the Summer.  By the summer I hope to be in the 185 range, 
currently I'm right at 200!!!  Not very good.  I have been talking with Mike 
Gioffre lately and were trying to get people together this spring or summer.  
I'll let you know when.  Gotta go, but I'll talk to you soon.

Nepco, the scope document on Wednesday.  Nepco will take till the following 
Monday to turn the doc. around.  I told him we need it sooner than that, but 
he seems to think that is the standard time of return.  We need to find out 
from Reed more information regardin the configuration, noise, water, etc.  We 
will meet with Bruce on Wednesday.  We also may want to think about going up 
there with an Engineer to visit the site.  We can talk more on Monday.

Talk to you soon.  Work number is (713) 853-7998.
Ben

Here is the new presentation.  Thanks
Ben

Here is a presentation I need by 12:00 this morning.  I need 1 set of 
transparencies and 40 color copies, where these copies are stapled and 
three-holed punched at the top.  If graphics can "clean it" up a little bit 
that would be great..  I am trying to finish one more slide in this 
presentation but please go forward with this due to time constraints.  Please 
give me a call if you have any questions. Thanks
Ben

Meeting with Carl Livermore from structuring on Monday afternoon at 1:00 down 
on 29 at Carl's desk.  We will be discussing the synthetic CC structure.

Ben
3-7998

It would be a trading/marketing power position.  My goal is to understand 
power markets in detail and this would be a way to do just that.  My # is 
713-853-7998.

I will have property taxes for Gleason tomorrow and I will be talking with 
Jody Pierce regarding the Fixed Operating #'s and cost numbers as well.  When 
I talked with Kevin Presto he thought that trying to use the 99 actual 
numbers and then escalting them was NOT a good idea, due to the fact that 
these are not "normal" operating assumptions.  Please give me a call if you 
have any questions.
Ben

Here you go!  Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks
Ben

Use Tenn. Zone 6 for the Gas Curve and NOT Transco Zone 6.
Thanks
Ben

Here are the assumptions you will need:

VOM:  $2.23
H.R.:  10,400
Cost/Start: $257.00
Power Curve: Nepool
Start Date: 6/1/01
Gas Curve: Transco Zone 6

Need:
4 and 5 year capacity numbers ($/kW-mo.) on a yearly basis

Give me a call if you need any more information. Thanks
Ben

Hey - Any luck with the Mid-Columbia last summer prices.  Thanks
Ben

Don Black said a good time ti meet this afternoon is 4:00pm.  I have a 2:00pm 
and I will call Claire in structuring to meet with her as well.  Give me a 
call if you have any questions. Thanks! Ben

Good Afternoon!  If your able to get a total of 4 tickets to the game that 
would be great.  Thanks for your help with this matter.
Ben

Wanted to see how the meeting with Don Black went regarding the "retail 
shorts" on Friday.  Lets catch up on the other deals. Thanks
Ben

 Thanks for the informative infomation session this past Friday.  Also, thank 
you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my application 
and talking to Dr. Harris for me.  After meeting with many of the faculty and 
staff (Professors Brown, Titman, Jemison & Ronn) at the School, my desire to 
attend the School is quite strong.  The School is a perfect fit for the 
career I am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where I would be 
able to contribute to and learn from the energy-finance program due to my 
experiences with Enron.  Eventhough I have tested poorly on tests such as the 
GMAT, I feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that I have 
proven that I can successfully compete in a competitive environment (ie. 
Enron).  I excel in environments (team-oriented) such as described by the 
many people I talked with at the Texas B-School.  
 Again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and 
it was good to see someone from Boston, who lived in DC and was now living in 
Texas, such as myself.  

Regards,

Ben Rogers

It was good to see a fellow Yankee down in these here parts.  I got some 
really good feedback from all the people I talked with.  I think that UT 
would be a good fit for what I'm trying to do afterwards - with there 
energy-finance concentration and investment fund.  Plus it would be fun 
living in Austin for a couple of years.  When your in Houston next time wh 
can grab some drinks and go to dinner.  Talk to you soon.
Ben

I talked to Mary Lou on Thursday afternoon and she said that we were all set 
with tickets (6) in the box seats.  Does this sound correct?  Thanks for your 
help in getting these tickets.  Hope you had a good weekend.
Ben

I will let you know by tomorrow what the exact times of the games begin on 
Saturday so when can fly in on Sat.  We ended up working around the apartment 
and getting things in order.  Pretty boring but nice.  I ran this morning and 
played outdoor b-ball, it was really nice outside.  Hope we can get together 
soon b/c it was good to see you and Susan for dinner last week.  Talk to you 
this week.
Ben

Here is the most recent copy of the presentations.  Don - please call Jinsung 
if you need any changes.  I will be in on Monday, so leave me a message if 
you need something for the beginning of next week.  Thanks
Ben

Here is the Calpine model.  We are still missing the VOM.  Leave me a message 
if there needs to be work done over the weekend or on Monday.  Thanks
Ben

Here is the Teco model from the client.  I will also send you the Teco 
presentation I was working on for Don Black.  He might call you tomorrow to 
work on it a little bit.
Ben

John wanted me to send it to you.  We are going to ask Jinsung what the 
differences are once he gets out of this meeting.  Thanks
Ben

Here is a copy of the flow of funds for the Teco Project.  Please give Don 
Black a call if you have any questions.  Thanks

Professor Ronn:
Thank you for your reply.  I have a meeting at 9:00 am, but I am free from 
10:00 am to 1:00 am.  If you could let me know what the best time for me to 
stop by your office I would appreciate it.  I look forward to meeting you 
tomorrow.  

Ben Rogers

Here is the Calpine model.  Give me a call if you have any questions.  Have 
not gotten the power curve or the VOM.  Thanks
Ben

If you could also let me know if you can get 4 tickets at the Cinergy Field 
box for opening day on Monday the 3rd.  The game is at 1:00pm on Sunday! 
Thanks!
Ben

I am finally getting some responses on the Final Four tickets.  I will know 
by next week the final numbers.  As of now it looks very optimistic.  I am 
trying to get two tickets for you and your Dad.  I think my dad and I are 
going and a buddy of mine and his dad.  It will be a lot of fun.  Let me know 
where you guys will be flying into and where you might stay.  See ya
Ben

I actually just talked to Mary Lou this morning, because my dad e-mailed me 
this morning to get 6 tickets for the Final Four for both Saturday and Sunday 
(April 1st and 3rd).  Thanks for the e-mail. 
Ben

Here is the form that needs to given to Scot Chambers once CTG fills it out 
with the originator.
Ben

Let me know what UAE says about the water source and how it will effect the 
new facility, so we can finalize the O&M numbers. Thanks

We can respond outside of the formal RFP if we get something to them soon.  
They want to see if we have anything to offer.  In the meantime, they will go 
forward with their RFP.

Do not factor in any cost for the gas pipeline.  The local distribution 
company will absorbe the cost and go at risk for new incremental load.

The cost to go through the LDC is 15 cents/mmbtu on a variable or usage 
basis.  10 cents for transport and 5 cents for service fee.  Peoples gas 
aggregates gas purchases for a number of customers in the region and 
purchases gas month to month.  RPU pays a fixed gas price that changes month 
to month.

We would need to add 15 cents/mmbtu to gas price from our curves.

Substation work should be approximately $5.8MM and no higher than $6mm.

As a point of reference, RPU's estimate for a fully installed LM-2500 is 
$17MM.  They break this out to $11.8MM for turbine and generator, $1.2 MM 
engineering cost, $400k winter package and $3.6MM other stuff.

RPU will have a gas pressure guarantee of 300# so we need to have a 
calculation done on the cost of compression to step up from 300 to 600.  My 
guess is that it will be around $1mm.

I would like to have something to Rochester by mid next week.  We can use the 
routine 2 page proposal format.

I sent over to Scot Chambers a one page summary of Rochester and the one page 
project eval form that always needs to be filled out before getting O&M 
numbers to Scot.  He knows that we need the numbers by Wednesday afternoon.  
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks
Ben

Here is the summary of the Rochester deal.  Oscar, Russ and I would like to 
sit down with you tomorrow to discuss the specifics of the deal. Please let 
me know if you need anymore info than this and let me know what time is best 
for you.  Thanks in advance for your time.

I thought I sent this earlier, but there are some problems with the system so 
here it is again.  This is the deal sheet for the week of Monday Feb. 14th.  
I will go through it with Ben and show him how to track the deals and update 
the deal sheet on a weekly basis.  If you have any questions, please give me 
a call.
Ben

Thanks for the reply!  I will be driving to Austin Friday morning and 9:00 am 
looks like a good time to meet.  My afternoon (1:00-5:00) is full with a 
information session, meeting with other Professors (Titman, Ronn and Jemison) 
and an Admissions interview.  I would appreciate it if you could send me your 
office location, so I can meet you at 9:00am on Friday.  Thanks again for 
taking the time to meet with me.  Look forward to meeting you.

Ben Rogers

Jeff Donahue heads up the Corp. Development group for ENA, which Don Miller 
and I work in.  Jeff is Don's supervisor and Don is mine.  I have been with 
this group since around May.  Thanks for the quick action with this.

Ben

Sorry about getting to go through this with you.  We can do this on Monday.  
Have a good weekend.
Ben

I am going to get a GTD directory set up on the Odrive so that we can access 
this from there.
I detached this sheet from the workbook that also has the contact infromation 
in it.
Please send me the names of any new people that you add so that I can update 
it for Monday
and send this back so that I can keep them together.
Thanks Tina

Hey, I talked with Paul Burkhart and he told me the woman at UT B-School is 
Margaret Dutton, so if your still able to send an e-mail to her in support of 
my application I would appreciate it.  Thanks again!  

Ben

Mr. Titman:
I have not heard back from Professor Ronn, so I am not sure as of now whether 
or not I can meet with him.  I will give him another call today to see if he 
is available.  Thanks
Ben

Here is the my deal summaries for the weekly deal sheet.  Thanks
Ben

Thanks for the fast reply.  I changed it online, but I wanted to make sure I 
wasn't booked for two different times.  Also, are you able to tell me who I 
will be meeting with?  I am meeting with a couple professors before my 
Admissions Visit and just wanted to know who I was going to meet with from 
your office.  Thanks!
Ben

Meeting will be at 10:30 in 3125!  See you there.
Ben

Sounds Good!  Thanks for the e-mail!

Are you able to meet with Tom and I on a different project, which includes LM 
6000's.  I have begun the modeling and we wanted to run through the numbers 
of this facility with you.  Please let me know what is a good time for you to 
meet with us.  Thanks
Ben

Mike:
Just wanted to let you know how everything went with the Marathon if you 
haven't heard already.  My time was a little slower (4:27: 53), but I 
finished and my goal of not walking was kept.  I now want you to focus in on 
is the MS150 in April.  We are both doing it and yes, I will give you your 
bike back to do it.  I think this would be something really fun to train for 
and to participate in.  Talk to you soon.
Ben

Mr. Titman:
Thanks for your fast reply.  Regarding Friday the 18th, I currently have a 
1:00 pm information session and a meeting with someone in the Admissions 
Office at 3:00 pm.  How does the morning work for you?  I look forward to 
meeting with you.  Thanks again!

Ben

Do you have time to meet with Tom Swank and me on another project, which 
includes four LM 6000's.  I have begun the modeling, thus we wanted to run 
through with you the configuration of this facility, since its going to be a 
"brownfield".  Talk to you soon.  Thanks
Ben

Mr.Jemison:
Thanks for the fast reply.  That time sounds great.  I have an information 
session at 1:00 pm and a meeting with someone in the Admissions office at 
3:00 pm, so that works out perfectly.  I'm really looking forward to coming 
to Austin to visit the school and to visit with you.  See you on Friday the 
18th at 2:30 pm.  

Ben

We only need +/- 25% operating expenses for now.  Thanks, Ben

Could you please send Scot Chambers the project costs on USEC.  Thanks
Ben

Bruce did give us project cost numbers and I will have him e-mail them to 
you.  Also, you and I already went through the project eval. form on USEC.  
Tom and I were trying to get numbers by Wednesday, but give me a call once 
you get the project cost numbers.  Thanks for your help with this project.
Ben

Tom Swank, the originator and I sat down with Bruce Golden and went through 
the porject cost numbers for the GE 7FA combined cycle facility.  At this 
point we need to claculate FOM and VOM and other operating expenses.  We feel 
pretty good about the project cost numbers.  Let me know if you need more 
info than I have already given you.  Bruce Golden has the soft copy of the 
project cost numbers.  Thanks
Ben

I checked with Bernie and there are no reserves left in any of the accounts.  
Edith Cross who worked on the Welded Tube Reg. Risk Account and who sits next 
to Bernie helped verify that there were no reserves left.  
Ben

This is what Scot Chambers has sent me so far.

Scot Chambers@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

Ben, I have a reference document called Gas Turbine World Handbook in which I 
look up these type of answers as well for ballpark info. They are the 
"preliminary answer" to your question and should be treated as so. Please 
keep in mind that these are numbers from a magazine, not from our internal 
Performance/Cycles group under Gary Bush (within EECC). They are the dept 
that the Dev Engineer typically consults with to arrive at a project's 
capacity and efficiency, both from a new & clean standpoint and an average 
degradation standpoint. The depts within EECC/NEPCO also come up with the 
total installed costs. It is their numbers that are the ones that we 
typically bid in a proforma, as such, they are a part of the deal approval 
process (DASH). Their buy in is important because in addition to the numbers 
that OEM's provide us, they factor in experience, judgement, unique project 
characteristics, design basis, intake/exhaust losses, etc. They also look at 
the net power for the Plant, not just the equipment itself. Having caveat'ed 
these numbers, I would respond to your questions below as follows:

1. PG7241FA Capacity: 171,700 kW each @ generator terminals (ISO conditions, 
gas fired @ baseload) -- does not include auxiliaries usage, duct losses
2. 1,060 MW Net Plant @ ISO, gas fired
3. 6,040 Btu/kWh LHV @ ISO, gas fired
4. Plug figure for GTG may be $32,500,000 each. No idea on the ST, swag at 
$175/kW. Power island turnkey for 2x1 may be $375/kW (does not include alot 
of stuff such as add'l options, development costs, tie-ins, permitting, 
spares, etc, etc, etc)

Hope this is useful to you somehow, but please go to the source (described 
above) for anything that we are going to hang our hat on.

With regards to our conversation yesterday, I am loking for basic economics 
regarding GE 7FA's.  Such as, 1. output per turbine; 2. output for 4 7FA and 
2 steam turbines; 3.  Heat Rates; and 4. cost per turbine and steam turbine.  
Total plant output will need to be 1000 MW's and will be run as a combined 
cycle facility.  If you could get me these numbers by the end of the day or 
call me to discuss what you currently have that would be great.  This project 
is not due till Wednesday.  Thanks

Back when, Susan transfered all the files to me and we went through the 
entire reg.risk process.  For the year I was in ISG, I never had to adjust 
the reg.risk book.  I did not hand over the files to anyone else because the 
group was breaking up and figured it was better that I keep them. I was in 
yesterday going through all my files and the boxes under my desk and did not 
come up  with them.  In rotating down to East Orig. I lost a box of stuff, 
but I didn't think it had those files in it, but it looks like that was the 
case.  Let me know what you want me to do, if anything at this point.  Again, 
sorry for the delay.

Ben, please find attached the preliminary O&M estimate for the Lincoln, NE 
project that we discussed. It shows O&M cost estimates for a 20 year period 
assuming a stand alone plant with Availability required Monday - Friday, 6 am 
to 10 pm during the peak seasons (hence 2 operating shifts of staff). The GT 
major maintenance accrual is also shown assuming no membership in the Lease 
Engine Membership program. Since we will be buying the output of the plant 
from the Owner & Operator (LES) during a contract period, we may consider not 
showing them these numbers. Before tipping our hand, I'd like to see what 
they plan to "charge" us for the O&M portion of the power they provide us 
during the agreement period. Please review these and the other assumptions to 
ensure that I understand the project correctly at this point (especially the 
water treatment part). 

Since its preliminary in nature, please consider its accuracy +/- 25% for our 
proforma purposes.

If LES is to provide what they feel the O&M would be, please let me in on 
their numbers so we can provide our experience.

thanks, Scot

Is there a reason why you think you are Batman?

I'm trying to find good in this announcement but not much is coming from it.  
I did have a good interview at Duke Business School last week.  I should be 
hearing from NYU-Stern and Duke in the next couple of weeks.  What is my next 
option?  Any suggestions regarding writing letters to anyone you know at Duke 
or NYU?

I just wanted to let you know that I got out UT Business School's application 
on Thursday, so they received it on Friday.  Megan and I are thinking about 
going down to Austin some time soon to see the school and see Austin.  Megan 
has never been down there, so if you guys would be interested in going down 
to Austin with maybe Brandon and Allison, that would be alot of fun.  Let me 
know.  If you could send an e-mail or a letter to the person you know at 
Texas that would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks

This is the model from KN regarding their 4 LM 6000 Plant and their other 
plant which has 6 LM 6000's and I EA.  These numbers are hard to follow so 
they probably won't make a lot of since, without me going through them with 
you, which we can do when I get back.  I will be back tomorrow night and will 
be checking my messages.

I can't believe it -those Hoosiers actually beat a good team.  I'll admit

The guy you are talking about left CIN under a "cloud of suspicion" sort of

1) Coverage/Origination:

To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product=
=20
technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20
businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=
=20
under the leadership of Dave Delainey :
a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,=
=20
co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;
b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a=
=20
broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20
including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=
d=20
mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,=
=20
textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20
Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=
t=20
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=
=20
ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=
=20
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=
=20
Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=
=20
will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=
gy=20
commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=
es=20
but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=
als,=20
plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional=
=20
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=
=20
groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=
=20
will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20
leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three=
=20
sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:
a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage=
=20
activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=
or=20
the provision of innovative=20
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=
n=20
of paper risk management products;
b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=
o=20
lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20
chemicals and refined products industries;
c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers=
=20
Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=
 the=20
coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t=
he=20
provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20
heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile=
s=20
and glass manufacturing industries.

Midstream Coverage/Origination

a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o=
n=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern=

group;
b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus =
on=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The=
y=20
will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20
opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked Chris Calger to assume the=
=20
leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20
Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort=

ocus on=20
the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20
emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc=

=20
Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will=
=20
continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20
Interconnect;
d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur=
ing=20
opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20
restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav=
e=20
asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20
formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=
=20
Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=
=20
this newly formed business.

2) Commercial Transactions:=20

The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20
Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=
=20
transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=
ecuting=20
transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=
=20
of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20
Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20
Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=
=20
Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=
=20
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=
=20
with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=
=20
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This=
=20
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=
=20
and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=
=20
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:

a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=
=20
Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20
include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=
=20
Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=
=20
Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=
=20
from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20
origination.
b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=
ial=20
origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20
Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=
=20
established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=
=20
Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing=
=20
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.
c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=
=20
Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni=
or=20
members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=
nd=20
John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the=
=20
Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We=
=20
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=
=20
weeks.
d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20
Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu=
de=20
Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition=
=20
of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=
=20
Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=
=20
responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will=
=20
continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=
=20
commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua=
l=20
responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20
Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai=
n=20
largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20
Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located=
=20
together.

We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag=
e=20
and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri=
al=20
markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe=
en=20
the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20

Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor=
th=20
America by working with us to implement these changes.

going over the assets.  Thanks

Attached is an Excel Spreadsheet, worksheet 1 is a list the documents I think 
maybe available in whole or part now - we should make a request at our 
earliest convenience to Delmarva/TECO/???? I would be glad to call (probably 
following an introduction call) to get this going.

Worksheet 2 is a start of the Table of Contents of the Due Diligence - I will 
try and finish it today - we are modeling this on some Stone & Webster 
efforts we have copies of - I can get you an example as a go-by.

I have also started on the tasking letter, deliverable list, schedule, 
resources and estimated cost.  I should have that available either tomorrow 
or Monday (I won't have complete buyin on the numbers but should be close 
enough to get going).

If you have a list of our team on this project, it would be helpful. Sounded 
like Lou had a fairly complete list of the Clients people.

Mr. Pushaw:
Whats up my friend.  It's been a long while-too long.  The last time I saw 
you was when I was in New York for the marathon and saw you at that Italian 
rest.  I've been keeping up with gioffre (sp) as of late and noticed your 
e-mail address, so I wanted to give you a shout.  How's everything at law 
school going?  Will you be staying in NYC after you graduate?  I may be in 
NYC next year going to B-School at Columbia.  I'm down here in Houston 
working with Enron.  It's been a great experience but I'm ready to go back to 
school to get my MBA.  Please give me a call when you have some time and lets 
catch up.  My work number is (713)853-7998 and home is (713) 355-8738.  Hope 
all is going well and talk to you soon.  See ya
Ben

Hee are Patrick Smith's brief comments regarding our questions.
Patrick Smith <PatrickAlan@compuserve.com> on 12/14/99 06:12:13 PM
Mr. Rogers,
Just to quickly address your questions in advance of our call in the
morning, I offer the following:

1.  The debt amount contemplated was based on assumptions given by Enron.
The rate given was $375 /kW or $120MM in debt.  This would be obtained via
a 144A Bond offering without any subdebt.

2.  There are three operating fees listed in the proforma currently:
Management fee ($600k/yr) to the Owners as contracted, O&M Fee ($300k/yr)
to the Operator contemplated to be TECO Power Services ("TPS") and the TPS
Parts Company for a spare engine.  The TPS Spare engine may be eliminated
provided we can get comfort via other methods.  The financing fees were
estimates based on discussions with Enron and our engaging CSFB.

3.  The Maintenance Reserve account is accrued based on operating hours of
the plant and planned major maintenance, as estimated by TPS (the O&M
Operator).  This reserve may be eliminated as we currently are estimating
that this plant will never reach a major outage.

I look forward to discussing these issues with you in the morning.

Regards,
Patrick Smith

Hey Mike,
Thanks for the pics.  Where were the ones from which  looks to be a wedding?  
Hey, how many tickets were you thinking about? Were you thinking two for you 
and your Dad?  That weekend is April 1 & 3, 2000.  I'm not sure whether that 
is Easter weekend or not.  One other way to get tics is to go to 
www.finalfourseats.com  Let me know your situation.  Where are you spending 
the New Year?  Talk to you later.

Everyday that we are on the front cover of the journal our stock will go lower.  I have said this the past three weeks and everyday I have been right.  I think it could continue to go lower, because their is going to be no good news for a little while.  Getting access to cash from private equity firms is a double edge sword.  It doesn't look good for the small E.

What do you think?

I needed the CPN lifeboat three weeks ago.  This ship is going down, takeover soon or bankruptcy later.  No joke!  Let me check with Megan, but that sounds good.

04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a "material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern," it warned.

Whats up?  I think tomorrow seems to be a big ax day over here for many of the groups in EIM and EGM.  It's getting pretty grim here on the trading floor.  Most people seem to think that this deal will not go through and that we will go into Ch. 7.  Trading has really slowed down.  How do things look over there?

thinkgs are bleak but not as dire as other groups (the credit of our counterparties are even sketchier than ours) but our trades have dropped off since last wednesday  -Shankman is coming tomorrow -I think to deliver the proverbial ax -the question is will the market deliver it sooner. I thought Ch. 11 would be first? (it may be moot anyway)

what are you thinking about doing?

KEY POINTS
*	CIN reported third quarter 2001 operating earnings of $0.80 per share, compared with $0.58 per share earned in
the third quarter of 2000.  The 38% increase in earnings per share is primarily due to strength in wholesale trading and
marketing and solid growth at the regulated utility operations.
*	Cinergy reaffirmed its 2001 earnings guidance of $2.75 per share.  Although no comments regarding 2002 estimated
earnings were provided by the company, we currently feel comfortable with our 2002E EPS of $2.95.  We expect Cinergy to
grow earnings at a conservative rate of 7%-8% per annum, with regulated operations growing at 5%-6% and energy merchant
operations growing at 10%-12%.  However, if the economy weakens further and wholesale power prices remain at current
levels we may revisit on 2002 estimated earnings per share at a later date.
*	Energy Merchant segment earnings were $0.37 per share, more than double the $0.15 per share earned in last
year's third quarter.  Origination, marketing and trading gross margins rose $43 million, or $0.07 per share, to $217.1
million from $174.1 million last year.  Electricity trading volumes totaled 86,398,499 mWh, up 150% from last year's
levels.  Physical and financial gas trading volumes totaled 48.1 bcf per day, up 160% over the same period last year.
Cinergy Solutions, the segment's cogeneration business, added $0.03 per share in the quarter.  Also, CIN added roughly
1,100 MW of new gas-fired peaking capacity since the third quarter last year.
*	Regulated Operations earned $0.48 per share in the latest quarter, compared with $0.46 per share in the third
quarter 2000.  Gross margins improved due to increased customer demand from service territory growth and warmer weather.
This was offset slightly by increased operations and maintenance and interest expenses.  Total electric retail sales
volumes were 13,898,726 mWh, up 3.6% over last year's level.  Gas retail and transportation sales volumes declined 10.8%
to 10,248,332 mcf.  The decrease was primarily related to weather as well as softening industrial demand.  As of
September 2001, total electric customers were 1,500,790, up from 1,481,411 a year ago and total gas customers were
489,667, up from 482,328 a year ago.
*	Results from the Power Technology and Infrastructure Services segment lost $0.05 per share, down from a loss of
$0.03 in the prior year.  Through Cinergy Ventures Group, this division pursues technology equity investments and runs
technology pilots.  CIN owns several start-up energy infrastructure companies that incurred additional costs as well as
roughly $100 million of direct and indirect investments in power technology-related companies that decreased in value
during the third quarter.
*	We continue to rate shares of CIN Strong Buy. Our 12-month price target of $37 per share is based upon a P/E
multiple of 12.5 times our 2002 EPS estimate of $2.95. In our opinion, the premium valuation is warranted. CIN is a low
cost producer of electricity (primarily coal) that is strategically located in the Midwest, and is actively adding to
its merchant generation portfolio. In total, Cinergy Corp. owns 13,000 MW of generation capacity. Of that total, 6,000
MW is regulated and 7,000 MW is unregulated. Because of Cinergy Corp.'s strategic location and its large fleet of
low-cost power plants, we think the company would be attractive to potential acquirers.

IF ENE management does not step-up to calm investor fears, these fears
could become a self fulfilling prophecy.  In the potentially vicious cycle,
investor fears could drive the stock down, the lower stock prices force the
rating agencies to consider downgrades, potentially lower credit ratings
force counter-parties to reduce exposure with ENE, limiting ENE's to
generate earnings and cash flow.  Thus we see a big incentive for ENE to
clarify the issues.  We expect ENE to put together a more complete
explanation of the major issues over the next few days in order to
stabilize the stock.   If/when ENE schedules a conference call or road
show, we would consider this a bullish sign.  Absent further clarification,
the stock is likely to continue to be weak.   Our gut feel is that ENE can
pull it off and that long-term investors should hold firm, as eventually
the stock gets valued on earnings (with upside potential to $25+/sh over
the next 12 to 18 month period), rather than break-up value ($16/sh-see
below).  We believe new money (with high risk tolerance!) should wait until
ENE announces its intentions for communicating a clear path to recovery.

ENE's VIEW:  ENE has stated that it has reviewed its asset base with Arthur
Anderson and that no additional asset impairments are required other than
an approximate $200 MM charge expected in 1Q02 due to an accounting change.
With no further asset write-downs, and roughly $890 MM in asset
divestitures ($390 MM India E&P, $250 MM Puerto Rico power plant, and $250
MM Brazilian power plant) in 4Q01, ENE's D/TC ratio is likely to decline
from 50% at the end of 3Q01 to roughly 48% at the end of the year.  After
the close of the Portland General divestiture, expected by year-end 2002,
we expect its D/TC to fall below 45% (we are projecting FCF to be
break-even in FY02).  We estimate that ENE's interest coverage at the end
of 3Q01 is 3.5x.  ENE is currently rated BBB+ by S&P and Baa1 by Moodys,
and would need to decline 3 ratings to fall below investment grade.  For
comparison purposes, S&P's BBB median D/TC is 47.4% and EBITDA/Int. Exp.
coverage is 6.1x, while BB (non-investment grade) median D/TC is 61.3% and
interest coverage is 3.8x.

IMPORTANCE OF ENE's INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING:  We believe that ENE's
Wholesale segments, which generates 80% of its EBIT, would be
noncompetitive if the credit rating falls below investment grade.  In
addition, a decline in credit rating below investment grade would trigger
the issuance of 50 MM shares of common stock and $1 B in convertible
preferred stock associated with ENE's off-balance sheet structured
financing vehicles.  We believe ENE will do what ever it can to maintain an

investment grade rating.  Moodys has its BBB+ rating under review for a
possible downgrade.   Last night S&P revised its long-term ratings outlook
to negative due to concerns that the significant drop in market
capitalization in the past week has adversely affected the company's
financial flexibility and could impede its ability to pursue plans to
rebuild its balance sheet.

BREAK-UP VALUE:  We believe ENE 's Wholesale America ($2.7 B in TTM
EBITDA), Wholesale Europe ($900 MM) and Retail ($450 MM) segments are
conservatively worth a 4x multiple (recent multiples have been higher, but
we are discounting due to limited buying interest) or $16.2 B.  The Gas
Pipeline segment ($820 MM) and Global Assets ($200 MM) valued at a 6x
multiple are worth $6.1 B.  PGE valued at the divestiture price is $2.9 B.
Total asset value is conservatively $25 B, vs. debt of $13 B, leaving $12 B
or $16/sh for equity investors in a break-up scenario.  The challenge is,
if ENE loses its investment grade rating, the value ($16.2 B) of its
Wholesale and Retail segments would be materially compromised--leaving
little for equity investors.

POTENTIAL FOR ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS:  ENE's Global Assets portfolio
includes assets with $6 B in book value (ENE's total gross PP&E is $14 B)
that has generated an EBIT loss of $18 MM (EBITDA of +$168 MM) over the
last 12-month period (4Q00 to 3Q01).  The Global Assets portfolio includes
Elektro (an electric utility in Brazil), Dabhol (power plant in India), TGS
(a natural gas pipeline in Argentina), Azurix and Enron Wind operations.
These assets seem ripe for a write-down although the company argues that it
has reviewed them with Arthur Anderson recently and that the assets are not
impaired.  ENE will have to continue to convince Anderson that the value of
these assets has not been impaired.  The write-down of these assets would
reduce shareholder equity and ENE's D/TC, threatening its credit rating.
It is not clear that ENE put all its under-performing assets in the Global
Assets portfolio.  There could be other poor performing assets in other
segments that are hidden by strong performance in its Wholesale business.

ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS:  ENE's counter-parties seem to be supportive and
have not indicated any change in business activity.  EnronOnline trading
volume was slightly above average yesterday.  Some energy traders have
bought ENE in their personal accounts, convinced that ENE core marketing
business is strong and the belief that the equity markets have
over-reacted.  Lots of ENE corporate finance people are working late nights
solidifying ENE's financial strategy (hopefully for a more complete
discussion with the street?).

THE SEC INQUIRY:  We believe ENE has an extensive paper trail from its
attorneys and accountants that will clear them of any legal problems with
the SEC associated with the LJM partnerships in which CFO Andy Fastow
participated.  We do not expect the SEC to find any legal
wrong-doing--although this doesn't mean that they won't express qualitative
concern over the appearance of the transactions.

                                                 family. 
                                                 The mayor kept a promise he made 
                                                 last month to Diane, 23, after her 
                                                 firefighter brother, Michael, who 
                                                 was supposed to give her away, 
                                                 died Aug. 28 while fighting a 
                                                 three-alarm blaze on Staten Island. 
                                                 "We will go on. This proves it right 
                                                 here. The mayor came here - he 
                                                 thought about us," the beaming 
                                                 newlywed said as she jumped into a 
                                                 limo with husband, Michael Ferrito, 
                                                 31, a police officer at the 61st 
                                                 Precinct. 
                                                 Diane has already lived through 12 
                               months of her own horrors. Her grandfather died Sept. 13, 
                               2000, and 17 days later, her dad, an executive at J.P. 
                               Morgan Chase, also passed away. 
                               With her father gone, she asked her brother, a member of 
                               Engine Co. 163, to walk her down the aisle at St. James 
                               Lutheran Church in Gerrittsen Beach, and he agreed. 
                               Then, the Staten Island fire tragedy took Michael's life. 
                               At Michael's funeral, Diane sadly lamented to her mom, Gail, 
                               that there was nobody to escort her up to the altar. She 
                               half-jokingly turned to the mayor and asked, "Why don't you 
                               do it?" 
                               "I'd be honored," Giuliani replied, without missing a beat. 
                               Yesterday morning, Giuliani - who has been working round 
                               the clock since the Twin Towers horror - said the wedding 
                               meant "a great deal to him." 
                               The mayor recalled asking Gail Gorumba, after her son died, 
                               how she has kept going through her grief. 
                               "She feels the pain of it, she allows the pain to happen," 
                               Giuliani said. "But then she focuses on the good things that 
                               are left in life, like her daughter's wedding. I thought about 
                               that a good deal of time this week." 
                               The bride and groom's families said they will be eternally 
                               grateful to him. 
                               "It meant more than I can ever, ever say. He's the best, and 
                               I wish we could re-elect him" Diane said. 
                               As 225 people jammed the quaint 77-year-old church, the 
                               mayor gave Diane his left arm. 
                               Smiling happily for perhaps the first time since the Tuesday 
                               disaster, Giuliani - clad in black tie with a white rose in his 
                               lapel - slowly strode down the aisle and brought Diane to the 
                               groom. 
                               Then he lifted her veil and kissed her on the cheek. 
                               As the 30-minute ceremony proceeded, the mayor sat in the 
                               front row with the bride's mom. Afterward, Giuliani got into 
                               his car to head back to Manhattan, and the serious work at 
                               hand.

Harry's cell phone number is (832) 723-6363.  I think I gave you his home number. This number may be better to use to get in touch with Harry.

Harry:
Wanted to get your comments on your conversation with Michael.  I think it would be good if we put something together using the information I have combined with what you would like to show them.  Then think about going up there pretty soon.  Let me know what you think.
Ben 

Michael:
I just had another brief conversation with Harry.  He had not heard from Bruce yet.  I think coming down here sooner rather later would be important to get Harry and his team convinced.  Harry is talking to other folks and it seems that those talks are moving along quite quickly.  Hope this helps.
Ben  

Harry:
What did you think of the presentation thus far and what other type of info are you looking for.  The rest of the presentation is not that strategy oriented like the pages I gave you, but I will go through it and see if any of the other pages will help.  The key is to get an idea of what they are trying to do so that you can craft in that fashion.  I am playing tennis at 3:00, but will call you later to talk more about the presentation and tomorrow's meeting.
Ben

Ben

1. Bruce Sukaly did call me and I am having  lunch with him tomorrow.
2. Could you share more of the presentation you have? It is very informative about their thought processes and ideas. It would be nice to gloss through that whole thing (I dont need to keep a copy or anything)

What's up?  How's the week going?  Things are getting back to normal down here in Houston.  How's your brother doing - has he gone back to work?

How amazing is this story. I worked with the father, he was an old H&Q guy and if anyone remembers, he is the one I used to smoke cigarettes with in his office. I am sure you remember when I went out to his funeral. Anyway, this story shows you just how amazing Rudy is after everything that has happened.

                                                 Gorumba of Brooklyn beamed with 
                                                 pride yesterday as Mayor Giuliani 
                                                 walked her down the aisle - and

Unfortunately yes.  The traders and finance folks were kept on to perform u=
nwind and liquidation functions.  The trading group, the group I am in, is =
really the only group with value besides the pipleines, thus we will probab=
ly be sold off to a bank like Citi or JPM.  I wouldn't mind that because th=
ey understand the trading business of commodities as well as equities and f=
ixed income.  This as been an amazing experience and taught me alot about o=
ver leverage and strategic, really about what not to due, which can be as i=
mportant as what to do in business.  99% of the folks are good hardworking =
people, but its the few finance guys at the top that brought this company d=
own.  It really is a shame to see all these people yesterday get laid off. =
 It was so sad.  Luckily, by accident I had sold off most of my options las=

my mom likes to say.  On a good note we got your picture of the little tike=

sounds good.  see you there.

3:30 at Starbucks on West gray

Sorry about that - I had to get a name and number from Mike for a guy at Goldman Sachs in New York, to arrange a potential meeting with those guys in NYC for a trading position.  I already paid $3,000 to ML today.  So its not an increase in Margin, plus you will write me a check for the current Margin balance tonight.  See you at home.

I don't have a meeting so we can take my car at 4pm

Yes - I think so.  I am still employed, just waiting to be bought out by a bank like Citigroup or UBS.  It's been crazy to live through all of this shit.  This has been an incredible learning experience of what NOT to do in business.  These guys at the top are complete crooks.  Anyway, enough bs, Megan and I are heading up to Boston for X-mas, were getting together with Jon and Kati one day.  Well be out in Colorado for New Year's.  I hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.  Thanks for the e-mail.

You still out there?

Joe:
Thanks for the call.  My e-mail at work, which is fine to send it to, is benjamin.rogers@enron.com.  My e-mail at home is rogersofenron@yahoo.com. I talked with Harry yesterday and he is bringing up with him all the resumes of the guys we are thinking about bringing over.  Do you want him to give them to McCabe or you or both when he is up there? Maybe someone should give hime a call before that to have the resumes sent up there sooner. I will send you and McCabe my resume today.  I look foward to coming up to Cincy Wednesday to talk to you guys about these opportunities.
Regards,

Here is a quick stock analysis spreadsheet you should really get to use.  Call me if you have any questions or we can go through it when we are out there in Colorado.  Did you have a chance to meet with Harry?  I was suppose to come up, but some of the guys weren't available.   
Ben

 

Dad:
I thought the article was very poistive, but started out a little on the "good old boy" side.  You are operating in a political minefield very effectively.  Keep up the great work.  Talk to you soon and have a good week.
Ben

Your talk is cheap.  I sat next to your Dad all day yesterday at the KMI investor conference.  We had a good chat.  Talk to you soon.
Ben

After church, after lunch/brunch, you are going down!   3:00.

Please tranfer my parking over to the Allan Center.  Please let me know what I need to due as soon as possible.  Thanks for the heads up.

Good Morning,

	The purpose of this e-mail is to inform you that a mandatory move from your current parking location is required due to the expiration of Enron's parking contract with the Metropolitan Garage as of 1/31/01.

	The Parking & Transportation Dept. is offering alternative parking in the Allen Center Garage for $99 per month. In order for us to make this a smooth transition for you, we are asking that you respond as soon as possible, however, all parking changes must be made via e-mail, no later than 1/25/01. The Allen Center spaces will be on a first come - first serve basis. If you have any questions you can contact Parking & Transportation at x3-7060.

Dave:
I hope all is going well.  I left you an e-mail regarding coming over to work for you.  I decided to not except the UBS deal, so I wanted to come work for you and Janet.  Since I have already talked with these guys, I am pretty much available today going forward.  Again, you know what I have done and I think it would be a good fit.  Hope to hear from you soon.
Regards,
Ben

I will call him today.  I have mover off the trading floor and I am actually back on 31st floor where we used to work in trading and origination.  Talk to you later.
Ben

Ben,
I have to email the Head of School and schedule a
meeting with her before she leaves.  When do you
suggest I tell her?????  Have you talked to your dad?

Have you noticed where Cin Summer is trading lately???  Thats right around $37.5 to $38.0  That is lower than where it liquedated last summer and based on the fundamentals regarding gas, it looks like its heading lower than that by April.  Just wanted to keep you well informed and hope that your guys were in the right position.  It was a pretty violent price move these last several weeks.  Hope all is going well and I'll talk to you soon.
Ben

Dad:
I heard that CIN summer is down to $32 - $33.  Gas is going to be below $2.00 for the summer by March.  Looks like your idea to short the whole year at $32.00 was a very good idea.  Again make sure your guys are looking at it right.  I think summer CIN will get to be around $28 before April and thats when you start buying it up.  Let me know what you think.  Merrill came out with a good report on you guys today.  I need to talk to you about a couple of things.  Please give me a call at home when you get the chance.
Ben

WIERD!!!  Someone has too much free time on their hands.  

Ben,
Check this out:

1.  Go to MS word and type Q33 NY (the number of the
first plane that crashed into the WTC)
2.  Increase the font to 65

This most recent year I was in the power trading group for Enron working in the Northeast market, where I was a junior trader, but doing alot of senior trader type stuff.  I would be interested in talking with those guys if they are looking for someone like myself.  I know that most of the senior traders are staying with UBS.  There are a couple who have been looking elsewhere, some I think with Goldman.  Let me see where those guys are at.  I will send you my resume when I get home, so you will see it come through my home e-mail.  Thanks again and talk to you soon.

I don't know who you may know on the trading side.  Goldman Sachs is looking

compensation for the first year.  Do you know of anyone falling out there
who might be interested?  I appreciate the referrals.

The Flipped-Over Rock

February 21, 2002

By WILLIAM SAFIRE

WASHINGTON -- What wife of a United States senator profited
from her close association with a big company that did
heavy lobbying of the federal government and then went
bust, costing investors billions and workers their jobs?

Why, Wendy Gramm, most recently awakened watchdogs would
say, wife of the Republican Phil Gramm of Texas, previous
chairman of the Banking Committee. As a director of Enron,
she was on the audit committee that didn't question the
fast-and- loose auditing, and (subtracting the deferred
compensation that went into the tank) received about
$220,000 over eight years.

That's peanuts, say Republicans. The senatorial wife who
hit it big was Anne Bingaman, married to New Mexico's Jeff
Bingaman, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources
Committee. As lobbyist for the telecommunications comet
Global Crossing, which went bankrupt last month, she
received $2,500,000 for six months' work during 1999.

Both senatorial wives are accomplished executives who
parlayed responsible government appointments into lucrative
private positions.

Wendy Gramm was chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission. Anne Bingaman was Bill Clinton's assistant
attorney general for antitrust until leaving in June 1996.
Her lobbying fee for delaying approval of a competitor's
undersea cable still makes Beltway bandits gasp.

This juxtaposition shows that the Enron scandal is having
only bipartisan political fallout; in this case, the
"everybody did it" defense works. (You can bet that neither
spouse will be subpoenaed and publicly humiliated by the
club member Fritz Hollings at the Commerce Committee.)
Because both the biggest bankrupt (Enron) and the
fourth-biggest bankrupt (Global Crossing) made
contributions to politicians of both parties, the resulting
public disgust has been used to advance bipartisan campaign
finance reform.

Enron, which mostly embarrassed Republicans, has been wrung
dry in the media; the sight of the tilted "E" symbol
elicits yawns from viewers. It's the telecommunications
giant Global Crossing's turn in the barrel; now we'll be
hearing about Clinton connections on its board and its
boss's million-dollar contribution to the Clinton library.

Especially delicious will be the examination of Terry
McAuliffe, the fabled fund-raiser whom Bill Clinton
insisted the Democratic National Committee take on as
chairman. McAuliffe says he merely invested $100,000 in
Global Crossing and sold it for $18 million, and what's the
big deal? What his D.N.C. spokesman won't say is what price
per share he paid before the company went public, and what
that stock was worth when it went on the market - and what
he did to earn the difference. (Same question could be
directed to Bush the elder.)

But after the politicians tire of wounding each other and
declare a truce, we may see some overdue action on the
control of financial derivatives. These are the
investments, often off the books, in futures and currencies
that slice and dice risk and have made instant
billionaires, but whose abuse has been disastrous to
investors from Orange County to Long-Term Capital
Management.

Hedge funds are supposed to spread and reduce risk; in
reality, they are often used to make huge bets unknown to
their institutional investors. Accountants are supposed to
enforce disclosure of all liabilities, but many have become
expert in the concealment of risk.

I don't profess to understand the worries some of my
financial sources express about dangerous excesses in the
convertible bond market, "swaptions" and ever-narrowing
derivatives. But my unwillingness to break my head learning
these intricacies gives the wheeler-dealers an edge.
Complication and secrecy are mother's milk to them, while
the average investor's best protection is full disclosure.

When you flip over a flat rock like Enron or Global
Crossing, you see much panicky scurrying-about by those who
like to work in the dark. For too long, new-economy
corporate creeps and their accounting Heeps have hidden
risk in arcane off-the-books dealing. The new S.E.C.
chairman, Harvey Pitt, seems not to get it: Stop pretending
it's a political scandal and start dealing with the
accounting and derivatives scandal.

Interesting, are you around for a late lunch?

 

Dad:
Did you see that Dynegy is spinning off a MLP called Dynegy Energy Partners.  Exactly what I have been talking about could be happening and that is still a very good idea, with maybe some of the players in your area.  Also, John Rowe as been named sole CEO and Chairman of Exelon. They came out yesterday and said they were interested in merging with a midwest utility.  Talk to you soon.

Ben,

I was again good to talk with you and I look forward to the
possibilities. As we spoke of, Joe Toussaint is heading up the talent
initiative and coordinating the recruiting process. I spoke with Joe
today and he informed me he had left several contact numbers for you so
I will at this point step out of the middle of process to allow for a
more coordinated approach. I'm sure I speak for Joe when I say we
believe the changes in the industry as well as Enron provide opportunity
for us both.

Please provide Joe with your resume as soon as you can and as we
discussed be prepared to discuss your desires, skills and/or experiences
you believe uniquely qualify you, as well as examples of your ability to
create value.

Again it has been my pleasure and I'm sure Joe or his designee will
contact you concerning your trip to Cincinnati and scheduled activities
next week.

Michael J. Cyrus
President & CEO, Cinergy, Energy Merchant

Is this the Enron effect happening over there today?  
Ben

Hey:
Where do you think Delaney goes?  Goldman?

Stan:
Its been a very interesting ride these last four and a half years here.  I received an offer from UBS, but decided to turn it down for personal reasons.  These last few weeks I have been with the estate working on selling certain assets.  Tomorrow is my last day with the estate and then I am off to Ohio and Cinergy to continue trading.  I will also begin to learn the oprations of Cinergy as well as go back and get an executive MBA at Chicago.  Ultimately, I want to learn more about the overall operations and effective energy risk management.  
I just wanted to thank you for all you have done while I have been here.  I look back and think that I should have spent time in the pipeline group.  Even after all that has happened I certainly wouldn't change what I have experienced.  Thanks again for being such a good friend.  Hope you are doing well and good luck with everything.  I will send you my new information at Cinergy.  My Dad would love to hear from you sometime.
Regards,
Ben

Chobs:
Sorry it took so long to respond, but its been crazy around here.  Both KMI and KMP are still good buys, its just the overall market environment thats bringing these down.  Also, the commodities prices in gas and crude and fuel oil have come off quite a bit, which makes the general investors worry about the future earnings potential of the companies.  They are locked into contracts at a very good price, so whether the price of the commodity goes up or down they still make their cash flow targets.  Remember, the CEO of the company has a stack of over 25% of the company, so he is very tied to the overall stock price.  Enough said, invest your money into KMI and KMP, especially KMP since it has that yield of around 7%.  Talk to you soon.
Ben

Yo Bro,

My brother-in-law (the wantabe day trader) has a good amount of Kinder
Morgan.  The price is down pretty low.  Is it just because of the economy?
Is this their cyclical low period?  Are they feeling some of the heat from
the Enron stock drop?  Let me know because if it is a bargain low. I want
to buy more too.  Let me know what you think.

Ciao

Missy:
If you could change that to a taxi service, that would be great.  Since this is only a one day trip it's makes it a little easier for me.  Thanks again!
Ben

Ben,

Please find attached your travel itinerary, as well as your meeting
schedule for Friday, January 4th.  I have reserved a rental car with
Hertz, but if you would prefer a taxi, we can make that simple change.
Just let me know your preference.

I have also attached directions to our facility.  We are located at 7200
Industrial Road in Florence, Kentucky.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or need any
assistance prior to your trip.  Hang on to any receipts for any
out-of-pocket expenses you incur and we will reimburse you.  I look
forward to meeting you.  Have a safe trip!

Let me know what you think.  I left a message for Brian Terp to send me his resume so I can send it to you.  Let me also know about your conversation with Michael about what we talked about yesterday.  Talk to you soon.
Ben

Eric:
There is a book store called the Brown Book Store located several blocks from here.  They have several books on trading within this industry that you will want to read.  You will need to call information to find out where they are.  Good Luck!
Ben

Hey Ben-

Hope you had a great holiday and you guys are staying busy.  Things down in EIM are looking a little more promising since our current direction is to hold onto some of our assets and potentially take a group of people forward to do some low-credit trading....I'm cautiously optimistic.

I did want your recommendation on any books for someone interested in learning about power trading.  Any ideas?

Thanks Ben-

Erik

Joe:
Thanks for taking the time to talk with me regarding the opportunities at Cinergy.  I enjoyed my discussions with the other guys on the trading floor.  There is clearly money to be made trading in the right regions with the right people.  I would like to continue trading, but also learn Cinergy's assets to better understand how to effectively trade around these types of assets.  It seems that everyone I talked to is enthusiastic about growing the business in the right regions.  Let me know if you guys need me to come up and visit again.  Thanks again and I'll talk to you soon.
Regards,
Ben  

Mr. Lay:
It was good to see you down on the trading floor today.  I have been in the power trading group for about a year now.  I came over from the corp. development group after we sold the peakers to Allegheny and to Cinergy.  I was the one who convinced my Dad to buy those two peakers.
The power trading group is a really solid group of individuals.  Sitting where I do I see and hear alot of what goes on in the heart on Enron and I feel that this part of the company is doing really well.  
I have been with Enron for over four years now and I continue to learn alot as well as contribute to Enron's bottom line.  Eventhough Enron's stock price has come off a little I still think this is a great company and that the overall fundamentals are very sound.  I hope all is going well! 

Regards,
Ben 

Jeff:
I think we may be past due on when we need to play by, but thats fine.  I think Saturday works for me as well.  I know things are quite busy right now, so good luck with everything.
Ben

Things are a little busy now - when do we have to play by?

I normally play in the morning but maybe next Saturday would work.

See ya.

Jeff:
It looks like we are playing eachother in the Met's consolation round.  The best time I can play is either after work or some time on the weekend.  Let me know what works for you.  
Ben

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.  We will be going to Texadelphia around 7:00.  I will still call you when we get there.
Love
Ben

Remember to call me!!
I am going to class in 25 minutes

love ya!!

11/09/2000 03:02 PM
Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of 
Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay 
Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector

Didn't you say mapquest said it takes around 6 hrs to get to Houston from 
Corpus
Dickhead?

What's the website you bought the Adirondack chairs off of.  We are looking
to pick up a couple more.

KR

There's a girl on my desk that makes it in 3, so it'll probably take you 4.

I'll tell you what.  You give us your "want"  list and we'll make sure you 
can do it all.
Of course, after you assemble the chair.

What was Lowery doing in San Antonio??

We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the 
upgrade to
the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the 
need to move
out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, 
besides this we
don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few 
hours on Sunday.

Let me know what you want to do.

KR

You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't 
know 
why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never 
does.   My desk
seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've 
relied, more than
any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the 
business.  Probably
not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner 
sometime within the 
next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - 
we'll go get 
a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is 
into some
good red meat.

KR

Kevin Ruscitti

Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In 
addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are 
they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, 
it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The 
politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute 
stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more 
focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think 
they are incable
of solving the problem.  

KR

Did you go to any parties last night??  I was lame, I didn't go to a single 
one.  I heard
there were some decent ones.  How's life at Duke been?  I haven't talked to 
you much
since you've become a big ICE trader.   Talk to you soon.

KR

Stamos,

I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to 
get 
crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that 
is in cash.
The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an 
increase in
plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates 
but there'll
be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've 
just seen the beginning.  
I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.

Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis 
is not a short term
problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that 
state's economy goodbye.
Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate 
prices in the country, and 
(2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst 
of a hi-tech meltdown, what would
keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  
If you own any
CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to 
reduce demand or increase supply.
Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue 
likely won't be solved anytime
soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so 
high that
the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves 
by closing its plant, cutting
back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak 
hours.  California will see
this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so 
many businesses have
closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the 
blackouts will get much worse.
If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity 
and gas, I would bet it will go
bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national 
economy from the bankruptcy 
of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but 
I would keep my eyes on
the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care 
and thanks for the email.

Kevin 

That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be
bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I 
hope
Lowery has held off on buying his house.

Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.

KR

Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball 
game.
Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We 
should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I 
definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we 
bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a 
pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer 
combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA 
economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way 
to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels 
where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  
price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so 
this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of 
course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. 
of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most 
other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an 
increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so 
you could take it with
a grain of salt.  

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

BL,

Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer.
What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or 
not?  I think
the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, 
but it'll be incredibly
difficult to avoid.

Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next 
time you'll
be in Dallas?  Let me know.

Great to hear from you.  Early congrats on your graduation.  Everything has 
been
going well down in the Lone Star State.  I got married in September down the 
Jersey
shore and everything has been going well.  We bought a house back in May.  It 
needs
an incredible amount of work.  We own the ugliest house on the block, by far.

How are things in Indiana?  Are you and Paul still together?  How is he 
doing?  When
is the last time you were back in Jersey?  We went back over Christmas but 
only for
a couple days.  I think next year we'll go back during New Year's instead of 
Christmas.

The following article appeared in today's Chronicle.

Enron rating setup irks many workers 
By L.M. SIXEL 

TONGUES ARE WAGGING at Enron Corp., and it's not because of the bonuses 
they're expecting next month. 

Employees are irate about a new performance-review ranking system that pits 
them against each other. 

Under the system, nicknamed "rank and yank," employees will be put in one of 
five categories: 5 percent will be identified as "superior," 30 percent will 
be labeled "excellent," 30 percent will be called "strong," 20 percent will 
be labeled "satisfactory" and 15 percent will be called "needs improvement" 
or "issues." 

An insider said "needs improvement" means "you have one leg hanging out the 
window." And "issues" is Enron lingo for "you're gone." 

The rankings, whose names reportedly took Enron officials hours to come up 
with, are not based just on performance. 

Instead, they compare employee against employee. 

"It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher 
level compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current 
period if other employees' performance raised the bar," according to a memo 
from Chief of Staff Steven Kean and Executive Vice President Cindy Olson that 
was distributed this month. 

While employees are competing against each other for ratings, they're also 
expected to be team players, according to the memo. 

`Horse-trading' of rank denied
The problem, according to someone familiar with the new system, is the 
horse-trading that goes on when the rankings are divided up. 

Managers trade rankings like baseball cards, explained the insider, offering 
to downgrade one employee if they can get a better rating for another 
employee. 

An employee's ranking is more a function of the negotiating skills of the 
manager he is working for, the insider said. 

Olson, who's over human resources and community relations, said no 
horsetrading is going on. The rankings, due out this week, aren't set in 
stone, she said. Only 9 percent of employees were rated in the bottom 
category while 6 to 7 percent were labeled superior, she said. 

But Olson said she can see how employees might be worried about the prospect 
of bargaining. 

She speculated that one reason employees might worry is because it's a new 
system for about 60 percent of Enron's employees. In years past, only the 
wholesale energy services group was ranked this way. 

Some human resource managers expressed surprise that Enron, which is known 
for hiring superstars, apparently feels that it must get rid of so many 
employees -- or at least put them on notice that they're not doing well. 

It doesn't say much about the confidence of your recruiting system if you're 
getting rid of 10 to 15 percent of your work force each year, said a human 
resource manager in Houston who asked to remain anonymous. 

Some may not fit in
Some people, as smart and talented as they are, just don't fit into Enron's 
culture, Olson said. It's a company that doesn't tell people what to do; you 
have to know what adds value, she said. Some folks just have a hard time in 
that environment. 

After thinking about it for a moment, Olson added that maybe Enron's 
recruiters aren't doing a good enough job weeding out the people who wouldn't 
do well in an entrepreneurial environment. 

Forced ranking systems were popular several years ago. But they fell out of 
favor, in part because they were seen as damaging employee motivation. 

Several years ago, Houston Lighting & Power put in a forced ranking system, 
dividing all employees into four groups, with "1" the top group and "4" the 
lowest. Employees were so angry with the system that some work crews had 
T-shirts printed: "Don't ask me -- I'm a 3." 

Olson said she doesn't see a problem with motivation. People like to know how 
they stand and will work hard to reach the top category, she said. 

But many of the employees -- at least the ones who rate above satisfactory -- 
won't know how they're rated. Managers don't have to reveal the ratings. 

And as for figuring out what it takes to be superior? You've got to reinvent 
your job, add new business lines or create something totally new. 

"Employees understand that when it's explained to them," Olson said.

Julie,

Glad to hear some positive news.  Hope you are doing quite well.  Talk to you
soon.

Kevin

Correction,  I don't think thinks will blow over this summer, I think things 
could blow
up and actually be a lot worse than they are now.  In terms of longer term, I 
think
a lot depends on how the state tries to resolve the problem.  It will be 
interesting to
see.  I feel that the summer will be very interesting, especially if 
California gets the
kind of heat they had last summer.  Stay in touch.

KR

The house thing is a tough call.  It's hard to say.   If you're not in any 
hurry to buy, the summer should give
you a good indication of continuing energy problems.  I personally think that 
the problem will come and go 
for a while, but a lot depends on how California's legislature deals with the 
situation.  I have no idea what 
they'll end up doing - they've acted pretty poorly already.

What's your time frame on a house?  If you're only concern is that prices are 
at their highest level in the last 
decade, I wouldn't worry too much about that.  It's impossible to time the 
market -  who would've thought 
San Francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels.   There are 
also a lot of intangibles associated 
with home ownership as your aware of.   

I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keep abreast 
of it.  Also, you could call me if you
have any questions.  I'll try to help the best I can.  Take care and tell Kim 
and Kendall I said hi.

Kevin

BriLowery@aol.com on 01/22/2001 10:48:39 PM
Chump!
This energy crisis is making me question  my timing on buying a house.  I'm
thinking if the economy tanks the housing prices will dip a little.  They
just crack the highs of 1989 this last two years.  Any opinions?

I start my Texas travel in February.  I'll be in Dallas for the first full
week and back in March in Dallas again.  Starting the end of March I'll be
there almost every week for about 6 months.  You'll be seeing more of me than
you want.  When we get closer to March I'll give you a buzz to set up some
dates.
Sorry about the Kendall picture, I'll try again.

Take care, B

Brett,

I thought I had your home phone #, but I only have your work #.  As a result,
I didn't call you this weekend.  Send me your home # so I can give you a ring.

By the way, Happy 35th birthday.  I hope you had a good one.

Kevin

Mr. B. Lowery,

First of all, you sent me a picture with the head cut off.  I couldn't even 
see Kendall.
I don't know if something happened with the translation of the file, but try 
to send
it again if you can.  

In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed 
- big time.
I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy.  If, like you 
said, noone 
really talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that will change soon.  It 
has the potential
to affect every person in the state.  Not only will consumers end up bailing 
out the
utilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&E - but it will 
likely prevent
many new companies from setting up shop in California.  After all, who would 
want
to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power 
interruptions 
while paying the highest utility bills in the country.  I think that the only 
way California
will come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for 
the foreseeable
future.  I don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the 
next couple years.
But remember, that is just my meaningless opinion.

When do you start coming to Texas.  Let me know so we can try to hook up.  
I'll talk to
you soon.

Counnnnnnnnn,

What's up?   I heard Conway emailed you the other day about New Orleans.  I'm 
going to 
meet Conway and Jughead in N.O. on Nov 17 - 19 for a weekend getaway.  I just 
booked
my flight a couple days ago and wanted to see if there was any way you could 
make it
down.  It seems Conway has gotten a cheap hotel room with his military 
discount - one of the
perks of working for Uncle Sam.  I'm sorry for the short notice but we just 
decided to do it a 
few days ago.  If you could make it, we'd all love to see you.  If not, we'll 
have to get together
when I'm in NJ over Christmas.  Tell Chris we said hi.  Hope everything is 
going great for the
both of you.  Talk to you soon.

Kevin

I'm goin' to have to bag on the game.  My return flight is at noon on Sunday. 
I get in at 4:45pm on Friday.  What time will you be in?  Do you want me to 
check
on a place to eat Friday or Saturday?  Let me know.

KR

I'm interested in donating.  Can I find out more info about the specifics of 
the procedure and the timing?

Sorry it's taken me so long to reply, but I just checked my email.  We were 
out of town the
last few days.  It sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking and 
reflecting.   I think it healthy
to analyze one's actions in order to better understand oneself.  This better 
understanding, I find,
typically leads to self improvement and greater control, and ultimately, more 
happiness in life.
However, do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair.  We 
all have regrets, but
these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the 
long run.  

I forwarded your email to Patty Kampmann, not Patti Campi.  As you might 
imagine, I got a kick
out of that.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin  

Hope all is well.  I haven't forgot abt the Hawaiin Electric position.  I'll 
try to get in touch with
my friend today.  I've been out of town for the last few days.

TJ,

Thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail - it made us 
feel great.
We actually didn't go on a honeymoon - we will take one sometime next year.  
We've just
been swamped with the house we recently bought.  We bought an old small 
bungalow
in the city.  What a money pit.  Hope everything is going great.  Tell 
everyone we said
hi.

Thanks again,

Kevin

The one thing I remember is that they are incredibly expensive and somewhat 
troublesome
to maintain.  Depending on how old it is, I definitely  wouldn't recommend it 
as your primary car.

Hope you had a good time at the wedding.  It was one of the best weekends 
I've had in ages.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

I'm glad you had a great time.  It meant a lot to Lisa and me that you were 
able to spend
the entire weekend with us.  I honestly can't remember the last time I had so 
much fun.  I
hope you felt the same way.  Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Congrats on the beautiful baby.  Let's get together soon, if even for coffee 
in the afternoon.  Call
me at x3-6320 when you get a chance.

I appreciate the email.  I figured something must be wrong for you to miss 
the big day, but I was afraid to call.  The
important thing, obviously, is that you get better.  We'll just have to 
figure out a way to meet up with you in the near
future.  Tell everyone I said hi and keep me informed of your operation and 
recovery.  We'll all miss you very much.

Hugs and Kisses,

Kevin.

P.S.  Tell Tom and John we said hi.

Any deal with a quantity discrepancy is being investigated.

Sounds great.  Moller's email address is Richard.J.Moller@marshmc.com.  I do 
not have anyone else's email,
but Moller should be able to provide you with Coun's and Ricigiliano's.  Just 
ask him.  Let me know if you need anything
else.

Thanks,

Kevin

Hey bro

What is happening?! Fishing stuff is coming along. The charter is set for
Sept. 22nd in the A.M. departing from point pleasant. Capt. Gene will get
back to me in a week or so with more details.

The cost is $50 per person. No bottles allowed but you can bring cans or
cups. I've got the beer and drinks. Also pack food. Trip should be about 8
hours.

Contacted Rich Moeller and let him know about the time and specifics. It
looks like 14 people are going with the possibility of about 20 (5 are still
undecided). Should be a good time.

If you have some e-mail addresses for Rich or Rosigliano or a couple of
other people please supply them to me so I can keep everyone posted on the
details.

The big date is less than 4 weeks away (Can you believe it?)

Hope all is well,

Keith

I could meet today after 5pm.  Give me a call at x3-6320.

Kevin

Alberto,

You're best bet is to send a resume to Chris Gaskill.  Chris is starting a 
new fundamental analysis group.  I know he
is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground.  If you're 
interested in trading, it's probably the best
way to get involved in this side of the business.  I'm not sure if you have a 
long term interest in trading or if you're just
looking for a rotation.  Give me a call also after 4pm and I could provide 
you with some insight into the area.

Until then send Chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to 
me first if you'd like.

Kevin

possible.

Let's say tomorrow at 6am.  See you then unless I hear back from you.

Jim,

Do you have any availability this week?

Kevin

Luke's growing like crazy.  Great to see the update.  Yeah,   the wedding is 
getting near and
the plans are pretty much complete.  We're really just having family so the 
plans at this point are minimum.

How's everything in California.  Is Lowery showing up on your doorstep every 
Sunday at dinner time?  I wouldn't
be surprised.

Did I tell you about the dinner I attended in NY a month ago.  What an 
event.  The party included - get this crew - 
Bill Ricigliano, Dan Sweetser, Jonathan Counnnn, Richie Moller, Brian Sh., 
and yes, Vincent Lima.  We were
all privey to Moller drinking a 12 oz. glass of fresh piss.  Some things 
never change.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Great to hear you'll be back soon.  Get me a call when you get back in the 
states and
tell that Fathead I said hi.

Kevin

Sweet house - I hope everything works out.  When are you trying to close?  
Did they accept your offer?

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Had a great time in SF.  Went to the wine country for a few days.  Was sad to 
come back
to Houston.  We haven't done much on the house since your visit.  I'll talk 
to you soon.  Tell
Marie we said hi.

Kevin

Angela,

I'm not looking for another rotation.  I will be staying in NG trading and 
will hopefully be 
getting promoted this PRC session.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Kevin

Thanks for the gift certificate. You shouldn't have done that.  I'm heading 
to San Francisco
tomorrow for 5 days.  I'll talk to you when I get back.

Kevin

Let's shoot for 6:30am on Friday.  I should be able to meet for about 15 
minutes.  Let me know
if this works for you.

Kevin

Your boy Gore is a nut.  How's everything going?  Looking forward to seeing 
you Gloria and Tommy over
Christmas.

Take Care,

Sounds great.  Let me know what your schedule is like.

Kevin

Please send me a few recommended B&Bs and restaurants.  Thanks for your help.

Kevin

My email at home is kruscitti@aol.com (I think).

Good to hear from you.  The name of the jeweler is William Crescent and his 
phone
number is (708) 418-5075.  He is located in Lansing IL and his address is 
18049 Torrence Ave
Lansing, IL  60438

Let him know I recommended him and if he doesn't remember me tell him I was 
referred
by Greg Penmann and Mike Curry.  They both bought their engagement rings from 
Bill.

He's a pretty cool guy so just tell him what your looking for in terms of 
cut, clarity, color,
and carat.  He'll receive a number of stones that fit your description and 
describe them
over the phone.  He should encourage you to shop his prices.  I found him to 
be very
competitive.  Let me know how it goes.

Are you available to meet next Tuesday afternoon around 4pm.  Let me know.

Kevin

Thanks.  Is there something I could do to facilitate the process.

KR

Any word.  I've been waiting for a while on this issue.

Kevin

Thanks for the update.  Let me know when everything is a go.

>15.  I can't think of any now but I'll try and let you know.

You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so 
poorly.  I often look back 
with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, 
not to mention
his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.  He could only be 
compared to x-Philly
and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.  The only uncertainty is whether or 
not Ivan will elect
to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.

On the house front,  we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May.  
It's a fixer-upper.
All our weekends are spent working on it.

I gotta run, but thanks for the email.  Let me know how everything is going 
in your world.  Tell
Rina and the kids we said hi.

Kevin 

I forgot, we have a new telephone # (713) 880-4157.  I'll pick you up on

you want to do in the Lone Star State.

Thanks for the picture.  I'm glad you guys like the gift.  Luke looks just 
like Rena, huh?

As far as Ricigs goes, I don't have his phone # or address.  I think Moller 
does though.
Let me know  if you need his #.  Take care and tell Rena and Luke we said hi.

Kevin

We will be in town.  It would be great to see you and Marie.  Sorry for the 
delayed response,
I seem to check my emails around once every 2 weeks.  I hope you could make 
it out.  I'll check 
into some things to do.

Let me know.

Kevin

We should be in town that week.  I'll make sure we save the date.

Kevin

Kelly,

I spoke with my friend and he mentioned that Michael was already talking to 2 
firms and he
didn't want to recommend a third at this time.  I told him that if anything 
changes, let me know.
It was worth a try anyway.  I'll talk to you soon.  

Kevin

That would be great.  Let me know so I could get tix to a ballgame if the 
Astros are in town that weekend.
I'm going to the game next Monday to see McGwire and the Cards.  Glad to hear 
everything's going well.

I got a call from Peremes on Saturday.  She heard I got engaged and was 
pissed I didn't tell her.  I think she's
smoking serious crack 'cause I told her when I talked to her about 6 mos. 
ago.  I guess she just chose to ignore
me as usual.

Talk to you soon.

KR

P.S.  We just closed on a house this past Friday.  It's in need of some 
serious work.  Hopefully it'll be
habitable by the time you see it. 

Chump,

Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you.  
Between work, the wedding,
and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been 
pretty stressed.
As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down 
considerably.  We're only going
to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that 
includes you of course, Moller,
Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her 
though, she's the only
one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to 
share a room.  I feel kinda bad
about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like 
dealing with Kim.  She's really 
annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.

We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a 
catered dinner for about 45 folks.
It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.

Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched 
you'll be a lot closer.  You
could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we 
should have it in decent shape.
We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs 
a lot of work.  We'll be busy for
the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.

Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when 
you'll be back.  Take care and
tell Marie we said hi.

Kevin

We'd love to go to the opener.  Let's talk Monday.  I don't know if I'll be 
able to get downstairs by 11:00am, so let's 
work something out.

Dave,

It was great getting a chance to finanlly meet the other night.  Hope you 
enjoyed dinner.

Since then, I've been thinking abt some of our conversation re: the PBR.  I 
have a quick
question - why wouldn't you under withdraw in Feb and over withdraw in Mar if 
Mar is currently
higher than Feb.  You could lock this in by buying Mar forward.  Also,  what 
happens if you
withdraw in Mar and the Summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at?  How 
is this accounted
for?

I'll talk to you after you get back from Houston.

Kevin

I hope that didn't surprise you.  You notice that our avg GMATs are stronger 
than Harvards.

Great to hear from you.  Things have been going well in Houston.  Lisa is 
working for Johnson Controls.
It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for 
about 5 months.  I love my
new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and 
Michigan.  Things have been 
incredibly busy.

The wedding plans have changed considerably.  As I'm sure you can relate to, 
the stress of planning 
combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a 
wedding with only our folks 
there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money 
toward a house and save
a lot of anger, frustration and stress.

How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?  Have you been to many Bears 
games?  The Scarlet Knights
have been so inconsistent this year.  I think a lot is due to their youth.

Let's talk soon.

Kevin

Anne Marie,

Unfortunately, it doesn't look like I'll be able to interview at UCLA on the

Dan,

Please take a look at the new Purchase agreement and let me know what you 
think.

Thanks,

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the upgrade to
the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the need to move
out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, besides this we
don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few hours on Sunday.

Let me know what you want to do.

KR

Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather spend the
time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend.  The only
problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire weekend.  Let
me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.

KR

You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't know 
why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never does.   My desk
seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've relied, more than
any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the business.  Probably
not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner sometime within the 
next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - we'll go get 
a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is into some
good red meat.

KR

Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think they are incable
of solving the problem.  

KR

Did you go to any parties last night??  I was lame, I didn't go to a single one.  I heard
there were some decent ones.  How's life at Duke been?  I haven't talked to you much
since you've become a big ICE trader.   Talk to you soon.

KR

Stamos,

I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to get 
crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that is in cash.
The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an increase in
plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates but there'll
be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've just seen the beginning.  
I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.

Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis is not a short term
problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that state's economy goodbye.
Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate prices in the country, and 
(2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst of a hi-tech meltdown, what would
keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  If you own any
CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to reduce demand or increase supply.
Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue likely won't be solved anytime
soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so high that
the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves by closing its plant, cutting
back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak hours.  California will see
this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so many businesses have
closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the blackouts will get much worse.
If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity and gas, I would bet it will go
bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national economy from the bankruptcy 
of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but I would keep my eyes on
the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care and thanks for the email.

Kevin 

That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be
bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I hope
Lowery has held off on buying his house.

Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.

KR

Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball game.
Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so you could take it with
a grain of salt.  

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

BL,

Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer.
What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or not?  I think
the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, but it'll be incredibly
difficult to avoid.

Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next time you'll
be in Dallas?  Let me know.

*** Springsteen visits Jersey Shore club

ASBURY PARK, N.J. (AP) - A legendary Jersey Shore rock club had a
special guest at its birthday party over the weekend: Bruce
Springsteen. The Boss made a surprise appearance Sunday night before
about 2,500 fans at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park. The show, which
marked the one-year anniversary of the club's reopening, featured
another shore favorite, Southside Johnny and Asbury Jukes, and
rocker Graham Parker. Springsteen showed up on stage at about 8:40
p.m. and performed with the band and Parker for about an hour. The
set featured several Springsteen songs and some Southside staples,
along with a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Born on the
Bayou."

I saw that, unbelievable huh?  The sad thing is that the folks I work with never heard of Jack Kerouac nor "On the Road".  
Probably not surprising considering most are from Texas.  How's everything going?  Did you get an opportunity to call
Kampy.  How's the job search progressing?

Before I forget, was there a guy in our MBA class named Chris Sevrson or something like that?  An email was forwarded
to me and that name was on the forward list and it sounded familiar.  

Any big plans for the weekend?  We're just hanging around Houston.  It seems every weekend for the past year+ we've
been doing some type of house work.  Hopefully one day it will slow.  Talk to you soon.

As I watched the Lakers pound that Texas  team?oh yeah, San Antonio, I was thinking about the guy Mr. Ruscitti refers to  as "my boy."  As I'm sure you were  both otherwise occupied, you probably missed my boy in action this  afternoon.  He was on what he  termed a "power walk (catchy, don't you think?)," going door to door with  power-saving light bulbs, which he was handing out free of charge to  "emphasize our need to conserve energy."   Boy, my boy is one powerhouse.   You think we could bottle what he's  got?

I need to hear the rest of the Red Neck weekend story.  Send me an email or give me a call.  Also do you have Lowery's and T.J.'s
email addresses.  They were deleted from my system when our email system was upgraded.

KR

In that case:
1. Guided tour of Enron Stadium
2. Chauffered transportation to/from Corpus Christi
3. A pound of fifties to spend over the weekend
 
I just checked w/ mapquest and they are estimating a whopping 6 hours for the drive!!!  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I seem to remember it taking about 3.5.
Lowery is doing some more training in San Marco, about 45 minutes north of San Antonio.  I imagine he was staying on the River Walk so he had something to do with Kim.  If he had any balls at all he'd stick around for the weekend.

the author of the email got fired shortly after it circulated through Wall St.  Anyway, thought you might find it amusing.  Start from

I think Enron is going to $10.  I've been quite concerned for
the last month+.  It looks like a number of the senior execs have
done some questionable acts.  It's been quite the moral buster.  They
need to clean shop and get rid of the CEO and entire board for
letting these types of actions occur.  We will never regain investor
confidence until this occurs.  

The problem with ENE is that we make an incredible amt of money on 
the wholesale side of the energy business (natural gas and power) but
we have thrown money at a myriad of bad businesses that lost lots of
money (Azurix water co., broadband, residential marketing.  They need
to get someone in here that will eliminate these losers and focus on
the core businesses.  In my opinion, some of these execs, former and current,
should go to jail.  It's amazing how a group of guys could ruin a great 
company.  I'm sure there will be a grad school case study and a book
written about this.  I'm sure it will be a best seller.

Anyway, let me get off my soapbox.  I'm glad to hear you got a new job.
That would be great if Chris gets the package and looks for something
more enjoyable.  Congrats to you brother and make sure you tell your
folks I was asking about them. 

Lisa and I haven't finalized any plans to NJ in Jan but I'll let you
know as soon as we do.  We're both looking forward to hooking up
with you guys.

Conway won't have to go overseas.  He said he's the last one they'll
activate.  His cell phone # is 240-298-7007.  I have to look for his 
email but i'll let you know when I find it.  

Take care and good to hear from you.

Good thing I took some of my Pru 401K $$ and bought Enron in February, when
I opened my roll-over IRA.

Besides the job how's everything else going with you and the lovely Lisa?

Things could not be more hectic over here. I'm switching jobs next month.
Gave the dot.com world a shot and timed it wrong. When the company you are
working for is borrowing $$ from the VC to meet payroll and has not locked
in the final round of funding, you know it is time to move along. Will be
joining a NY Real Estate Brokerage House, where I'm friend with the guys.
Will be helping them run their Corporate Service Group.

Lets see what else is going on.

Chrissy is trying to decide if she is going to volunteer for the Merrill
Lynch layoff package that is being offered. I want her to, because her boss
is making her life miserable.

My father had triple by-pass surgery last month. He is doing fine now and it
is probably for the better in the long run that he had the procedure done.

And on good note- My brother got engaged.

I lost Mr. Conway's tele # and email address, can you shoot it over to me.
Would like to drop him a message. Is he still State side? hopefully.

Remember to drop me a note when you finalize your visit back to NJ in
January, so we can hook up.

Tell Lisa and the family that we send our regards,

Jonathan R. Coun
Vice President, SPACEdirect Development
NetStruxr
212 399-4687
jcoun@netstruxr.com

I'm not going to be able to make it.  I talked to Lisa and we're heading
back to NJ for her friends wedding.  I'm hoping to make a trip to CA
sometime next year.  I hope you have a great time and tell Lulenski I
said hi.

Kevin

Kevin:

Do you know if you're coming out yet? Got e-mails from
Lulenski (he's coming) and Sarhatt (he's not). I'm
planning to go to the beer bust and picnic for sure
and probably the Saturday night event if enough of you
guys are interested. Let me know.

Regards,

Mike

Steve,

Not a lot.  Just working and watching my company's stock get the
shit kicked out of it.  

I did get married last year, but everything else has been pretty quiet.
How 'bout yourself.  What have you been up to?  Who have you kept in 
touch with?

Kevin

Sorry you can't make it.  We'll miss ya!

What have you been up to lately?

Steve,

Hope everything is going well.  Unfortunately I won't be able to attend
the reunion.  Hope you have a great time.  Talk to you soon.

I'd sell all of the ENE.

KR

Kev-

Sold some of the Ene stock. just saw a clip of moller (like 6 seconds). it 
was a collage of witnesses from the WTC blowup. It was on like the first day 
we got FOX NEWS on our cable. It was pretty shocking.

Take care,

KR

Great to hear from you.  Glad to know everyone's doing well.
Did you know Moller was going to be on TV or were you just channel
surfing?  How did he do?

Work's going OK.  ENE stock has been getting destroyed.  A lot
of negative press abt management.  I would sell your shares if
you still have them.  It's $30 right know but I have a feeling 
it's going lower.  Tell Dave also if you talk to him.  News has
been coming out that I wasn't aware of.

Anyway, Lisa's job is going great - she's really happy.  We haven't
been up to a lot lately - just hanging around the neighborhood.

The anthrax scares and the terrorist stories are really scary.  What
a bunch of nuts we have living in this world.  I have a feeling it
could get worse before it gets better.  Don't open any letters from
unknown companies or counterparties.  Take care of yourself and Gloria
and Tommy.  Tell them we said hi and we'll talk to you soon.

Kevin

Yo Kev,

What's happening? Hope everything is going okay. How is Lisa and the rest of 
the neighborhood?

It's starting to get cold here. The temperatures are in the high-40's.
Went to Notre Dame last week with dad. It was cool. The campus was 
beautiful; the ride wasn't that bad; and the people were REAL nice (how 
weird?!).

Anyway, dad had a good time, except I think he got pneumonia on the trip. 
"Mr. Sunshine" was dressed up in shorts and a golf shirt for a mid-October 
trip to Indiana. It was 75 degrees when we left Jersey and 45 degrees by the 
time we hit the Ohio border. He can't figure out how he got pneumonia (true 
story). Anyway, I saw him yesterday and he looks and sounds better.

Anyway, Gloria is busy coaching soccer. Her team is 9-4-1 (best record in 
school history). Tommy is busy causing havoc wherever he goes (Takes after 
mommy). His grandparents are driving mommy and daddy nuts (same ol' story).

I hope everything is going all right. Heard the big lobsterfest was a 
success (Nothing like a FRESH Maine lobster). Belated congrats on your first 
anniversary.

Is life pretty tense at Enron (with all the craziness of the world markets, 
terrorism scares and this Anthrax hysteria)? Do you have to go through a 
metal detector or anything like that?

Anyway, I saw Moeller was on TV. Never thought I'd be happy to see his ugly 
mug on the toob!

Well, I've got to go (I'm at work). Talk to you soon.

Love your brother,

PS. Mom and Dad are looking forward to THANKSGIVING with you and Lisa! (Some 
fun, eh?!)

Take care

Sounds good based on 1 condition.  You and ML do not pick up everyone's dinner.
We'll just go out to dinner and a show and we'll all split it.  Sounds like 
fun.  Good idea - must've been ML's.

KR

Gentlemen - I hope you all are doing well.  I wanted to follow up with guys
on supper club.  I believe it's our turn in the "rotation".  ML and I
thought it might be fun to change it up a bit and go some place like the
Mucky Duck where we could eat and watch a band or go somewhere like the
Laugh Stop for dinner and a comedy hour.  We will treat on the dinner and
first round of drinks.  I would say on all drinks but given Kevin's past
rampages with the bottles of wine I better not guarantee full payment of
that at a restaurant.  If that's a problem, I can always bring Kevin a small
flask and straw that he can have during the night. 

ML talked to Lisa and I talked to Dax and it sounds like Sunday, November
11th will be the only date that might work.  Follow back up with me and let
me know if that will work.  Take care and talk to you soon.  

We have a lot of things to do Saturday or else I would - believe me.  We'll have to get together the next time.
Let me know if I  can help any more with your search.

Kevin

C'mon you can play 18 then do housework all afternoon.  If you're just starting you don't get many invitations!  Truthfully, I'm usually napping after golf, you're always surprised how tired you get after 18 holes!

I've gotten some interest from various groups within EES, EGM and hopefully Industrial Markets, but it's tough.  Everybody is cautious, nobody's going gangbusters.  I've been pounding the pavement almost full time for 2 weeks.  Need to close something before heading back to Seoul.  I brought my family back to Houston and they're staying, but I'll head back to Seoul in a week or 2.

Jung

p.s.  thanks for your lead on Mike Curry, but he had just hired a manager so nothing for now.  

I'd like to but i'm tied up doing house stuff all day.  Have you found a group in Houston?
How's the search going?  Tell Matt I said hi.

It didn't down here b/c I watched it from 5:15 - 6pm unless it actually came
on 4pm down here with the time difference.  I bet that's what happened.

KR

Actually, it went on towards the end of the hour, about 5:45.  I can 
get you a copy.

<<< Memo from Kevin.Ruscitti@enron.com on 05 October, 2001, 09:07 
Friday >>>

Kevin.Ruscitti@enron.com on 5 Oct 2001, 09:07 Friday

You'll never believe it but I turned it on at 5:10 so I guess your
interview
was over.  If you have a copy, please send me a copy and I'll pay you
for it.
How's everything going?  Hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.

Kevin

What's Happenin'?  Did you catch the interview on Fox?  The babe who
interviewed me was sooooooooo hot that all I could think of was how
good she must taste.

I think the only difference btw the 330Ci and the 330i is that the Ci
is a 2 door.  

Had a choice btw Wed and Thur game - chose Wed.  Not that disappointed
though as the Astros proved to be the biggest bunch of pussies in the
ML.  They were more concerned with not giving up a homer to Bonds than
with winning the game.  Now they stand a chance of not making the playoffs
at all.  If you ask me they don't deserve it and the mgr should be fired.

It was great to hear the fans booing the home team every other inning.  I'm
sure they lost a lot of fans over those 2 games.

Anyway, what's up on your front.  Are you still going out to Cali to visit
Hop and Denise?  How's flying?

KR

Last night was the game to catch.  Where your seats near where the homer
dropped?

I think the 330 is the better call.  You really don't want a BMW as a family
car anyway until the kids are much older.  I don't know what the prices are
but the 330ic is pretty sweet.

Thanks for the advice.  Much appreciated.  We plan on test driving
this weekend.  The BMW has a racing track in the back of the dealership
-
I heard it's pretty sweet.  I have a feeling we're going to lean toward
the 330i just b/c everything I've read rates it the best in its class.
I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now (w/o kids) but
we should get a better feel this weekend.  I'll keep you informed.

Thanks again.

KR

Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you
will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).
Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you
drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end
power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of
the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a
bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank
(large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your
performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price
range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple
of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to
go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite
a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

What do you think about the 530?  Isn't it basically the same thing
as the 330 except it's bigger?  If so, does it handle as well with the
added size and weight?

Kev,

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.
Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.
I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

I was at the game last night sitting in home run territory - section
154.
It was one of the most disappointing games i've ever attended.  the
astros
don't even deserve to make the playoffs after their cowardly play.  the 
manager's an idiot - intentionally walking Bonds with guys on 1st and
2nd
with 2 outs.

Anyway, in terms of the Miata, the dealer recommended abt $1300 worth of
work.
Of course i told him to just get the thing running ($450).  The problem
is
the blue book value is only $2500 so i can't see putting another grand
into it.
I'll probably just sell it to someone who races miata's (which is really
big
in Texas) or donate it to charity and take the tax write off.

We haven't test driven anything yet but it looks like we're leaning
toward the
BMW 330i.  It seems to get great reviews, the main downside is that it's
a little
small - but still sporty.  We'll go for test drives this weekend and
should buy
or lease (still undecided) something in the next couple weeks.

How's everything on your front.  Less classroom time and more flying
time???

That faggot Lowery was in Austin this past weekend.  I don't expect him
to call
of course but it shows how easily he could've gotten to Houston while he
was 
working for 8 mos. in Dallas.

Some idiot lost a pair of pliers so I have to wait around to go fly.  I
guess it's just as well, I'd hate to find them at 3,000'.

Sorry to hear about the turbo Miata.  What happened to it?  Can't it be
fixed or are you just abandoning it?  Where are you leaning in terms of
a
new car?  On my end, the classic motorcycle is buzzing like  a champ and
a
complete blast to drive.

What's with the faggot Astro's walking your boy?  At least he pocketed
one
record.

I don't have TJ's email w/ me, but I'm sure he never expected you to
actually show up in the first place.

Conway,

Do you have T.J.'s new email address.  I want to let him know I
won't be out there in Oct.  Give me a shout.  How's everything going?

My miata broke down this past weekend.  I didn't think it would be
that soon.  It looks like I'm forced to buy a new car.  I'm not 
looking forward to the process although the internet should make
it less painful than it was 9.5 years ago.  Wow, I can't believe
I've owned the Miata for over 9 yrs.  

I'm going to see Bonds play on Wednesday night.  Hoping he'll be
going for the record that night (either a tie or to break it).  I
scored tix in section 154 - prime bonds territory.  Check out the
section on the Houston Astros website.

Talk to you soon.

You'll never believe it but I turned it on at 5:10 so I guess your interview
was over.  If you have a copy, please send me a copy and I'll pay you for it.
How's everything going?  Hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.

Kevin

What's Happenin'?  Did you catch the interview on Fox?  The babe who 
interviewed me was sooooooooo hot that all I could think of was how 
good she must taste.

Thanks for the advice.  Much appreciated.  We plan on test driving
this weekend.  The BMW has a racing track in the back of the dealership -
I heard it's pretty sweet.  I have a feeling we're going to lean toward
the 330i just b/c everything I've read rates it the best in its class.
I feel like the 5 series will be too big for us right now (w/o kids) but
we should get a better feel this weekend.  I'll keep you informed.

Thanks again.

KR

Drive 'em both, but at least for the older one's the 8 cyl was MUCH
smoother.  It really comes down to what you want.   Unless you're really
pushing it you won't notice much of a difference.  However, what you will
notice is that the 6cyl will be working a lot harder (i.e. louder).  Once
you jump into the 5 you're in the luxury market and you probably want a
smoother car with plenty of torque (8 cyl).  Especially the way you drive
(not winding the engine out in every gear) you'll feel more low end power in
the 540.  Again, it comes down to the pax.  If you're hauling 2 most of the
time, the 530 is probably fine;. hauling 4 it will be sucking wind a bit.
Remember when you're on a test drive the car isn't configured the way it
will be in real life.  The tires will be under inflated, the gas tank (large
in that car, like 14 gal ~90 pounds) and no passengers so your performance
will seem better.  My best advice when looking at cars in that price range
is to insist on an extended (overnight or over a weekend) test drive of
both.  You don't want to buy and wish you had bought the other a couple of
weeks later.  Finally, think about long term (kids, etc) if you plan on
hanging onto it as long as the Miata.  It's not uncommon for a bimmer to go
2-300,000 miles without engine work so you can hang onto them for quite a
while if you stay up on the maintenance.  Give me a buzz at home
(301.737.5366) tonight if you want to yap about it.

What do you think about the 530?  Isn't it basically the same thing
as the 330 except it's bigger?  If so, does it handle as well with the
added size and weight?

Kev,

Real quick on the cars.  The beamer is real tight in the back seat.
Think
about how often you might be hauling 3-4 people.  If you think it's a
factor, spend some time on an extended test drive sitting in the back.
I'd
still look at the Vovlvo S-60 twin turbo, it might surprise you.

Kamp,

Did you watch the Astros / Giants game last night.  It was embarrassing.  I've never
seen such a cowardly performance by a baseball team (of course I'm talking abt the
Astros).  When do you ever walk a guy with runners on 1st and 2nd, your team is 
down by 1 run and there is 2 outs?  Answer:  NEVER.  According to Dierker,
"... the critical walk was the one with runners on first and second," Dierker said. "We did that because Jeff Kent was 3-for-17 against Williams and had struck out the last five at-bats (against him), so he showed some dominance against him. Obviously, you don't want to put another runner on base and move the runners another base in scoring position unless you have a very compelling reason, and we did.

How's long's this clown been managing.  I guess he hasn't followed Kent the last few years.  It wasn't like he was walking Bonds to get to 
Ivan DeJesus.  He doesn't even have the sack to admit he fucked up.  I've never seen fans boo their home team so much since the days of Michael Jack.

Have you and Patty been getting any sleep? How's Jack?

How 'bout that Barry Bonds?  You must be in heaven - (1) baby boy,
(2) Yanks win the division, (3) Bonds goes for record.

I think Bonds is going to break the record Wednesday night in Houston.
Guess who'll be sitting in section 154 (check it out on the Astros

AP Camden,NJ: A terrorist cell has been broken up in Camden just east of
Philadelphia. Four of the members have been apprehended by the Camden
Police, with the fifth still at large. Arrested in the Camden sweep were
Bin Eatin, Bin Smokin, Bin Sleepin and Bin Drinkin. All are being held on
illegal immigration
charges. Police stated that they can find no one fitting the description of
the fifth cell member, Bin Workin, in the area. But Camden Police are
confident that anyone who resembles Bin Workin would be easy to spot in
Camden.

Let me tell you who won't win - RU.  They are arguably the worst
division 1 football team I've ever seen.  I saw them for the 1st time
this weekend on TV.  They are horrible.  Hope everything's going well.
Life at Enron sucks.  I'm sure you've been following the situation.
I'm sure there'll be a #1 bestseller written about this circus.  Talk

Kevin,

This has to be one of the *ugly* games of the year.  The only saving
grace (and it isn't much of one either) is that the winner gets to say
they won their last game.  For Cal, that would be their only win.  I'm
going to be in OC at my in-laws, and I'm going to try to get an Internet
broadcast.

If Rutgers wins, I'll buy you a drink the next time I see you (actually
I'll buy you a drink regardless).  

Hi to Lisa - hope you guys have a Happy Thanksgiving.

Morris--Thanks for your previous information where you said, from a tax 
standpoint, that EPMI could buy and sell power in Canada as long as the 
trading was done in Houston (or Portland).  Can the EPMI traders physically 
meet in Canada with Canadian counterparties, as long as the agreement is 
executed by EPMI in the US?

Morris/Elizabeth/Jeff -- Tom May, our new NY trader, wants to wheel power 
to/from NEPOOL or NY through Hydro Quebec Power and New Brunswick Power.  
Rhonda and I will take care of the EPMI wheeling agreements on HQ and New 
Brunswick.  Who can make sure that EPMI has the necessary export permits to 
take power out of Canada (DOE or NEB)?  Thanks.

The latest version of the EEI-NEM Master Contract now can be downloaded from 
EEI's website at  http://www.eei.org/issues/contract/.  We only ask that a 
short registration form be filled out first so that we can better serve the 
community interested in using the contract.  We are making the contract 
freely available, multiple copies may be made, our only restriction is that 
the contract not be resold.  We also request that attribution to EEI and NEM 
be given in all copies of the contract.

Our intention is to use the EEI website and listserver as tools to help 
promote dissemination and use of the contract.  For instance, we could make a 
listing of companies using the contract on the website.  Also, we are 
considering posting on a periodic basis responses to requests for 
clarification or interpretation of the contract terms that would be of 
interest to the user community.  Please let me know if there are other 
enhancements that you would find helpful

All:

I received an RFP from Northeast Utilities for sale of peaking plant 
entitlements to which I would like to respond (respose due Fri 5/12).  A 
requirement for any transaction coming out of this process is that the 
winning buyer must be signed on to NU's Tariff 7 (mkt based rate tariff).  Do 
any of you know whether or not we are already signed on to this?  If not, 
would one of you be able to review this tariff (attached) to see if there are 
any problems with it?  Thanks.

John

She'll love it!
Talk to you soon.
Have a great weekend.

Hi Brent 

Hope all is well.

I received your email.  In the US we do physical power puts and calls,  
usually on a daily, weekly or monthly basis (e.g several month deal that 
gives party right to receive/sell energy on a daily basis).  The confirmation 
for them is very simple, and generally assumes an underlying master that 
would govern the physical delivery if the option is exercised as well as all 
the other general terms and conditions.  
By copy of this email, I would ask Leslie Hansen to send you copies of a put 
and call confirmation which she can get from our documentation group.

Looking forward to seeing you soon back in Houston

(Thanks Leslie)

I received a call from your attorney a few days ago; she was  inquiring
about the status of the draft of the power sales agreement.  .  I misplaced
her number; therefore I did not get back to her.  Please apologize to her
for me.  We have not spent much time with your draft because we feel our
positions are so far apart that  NES's time was better spent working with
those suppliers that understood the program and were comfortable with the
program.  We have one contract signed and are negotiating with two other
suppliers.  Is there any point to sending ENRON a copy of the agreement NES
is will to sign or has ENRON decided it has very little interest in the
program as it is structured?

I don't see anything glaringly wrong in these, but I am not a corporate 
lawyer.  It seems to have section balanced voting at the committee level 
(except that each member gets one vote at the "parent" level, section 6.5 -- 
how is balanced voting assurred there?)  Also, it takes one year to withdraw 
(section 5.7)  It seems like the timing should be shorter, perhaps, 6 
months.  ,I assume that MAPP and MAIN have hired corporate counsel to draft 
these, but JOE do we need to have one of the Enron corporate lawyers look at 
these?

	Larry Soderquist
	05/17/2000 09:42 AM
		 
Elizabeth, we discussed this matter intenally yesterday, witht he following 
conclusions:

We want to be able to apply Gleason Network credits to all transmission costs 
(from all  TVA-related control areas)
We want to be able to go negative on application of the credits - when 
network upgrade invoices to Gleason have not  yet caught up to transmission 
credit requests from all of the control areas.
We do not want to make a monthly declaration of transmission requirements.  
We need to agree with TVA on a process to keep track  of the credit usage and 
balance.

We would like to go over them with you in our 2:30 pm meeting today - at the 
controol room conference table.  

Larry.

Larry:

Please make sure folks are up to speed on this. In any current month, the 
amount of the transmission credit is equal to the then current amount of 
capital costs paid by Gleason to TVA for the Shleby upgrade, less any 
transmission credits previously used. I think the way to go is first to see 
if we can use the credits to offset transmission charges from our other TVA 
plants (on this point, TVA said no, but since Luke is out of the picture, we 
should make another run at this). If that does not fly, (that is, if the 
amount of credits we can use in any month is limited to the transmission 
charges otherwise due from Gleason on the power it generates), we obviously 
want to make sure we designate a credit amount equal to only as much as we 
actually need. 

Given that I believe we are the first IPP to be in this situation with TVA, 
and given that TVA is to repay us in 2009 for the actual cost of the Shelby 
upgrade less transmission credits actually used, we also need to make sure we 
are accurately tracking both upgrade costs and transmission credits used, and 
that TVA agrees with what we believe to be the correct balance. Jody Pierce 
and Amy Copeland are aware of this, but I caution that we need to be 
extremely careful given the amount of money involved. Toward this end, I have 
asked Jody and Amy to make sure each TVA Shelby upgrade invoice is adequately 
labelled as such by TVA before we make payments. I strongly suggest we put in 
place a similar system for transmission credits whereby we receive TVA 
signoff as part of the process Dennis To references below.

Please follow up with Jody, Amy, and Lloyd to make sure everyone is up to 
speed on this as we proceed, and please make sure that an adequate process is 
set up to account for transmission charges, credits, and balance of Shelby 
upgrade costs.

Thanks much,

Ben

 Hi John

Just wanted to let you know that we still have not heard from TVA, re dual 
interconnect with Southern. In the next week or so we will give them a call.  
On the Gleason facility, TVA has been relatively helpful and has agreed to 
let us go "commercial" sooner than they otherwise would be required to.  
Maybe this is a thawing of relations.  Just dreaming.

The June 1 issue of PUF contains an article about the Master Contract.  The 
reporter interviewed me and Richard McMahon, another EEI staffer, after our 
NY workshop.  The reporter promised that I would see the article before 
publication.  This never occured.  Had I had seen it I would have tried to 
correct several errors.   At the outset, I want to apologize for the 
mischarcterization of me and Richard McMahon as "architects" of the 
contract.   The true architects are the many industry representatives who 
devoted their time, energy, and company resources to participating in the 
year and a half drafting process.  EEI's role was only as a facilitator; 
hosting meetings; disseminating information, and sponsoring our series of 
contract workshops.

Elizabeth --  As discussed, attached are (1) a copy of the format of letter 
"LG&E4" you sent w/ Fallon's signature, from your 1999/letters directory, and 
(2) also a format of letter "LG&E6" I used when they had switched the format 
of their agency to be more palatable.

Sound the Alarm
Economist James Stiglitz rips Washington's "market Bolsheviks"

By James North

When the Asian economic crisis started to bite deeply, during the second half
of 1997, Joseph Stiglitz recalls that his children were studying the
Holocaust. Each day, he went off to his job as chief economist and No. 3 man
at the World Bank, where he and his colleagues had come up with a consensus
of how to contain the spreading crisis. Each day, he got increasingly
frustrated as the bank's proposals were overruled by its sister organization,
the International Monetary Fund, influenced strongly by what Stiglitz calls
the IMF's "largest shareholder," the U.S. Treasury Department.

Especially frightening to Stiglitz was the IMF's rescue plan for Indonesia,
East Asia's most populous country after China. The fund directed the
Indonesian government to cut social spending and raise interest rates,
policies designed to draw panicked overseas investors back into the country.
But Stiglitz argued that sudden cuts, particularly in food and kerosene
subsidies, could trigger social unrest in the fragile island nation, and that
the violence might take an ugly ethnic turn. The Chinese minority there had
already started to worry.

"My kids were writing school papers about people who remained silent during
the Holocaust in Europe," Stiglitz remembered recently. "So you ask yourself
the question: 'Do you remain silent and play the system, or do you speak
out?' Why have a job with responsibility if you don't speak out?"

The IMF imposed its plan, and just as Stiglitz and the World Bank had
predicted, ethnic conflict swept across Indonesia, leaving hundreds dead.

By then, however, the economist was speaking out on Indonesia and other
international economic matters -- an action that earned him the enmity of
Lawrence Summers, now Secretary of the Treasury, then in a lesser role at the
agency, and other officials at the Treasury and the IMF. Their hostility, he
asserts, led to his departure from the World Bank earlier this year.

Today, from the outside, Stiglitz is increasing his criticism of the U.S.
Treasury/IMF policy toward Asia, Latin America and Russia, which is still
fundamentally unchanged despite the great scare of 1997-98. Stiglitz himself
may not join the expected protests this week in Washington at the IMF/World
Bank annual meetings. But the intellectual rigor and creativity that has put
him on just about everyone's short list for the Nobel Prize in Economics will
provide powerful support for the critics.

The Malcontent

When Stiglitz left the World Bank, press accounts described him as "a
malcontent," "a great nuisance" and "a scourge of the Washington
establishment." In person, however, he seems pleasant and enthusiastic, not
sour or contentious. Even when asked about his No. 1 opponent, Lawrence
Summers, he was never hostile, maintaining a kind of bemused detachment about
the Treasury Secretary; he chuckled when he recollected how Summers "went
ballistic" after one of his critical speeches.

Joseph Stiglitz's disagreements with the so-called Washington Consensus are
intellectual and not personal. He recognizes that he leans to the liberal
side of the spectrum, but he also insists that his views are not based on
sentiment, but on what he calls "good economic science."

Stiglitz: "Do you remain silent and play the system, or do you speak out?"
Take, for instance, the World Bank's response as the Asian crisis unfolded.
After Thailand's devaluation in July 1997, the Bank started to get data
showing that the country's financial crisis was triggering a depression -- a
severe downturn that would soon spread to Indonesia, South Korea and Hong
Kong. To Stiglitz, who had earlier been chairman of President Clinton's
Council of Economic Advisers, the pattern looked familiar. "I was approaching
it much as I would if I were advising the President of the United States,
recommending stimulatory policies to counter the decline," he remembers.

Instead, the Treasury/IMF in tandem overruled the Bank and did the precise
opposite, directing the beleaguered Asian countries, as a condition for
getting the bailout emergency loans, to raise interest rates and to reduce
government spending, including the all-important food and fuel subsidies.

Today, Stiglitz still cannot hide his astonishment at these contractionary
policies. The Washington Consensus argued that the measures were necessary to
restore overseas investor confidence, stabilize falling exchange rates and
attract capital back into the afflicted countries. But he points out that
their economic models were far too narrow, and therefore doomed to fail.

For example, the Treasury/IMF strategy ignored the potential for
bankruptcies. The sky-high interest rates forced even sound companies in
Thailand and Indonesia to the wall, which wasn't the best way to re-inspire
foreign investors. At the same time, the sharp cuts in government spending
stimulated violence across Indonesia, which did not build confidence
overseas, either.

Stiglitz insists that "these political and social concerns are not outside
the economic model." He knew that over the years, unrest had been frequent in
the developing world following the imposition of austerity plans. Indeed,
austerity-inspired uprisings are routinely called "IMF riots." But when he
raised his doubts, within channels, he says, "It was like hitting your head
against the wall."

Stiglitz has other pungent criticisms of the Washington Consensus:

He questions the Treasury/IMF insistence that emerging nations end
restrictions on capital flows. He points out that vulnerability to hot money
can worsen crises, emphasizing that some countries, such as China, have
achieved significant rates of growth without making their currencies fully
convertible.

He continues to criticize Western policy toward Russia. He argues that the
crash privatization program, in a country with no working democratic, legal
or financial regulatory system, created a corrupt new oligarchy that blocks
economic growth. He is particularly biting about the IMF's 1998 Russian
bailout. "Was this a good investment?" he asks. "You put in $6 billion ...
that enables the oligarchs to take out $6 billion in capital flight the next
day. Clearly the country is worse off, and everybody knew it was going to
happen."

He has strong objections to the IMF's policy of "conditionality" -- of making
loans to countries contingent on far-reaching internal changes. "Of course,
any lender will need evidence the loan can be repaid," he recognizes. "But
the conditionalities the IMF imposes have gone well beyond anything required
for repayment."

Now that Stiglitz is outside the system, he's expanding his critique. He will
divide his time between the Brookings Institution in Washington, teaching at
Stanford and working on a book about his experiences on the inside.

Not surprisingly, he comes down hardest on the U.S. Treasury/IMF
policymakers. They embody what Stiglitz calls "the theory of escalating
commitment." By that he means, "The cost of continuing mistakes is borne by
others, while the cost of admitting mistakes is borne by yourself."

Finally, he asserts, Treasury/IMF bureaucrats are following the dictates of
an ideology, not testing economic models in a scientific way.

Stiglitz uses the term "market Bolsheviks" to describe the advisers who
helped bring Russia to its economic knees in the 1990s -- people who believed
fervently in a rigid fundamentalist doctrine and tried to force an entire
society to conform to it, just as their central planning predecessors had
done back in Lenin's day.

The economist savors one final irony. IMF policy makers never apply their
anti-state orthodoxy to their own organization. "Intellectual consistency,"
he says, "should lead them to ask themselves, 'If we believe that government
bureaucrats are always incompetent, then why are we an exception?

He points out that the spread of democracy, accountability, good governance
and transparency are applauded around the world, at least in theory, and
asks: "Is it right for an international organization to be the instrument of
political change? Those of us who are committed to democracy are very
uncomfortable with a bunch of international bureaucrats playing the role of
God. Sometimes, they may play the role in the right way, but they can also
overturn democratically elected governments."

In a sense, Joseph Stiglitz resembles another economist, who worked for the
British Treasury and attended the 1919 Versailles peace negotiations after
the First World War. John Maynard Keynes was so disturbed at what he saw
there that he resigned his post and wrote The Economic Consequences of the
Peace, an impassioned polemic that eerily predicted that the harsh and
punitive economic settlement the Allies had imposed on Germany would create
terrible unrest and "sow the decay of the whole civilized life of Europe."

"What was great about Keynes was the combination of someone who used analytic
powers but who didn't distance himself from the human cost," Stiglitz
observes. "During the Vietnam War, we tried to distance ourselves by talking
about body counts. In economics, we talk about unemployment rates, so we
don't see the people. The challenge is, how do you remain analytically
honest, but not lose the human dimension?"

Enron Plugs On in Poland

Power Market's Vast Potential Holds Allure, But an Uncertain Future
---
After Six Years, Profit From Company's Power Operations Remains Years
Away
By Elizabeth Williamson

  NOWA SARZYNA, Poland -- From a small power plant humming among the
birches near the Ukrainian border, Enron Corp. has staked its claim on
the Polish energy market.

   Yet after six years, the company is still seeking a mother lode.
   The Houston-based energy producer and trader entered Poland in 1994,
nabbed one of the first power-trading licenses to go to a foreign
company and began work on Elektrocieplownie Nowa Sarzyna, Poland's first
new, foreign-operated heat-and-power plant.

   Other companies followed, including Electricite de France, RWE AG of
Germany, Vattenfall AB of Sweden and Tractebel SA of Belgium.

   The prize could be a rich one. All of these companies hope to profit
as Poland sells its state energy assets and frees prices before joining
the European Union.

   A wholesale power bourse is due to open in Warsaw in July. And the
country's transmission links to markets East and West could make Poland
the power-trading hub of Central Europe.

   But after six years in Poland, Enron has yet to earn a profit. Net
income from Nowa Sarzyna, which is to begin commercial production later
this month, is at least five years away. Power-trading operations might
generate profits next year, if the new bourse gets moving. But that is
"one big question mark," says Jarek Astramowicz, Enron Poland's
president.

   Indeed, despite its promise, Poland's energy sector remains a
sizzling tangle of aging plants, archaic market agreements and complex,
shifting regulations.

   Enron, with $40 billion (41.69 billion euros) in annual revenue, is
an innovator and an investment bellwether for its peers. But in a power
market as negatively charged as Poland's, the company also is an example
of how shaky market conditions can keep even the savviest competitors
offline.

   "These are very large operations and to some extent they can bear
some risks," says Pawel Kaminski, energy-sector operations officer at
the World Bank in Warsaw. "But eventually they have to generate some
return."

   Enron pioneered wholesale gas and electricity trading in the U.S. It
entered Europe in 1989, setting up in London as the U.K.'s energy sector
liberalized. It entered the Nordic market in 1996, and today is the Nord
Pool's largest-volume trader.

   Enron says it takes about two years to find a site and obtain permits
for a power plant, and a further 29 months for construction.

   Just four years after entering the U.K., Enron finished its
1,875-megawatt Teesside plant. Teesside's capacity and cost, at GBP 795
million (1.32 billion euros), are many times larger than Nowa Sarzyna's.
Yet Teesside was completed in only two-thirds the time. The company
declines to compare development times in various countries.

   "I wouldn't necessarily put Poland into the same category as Russia,"
says Philip Davies, regulatory and government-affairs manager at Enron
Europe in London. "But obviously, given Poland's (planned economy) past,
it probably takes a bit longer to work through the regulatory process
and get to the starting point."

   At Nowa Sarzyna, it took Enron nearly twice the usual time to reach
the starting point, even though Mr. Astramowicz already knew the site,
and the Polish power industry's rules.

   The Nowa Sarzyna plant was Mr. Astramowicz's brainchild, and he
burned out the engine in his first BMW as he traveled between Warsaw and
the town to craft the deal. A freelance energy-sector entrepreneur
before joining Enron, Mr. Astramowicz sold his interest in Nowa Sarzyna
to Enron in 1998.

   Enron has spent $132 million to build Nowa Sarzyna, a 116-megawatt,
gas-fired combined heat-and-power plant. Quiet, clean and efficient, the
plant stands in stark contrast to most of Poland's belching, coal-fired
behemoths. When it starts up this month, it will sell its electricity to
the Polish Power Grid, the country's high-voltage network, under a
20-year power-purchase agreement, or PPA, that Enron won in 1997. Steam
output goes to Organika, the chemical company next door, and helps heat
the town of Nowa Sarzyna.

   The Nowa Sarzyna plant is more than 80% financed by commercial-bank
loans for which the only collateral is the plant's concluded contracts.

   "They were betting on their good name," says Michael Davies, a
partner with Allen & Overy, the Warsaw law firm that advised Enron
Poland's lenders. "They are pushing envelopes all the time."

   That is especially true in a market with 30% overcapacity, where an
energy law didn't even exist until 1997.

   Says Peter Bisztyga, emerging Europe utilities analyst at Solomon
Smith Barney in London: "Because Enron signed a PPA, they are OK . . .
(but) I'm really not sure building Nowa Sarzyna was such a good idea."

   Mr. Bisztyga says Enron could have generated a faster return by
renovating an existing power plant. But, he acknowledges, Nowa Sarzyna
"allowed Enron to get into the Polish market early and stamp their name
on it."

   In 1994, Polish power plants weren't for sale. Energy asset
privatization, discussed for years, began in earnest only this year. By
2002, the Polish government proposes to sell off stakes in dozens of
power plants, 33 distribution companies and the Polish Power Grid, a
12,000-kilometer national transmission network of high-voltage lines.
The assets have a total book value of 33 billion zlotys (8.4 billion
euros), but murky regulations have driven prices down.

   "The regulations don't promote competition and so you don't really
know the price of electricity," says Bengt Wegemo, president of
Vattenfall Poland. Earlier this year, Vattenfall paid $235 million for
55% in Warsaw-based Elektrocieplownie Warszawskie, promising $340
million in investment in the heat-and-power plant over the next 10
years.

   Investors hope the new power market will bring clarity over pricing.
Ultimately, 170 licensed energy traders and 200 large power users will
trade on the bourse, setting the wholesale price of electricity. The
Polish bourse will be modeled on its Nordic counterpart. Enron, the Nord
Pool's largest trader, hopes to post Polish trading profits by 2001.

   But first, say market experts, Poland's 1997 energy law must be
amended to ease functioning of the bourse, and free up access to
Poland's distribution network.

   Further, the government says it must solve the competition problem
posed by the Polish Power Grid's power-purchase agreements, which
account for 70% of energy sales in Poland. Some state-owned plants used
the agreements as collateral to secure modernization financing. When
prices are freed, these plants might go bankrupt if forced to compete
with plants that didn't spend money to modernize.

   The government is contemplating a special fund to compensate the
modernized plants for their extra costs. Though Nowa Sarzyna is a
private plant, the price Enron must charge for its power is about twice
what outmoded plants charge.

   "We are hoping that continuous, efficient operation of the plant will
generate us a (bigger) profit," Mr. Astramowicz says.

   Another problem is cross-border power trading, where contradictory
legislation essentially gives a monopoly to the Polish Power Grid, also
known as PSE. Enron and others protest that PSE shouldn't compete with
electricity-market participants who contract with it for transmission
service.

   PSE intends to stay in the trading business, says Marek Zerka, PSE's
vice president. In late March, PSE and local company Kulczyk Holding
signed an agreement with PreussenElektra AG of Germany to export
electricity and coal to EU countries via Germany.

   "This is great news," Mr. Astramowicz says. "If this joint venture
gets access to PSE's cross-border transmission capacity . . . I would
expect PSE to confirm open access to all market participants."

   Enron and others are pushing hard for that access. "As soon as the
market becomes open, free and non-discriminatory, we will come out at a
decent profit," Mr. Astramowicz says.

Dear Mr. McSherry:

I   am   responding  to  your  search  for  credit  risk  professionals  on  
the
enroncredit.com   website.   After  working  for  seven  years  on  credit  
risk
management  in  a  research and consulting capacity, I would like to transfer 
my
experience  in  assessing  credit  risk  modeling,  information  technology  
and
methodology  in  complex  top-tier  institutions  to  an  active  credit 
trading
managerial   environment.   I  am  excited  about  being  involved  in  
trading,
origination, risk management and R&D of credit derivatives.

I  have  seven years of experience in credit risk measurement and 
management.  I
have  helped  design,  test  and implement credit value-at-risk systems with 
KMV
Corp  and  with  a  major  Japanese  bank.   I was a major contributor at KMV 
in
designing the Expected Default Frequency model and I am thoroughly familiar 
with
its  assumptions,  strengths,  weaknesses and applications.  I did the 
empirical
research  that  lies  behind the KMV default correlation model, the private 
firm
EDF  model  and  I interfaced with J.P. Morgan (now R.M.G.) personnel during 
the
creation of the CreditMetrics documentation.

I  have  excellent analytical, quantitative, statistical and programming 
skills.
I studied finance extensively when I was a graduate student and I studied 
credit
risk theory while I worked with KMV and Arthur Andersen.  I am eager to join 
the
credit derivative team at Enroncredit.com where I am certain that my 
combination
of   quantitative   research  skills,  credit  risk  consulting  experience  
and
technology   expertise   make  me  uniquely  qualified  to  support  the  
credit
derivatives trading and risk management function.

I  have  included  my  resume  with this e-mail.  Please e-mail me or call me 
at
201-420-0191  (home)  and  212-708-4027  (work)  so  that  we  can  discuss 
this
opportunity further.

Frank,

We shall be glad to meet you in Houston. I am sure that we can find many=20

topics to discuss

We can pay for your trip to Houston. I shall call you next week to discuss=
=20
the details.

Vince

Dear Vince,

I very much enjoyed speaking with you at lunch, if only briefly, at the
=01&Finance Festival.=018  We
have more common interests than I realized at first, as I am interested
not only in weather
derivatives, but also in the financial econometrics of risk management,
broadly defined.  And
moreover, business interests have recently led me to focus on electronic

trading and brokerage
issues.  A quick check of my web page will give you a good idea of the
range of my interests; see
http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~fdiebold.

The upshot:  It seems to me that we would both benefit from a more
extensive conversation.  I
would be happy to visit you in Houston to learn more about your
operations, and to tell you more
about mine.  Please do let me know if you are interested.

Best regards,

Frank Diebold

Hello Vince!

I'm working with Michael Sergeev to produce this next issue of the 
newsletter.  Do you have a suggestion for the Kaminski Column on Page One?  
If so, please tell me what you'd like to use and I'll get it ready either 
today or Monday morning.

At some point, when you have a couple of minutes, we should sit down and talk 
about your philosophy regarding the newsletter and what you would like to see 
in the future.  I'd like to get a little creative with it once I know your 
thoughts on this.

Best Regards,

Sam

Scott,

I spoke briefly with Edith Terry from our DC office. There is not a good fit 
for my group
but she could be a great asset for you.

I have her resume in case you are hiring and  would like to take a look at 
her.

Vince

Paula,

Works for me. Maybe we should go out and explore some other options
in the Montrose/Heights area.

Vince

We are lo-o-o-o-ng overdue for a meeting of the round table and it is time to 
work this into our schedules.

Please respond and let me know if Thursday, April 27th will work for 
everyone. I think LaGriglia would be a good place but am open to any and all 
suggestions. 

Thank you

Paula

Harry,

In case you are looking for a secretary, here is one candidate.

Vince - Please ask your associate to contact Laura Valencia in my group - she 
can give you the recent 1Q anaylst slides and the Enron.com year end 
presentation on the web (these two should give you enough for a "basic" ENE 
pitch.  Mark

Mark,

I want to ask you for a favor.

One of my associates, Stinson Gibner, is making a presentation to the MBA 
students at
Texas A&M University next week.

Do you have a Power Point general presentation about Enron, emphasizing our 
growth,
creativity and employment opportunities? We could use it for presentations
we make on campuses to business and science students. There are many 
presentations available on our Intranet site, but the are outdated.

It was nice meeting you in San Antonio.

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE
Today's Focus: Instant messaging
04/13/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: Instant messaging
While NetWare has had instant messaging capabilities built in for more
than 10 years, it has never gotten much beyond the basic product first
introduced with NetWare 2.

The product allows a limited message (less than 250 characters) to be
sent from one logged-in user to another on the network, or to a group
of users.

Now, Novell has joined forces with AOL to produce InstantMe - an
instant messaging client for enterprises based on AOL's phenomenally
successful AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) client.

InstantMe uses the Novell Directory Services eDirectory to store
contact information accessed from anywhere on the 'Net with Novell's
DigitalMe identity services platform. With roaming capabilities and
real-time access to contact information, DigitalMe lets users respond
quickly, no matter where they are or what station they're working from.

InstantMe lets users communicate in real-time conversations with
partners, suppliers and clients. It also lets users have conversations
with any other AIM user worldwide (provided both users are logged in to
the service). It also will, I'm sure, lead to more involved discussions
of where to do lunch, rehashes of Sunday's football game and other
so-called "water cooler" chatting, all from the privacy of the user's
desktop. That may or may not be a problem - you will want to formulate
some usage rules before implementing the technology.

Novell plans to release a secure version of InstantMe in the next few
months, which will integrate encryption and digital certificates in a
move to increase trust between two or more parties and ensure integrity
and confidentiality of messages exchanged over the Internet.

Instant messaging should provide a much-needed medium for quick,
perishable communications, such as those requesting time-sensitive
coordination or short-fuse decisions. It's best used where e-mail
would be considered too slow to get the needed response. Generally,
you'd use instant messaging in a situation where today you would use
the telephone. Instant messaging can be even faster than using the
phone when you consider time spent on hold or navigating through
receptionists and secretaries, and it's cheaper than a long-distance
call. Those are competitive advantages, and you should examine this new
technology thoroughly before deciding if it is, or isn't, for you.

InstantMe is a free download that supports Windows 95, Windows 98,
Windows NT and Windows 2000.

Microsoft
The Business Value of Certified Applications

For a technology to have maximum value, it must deliver core benefits
to IT and to the organization. Simply put, these core benefits must
make life better and the job easier for IT while lowering the
technology's total cost of ownership (TCO) for the company.

The process of Windows 2000 Certification can help meet both of these
demands. This paper looks at the value and procedures involved of
Windows 2000 certification. It explains the process of certification
and also presents case studies of seven different companies who are
seeking or have received Windows 2000 certification.

Dear Professor Kaminski

    I , Masayuki Fujita was the only Japanese attendee of the Energy 
Derivatives seminar
in Houston last December and a member of Japanese consultation firm: 
Mitsubishi Research
Institute, Inc. I would be very honored if you can meet with me 17 or 18 
April after
attending Energy Trading Summit in 12th-14th. As you know, Japanese 
electricity trading is
on the way of deregulation beneficial to the consumers from a long stage of 
the nine major
companies' regional monopoly. We are giving a hand to help the Ministry and 
industry to
find the right course of them. I and my colleague Yamada, who will attend Risk
Publications Monte Calro seminar in Four Seasons Hotel, would like to visit 
you and your
company for studying the sophisticated risk management at Enron. In return, 
we may give
you the information about recent institutional progress and major electricity 
companies
response in Japan.

    We are now personally translating your book "Managing Energy Price Risk" 
second
edition and wondering if you have not given the right to publish in Japanese 
and nay give
us the chance to help you introduce modern technology to manage energy risk 
in the
Japanese energy industry.

    I do not hope Japanese English power prevent me to pass my sincerity to 
you and I can
visit you soon.

Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the 
camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the 
fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff 
Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.

Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 
350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the 
Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am 
challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain 
amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a 
break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's 
closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat 
pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge 
to this very worthy cause 1-1.

I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top 
money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your 
consideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.

Vince:

Thanks very much for your interest in our MarketPoint product, and thanks
for the hour you gave me this morning.  As promised, I am enclosing our
executive summary and first chapter from our business plan for you to take
forward to your management as a prospective Enron-MarketPoint investment
collaboration.  I want to reiterate that should Enron elect to be the lead
investor here, you will be exclusive in your industry if you want.  If Enron
wants to be the lead and ensure the entire second round of resources we
need, we would not offer and investment opportunity to other trading
companies, pipelines, or electrics until the third or subsequent rounds and
then only with your participation as a MarketPoint board member.  I am aware
you have coinvested with SAP in the past and that you might want to coinvest
with them again.  I presume you would not have a problem with
non-competitors such as EPRI, our management consulting service provider
partner, or our VC partner (but I would want guidance from you in this
arena).  I think you would find our VC partner very suitable and very
attractive.  They have done several interesting energy and trading plays,
and they would provide good management skills I believe.  I hope we can move
forward together.  I am looking forward to a positive response.  Thanks
again and best regards.

Dale Nesbitt

PS:  You might hear from Drew Ries of your Investments group.  I spoke with
him after speaking with you about many of the same issues.

Tim,

I hope things are going well in Resco.  I think somebody from Resco (or 
Research) may be interested in the email I received below from Brad Davids.  
Brad is now working at Abacus who works with residential customer patterns as 
well as predictive modelling.  He's going to be here the 25 and 26 of this 
month.  I'm not sure who is responsible for Resco Marketing, but I think they 
would find this interesting.  Who should I send this to?   Please let me know 
if anybody in Resco may have any interest.

Thanks,

Steve

PS:  Vince, simply an FYI since they do focus on modelling and research.

Bradley Davids <Brad.Davids@abacus-direct.com> on 04/10/2000 08:35:32 PM
Steve:

I'll see if I can get in on the 25th . . . will let you know, but I think
it'll work.

Just to give you a very brief overview so you can think about who might be
interested, Abacus has the largest transactional database of consumer buying
behavior in the world (89 million US households, 3 billion+ purchases),
along with sophisticated modeling capabilities to help predict customer
response to various offers at the household level. Given the critical need
to reduce customer acquisition costs in retail energy markets, we believe
that our data and modeling can help energy retailers target their direct
marketing efforts toward the residential customers most likely to respond to
whatever the offer is--improving the efficiency of mailings and other
promotional campaigns (so there is an efficiency angle, see!)

Because our data allow the modeling of future buying behavior based on
actual purchases, our results tend to be significantly more predictive than
demographic-based models. So far, the the response from utilities and "new
entrants" I've been talking to so far has been quite positive, and we have
some tests of our data underway, but we're interested in talking to as many
players in the market as possible as we develop specific products to meet
utility needs.

I can provide more background if desired to whoever might be interested, but
I guess the key immediate question is whether it might be worthwhile to
arrange a short meeting sometime on the 25th of April with whoever at Enron
might have interest in hearing what we're up to, and (most importantly)
listening to what your data needs might be as you enter new markets.

Thanks very much for any help . . . I look forward to catching up and
hearing how things are going for you.

Regards,

Brad Davids
303-410-5531

It'd be great to meet on the 25th in the afternoon.  I have a flight in the
evening.  I'm interested in hearing about life at abacus.  I too have heard
that Enron is getting back into the residential market.  What type of
database do you have?  I might be able to find somebody for you to talk
with here.

-Steve

Bradley Davids <Brad.Davids@abacus-direct.com> on 04/10/2000 12:04:00 PM

Steve:

Sorry we've been unable to hook up . . . I can probably get down there on
the 25th, if you're going to be in town that afternoon? Would love to catch
up--both on how things are going with EES and tell you about my new life.

Also, I'm hearing rumors that Enron is about to get back into the
residential market in a big way--you know anything about that? Anybody I
should talk to there about my huge database of consumer buying behavior?

Thanks--looking forward to connecting . . . I'll be travelling most of this
week, but you can leave a VM and let me know when I can call you, or try me
on the cell at 303-886-3458.

Best,

I think full time employment starting in about six months seems to be the
best option.  It is probably best to get my dissertation wrapped up before
taking on additional commitments.

Regards

Zeigham,

We discussed two options (not necessarily mutually exclusive):

1. summer internship
2. full employment.

Are you interested exclusively in full employment?

I need the answer ASAP, as we are going to discuss the additional summer
intern positions this afternoon.

It was very nice talking to you at  the Texas Finance Festival and I think
the telecom market that Enron is entering  is very interesting and very
lucrative. I would be very interested in  working in that segment for
Enron.

However, I talked to Sheridan about  this oppurtunity and he said that it
is probably going to be another six months  before I finish my
dissertation. So while I am definitely interested, the  start date will
probably have to be around that time.

At any rate, it was a pleasure meeting you again  and hopefully once I have
defended my dissertation we can discuss  employment oppurtunities in
greater detail.

Sheridan Titman <titman@mail.utexas.edu> on 02/29/2000 05:29:19 PM

Hi Vince:

     I haven't talked to you in a while and wanted to touch base with you on a
couple of issues.

1. Is there someone at Enron who would be interested in speaking to our
MBAs about real options? Jim Dyer from our management science group is
interested in having someone for his decision analysis class this spring.
Also, I am thinking about having a panel discussion in the Fall on
valuation issues.

2. I recently received a phone call from the editor of the Journal of
Applied Corporate Finance, which is a practioner journal sponsored by the
Bank of America and Stern Stewart which is distributed to academics and
major corporations.  They are doing a special issue on Energy and are
interested in an article on how energy derivatives are used for risk
management.  Are you aware of anyone from Enron who has written such an
article?

3. Last fall when you visited us at UT we discussed the possibility of
giving lectures to Enron employees on valuation.  Ehud and I sent you a
proposal but didn't get a response.  Is there still an interest in this.

4. Murray Carlson and I are developing a general equilibrium model that we
think is potentially useful for valuing oil and gas derivatives as well as
real investments.  If you think this approach might be potentially useful
for Enron, we would be interested in presenting our model to your research
group.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

  Exchange products seeing slow trading
  GAVIN SOUTER

  Business Insurance

  Exchange-based insurance products developed in recent years have
  been somewhat slow to get off the ground.

  Although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since
  the mid-1990s to cover insurance risks, none so far has posted a
  significant volume of trades.

  Few insurers, reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away
  from the traditional insurance markets, where capacity remains
  abundant and relatively cheap.

  As long as those traditional markets manage to weather major
  natural catastrophes, the allure of the exchange-based products will
  remain limited, observers say.

  Also stifling the growth of the exchange-based contracts is the
  limited number of contracts available, one expert noted. Dealers, he
  said, are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one
  contract against another.

  Although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to
  establish a widely used set of new risk financing products, that has
  not been achieved, said Morton Lane, senior managing director,
  capital markets division at Gerling Global Financial Products in
  New York.

  The main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not
  offer a sufficiently diverse array of products, he said. The only way
  to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified
  portfolio of other contracts, and none of the exchanges currently
  offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that
  hedge, he said.

  Florida windstorm options, for example, cannot be bought and then
  hedged in the same way that International Business Machines Corp.
  stock options contracts can be hedged with IBM stock, Mr. Lane
  explained.

  The exchanges might be more attractive to investors if, in addition to
  natural catastrophe options, they included options on other risks, he
  said. Those might include, for example, satellite, aviation and crop
  indexes, Mr. Lane said. "For the insurance buyer, such exchange
  instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle, but
  as long as they are quantifiable and indexable, they may represent a
  good surrogate," he said.

  The exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for
  over-the-counter securitized deals, if there are regular issuers of
  catastrophe bonds, Mr. Lane said.

  The soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of
  exchange-based insurance products, said Sean F. Mooney, senior
  vp and chief economist at Guy Carpenter & Co., the reinsurance
  brokerage unit of Marsh Inc. in New York.

  "The traditional market has been so competitive that people are not
  looking for other ways of doing business," he said.

  At least in concept, the exchange-based deals are generally similar
  to the mortgage-backed securities that have been a huge success
  since they were introduced in the 1970s. "There is a belief that
  alternative means of transferring risks will grow, but it is difficult to
  predict when," Mr. Mooney said.

  Currently, the trading that is taking place typically involves
  established insurers and reinsurers, so the exchanges have not
  brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace, he said.

  Guy Carpenter provided the index for the Bermuda Commodities
  Exchange reinsurance products. The BCE did not take off,
  however, and was suspended last year after two years of little
  activity.

  The oldest of the insurance-related, exchange-based derivative
  products are the catastrophe options traded on the Chicago Board
  of Trade, which began trading the options in 1996.

  Initially, there was substantial interest in the options, but the soft
  traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge
  catastrophe exposures, said Carlton Purty, an independent broker
  at the CBOT who trades in options.

  No catastrophe option trades have been completed at the CBOT
  so far this year, he said. Last year, there was increased interest in
  the contracts because of Hurricane Floyd, but few contracts were
  traded, Mr. Purty said.

  "I think a major, major catastrophe will have to happen before they
  really take off," he said.

  The contracts offer real protection, and options dealers are keen to
  trade in a new niche, but the conventional insurance and reinsurance
  markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative
  coverage options, Mr. Purty said.

  The Catastrophe Risk Exchange, located in Princeton, N.J., has
  radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in
  mid-1996, and it is well positioned to expand, said Frank Sweeney,
  chief operating officer.

  CATEX initially planned to be a computer-based facility for
  reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks
  and to build balanced portfolios.

  But by the time the exchange was operational in November 1996, it
  was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in CATEX
  wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance, Mr. Sweeney
  said.

  Although there was some interest in risk swapping, only a handful of
  risks were posted on the system, and none was traded, Mr.
  Sweeney said.

  Consequently, CATEX has become chiefly a "cash for cover"
  exchange, he said, noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange
  include property catastrophe coverage, aviation and liability
  coverages. CATEX also trades industry loss warranties, where
  coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry
  loss over an agreed threshold.

  Other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible
  through the Internet in November 1998. And late last year, CATEX
  offered users the ability to set up smaller networks, allowing them
  form groups whose members do business only with one another.

  Since its inception, CATEX has completed about 450 trades,
  totaling $400 million in premium and more than $3 billion in limits,
  he said. CATEX's roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers,
  insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their
  captives, Mr. Sweeney said.

  "We obviously have a long way to go, but we are pretty satisfied
  with what we have achieved so far," Mr. Sweeney said.

  The exchange sees increased activity after major losses, as cedents
  seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their
  existing cover, he said. For example, Mr. Sweeney said, there was
  a flurry of activity after the European windstorms in December last
  year.

  Last September, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered the field
  of insurance-related derivatives when it began offering weather
  derivatives .

  Thus far, 420 futures contracts have been traded, said Larry
  Grannan, senior director in product marketing at the CME.

  Such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against
  weather-related losses. For example, a utility may sell less power in
  a mild winter, and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a
  resultant fall in revenues.

  The exchange first offered heat-based indexes for Atlanta, Chicago,
  Cincinnati and New York. In January, it added Philadelphia, Dallas,
  Des Moines, Las Vegas, Tucson and Portland, and it began offering
  contracts based on cold weather.

  Currently, most of the trades are between securities dealers
  themselves, but, eventually, the contracts will likely be used more
  extensively by utilities and insurers, Mr. Grannan said.

  In addition, the futures contracts could be used as hedges for
  over-the-counter securitized deals, he said.

Jim Dyer <Jim.Dyer@bus.utexas.edu> on 03/22/2000 11:53:17 AM
Vincent,

 We met last year when you were visiting The University, and talking
primarily with our finance faculty.  As you may have heard, I tried to call
to talk with you about the possiblity of a guest speaker in my class on real
options from your group at Enron.  Naturally, I would be delighted if you
could speak, but I could also appreciate the possibility that someone else
might also be a good choice.

  I have attached a copy of the course syllabus for your information.
This is the first time this course has been offered at UT, and I was
motivated to do so because of the "buzz" regarding the topic in industry.  I
have about 30 MBA students in the class, many of whom were in the energy
finance classes offered by Sheridan Titman and Ehud Ronn (both of whom have
been very supportive of the development of this class).  My own background
is decision analysis rather than finance, so I tend to approach the topic
with that perspective.  As you can see, I have covered both traditional
decison analysis topics and a review of the options literature.  At the
present time, I don't think there is a really complete textbook that fits
the course at the MBA level, so I've tried to focus on how to do things in
practice, and have provided software (DPL, spreadsheets, @Risk, etc) as
tools for the students to use.

 The course is scheduled on Thursday afternoons from 3:30 to 6:30,
which is a time that I chose to make possible the participation of some

Vince, FYI on Nebraska , this note I recently sent to Maureen. 
	
	

Maureen,
The  Energy CEO Roundtable hosted by Gov. Johanns has been scheduled for 
April 20th 10a.m. -2 p. m. Does this date work for you?  As we have 
discussed, your presentation would provide the Governor and his guests with a 
national/ global perspective on pricing trends for natural gas , electricity 
and oil and their impact on agricultural production costs. We may also 
include a hedging presentation, but have not committed to do so yet. 
 Your presentation would be scheduled at the start of the meeting, w/ an 
anticipated length of twenty minutes.  A University of NE  ag economist will 
provide a state perspective for the group. Following the conclusion of both 
presentations time would be allotted for questions. We expect approximately 
20 people to attend the roundtable. 

Great,

Please, let me know. There are several good films playing currently.

Monica,

In preparing the FX curve, we assumed the following main points:

General outlook: a slightly more aggressive depreciation rate than the 
consensus forecast and the forward market would indicate on the short-end 
because of the lack of complete, measurable and sustainable progress in the 
financial and corporate restructuring efforts.  The won depreciated more than 
most analysts expected at the end of last year because of heightened concerns 
regarding the government's banking sector reform program.   If the Koreans 
follow the Japanese model and continue to put off badly needed banking sector 
reform, the country is in for a long period of economic uncertainty.  
Reform: We think the financial restructuring effort (bank mergers, etc, which 
have led to public strikes recently) is going to take at least two years.  
Industrial restructuring has been slow moving, the 50% drop in the stock 
market since early 2000 is strong evidence of that, and the banks in their 
weak state are not creating the liquidity needed to boost the economy.  
Although the IMF package has been largely paid off, these underlying problems 
remain.  The goal of government-sponsored financing is to shore up the 
banking sector (which is burdened by non-performing loans) and to close 
nonviable companies, but reform efforts have appeared to languish of late and 
the cost of the program by some measures is as high as 26 percent of GDP.  
Failure to find investors for the Daewoo Motor Company and Hanbo Steel should 
warn investors of the impediments to reform in the Korean market.  
Exports:  The weak Japanese yen (following stagnating demand at home in Japan 
and abroad, coupled with a weak financial system and a huge public debt 
burden) will likely cause the central bank to be very cautious about any 
intervention to stem any possible slide in the won.  This is because Korea's 
largest competitor on world product markets is Japan, and a weak yen hurts 
Korea's export competitiveness (exports account for half of the Korea's 
GDP).  Korea's FX reserves are strong.  
Risks to Forecast: The risks to our forecast are those factors which could 
lead to negative investor sentiment toward Korea.  Included in these risks 
are stalls in restructuring or that restructuring efforts uncover serious 
resistance by banks or corporates (chaebols) to proceed smoothly with reform 
or the government succumbs to public pressure to soften the reform objectives 
or implementation timeframes. 

Gwyn Koepke 

Thank you for providing the South Korea curve.  Can you please provide a more 
detailed explanation regarding you assumptions to calculate the curve?  The 
SK-Enron team is interested in knowing your view points on the market.

Thanks again

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

     How are you?  It was nice to meet you at the Real Options conference in
NYC.

     I was intrigued by some of the comments in your conference talk.  In
particular, by your use of real options to hedge financial options.  This is
something I am interested in as well.

     When you have some time, could we chat about this topic in a bit more
detail?

     Thanks for your time and consideration.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,
Iris Mack

Makes sense to me.

Just a quick email to start some  discussion about the panel session you are 
involved in during Risk2000 in Boston  on 13 & 14 June.
?
Although I would welcome suggestions to the contrary, I would  prefer to go 
straight into the discussion rather than have a series of short  
presentations first. Ideally I think we should establish a number of topic 
areas  around which the moderator can lead the discussion - naturally for the 
better  discussions it's important to have varying views on similar subjects; 
similarly  it is often interesting to hear the panel's comments on one 
individual's more  specific area of knowledge.
?
Conseqently if you could return this email (to all panel  members) with 
topics you feel should be covered, any particular areas you would  personally 
like to focus on, any proposed changes to the actual panel structure,  and 
possibly additonal panel members you think should be there, that would be a  
good start. I am still in the process of looking for a moderator and if 
anyone  has any suggestions, please let me know.

Hello Vince,

I didn't know if that was your correct e-mail address listed below on 
receiving from outside the company, so I thought I would forward this with a 
couple of comments.

She states below that she has enclosed a proposal, however, the only pricing 
I really see is in the Software License Agreement, Article 2, which states 
that the license fee is $100,000 and lists out when you must pay for it.  It 
then states in Article 3 that the fees are set forth in Appendix 1, but there 
are no prices in Appendix 1.  

I have reviewed the actual terms and conditions to the license and am going 
to prepare it as we usually do to send to Mark Holsworth for review.  In the 
meantime, do you want me to go back to Ms. Geman and ask her for more 
detailed pricing information or do you have what you need?  Also, in Appendix 
2, you will need to list the number of sites and workstations you want to 
have.  

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Karla

Kevin,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado

As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are inviting Ken Rice and Joe Hirko to this meeting. We would appreciate 
if you could
speak, together with Joe and Ken, on strategic directions of EBS. It is 
important for a group
of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to 
understand the big picture.

I am attaching the preliminary agenda for this meeting.

Vince

Dear Vince,

FYI

Vince

Below is proposed schedule for the Darden case video-taped interviews; an 
hour has been scheduled for each of you (except Vince, for whom 1-1/2 hours 
has been requested), however, you may be finished in less time.  The location 
is yet to be determined, but will most likely take place in a vacant office 
of 50M.  

Please let me know of any conflicts with this proposed schedule.  I'll send 
along additional information as it becomes available.  Thank you and have a 
nice weekend.  SRS

Hi Vince,

As requested, I sent you an invitation (3pm Houston time Monday) for the 
summary review of the half-hourly forward vol curve method plus review of 
recent projects (e.g. inflation book, EnergyDesk.com, Weather desk update, 
emerging market in Continental power market options and Global Products 
exotics).  Look forward to catching up with you then.  I also sent you a 
tentative list of meetings that I will be having in Oslo.

Regards,

Anjam

P.S. The telephone number is 47 2321 2000 Grand Hotel, Oslo and my mobile 
number is 07747 868131

Please, refer John directly to Jinbaek Kim and his academic advisor.

Vince

As a followup, John Gillespie has expressed interest in participating on the 
panel mentioned below.  To whom should I refer John or should somebody 
contact him?  I just wanted to know what to tell John.

Thanks,
Martin

Martin,

Thanks.

I did not find anybody in EBS who seems to know or be involved in any 
e-procurement issues.  In Enron Corp, however, there is an initiative called 
iBuyIt.  This is a system that Corp is deploying for e-procurement through 
Corp and ENA, and will get to EBS sometime late this year.

John Gillespie is in charge of the iBuyIt initiative.  Perhaps he is the 
appropriate contact.  I left a voice mail with him, but have not yet received 
a response.

Martin,

Please, take a look at Question 3.
Who is the right person at EBS?

Vince

Jinbaek Kim <jinbaek@ieor.berkeley.edu> on 03/15/2001 01:12:32 AM
Dr. Kaminski,

Sorry for the late response,
it took me some time to coordinate things.
Finally, it's almost dont :-)
It turned out that from June to August
will be best for me for work at ENRON
(Say June.4 to August.4)

But I still need to know several things from your side.
Could you answer following questions?

First:
Is my suggested working period is OK with you?
If so, let me know what to do for settlement
during the period.

Second:
I got a list of work, I might be able to do for
DealBench team from Ross and Suresh.
I'd like to know it is still a valid work list:
The list he sent is as following:

> 1.  Write a paper in layman's terms that answers
> questions like the following:
> Benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and
> sellers, particularly in reverse auctions
> Explanation how multi-variable auctions are not
> as efficient as price-only auctions (is this true?)
> How many participants are recommended for a
> successful live auction
> What types of goods and services are best suited
> for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes
> Opinions on lotting strategies
> Trends in online private auctions

> 2.  Identify appropriate recent auction research (3
> or 4 papers out of the 90+ you provided)and obtain approvals from the
> authors to post on our site

> 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction
> literature (with hyperlinks?)

> 4.  Would you be willing to offer auction consulting
> services to our customers (if they are interested)

Third:
There is an e-procurement forum at Haas School of business,
in May 22. The chair of the forum is my advisor Prof. Arie Segev.
A person from Wells Fargo Bank will talk about Wells Fargo's role
in e-marketplace payment initiative,
where ENRON broadband services is also one of key players
along with Citibank.
He asked me whether you can contact a person at
ENRON broadband services, who's related to the initiative.
He wants to know whether we will have a speaker from ENRON
to see ENRON's perspective, in the Forum.

Here is a link to news related to the initiative,

http://www.internetweek.com/story/INW20000808S0001

Fourth:
My advisor wants to know whether
there could be any opportunity to do a case study,
regarding ENRON's business.
He is interested in e-procurement and e-marketplaces.
Business model and System architecture...

Thanks for reading this long email.
I'll look forward to your answer..
I am sorry for giving you so much burden
to answer those questions possibly not easy to answer.

Warm regards,
Jinbaek

Go Bears!

 Dear Energy in Europe Congress Delegate

ENERGY IN EUROPE CONGRESS 2000
19th June * 22th June 2000 * Kempinski Hotel , Berlin

I am delighted that you will be joining us to speak at our Energy in 
Europe2000 conference (formally known as Electricity in Europe Congress) and 
enclose copies of the printed brochure for you and your colleagues. I hope 
that you will agree that the programme looks excellent and the response so 
far indicates that the event will be extremely well attended.

I would be grateful if you could just take a moment to look through the items 
we would like from you prior to the conference to help ensure everything runs 
smoothly on the day.

Your Administration/Preparation Details
12 weeks to go!

You will find attached:
  ? PINK FORM : please tick and fill in and fax back immediately
? HOTEL FORM: please tick and fill in and fax direct to the hotel
? MARKETING.DOC: Information for out marketing department, please fill in and 
send back as soon as possible

Friday 26th May 2000 : A Hard Copy Of Your Documentation
3 weeks to go!

  ? We would like a hard black & white copy of  your presentation / bullet 
points/copy of slides whichever is best for you, to insert into the delegate 
documentation. We can receive this by post or email if the documents are not 
too complex but we try not to insert fax copies as copy quality is poor. 
(e-mail address - ttulsi@icbi.co.uk).

N.B. Even if you plan to speak off the cuff, we would urge that you submit at 
least an outline of your speech to us for insertion into the delegate pack by 
the above date. The most consistent complaint that we have from delegates is 
that not all speakers offer hard copies of their presentation.

  ? If you are unable to make this deadline, please could you inform us as 
soon as possible so that we can make alternative arrangements and avoid 
printing delay.

Under separate cover we have arranged for five brochures to be sent to you 
outlining the full programme.  These should arrive very shortly.

Should you have any queries regarding your participation at the conference 
please contact Tanuja Tulsiani, our Logistics  Manager who will be looking 
after the 'domestic' side of the event. You can call her direct on (44) 171 
915 5173 or do contact myself. Thank you once again for joining us and I look 
forward to seeing you in the Berlin.

With kind regards,

Hi Martina & Trena,

I think this is a reasonable smoothing method between the short and long-term 
models - let me know if you need me to explain it.  I also included the 
short-term models so this is now a self-standing spreadsheet, but probably 
still needs cleaning up a bit.

ZIMIN & STINSON:

We agreed on short-term and long-term models for DZCV and PLLU PPI indices in 
a meeting with Dale and Trena and a simple smoothing is employed to give the 
results as follows.  Blue and red curves are the proposed DZCV and PLLU PPI 
index forward curves whilst RPI is the market-derived black curve.

Vince,

 I appreciate your response to my request for you to speak to my
class on real options.  I thought you might enjoy the following exchange of
emails that occurred yesterday.  Perhaps some of these issues could be
addressed in your talk.

 Jim

Jim:

Your student has raised some difficult questions.  I would recommend Ehud,
but I thought that the finance people have the answers in cases with
complete markets and that we rely on the decision science people for cases
with incomplete markets.

If it would help, I can come in at 6pm after my class in a couple of weeks.

Sheridan,

 Which of your classes do you want to miss?  Just kidding.  Actually
you probably told me that before.  Can you suggest someone else who would be
a good choice to discuss the use of option theory in the context of
incomplete markets, and to address some of the types of questions raised in
the note from the student?

I teach at the same time as you do.

Sheridan,

 See the comments below.  I don't mean to put you on the spot, and
have not announced anything in class, but I am hoping that you could visit
my class for about an hour one Thursday afternoon to discuss your views
regarding applications of option pricing concepts to "real options".  As a
reminder, I've attached a course outline.  Chris Kenyon from Schlumberger is
speaking on April 13, and Vince Kaminski has tentatively agreed to speak on
April 20.

 I am going to be out of town on April 27, so that leaves either next
Thursday (April 6) or May 4.  Would either of those times work for you?  I'm
not thinking of any preparation, but more of an informal discussion of the
"philosophical issues" related to real options work.

 Jim

Josh,

 Some very thoughtful observations.  As you know, I had invited one
finance professor to our class on Arundel, but he was out of town.  I do
plan to invite Sheridan Titman to discuss the issue of using the option
models in situations where there is no underlying security that is traded.
I do think it is important to face that issue, which is actually covered at
a theoretical level in our last couple of readings.

 The issue of volatility is also an excellent issue for further
discussion, as you suggest.  So far, we've been looking at cases where
volatility is "given".  The problem of finding an "objective" measure of
volatility for a project reminds me of the problem of finding the correct
risk adjusted discount rate, which is not surprising since the concepts are
almost two sides of the same plate.  One approach, of course, is to do some
modeling using traditional decision analysis tools, including subjective
probabilities, but the finance people who write options articles don't like
to think  about such ideas.

 I'll try to address these issues in more detail as the semester
continues.  I think it was important to surface some of these points early,
and to come back to them after we have seen how to apply the methods in a
naive sort of way.

 Thanks for the feedback and comments.

 Jim

After overcoming the initial (I hope) overload of materials and tools
presented
thus far in the semester, it appears to me that you are achieving the
objective
of making us comfortable with optionality valuation as applied to a variety
of
problems which are outside the borders defined by a liquid market of traded
financial elements.

As a constructive feedback, you have been forthright with us in marking off
areas of this subject which are still controversial.  I also realize that
rightly so, real-world application of this type of analysis without a robust
understanding of finance may degenerate into a succession of assumptions
that
result in a "house of cards" effect.  My opinion at this point is that two
issues are of potentially "make-or-brake" importance if I am to persuade my
superiors to accept these methods for valuations outside the realm of
projects
whose value is primarily driven by the value of commodities backed by
financial
instruments.  These issues are easy to guess:

1)  Discounting and Risk Free rates:  I do not sense that anyone in the
class
has put forth convincing arguments as to the proper application of time
value
questions in the absence of liquidity.  Is there someone within the finance
department that can present a firmer position on this question?

2)  Volatility: I found Winston's examples on this metric succinct.  I would
recommend that in future years you dedicate some hours of class time to this
subject.  My criticism again relates to messy problems.  I anticipate
arguments
against real option applications based on the dispute of volatility
measures.
If I were a conservative financial manager, I would argue that:

*** Two-a: implied volatility derived from an industry specific slice of
equity
options is a shotgun approach -- the projects being valued are of a tranche
which may in fact have a significantly different outcome variance than the
weighted average measured by the equities utilized.  Oil, gas and electricty
are
good examples the major players are competing on many different levels of
the
value chain. Smaller companies do exist which are dedicated to one strata,
but
what about projects that want to exploit opportunies across strata in a
vertically integrated company?

*** Two-b: based on the following skepticism - if a real option value is
being
proposed for a new business venture (some new unexploited opportunity,)
there is
some paradox embedded in the increased value based on high volatility in new
ventures and the high risk of failure.  This skepticism is likely to be less
acute in high-tech sectors where the huge upside of new ventures is paraded
before us daily by NASDQ touts.  It is a much harder sell to "mature"
industries.

Of particular interest in the power industry are investments centered around
opportunities arising from restructuring of electricity and natural gas
sectors
as regulation is removed.  A large proportion of the risk is embedded in
ongoing
changes of public policy on an international basis.  As an intentionally
screwed-up example, can anyone other than a financial genius correctly asses
volatility for U.S. companies investing in seed projects in Mexico based on
speculation of the inevitable dismantling of the national utility (CFE) and
PEMEX?

Hi Martina & Trena,

I made a few minor changes to the models...  I reckon these models can be 
checked in Houston now - the raw data is included (see attached spreadsheets) 
and all the regression parameters and main statistics are displayed.  I 
became interested in how far DZCV and PLLU should be below RPI and whether 
this model is reflecting any reversion to the RPI level; I believe that the 
forecasts are accurately reflecting this.  Please see graphs below:

Both models really need our RPI curve to be linked (at the moment I have just 
copied the 2.3% number forward).  Because the auto-regressive error term is 
not very important, we can run the models forward with reasonable 
confidence.  As I mentioned, I don't think we can really run this model more 
than 12 months, in fact, I think we should run for 9-12 months and blend the 
next 3-4 months out with the long-term model.

Hope I can fix the long-term ones now with some new insight!

Regards,

Anjam

Hi Zimin!

Please find attached the RPI model I developed by bootstrapping RPI swaps. 
The structure of this particular swap is:  

semi/semi Act/365F
>
> YOYUKRPI = (UKRPI(p-2)/UKRPI(p-14) - 1)/2
> p = payment month
>
The first payment is the latest known historical RPI, February 2000. You will 
notice that I have assumed constant cashflows between the quoted years (as 
opposed to interpolating swaps which distorts the curve a lot).

Please find below a graphic comparison between the RPI curve produced by 
swaps and the one produced by the GILT market.

Looking forward to your comments.

Best regards,

Martina

Huge Growth in Natural Gas Storage Tracked

     As the natural gas market approaches 30 Tcf per year, demand for natural
gas storage capacity will rise exponentially.  Although the snowball has just
started rolling, current plans by natural storage operators will boost
working capacity by 430 Bcf, or 10%, and will raise peak-day deliverability
11.8 Bcf per day, or 13.8%, according to a new survey by Intelligence Press.
Intelligence Press' new multimedia research package provides a comprehensive
look at all current activity on 458 storage fields with additional key
information on 101 LNG facilities. Among them are 38 proposed natural gas
storage fields and 15 storage expansion projects. Depleted fields capture the
largest share of the proposed fields with 24, followed by aquifers with six,
and salt domes and salt beds with four each. Altogether the proposed new
fields account for about 329 Bcf in working capacity and 9.7 Bcf per day in
deliverability.  Proposed and potential expansions represent an increase of
about 100.5 Bcf of working capacity and 2.1 Bcf per day in deliverability.
But these projects are just the tip of the iceberg. Regulatory changes,
shifting natural gas flows and increases in demand due to growth in the
economy and particularly in natural gas fired power generation are expected
to cause significant additional storage growth in the next decade. For more
information go to:  www.intelligencepress.com

Dear Vince,

Greetings from NY & hope all is well.  As you may recall from the ROG real
options conference in NY, I'd indicated the opportunity to visit with you
next time I'm in Houston.  I'll be there during 4/18-4/21 & wonder if we can
pls meet on Wed. 4/19 in your offices.  Would appreciate it if you can pls

Jeff,

I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
organization
and the Research Group. 

Date:   April 27 - April 29
Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado

As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
project
currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are also inviting to this off-site senior management of EBS and plan to 
have
on the agenda several presentations about strategic directions of EBS. The 
effort
of network design and construction currently under way is  unprecedented in 
terms
of its scope and complexity and it is important  for technical people, who 
often have
highly specialized technical skills, to understand the broad picture.

I would appreciate if you could join us for Friday afternoon (April 28) and
Saturday (April 29). I understand  that you have commitments on Thursday and 
Friday 
morning. We have reorganized the tentative agenda of the meeting to devote
Friday afternoon to more general topics.

Joe, 

Thanks for your message. It would be difficult to rearrange  the meeting at 
this point, given that it was 
timed around the availability of Jeff Skilling. I doubt we could get Jeff for 
any other date at this point. We can still adjust
the agenda to discuss and address the Content Services issues. I shall work 
on this with John and Ravi.

Vince

I could probably make Friday but would have to leave that night.  Any chance 
it could be moved to the first of the next week.

Also, I think it is important that as we examine the technical issue of our 
network and network functionality that we balance the meeting with the 
Content Services issues and requirements.  I talked to John about this 
already.

Gentlemen,

Jeff has asked that each of you make time to meet with Professors Bruner and 
Bodily regardig the above referenced case (I have attached a project overview 
for your review).

They are scheduled to be in Houston on Tuesday, April 18, to begin conducting 
interviews (some of which may be videotaped).  Please let me know your 
availablility on that date.  

Thanks for your help, and please don't hesitate to call me (x3-5984) should 
you need additional information.  SRS

Vince, thank you so much for your generous pledge.  Please make your check 
payable to "National MS Society," and send it to me at EB5008A at your 
convenience.  Thanks again, SRS

Vince J Kaminski@ECT

Sherri,

I can pledge $2 per mile.

Vince

   

	

Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the 
camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the 
fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, 
the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff 
Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.

Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 
350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the 
Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am 
challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain 
amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a 
break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's 
closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat 
pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge 
to this very worthy cause 1-1.

I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top 
money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your 
consideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.

Sherri x3-5984

Hi Vince,

I am writing you at this time to inquire as to the potential of renewing my
internship at Enron for the Summer of 2000.

While the date of my request is later than I would have wished, the reason
is that I had originally planned to go back to Turkey this summer and get
my mandatory military duty done. However, I now realize I can put it off to
a further date. That left me wondering if you believe there is a project
that I can get involved in this summer and be useful. If that were the
case, I would be more than happy to postpone my military duty and spend the
summer with the research group. I discussed this with Dr. Ronn, and he is
very supportive of this idea.

I apologize again for bringing up this issue late, and look forward to
hearing from you.

Taking summer interns is the best way to screen and identify good candidates
at low cost and low risk. I would take this person in,
assuming you can still run it by the Analyst/Associate program. They closed 
the books
for the summer.

Hello all,

The program for the 2000 Texas Finance Festival has been formalized and can
be found on our web site at

http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/martinj/festival2.html

I do need to remind you of a few things before we converge on San Antonio.
First, be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations.
At last count there were only 6 rooms left.  Second, I need a completed
application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count.
I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate
boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a
form.

Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on Friday
so plan on arriving early Friday or coming in on Thursday evening if you
can.  Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and
interesting things to visit in the immediate area (the Alamo is across the
plaza from the hotel).

We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on
Friday and Saturday evenings.  The Friday evening dinner begins at 6 p.m.
so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the
Alamo at 8:00 p.m.  For Saturday we are still working out plans for the
evening so stay tuned.

There will be more information later as the conference nears.  Looking
forward to seeing you all and in beautiful, sunny San Antonio.

currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
effort
which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
optimization and
stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).

The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
transfer 
of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
in the future.

We are inviting Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon to this meeting. We would 
appreciate if you could
speak, together with Kevin and Ken, on strategic directions of EBS. It is 
important for a group
of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to 
understand the big picture.

I am attaching the preliminary agenda for this meeting.

Hi Vicek,

Fuel Cells
A scientist at The University of Pennsylvania discovered a material for
fuel cells electrodes which has a potential for common applications.
Everything known before would plug-up a cell.

Biochemistry
What do you thing about Martek Biosciences (MATK).  It is the only company
in the world producing polyunsaturated fatty acids (nutritional oils).
According to very recent research results their product added to baby
formula substantially increases IQ of babies.  They are quite small now ;
however, already have licenses in several countries.  Martek is still
waiting for FDA approval in US.  Competitive product, fish oil is
contaminated with other undesired compounds.

Are you going to Poland anytime soon?

Vince,
 Linda Vargo asked me because I am the administrator of employee referral 
program to contact you on whether or not Li Xiao is eligible for a bonus on 
his referral of Alex Huang.  I have informed Linda that the decision up to 
you.  If you feel that Alex Huang was hired as a result of Li bringing him to 
the attention of Enron then the bonus is due.  Linda and yourself have 
communicated via e-mail on this issue in early February and it appears from 
that correspondence that Li did encourage Alex to e-mail his resume to you.  
Please advise as to whether or not you want to award the bonus.

Thank You

Just wanted to pass a quick note to say thanks for all of your help that the 
three of you each gave me concerning cluster analysis.  Your help was 
invaluable .  As you may have been aware, we were performing the cluster 
analysis to define the commercial zones in ERCOT.  I only had a few days in 
which to learn the FASTCLUS procedure in SAS and prepare graphical views of 
the results.  

Your assistance ensured that Enron was seen as one of three market leaders 
who had the capability to perform the analysis and cross check other market 
participants analysis.  We were the only participant who had the ability to 
graphically  display the results.  

I was able to take the lead in a commercial meeting because of the data and 
results.  I just wanted you guys to know that I really appreciated your help.

I have attached a couple of files that show some of the results.  The 
presentation has the best overview.

  

Best Regards,
Lance

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE
Today's Focus: Filling in forms automatically
03/23/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: Filling in forms=20
automatically
You've probably started switching to electronic documents (rather than
printed forms) for your users. Perhaps you've created an expense report
template in Excel that has the fields your accounting department is
interested in.

But if you want to really impress the users, how about templates which
automatically populate themselves with user data (names, departments,
etc.)? If you've got NetWare 4.x or 5.x and use Microsoft Office, you
can do that - quickly, easily and (best of all) for free.

Novell Directory Services-Enabled Office is a tool for automating the
task of filling in standard forms with user and departmental data from
your NDS directory. It=01,s based on ActiveX controls and uses Visual
Basic scripts to feed that data into your forms.

To use NDS-Enabled Office, you must create Microsoft Word or Excel
templates that contain Visual Basic script macros that call users=01, NDS
data, such as their names or departments. You can then send your
templates to any employee in the company, and when the employee opens
the template, the document will be filled in automatically with that
employee's NDS information.

The NDS-Enabled Office installation includes sample templates. One is a
Word fax template, and the other is an Excel expense report template.

It saves paper, saves employees' time and it=01,s free. What are you
waiting for?

Gri Study Documents Changing Role of Natural Gas Storage
( March 21, 2000 )

(reported in http://powermarketers.com 3/22/2000)
(forwarded to you by Bob Brooks, RBA Consultants)

ARLINGTON, Va., March 21 /PRNewswire/ -- Regulatory changes coupled with
steady growth in U.S. natural gas consumption are expected to trigger a 21
percent increase in gas storage capacity over the next 15 years, according
to a new GRI study.
The study -- Natural Gas Storage Overview in a Changing Market Environment
(GRI-99/0200) -- estimates that lower 48 storage capacity for working gas
will grow from 3.8 trillion cubic feet (Tcf) in 1998 to 4.6 Tcf in 2015.
About 75 percent of the capacity additions are expected to occur after
2005, as gas demand grows more rapidly than storage capacity requirements
during the next five years.
Part of the new capacity will provide storage operators with increased
operating flexibility and augment changing needs of the power generation
and industrial sectors. These two sectors are expected to account for
nearly 80 percent of growth in gas consumption between 1998 and 2015. (GRI
projects the nation's gas demand will increase 50 percent, from 21.3 Tcf in
1998 to 32.8 Tcf in 2015.)
The added storage capacity will require a gas industry investment of nearly
$5.0 billion (1998 dollars) between 1998 and 2015, or about $270 million
per year, the study estimates.
The study, conducted for GRI by Energy and Environmental Analysis Inc.,
Arlington, Va., identifies several trends that will drive future storage
requirements, including:
* High consumption by power generation and industrial markets dampens
seasonal volatility. Since these sectors have relatively flat
year-round load profiles, they act to compliment rather than
stimulate short term demand swings in traditional residential and
commercial applications which drive the need for increased storage
capacity to overcome seasonal differences.
* Increases in the value of market-area storage to accommodate significant
growth in gas usage for power generation are anticipated. Due to
improvements in technology, favorable economics, and low emissions,
natural gas is expected to be the preferred incremental fuel for
power generation for the foreseeable future.
* Pipeline restructuring is changing the role and value of storage. Most
notable are the development of secondary markets for storage and
pipeline capacity, growth of market hubs and gas marketers, and a shift
toward market-based rates.
* Storage services are likely to become more efficient as a result of
local distribution company restructuring. Storage operators are
expected to have a direct profit motive to maximize the value of storage
and are likely to offer new services that use existing facilities more
effectively.
"These trends are already beginning to have a major impact on gas storage
operations and will only be magnified in the future," said John Cochener,
GRI project manager and principal analyst-resource evaluation. "We are
already seeing increases in the value of well-placed storage facilities,
particularly those able to capitalize on regulatory changes that allow for
greater operating flexibility. The reduction in regulatory constraints will
allow storage market players even greater latitude in the future to
experiment with innovative competitive tools. This will result in greater
flexibility in the timely movements of gas to where it's required.
Conversely, high-cost storage operators, who fail to respond to the
changing market by offering more flexibility, may eventually find
themselves at a competitive disadvantage in the future and may see the
value of their storage asset stagnate."
The study is GRI's most comprehensive look at gas storage markets. Included
is an analysis of changes in storage capacity, services, customer usage
patterns and costs, as well as proposed storage projects. LNG and
Propane-Air are covered in addition to traditional types of storage
facilities. The study also reviews future storage requirements, costs
associated with expanding different types of storage capacity, and the
merits of different storage locations.
The study also looks at storage capacity under existing contracts. One
finding is that the average length of time until contract expiration for
firm storage contracts has declined from 6.8 years in 1996 to 6.2 years in
1999. More than half of the existing contracts in spring 1999 will expire
by 2004. By 2006, 70 percent of existing contracts will have expired.
Further, storage operators will generally be replacing storage contracts
negotiated by local distribution companies (with guaranteed rates of
return) with contracts negotiated by the growing ranks of gas marketers,
who are under competitive pressure to hold down costs.
The number of years remaining under existing storage contracts varies by
customer type, according to the study. Currently, cogenerators and
independent power producers have the longest remaining contract lengths,
followed by pipelines, gas utilities and marketers. Electric utilities and
industrial customers have the shortest average contract lengths remaining.
Listed in the study are the top 50 storage capacity holders.
Questions about the study or ordering should be addressed to Kelly Murray,
GRI Baseline Center, Arlington, Va., at 703-526-7832; by fax at
703-526-7805; or by E-mail: mailto:baseline@gri.org <<a href=> The study
(GRI-99/0200) can be ordered directly from the GRI Document Fulfillment
Center by fax at 630-406-5995. The report is $250 for GRI members and $325

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: MIKE JUDE and NANCY MEACHIM
on APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS
Today's focus: ASP Noise
03/22/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's focus: ASP Noise
One problem with the application service provider market is that no one
has yet been able to quantify it. This problem jumped out at us
recently as we were surfing the ASP News Web site.

ASP News, which is a very good resource for anyone interested in the
ASP world, has developed a dynamic directory of network-based service
providers.  To give you an idea of how much information is included,
the directory lists four main categories and 15 subcategories.
Although these categories are not exclusionary, they clearly represent
a lot of companies.

The question is, What does it all mean? What is the difference between
an independent software vendor (ISV) and an ASP?  How is a prospective
customer supposed to find the right vendor for its needs?

Therein lies the rub, as they say.  ASP News=01, directory makes it appear
that the service provider marketplace can be clearly defined and the
vendors listed in a neatly parsed, easy-to-understand directory.  Of
course, it isn=01,t that simple.  An ASP infrastructure provider, or AIP
(how=01,s that for an acronym within an acronym?), may, by virtue of a
partnering arrangement, also compete against full-fledged ASPs.  And
what about the mutable ISV?  What little push is required for an ISV to
become an ASP?

The fact of the matter is that the ASP News directory made me realize
that we have so much information that we can=01,t see the trees.  We can
only see the forest.

As providers all vie for customer attention and try to satisfy every
user need, their messages are becoming confused.  The service provider
market has reached a point of information overload.  So much marketing
is being pushed out that customers are hearing only noise.  The message
is being lost.  It is as though every person in a community was on a
telephone party line all talking at once.  Star Trek=01,s Borg
notwithstanding, being on the receiving end of such a call would leave
anyone confused about what was being communicated.

Too much information can be worse than no information at all.  At least
we don=01,t have to spend time trying to understand silence.  Today=01,s AS=
P
market makes customers work too hard.

The huge potential of this new market is attracting all types of
vendors.  New players are jumping on the bandwagon every day (even if
only via marketing material).  As a result, customers are confused, and
providers are unable to differentiate themselves or their solutions.
In short, the ASP market is being held back.

So, how do we get past the competitive chaos? We get past it in typical,
free-market style.  Because there are too many providers, many will
simply find themselves unable to compete and others will be gobbled up
by larger players as the market coalesces into several major players
with significant chunks of market share and a few smaller providers
serving niche markets.

In our opinion, this is already starting to happen.  Many of the large
players in traditional markets such as enterprise resource planning and
accounting have already begun to form alliances to gain market leverage.
Next, we will see many of these alliances collapse into large monolithic
players, as the smaller members are simply absorbed.  Remember the
lesson learned from the U.S. local telephone service market: Successful
companies always consume their friends.

Why does this happen?  It happens because consumers demand it.  The ASP
market has been wildly successful in convincing executive decision-
makers that outsourcing is the way to go.  People at this level will
not tolerate bedlam for long.  All it takes is a few large customers
choosing the same ASP and the market will be on its way to downsizing
as the winners and sure bets emerge.

One thing is clear: The answer to ASP success is not to simply try and
shout louder.  It is to reduce the noise level, and make it simpler for
the customer to understand your solution.  Remember the Borg, only when
there is a multitude of voices giving the same message is there a
chance for understanding. Make sure you are sending a clear signal, if
you want to get through the noise.

Today's Focus: The case for network-attached storage
Hyper-efficiency is a prime objective in e-business.  Companies want to
gain a competitive advantage by defining new sales opportunities faster
than their rivals, fulfilling customers information queries quickly,
and cutting their time to market with new products and services.

That often means finding a high-speed mechanism for filing and
retrieving business data.

Network-attached storage (NAS) is one way around the slowdowns and
service interruptions that occur in a conventional file server model.
The shortcomings with the file server model were discussed in last
week=01,s newsletter, but essentially they center on the file server=01,s
role as a gatekeeper.  In this setup, the file server sits in front of
storage systems typically connected to disk arrays by a SCSI bus in a
parallel cabling scheme. File servers read and write all storage
requests from users and other servers, and only one file server has
access to the disks that hold stored files.  The file server can become
a single point of failure or a bottleneck.

NAS effectively moves storage out from behind the server and puts it
directly on the transport network. Unlike file servers that have SCSI
and LAN adapters, a NAS appliance uses a network interface card to
transmit LAN and storage communications.

These specialized storage devices bring with them some major benefits
over file server systems. Because they don=01,t require a file server, any
user with access rights, anywhere on the network, can directly access
stored data.  This removes any delay posed by slow file server hardware
or operating systems.   NAS devices are also optimized to process
storage I/O transactions much faster than conventional parallel SCSI
schemes.

NAS appliances use a common file server access protocol, so they can
process requests from systems around a network, running multiple types
of operating systems. Any system, whether it is a Windows NT server or
a Unix box, can access the NAS device.  This solves cross-platform
issues that arise frequently in today=01,s heterogeneous enterprises.

NAS also mitigates the physical complexity associated with file servers
that use parallel SCSI buses to connect servers to storage disks.  NAS
alleviates the awkward setups of parallel cabling, host bus adapters,
and termination that are part and parcel of a file server
implementation.  Companies simply plug the system into the network and
it is ready to go.  Many NAS appliance vendors claim an installation
takes less than an hour.

Yet for all its advantages over a file server model, one drawback of
NAS is that it shifts storage transactions from parallel SCSI
connections to the production network.   This means the LAN has to
handle both normal end-user traffic and storage disk requests,
including backup operations.

Thus, NAS doesn=01,t resolve one of the core issues associated with file
servers  bandwidth consumption during backups.  Unlike storage-area
networks, which remove back-up traffic from the LAN, NAS still uses the
production network for backup and recovery.

That said, NAS technology still supplies companies with an easy-to-
deploy solution for resolving cross-platform issues while speeding
access to stored files.

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE
Today's Focus: Databases galore
03/21/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: Databases galore
Longtime NetWare managers lament the greater amount of resources needed
for newer versions of the network operating system, with many sticking
to their NetWare 3.11/3.12/3.2 servers simply because the earlier
version is leaner and meaner.

<aside> My first NetWare server was nondedicated and ran with 512
kilobytes of RAM. </aside>

Some blame the Java console introduced in NetWare 4.11, while others
feel it=01,s just the larger amounts of disk real estate used in servers
which consumes so much memory (for caching, tables, etc.).

One area not often mentioned, though, is the proliferation of databases
and database systems.

NetWare has shipped with Btrieve for 15 years, and NetWare 5.1 still
has Btrieve on the installation disk, but also installs Pervasive's
(the Btrieve vendor) SQL 2000 database system (Btrieve/SQL 2000 is used
by NetWare to track installed products). Then there's Novell Directory
Services, which uses its own proprietary database. For the adventurous,
NetWare 4.2 and 5.x ship with a five-user version of Oracle. Sites
using any of the ZENWorks products get yet another database system,
since ZEN installs and uses Sybase to store information. Add GroupWise
(used for e-mail at many NetWare sites), and there's another database
system using the FLAIM database. That's six, and you may have more.

Each one of these has minimum RAM and disk space requirements, no
matter how lightly populated any single database is. Each has its own
maintenance requirements. Few sites have the expertise to optimize all
of these different systems.

If Novell would only choose a single database system for all of these
applications, total cost of ownership could be significantly reduced.

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: JASON MESERVE on
SECURITY AND BUG PATCH ALERT
TODAY'S FOCUS: Guarding the perimeter is not always enough
03/21/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: Guarding the perimeter is=20
not always enough
Oh, the irony. You build your security systems to protect internal
systems from outside intruders, then someone inside the company decides
to play cyber-vandal.

Last week, authorities charged Abdelkader Smires with launching denial-
of-service attacks against his own employer, New York-based Internet
Trading Technologies, Inc. (ITTI). Smires was upset that ITTI did not
meet his demands for a raise and more stock options. He used computers
at a Kinko's Copy store and a local university to launch his revenge
attacks against ITTI that disrupted the company's trading systems for
three days.

"He and the other programmer were involved in writing the software, so
he knew just where to attack. He was fully familiar with weaknesses in
the code," said Eric Friedberg, computer and telecommunications crime
coordinator for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Brooklyn, N.Y., in an
interview with Computerworld "Although it was a potentially disastrous
attack for the company, it wasn't a highly sophisticated attack."

Read more about the attack here:
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2000/0317insidejob.html

Another interesting article to check out is "The service-pack shuffle
ruffles a lot of feathers" in this week's issue of Network World
(http://www.nwfusion.com/archive/2000/83305_03-20-2000.html). My
colleague Deni Connor writes that customer are fed up with the endless
release of service packs, which seem to be replacing quality assurance
at the companies developing our enterprise software.

But with no bugs, there would be no newsletter, so on with the latest

Cisco Secure PIX Firewall FTP vulnerabilities

Cisco announced that its PIX Firewall has a problem interpreting FTP
commands, allowing inappropriate access through the firewall. The
announcement covers two vulnerabilities: One when the firewall receives
an error from an internal FTP server and the second when a client inside
the firewall visits an external site and selects a link that the
firewall interprets as two commands. One of the commands inadvertently
opens a connection through the firewall.

Patch available for "OfficeScan DoS & Message Replay" vulnerability

Trend Micro has released a new version of OfficeScan Corporate Edition -
Version 3.51 - that eliminates two security vulnerabilities found on
previous versions. Previous versions of OfficeScan allow intruders

FreeBSD releases four advisories

The makers of FreeBSD did a little housecleaning last week, releasing
advisories on a number of previously announced vulnerabilities in
various Linux packages.

Lynx ports contain numerous buffer overflows
The lynx WWW browser is written in an unsecured format that contains a
number of holes. There is currently no patch available, so FreeBSD
recommends removing the package to eliminate the problem.
mtr port contains a local root exploit
The mtr program (versions 0.41 and below) fails to correctly drop setuid
root privileges during operation, allowing a local root compromise.

IE and Outlook 5.x allow executing arbitrary programs using .eml files

Georgi Guninski has found yet another flaw in Microsoft's popular
browser and e-mail program. This one allows arbitrary programs to be
launched via attached .eml files. No patch is currently available from
Microsoft, so Guninski recommends shutting off active scripting.

Sojourn search engine exposes files

The Cerberus Security Team has discovered a weakness in the commercial
search engine, Sojourn, that allows attackers to read any local file on
the file system that they have read access to (as provided by the
account the Web server is running under). As such, files such as
/etc/passwd on Unix systems can be read and files such as the
global.asa on Windows NT and 2000. No patch was available as of this
writing.More on Sojourn:

Problem with AIX 4.x linker

The Sendmail Consortium is warning of a problem with the AIX 4.x linker.
According to the advisory, unlike most other linkers, the AIX linker
uses the paths specified at compile time for the program's shared
library search path at run time.  Therefore, AIX compilations that use
the -L flag with the AIX linker must use extra precautions to prevent
security problems. This problem is not specific to Sendmail and can
affect other applications. IBM claims it is aware of the problem and
provides workarounds.
AIX site:
http://www.ibm.com/servers/aix/
************

Oracle Web Listener 4.0.x

The Cerberus Security Team has discovered a number of issues with
Oracle's Web Listener, part of Oracle Application Server (OAS), which
allow a remote attacker to run arbitrary commands on the Web server. As
part of the default installation, OAS creates an ows-bin virtual
directory that is a cgi-bin equivalent. According to Cerberus, this
directory not only contains a number of batch files, DLLs and
executables but also the binary image file for the Listener itself,
which could lead to malicious users executing commands on the server
with special query strings. No patch is available yet, though Cerberus
recommends removing the ows-bin directory or point to a more benign
directory.
OAS Web site:
http://www.oracle.com/appserver/
************

kreatecd local root compromise

TESO has found a vulnerability within the kreatecd application for
Linux. An attacker can gain local root-access. Halloween Linux Version 4
and SuSE 6.x are vulnerable. According to the TESO advisory, the author
of the software has been notified. The advisory recommends removing the
suid bit of kreatecd.

Vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 encryption used to store
administrative login ID

Internet Security Systems (ISS) has identified a vulnerability in the
encryption used to conceal the password and login ID of a registered SQL
Server user in Enterprise Manager for Microsoft SQL Server 7.0. When
registering a new SQL Server in the Enterprise Manager or editing the
SQL Server registration properties, the login name that will be used by
the Enterprise Manager for the connection must be specified. If a SQL
Server login name is used instead of a Windows Domain user name and the
'Always prompt for login name and password' checkbox is not set, the
login ID and password are weakly encrypted and stored in the registry.
http://xforce.iss.net/alerts/advise45.php3
************

Patch available for "Malformed Media License Request" vulnerability

Microsoft has released a patch that eliminates a denial-of-service
vulnerability in Windows Media License Manager. The vulnerability could
allow a malicious user to temporarily prevent the license server from
issuing further licenses to customers for protected digital content such
as music and video.

New England's Natural Gas Industry Reaches New Growth Levels
( March 23, 2000 )
(relayed by Bob Brooks, GPCM Natural Gas Market Forecasting System)
PROVIDENCE, R.I., March 23 /PRNewswire/ -- The natural gas industry in New
England continues its fast rate of growth, in terms of new customers and
new supply capabilities, industry and government leaders learned today at
The New England Gas Association's annual Energy Conference held at The
Westin Hotel in Providence.
Alfred P. Degen, chairman of The New England Gas Association, and chairman,
president and chief executive officer of Valley Gas Company, based in
Cumberland, Rhode Island, said: "The interest in natural gas has never been
stronger in New England. We look forward to continued growth in the years
ahead, to bring reliable, efficient, and cost-effective natural gas to
homes and businesses throughout the region."
This growth in New England is reflected in such developments as:
* A 25% growth in the region's pipeline infrastructure over the last year:
-- two new pipelines from Canada - the Portland Natural Gas Transmission
System (PNGTS), and the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline from Nova
Scotia;
-- system expansions by the region's transmission and local distribution
companies;
* A new supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Caribbean:
-- the Cabot LNG Corporation's Atlantic LNG Project made first
deliveries to New England in May 1999;
-- LNG deliveries to New England in 1999 were more than double 1998
levels;
* There are more natural gas customers in New England than ever before:
-- NEGA reports that New England now has over 2.2 million natural gas
customers, from homeowners to small and large businesses;
-- The region's gas utilities reached a new record sendout of gas on
January 17, 2000, reaching 3.4 billion cubic feet (Bcf), a 13%
increase over the previous record.
"Over the past year," said Degen, "the New England natural gas industry
installed more new miles of pipelines than it has in decades. Whole areas
of New England are gaining access to gas for the first time, and the rest
of the region is receiving substantial new supplies as well."
The Conference was attended by more than 300 industry and government
officials. In his keynote address, Gary L. Neale, chairman, president and
CEO of NiSource, Inc., and chairman of the American Gas Association
(A.G.A.), reported on the national natural gas market projections found in
A.G.A.'s recent study, "Fueling the Future." Neale noted that increased
natural gas demand has multiple national benefits, including:
environmental, energy security, trade, and economic development.
NEGA, based in Needham, Massachusetts, was established in 1926. Its
membership includes all of New England's local natural gas utilities, the
interstate pipeline companies, a liquefied natural gas (LNG) importer, and
over 280 associate member companies. The natural gas utilities serve over
2.2 million customers in 490 communities in New England.

Lynx ports contain numerous buffer overflows
The lynx WWW browser is written in an unsecured format that contains a
number of holes. There is currently no patch available, so FreeBSD
recommends removing the package to eliminate the problem.
mtr port contains a local root exploit
The mtr program (versions 0.41 and below) fails to correctly drop setuid
root privileges during operation, allowing a local root compromise.

IE and Outlook 5.x allow executing arbitrary programs using .eml files

Georgi Guninski has found yet another flaw in Microsoft's popular
browser and e-mail program. This one allows arbitrary programs to be
launched via attached .eml files. No patch is currently available from
Microsoft, so Guninski recommends shutting off active scripting.

Sojourn search engine exposes files

The Cerberus Security Team has discovered a weakness in the commercial
search engine, Sojourn, that allows attackers to read any local file on
the file system that they have read access to (as provided by the
account the Web server is running under). As such, files such as
/etc/passwd on Unix systems can be read and files such as the
global.asa on Windows NT and 2000. No patch was available as of this
writing.More on Sojourn:

Problem with AIX 4.x linker

The Sendmail Consortium is warning of a problem with the AIX 4.x linker.
According to the advisory, unlike most other linkers, the AIX linker
uses the paths specified at compile time for the program's shared
library search path at run time.  Therefore, AIX compilations that use
the -L flag with the AIX linker must use extra precautions to prevent
security problems. This problem is not specific to Sendmail and can
affect other applications. IBM claims it is aware of the problem and
provides workarounds.

Oracle Web Listener 4.0.x

The Cerberus Security Team has discovered a number of issues with
Oracle's Web Listener, part of Oracle Application Server (OAS), which
allow a remote attacker to run arbitrary commands on the Web server. As
part of the default installation, OAS creates an ows-bin virtual
directory that is a cgi-bin equivalent. According to Cerberus, this
directory not only contains a number of batch files, DLLs and
executables but also the binary image file for the Listener itself,
which could lead to malicious users executing commands on the server
with special query strings. No patch is available yet, though Cerberus
recommends removing the ows-bin directory or point to a more benign
directory.

kreatecd local root compromise

TESO has found a vulnerability within the kreatecd application for
Linux. An attacker can gain local root-access. Halloween Linux Version 4

Vulnerability in Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 encryption used to store
administrative login ID

Internet Security Systems (ISS) has identified a vulnerability in the
encryption used to conceal the password and login ID of a registered SQL
Server user in Enterprise Manager for Microsoft SQL Server 7.0. When
registering a new SQL Server in the Enterprise Manager or editing the
SQL Server registration properties, the login name that will be used by
the Enterprise Manager for the connection must be specified. If a SQL
Server login name is used instead of a Windows Domain user name and the
'Always prompt for login name and password' checkbox is not set, the
login ID and password are weakly encrypted and stored in the registry.

Ted,

Thanks for kind words.

I have a favor to ask. Jason Sokolov who works with us part-time (he is a Rice
MBA candidate) has been accepted as a summer intern. I suggested that he ask 
for
a position with your group for this summer. He works currently with Mike 
Roberts,
4 hours a day.

Jason is a very bright and hard working person and I can recommend him 
without reservations.

To the great and powerful Research Group:

As you may know, Moody's has recently upgraded Enron from Baa2 to Baa1.
We had been on watch for an upgrade for a while and after their intitial 
credit meeting, they still had questions primarily related to our control of 
market and credit risk.  To that end, Jeff McMahon and Tim Despain had Rick 
Buy, Bill Bradford and I meet with eight members of the Moody's team.  The 
questions centered around policy and procedure in the Wholesale businesses.  
We discussed VAR, stress testing and potential credit exposure.  To make a 
long story short, subsequent to that meeting, they reconvened their committee 
and announced the upgrade.  

I want you to know how critical your contribution was to the discussion and 
will continue to be as the bar gets raised.  I am sure that next year they 
will continue to be concerned with our risk management capabilities as well 
as extensions of our current platform - tail risk, intra day risk, 
operational risk, and enterprise wide risk.

Thank you for your efforts in supporting RAC - it has tangible benefits.

Ted

p.s. - there is still lots of interesting opportunities to extend the paradigm

A copy of Paul Schultz's paper, "Who Makes the Market," is now
available.  The paper to can be obtained (by Monday for sure) from Felicia
Jones (Economics), Latha Ramchand (University of Houston), and Vince
Kaminski (Enron) or Barbara Ostdiek (everyone else).

Paul's seminar is Friday, March 30, at 3:30 in Room 201 (note the room 
change).

The abstract of the paper is copied below:

Abstract

"I provide evidence that Nasdaq dealers make markets in the stocks in which
they receive order flow.  Several variables used to proxy for the stocks
that individual market maker's brokerage customers would trade, including
trading volume, location, underwriting participation and analyst coverage,
are significant determinants of market marking activity.  Informational
advantages may also be a factor in the market making decision as evidenced
by dealers specializing in stocks in specific industries.  Some potential
problems that arise when researchers ignore the integration of market
making with brokerage, securities analysis and underwriting businesses are
discussed."

David,

I am leaving for vacation this weekend and I haven't received the copy of 
your presentation yet.
The window during which I could make changes to my presentation is closing 
very fast. Let's
do the following: I shall keep my presentation as is (this means that I shall 
use the copy of my 
presentation I sent to Dawn Scovill  and you this week). If there is an 
overlap between our presentations, so be it.

Dawn, please use the copy of my presentation I sent you earlier this week.

Dawn,

I met David Sobotka from Koch this morning and we talked about  coordinating 
our presentations.
This means there will be changes intended to avoid overlaps. Sorry for that. 
The portions of my presentation
will survive (those about valuation paradigms) and I shall add a few more 
pages on accounting treatment of weather derivatives
plus more specific examples. David will cover primarily market evolution + 
plus examples of some
standard structures, and we shall both give more interesting examples of
specific deals executed by our companies.

I shall send you an updated version of my part next week. Let me know what 
the deadline is.

Vince

Thanks -- would you like me to include these in the conference book? or do
you anticipate changes?

Clayton-

Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  There are a couple of things to 
keep in mind:

 -Enron IT supports Enron equipment.
 -All equipment must be purchased through "Enron IT Purchasing"

Our current high end desktop is a 800 MHZ pentium III machine with 128M of 
RAM.  You can bump up the RAM to whatever you feel is appropriate. When the 
1GHz processors come out (in the very near future) that will become our 
standard.

What we want to avoid is getting equipment that we do not have a image for.  
The "image" is the complete package of software that we put on a machine when 
it is deployed.  If you go out and buy a machine that we do not have a image 
for, we can't support it for a multitude of reasons. 

Hopefully this answered your questions/concerns.

If not, please call me so that we can discuss this further.

Thanks

I have developed a model for Enron that requires ultra-high-end PC 
performance (it does many calculations in Excel), and my boss has authorized 
me to buy whatever PC I need. I'm looking at the Compaq 850, but Richard (our 
floor rep) says no PC's over the 600 series will be supported by IT. I need 
to resolve this issue; we are sophisticated buyers, we know the type of 
machine we want, and we have the money to pay for it.

Dear all,

Firstly, apologies for the delay in finalising this study; a considerable 
amount of data analysis was required.  The idea is to aggregate monthly, 
weekly and daily volatilities such that we can price individual options on 
half hours into the future.  We have a reliable methodology for the monthly 
vol curve at the EFA slot level.  The first issue to address was to use a 
"reverse basvol" to estimate the monthly vol curve at the half-hourly level 
of detail.  This required an estimation of half-hourly price return 
correlations.  This resulted in a scaling factor of approximately 1.30 that 
is applied to all EFA vols to convert to half-hourly (the scaling factors are 
slightly different by EFA slot, but not by nearly as much as might be 
expected). 

For the weekly and hourly half hourly vols, a historical analysis was carried 
out on the past few years data; a weighting-scheme was applied to add more 
emphasis to standard deviations calculated on more recent data.  

COMBINING THE VOLATILITIES
The idea is to let the monthly vol curve get us to the start of the month and 
then assume that all half hours are positioned at 2 weeks and 3 days into the 
next month.  The volatility is aggregated using these time-weightings to 
ensure that we don't have a wildly different volatility for the options at 
the start of a month and at the end of a month.  Below is an example for half 
hour #38:

I put the spreadsheet HalfHourlyVolModel.xls into the public directory, 
S:\RESEARCH\ANJAM\HHOPTIONVOLMODEL\. I suggest we use the matrix of forward 
volatilities on the summary page and see what kind of numbers we get.  There 
may need to be some fine-tuning of the time-weightings, but in general, I 
believe we can start utilising these semi-final numbers.

Regards,

Anjam

Hi Vince

I met with Thomas this morning (I gave you his CV before, though I don't know 
if you had time to read it).  He's extremely interested in moving to Enron, 
and accepts that our work is far less academic than his postdoc research, 
although far broader than his investment banking quant experience.  He 
remains interested, and emphasised he wants to stay close to the traders, but 
wants to look at new markets and products.  I think we should seriously 
consider hiring him.  He is (understandably) reluctant to move to Houston, 
but there's no doubt that there is plenty of (unnmet) demand for derivatives 
pricing (and thinking) here in London.

Would you be interested in my setting up a videoconference in the next couple 
of weeks so you have a chance to chat with him?  I'm meeting with him again 
on Tuesday at an academic quant finance seminar organised by Lane at King's 
College.  I've attached his CV for your reference.

All the best,
Steve

Vadim,

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: JASON MESERVE on
SECURITY AND BUG PATCH ALERT
TODAY'S FOCUS: 'South Park' virus on the loose
03/13/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: 'South Park' virus on the=20
loose
It's been a year since the infamous "Melissa=018 virus downed e-mail
systems nationwide and caused some panic in the general Internet
populace. In the year since, we have a number of copycats and variants
of Melissa invading our e-mail systems, though not to the same extent.

Now, the e-mail virus du jour is the "South Park" virus, named after
the animated series on Comedy Central. The South Park virus, known in
security circles as W32/Pretty.worm.unp, attempts to send itself to all
the addresses listed in an infected user's Outlook address book every
thirty minutes. By doing so, the virus causes an "e-mail storm" that
can bog down and crash network servers attempting to relay the flurry
of mail. South Park appears to come from a known user and contains an
icon featuring Kenny, one of the characters from the show.

Security software maker Finjan Software has reported seven variants of
the South Park virus, which itself is a variant of the PrettyPark virus
that made the rounds a few weeks earlier.

For more information on South Park and its variants:
http://www.nwfusion.com/news/2000/0306southpark.html
http://www.finjan.com/attack_release_detail.cfm?attack_release_id=3D32

Before we get to the latest alerts, two other resources to check out:

1. The Shmoo Group, a security consultancy, has written a paper entitled
"How to Write Secure Code." It can be found at:
http://www.shmoo.com/securecode/

2. Eric Knight of Security Paradigm has written an online book entitled
"Computer Vulnerabilities." The book looks into how hackers exploit
vulnerabilities and what methods they use. Knight's book is available in
PDF format at:
http://www.securityparadigm.com/compvuln_draft.pdf

Now on with the latest alerts and patches:

W97M/Melissa.AO virus

Computer Associates is reporting a new version of the Melissa
macrovirus that could be making the rounds. This one disables the
Tools/Macro command bar, Virus Protection, SaveNormalPrompt and
ConfirmConversions options in Microsoft Word. It also makes a couple of
changes to the Windows registry. Like the original Melissa, this
version replicates itself to the first 25 users in the Outlook address
book.
http://www.ca.com/virusinfo/
***********

Microsoft had a busy week, releasing three patches covering a variety
of problems:

1. Patch available for "Registry Permissions" vulnerability.

It seems as if the security on a couple of registry settings in Windows
NT 4.0 is not as secure as the Redmonians first thought. This patch
fixes the problem, which could let a malicious user gain additional
privileges on a system they are logged into.
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/fq00-008.asp

2. Patch available for "SQL Query Abuse" vulnerability.

This patch for Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and Microsoft Data Engine 1.0
plugs a hole that could enable a remote user to author malicious SQL
queries that allow the user to take unauthorized actions against on the

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE
Today's Focus: Btrieve free ride ends
03/14/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: Btrieve free ride ends
NetWare has shipped with Btrieve (originally a flat-file database
system, now grown into a full-fledged relational database system) since
the days of NetWare 2 some 12 years ago. Many independent software
vendors have relied on this and constructed their NetWare applications
to use the built-in facilities Btrieve afforded.

Originally licensed from its creator, Softcraft, Novell bought Btrieve
outright in the late =01+80s, then sold it off 10 years later to some of
the original developers, now incorporated as Pervasive Software.
Pervasive has, essentially, retired the Btrieve name in favor of
"Pervasive SQL 2000," a true relational database system which
nevertheless still purports to support applications written to the
Btrieve 6.x specification.

A major change has been introduced in NetWare 5.1, however. There is no
longer an unlimited-use version of the database included. Novell still
uses Btrieve technology for (among other things) its installed products
database (sys:system\products.dat is the file), but NetWare 5.1
includes only a two-user license for SQL 2000  enough for the
administrator to add new products and services, but not enough for any
Btrieve-based applications the network might be running.

There is an unlimited-use version of SQL 2000 included, but it=01,s an
evaluation version only. It will time out after 90 days. Full-use
licenses may be purchased from Pervasive Software (or your software
vendors may provide them), but unsuspecting network administrators
could be caught off-guard when applications stop working.

For the adventurous, there is an unlimited-use version of Btrieve 6.10
included with the NetWare 5.1 distribution. But Novell admits it hasn't
tested the software with NetWare 5.1, it may not work, and  the real
killer  most current applications (such as Computer Associates
ArcServe) require Btrieve 6.15.

Check the applications you're using before doing that upgrade to
NetWare 5.1, and calculate the additional costs of obtaining the
requisite number of SQL 2000 licenses. Then, decide if that's what you
want to do, or if switching to a different application is the better
choice.

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: PHIL HOCHMUTH
on LINUX
Today's focus: Will Linux be a hit or miss on the corporate desktop?
03/15/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's focus: Will Linux be a hit or miss=20
on the corporate desktop?
So far this year, the buzz about Linux in enterprise networks has
focused on servers and embedded systems, with the growth of Linux
severs being most heralded. According to IDC, a research firm based in
Framingham, Mass., Linux was the fastest-growing server operating
system last year, with a 93% growth rate over the year before. Linux
was the second most-shipped operating system in 1999 after Windows NT,
capturing 24% of new licenses shipped.

As for the embedded market, Linux has emerged as an ideal platform for
network appliances, because the system can be modified to handle
specialized, dedicated tasks very well. Companies such as Cobalt
Networks, Picazo and Progressive Systems have announced Linux-based
appliances, ranging from Web servers to PBXs to firewalls.

But what of the open source hacker=01,s dream of =01&Linux on every desktop=
?=018

Sure, Linux on the desktop has become more accessible than ever, with
colorful, shrink-wrapped boxes of Caldera, Red Hat and Corel Linux now
available at places like CompUSA. However, analysts have said that
Linux=01,s growth in the enterprise will be limited to the macro and micro
areas of network servers and embedded operating systems.

According to IDC, Linux currently runs on only 4% of U.S. desktops. The
hold Microsoft Windows has on the desktop market will remain strong,
analysts say, despite such factors as Microsoft=01,s antitrust problems
and the surging popularity of Linux.

Even some Linux executives are skeptical of their product=01,s desktop
future. Recently, SuSE CEO Roland Dyroff downplayed Linux=01,s future on
desktops. Dyroff said, =01&given the lack of applications available, we
really can't claim it as being competitive on the desktop yet.=018

A recent survey by Survey.com gives more hope for Linux desktops.
According to the survey of 1,640 enterprise network managers, open
source operating systems are used on 10% of desktops, with the number
jumping to a surprising 23% of enterprise desktops by 2002.

Despite the mix of numbers being thrown around, two important factors
that will determine the success of Linux as an enterprise client
desktop are: a standardized, easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI)
and available applications.

One company that is working to make Linux more user friendly is Palo
Alto-based Eazel, which is designing a next-generation file management
system and user interface to run on top of the Linux kernel. According
to Eazel=01,s Web site, the company=01,s goal is to bring Linux to the mass=
es
and =01&do it in a way that appeals to today's Linux users and to mere
mortals.=018

The company was founded by a group of former Apple executives, and is
allied with the Gnome project, which has been doing extensive Linux
desktop environment development for several years. Eazel is due to have
a product out by the middle of this year. With an intuitive, icon-based
file management environment, Eazel is hoping its user interface will be
an improvement over the two current Linux GUIs, Gnome and KDE, and will
help standardized the look and feel of Linux for =01&regular=018 users. For
enterprise mangers who have already embraced Linux on the server side,
this development will be worth keeping an eye on.

On the applications side, several office productivity suites have been
available for some time, such as Sun=01,s StarOffice suite and KOffice for
the KDE desktop. Corel has also ported its office products, such as
WordPerfect, over to Linux to complement its own distribution of the
operating system. While there have been recent rumors (started by Linux
Care Vice President Arthur Tyde) that Microsoft is working on a port of
MS Office to Linux, Microsoft officials deny this.

While Linux may never supplant Windows as the industry-standard desktop,
there should be plenty of opportunity for Linux PCs in enterprise nets
in the future.

Dawn,

I met David Sobotka from Koch this morning and we talked about  coordinating 
our presentations.
This means there will be changes intended to avoid overlaps. Sorry for that. 
The portions of my presentation
will survive (those about valuation paradigms) and I shall add a few more 
pages on accounting treatment of weather derivatives
plus more specific examples. David will cover primarily market evolution + 
plus examples of some
standard structures, and we shall both give more interesting examples of
specific deals executed by our companies.

I shall send you an updated version of my part next week. Let me know what 
the deadline is.

Vince

Thanks -- would you like me to include these in the conference book? or do
you anticipate changes?

Joel Brown <energyrisk@earthlink.net> on 03/08/2000 11:00:42 AM
Vince,

Thanks for taking the time to look at these initial results.  They are
based on the Cal PX volumes and unconstrained market clearing price
(UMCP).  Any commercial application would involve Cal ISO loads and
zonal prices, a relatively straight-forward extension of the work.

Currently I'm working on modifying the deterministic portion of the
power price to account for the sharp increase in oil and gas prices
since last year.  I'll let you know if I make any headway in that
effort.

I'd appreciate any feedback you might have regarding these results.

Thanks Again,

Hi Vince:

 I haven't talked to you in a while and wanted to touch base with you on a
couple of issues.

1. Is there someone at Enron who would be interested in speaking to our
MBAs about real options? Jim Dyer from our management science group is
interested in having someone for his decision analysis class this spring.
Also, I am thinking about having a panel discussion in the Fall on
valuation issues.

2. I recently received a phone call from the editor of the Journal of
Applied Corporate Finance, which is a practioner journal sponsored by the
Bank of America and Stern Stewart which is distributed to academics and
major corporations.  They are doing a special issue on Energy and are
interested in an article on how energy derivatives are used for risk
management.  Are you aware of anyone from Enron who has written such an
article?

3. Last fall when you visited us at UT we discussed the possibility of
giving lectures to Enron employees on valuation.  Ehud and I sent you a
proposal but didn't get a response.  Is there still an interest in this.

4. Murray Carlson and I are developing a general equilibrium model that we
think is potentially useful for valuing oil and gas derivatives as well as
real investments.  If you think this approach might be potentially useful
for Enron, we would be interested in presenting our model to your research
group.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Hello Vince,

It was nice seeing you at Stanford and many thanks for the lunch
we had together. I really enjoyed our discussions, both at the
technical level and otherwise.

I promised to send you an e-mail regarding possible dates for
a visit to Enron. I delayed it for a week till my schedule was
clearer. Let's see if we can get a match with your schedule -
mine is rather terrible:

Friday, 21st of April looks good. But April 23rd is Easter
Sunday, so that may make it difficult for some people at Enron
to be around. Let me know if that is the case. I am willing to
visit then, because the week after that I am scheduled to be in
Japan and in the previous weeks I am all committed on Fridays.

Friday, 19th of May is the next possibility, but this probably
is too far out. The main problem is that I am operating within
a window of opportunity for attracting top students for this
research. This window closes by the end of April, and it would be
important for the student support funds to be in place then, so
that I can make hard commitments to students and attract top
talent. I am already reviewing files of students who have
approached me for PhD advising, and I am in a mode of doing "soft
commitments to star-level students" to get this research and its
potential on their radar screen. Top students are highly sought
after by advisors and I want to be an early player in this
competition.

Does my visit to Enron have to happen before we can set up the
project and student support at Stanford? If so, doing it before the
end of April is important for getting top people. If the visit can
happen after we get the ball rolling, then we can schedule it in May.
I assume there will be multiple visits both ways when the project gets
going. Please let me know what you think.

Best Regards,

Nick

SHOPPING AROUND THE WEB

Electronic commerce is still so young that teething troubles were
only to be expected. But just watch it grow, argues our survey:

Celeste,

I was under the impression I sent you a message regarding Brad Romine but
I cannot find a copy in my msg folder. There might have been a glitch in the 
CC-mail
and the message did not go through and wasn't  stored.

I wanted to make the following points:

1. Brad will not show up on March 15. He is still working on his dot-com 
business and wants to
pursue this opportunity.

2. My recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand. Either Brad 
or a stipend
refund check should show up on March 15.

3. I told Brad that  a failure to show up on March 15 will not imperil his 
future employment opportunities
with Enron. We just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource 
needs. If he decides to re-apply
at some point in the future, we shall not hold his  decision  to pursue him 
entrepreneurial plans against him.

Please, let me  know what you think.

Vince,

I will not be able to attend on this weekend (April 15), but I think the main 
point is for John's guys to meet the rest of our group.   Most of them know 
me already.

--Stinson

Ravi Thuraisingham@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 03/06/2000 04:29:34 PM
Hi John, as per our discussion and e-mails, I am suggesting the following 
dates for the subject offsite:  April 14 & 15 th (Friday & Sat).  Place and 
agenda to follow once this date is nailed up.   The heads of each group will 
decide who will attend.  We would also invite Kevin Hannon, Scott Yeager, Tom 
Gros, Ted Seitz and Jean Mrha once the dates and agenda are agreed upon by 
the Technical folks.

As before, the idea is to introduce the two of the most technical groups 
within Enron and to exchange ideas and issues.  The Enron research team will 
provide trading and modeling presentations and the Optical Network 
Engineering team will present networking and components related topics.

Take away from the two days will be to provide John Griebling's group with 
better understanding about how the trading markets have developed in general 
and energy markets in particular via Enron (i.e.,  how the sausage was 
made!).  Likewise, John's group will provide us with better understanding of 
optical networking from a technical perspective.  Particularily, how EBS is 
planning to develop the Puplic Switched Optical Network (PSON) that John has 
'branded' our pooling point based network!

Please reply ASAP if these two days (April 14 & 15) will work.  Additionally, 
John, is the original suggestion to hold it in Scott Yeager's cabin somewhere 
up in Colorado mts. still holds?  If yes, I should probably let Scott know!  
If not, I'll try to find other places--any suggestions, anyone? 

Regards,

Ravi.

Ravi,

It's fine with me. I think the expense is justified (as it's equal to the 
cost of the alternative).

Vince

Ravi Thuraisingham@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 03/09/2000 12:44:01 PM
FYI, I may have to stay over weekend. Vince, if that is the case, I may have 
to bring my wife or allow her to go to her sister for a week etc.  I may ask 
John to cover some of that cost as (I think) he is done with other people. 
I've seen other guys family members showup. This cost would equal what EBS 
would have spend to send me home and bring me back again, etc.

Ravi.

Sent by: gappy@Stanford.EDU
Ms. Roberts, thanks for the quick reply! I received the offer on Thursday, 
and I
am very excited about joining Enron this summer. My research group is
establishing a long term collaboration with Dr. Kaminski and Dr. Gibner, and I
hope to help foster this relationship this summer.
I would just like to discuss one issue that is very specific to my status of
international student. As an international student, I am required to enroll 
part
time at Stanford University during the summer quarter in order to be 
considered
eligible for a summer internship ("optional practical training"). The cost of
the part-time tuition will be approx. $2300 for this academic year. The past
summer, my employer (AT&T) matched this tuition cost in an effort not to
discriminate between international and domestic Ph.D. students. The offers for
summer employment I received this year have also been very flexible in this
respect. I would like to know if Enron could do the same; it would be of 
course
very much appreciated (given the notoriously precarious financial condition of
Ph.D. students). Yet, to make things clear, please rest assured that my
acceptance of your offer is not conditioned on your reply regarding this 
issue,
and that I intend to be at Enron this summer.
All the best,

          Giuseppe

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: MIKE JUDE and NANCY MEACHIM
on APPLICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS
Today's focus: What=01,s holding back ASP adoption?
03/08/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's focus: What=01,s holding back ASP=20
adoption?
The application service provider (ASP) market has been growing by leaps
and bounds.  What used to be a nascent market has expanded from
addressing niche enterprise needs to providing significant IT support
for many Fortune 500 companies.

However, there are still significant impediments to wide acceptance of
applications outsourcing.  Two major deterrents have to do with older
business concerns.

One significant problem that has been addressed only tangentially by
ASPs is the fact that corporate IT departments are, more often that not,
dependent on less than cutting edge technologies.  Many established
companies have, over the years, made significant investments in legacy
technologies.  The fury over Y2K attests to the high number of mainframe
computers still using first-generation code.  Such organizations may
have added a great deal of newer technology, but concerns over the older
applications may be preventing them from taking advantage of application
hosting.  Even if there were an ASP willing to address the entire
solution, including legacy systems, doubt about the viability of handing
off archaic yet mission-essential systems may prevent an enterprise from
handing over support of these applications.  While the ASP may offer a
more cost-effective solution, the fear is that it may not be able to
offer the depth of experience necessary to work with older technology.

Security is the second dynamic that tends to retard ASP acceptance.
Although most ASPs are able to maintain the proper level of security
necessary for critical information, many IT departments find the idea of
putting that information in the hands of a third party too daunting.
There are some businesses with huge IT investments that absolutely
cannot take chances with information leakage.  Local telephone service
providers, because of their Federal Communication Commission regulators,
come to mind.

A simple pitch of cost avoidance or cost reduction is rarely sufficient
to sway IT mangers in such organizations.  They are thinking about the
care and feeding of cranky old mainframes that run a million lines of
COBOL and manage highly proprietary customer information.  Only when
ASPs are willing to spend the time to understand the needs of such a
complex IT environment will they truly be able to introduce services
fully capable of addressing all the security and legacy issues involved.

Until such an enlightened ASP comes along, there are still several ways
to start moving to outsourcing for IT managers coping with a legacy or
highly sensitive environment.  First, consider whether a full
outsourcing solution is the only option.  It may be that there=01,s a
subset of the IT architecture that is appropriate for an ASP to take on.
It may also be possible to find an ASP to partner with and gradually
migrate support of legacy systems as the ASP learns the systems and
their requirements.

One thing is certain: legacy systems are not going away anytime soon.
It=01,s also just as certain that application service provision is the way
of the future.  ASPs let enterprises offload an expensive and time-
consuming technical function.

As the ASP market matures, this column will examine issues such as these
from both the user and the vendor perspectives.  To ensure we address
the topics you are interested in, we invite your comments and questions.

I'll understand it as
I may identify work that I think will be
beneficial to both of us.
Actually,
I have more ideas on the work, beyond the suggestion.
I'll work on it and send it in more formal way again.

I'll take steps to get work permit for those two months.

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: PHIL HOCHMUTH
on LINUX
Today's focus: Thinking outside the (server) box with Linux
03/08/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's focus: Thinking outside the=20
(server) box with Linux
Welcome to the first Network World Fusion Focus newsletter on Linux in
the enterprise. With the mountains of information available about Linux,
it can be hard for network professionals to keep up with Linux news that
is fresh and relevant to their jobs. Here each week, you will find Linux
industry news, tips and examples of how Linux is being used in
enterprise networks.  Jumping right in, this week=01,s topic will focus on
how Linux can be used to turn an old PC into a network router.

When people talk about a Linux box, what generally comes to mind is
either a server or client machine running some distribution of Linux.
One way for users to use Linux outside =01&the box=018 is with the Linux
Router Project=01,s distribution of the operating system.

The Linux Router Project (LRP) is a microdistribution of Linux (it fits
on a 1.44M byte floppy) that can be used along with some extra hardware
to turn a variety of low-end PCs into practical, useable network gear.
Additionally, as with most Linux distributions, the software is free.

A variety of different network devices can be put together using LRP.
For instance, using just an Intel 486 PC with a floppy drive, 12M bytes
of RAM and at least two network interface cards, LRP can be used to
assemble a 10M bit/sec Ethernet router. For higher speeds, a Fast
Ethernet router can be assembled with a simple Pentium 100 or higher,
along with 16M bytes of RAM and 10/100M bit/sec network interface cards.
LRP can also be configured as a secondary Domain Name System firewall, a
Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service and a WAN router with DSU
functionality. LRP routers support standard routing protocols, such as
Routing Information Protocol and Open Shortest Path First. Advanced
routing protocols are also supported, such as IPX for NetWare networks
and Token Ring.

Building a Linux router out of spare parts can be useful when setting up
a testing environment that requires the simulation of live router
traffic. It=01,s also more practical than disconnecting your live
commercial routing equipment for use in testing purposes. LRP can also
be put into a live production environment as a way to add extra routers
to a network for a minimal cost.

Because Linux routers can be built with standard PC components, the
materials to build one are likely sitting in a storage room or back
closet somewhere in your office. LRP is a completely free, open source
operating system  so if you can program, you can add functions such as
Multi-protocol Label Switching and load balancing to the router by
writing customized code.

If you are not a Linux hacker, odds are someone else has already written
the code for these types of functions. Start at
http://www.linuxsupportline.com
to find these kinds of modules. As with many free software products,
your best source of support for LRP will be the Web. An extensive list
of FAQs and tips on using LRP can be found at
http://www.linuxrouter.org/faq.

Since LRP is developed and distributed mostly by volunteers, download
access to the software is not always very fast. The easiest way to get
it is to log on to http://www.linux-howto.com, which has a search engine
for Linux documentation and free distributions. Type in =01&Linux Router=01=
8
in the search field, and it will let you choose what geographical region
to download the LRP software and source code from for optimal speed. You
can also try several of these mirror sites to download LRP:

ftp://ftp.cpwright.com/linux-router/
ftp://lrp.rutgers.edu/pub/linux/distributions/linux-router/
ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/distributions/linux-router/

COURSE 1:   Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management
Course Leaders: Dr Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland

Houston: 29-30 March 2000
London:  3-4 April 2000

Fee : STG 1950 / USD 2950

This is an intermediate course aimed at the Energy professional who is
familiar with energy derivative products but who requires the mathematical
foundations of derivative pricing and an understanding of the pricing and
risk management of energy derivatives.

This course assumes that participants are familiar with standard basic
option pricing theory (the Black-Scholes formula, Monte Carlo simulation,
and the use of binomial trees for option pricing).

The format for the course will follow our usual highly practical and
successful style of alternate sessions of lectures and Excel based computer
workshops. To facilitate intensive interaction, the course will be limited
to a maximum of 15 participants so early booking is advisable.

The Excel based computer workshops deal with oil and gas as well as
electricity derivatives and contain detailed calculations for pricing and
risk management. At the end of the 2 days, participants leave with a
diskette containing answers to all the workshops as well as valuable code
for pricing and simulation.

Registration fee includes: pre-course reading, course materials, copies of
relevant research materials, diskette with fully worked solutions to
computer workshops, lunch and refreshments.  Additionally, each attendee
will receive a free copy of Clewlow and Strickland's forthcoming book
"Energy Derivatives: Pricing and Risk Management" which includes

Ravi Thuraisingham@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 03/07/2000 11:28:07 AM
FYI:  

Note that the person mentioned in the text below (Ming Lung Lee) is very 
experienced in traditional traffic engineering work. He comes from MCI where 
he was responsible for modeling traffic etc.  It  appears that Sycamore 
finally got him.  One time they had lost him to Corvis (another optical 
equipment company), I guess Sycamore went back to him with a better deal!  As 
soon as this guy is available, I'll set up an all day technical meeting to 
hash out what needs to be done as far as optimization algorithm development 
is concerned.  I want to produce a technical requirement document to clearly 
outline what needs to be done to support dynamic, optical-switched-circuits 
based trading and streaming media applications, etc.  Having such an industry 
expert help us will help 'justify' internally all the the effort on the 
traffic analysis side that John Griebling has asked us to support.  Keep in 
mind that even though he is an expert in the field, the field that we need to 
play in has not develop yet. Even the emerging data based traffic (as opposed 
to voice where blocking of traffic is allowed) analysis is an order of 
magnitude more difficult (due to uncertain load), let alone trading such load 
(which we are planning to do!).  

Ravi.

... Sycamore hired a guy per Griebling's request, to work with you on the
design/planning piece of the business.  He will be contracted out to Enron
for a period of 6 months initially.  He lives in SF but will be traveling to
whereever you need him.  Jim, Griebling wanted us to set up a meeting
between you guys for Wednesday morning, if you have time.  His name is Ming
Lung Lee and he comes to us from MCI.  Let me know what works.

Hi Ravi.  Fair enough, we will make sure we keep you guys in the loop.  Let
Barb/me know which items we can offload to you guys.

First thing to be done is Barb will schedule a call between us and you all
to gain a better understanding of a number we are trying to back into with
the metro solutions (there are alot of options on our side and we need some
guidelines).  I already talked to John about this this morning so we need to
make some headway on that number.  Also, we are scheduled for a conference
call Wednesday morning with Griebling to discuss where we are at with
initial solutions for metro.  Would you like to join us?

Thursday night, we have a dinner tentatively planned (talk with Griebling
about who, where, etc.).  Friday we will be meeting all day at the Omni in
Interlocken.

Ravi and Jim, per my conversations with John, he is going to run point on
the metro solutions.  Dorn is swamped with other activities.  As for the
switching piece, we discussed our routing software on Monday and I think
that is all we are going to do until Ahi is done then we will set up a
meeting between our guys and the Ahi folks.  The expectation is that this
meeting will occur in the next 30 days.

Also, Sycamore hired a guy per Griebling's request, to work with you on the
design/planning piece of the business.  He will be contracted out to Enron
for a period of 6 months initially.  He lives in SF but will be traveling to
whereever you need him.  Jim, Griebling wanted us to set up a meeting
between you guys for Wednesday morning, if you have time.  His name is Ming
Lung Lee and he comes to us from MCI.  Let me know what works.

The best ways to reach me are my cell phone or text pager.  Cell is
303-619-2485 and pager is 888-467-6167 -- you can send me a text message
from either your pager (if you have a 2 way) or press 3 to get an operator.

thanks, Kristin

Hi Kristin, Jim and I will be in Broomfield, CO from tueday late ~ 10am
until
friday end of day.  We would appriciate being in the loop of any discussion
that
you may have with John and Dorn (provided that they can be shared with us).
Both
John and Dorn are very busy and you can help alleviate some of the
congestion by
send information directly to Jim & me.

Regards,

Ravi.

Thanks for the info.  We will walk through this information and I am sure we
(Brett and Barb) will have some questions as we are modeling with our
potential metro solutions.  When would you and Ravi be available for a
conference call on Tuesday to discuss?

Also, as far as a meeting, I am trying to recall what you are referencing.
Is it in regards to this or the switching piece?  Will you two be in Denver
all week?  We have a call with Griebling tomorrow regarding our routing
software, so I can talk with him about how he wants to handle this piece.

Talk to you soon, Kristin

NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: JASON MESERVE on
SECURITY AND BUG PATCH ALERT
TODAY'S FOCUS: BUG ALERT: WELCOME
03/06/00

Dear Wincenty Kaminski,

Today's Focus: Bug Alert: Welcome
Welcome to the Security and Bug Patch Alert newsletter!

Given the recent spate of high-profile denial-of-service and hack
attacks and the large number of people who have signed up for this
newsletter before this first edition has been even published, it is
clear that security is a major concern in the IT community  as it
should be.

With technology now being looked upon as a profit rather than cost
center, IT departments face more pressure to keep critical systems up
and running  as well as secure. No chief information officer or network
manager wants to have to tell the CEO that their e-commerce site has
been broken into and customer credit card data copied. Stories like that
tend to stick in a potential customer=01,s mind more than an expensive
Super Bowl ad.

It=01,s hard enough to keep up with the latest new technologies, never mind
latest security patch for your operating system or e-commerce
application. But we=01,re here to help.

Once a week we=01,ll publish a list of patches and alerts from all the
major vendors and security organizations with links to the source. We=01,ll
also provide other (hopefully) useful resources for the security-
conscious IT manager.

Comments and suggestions are always welcome! Send mail to
jmeserve@nww.com.

Now on with the latest patches and alerts:

Security glitch hits Foundry switches

From this week=01,s Network World: A security problem has cropped up in
Foundry Networks=01, ServerIron switches that make the devices susceptible
to denial-of-service attacks.

Read the story:
http://www.nwfusion.com/archive/2000/89454_03-06-2000.html

Download the patch:

********

New version of Apache Web server released

The Apache Server Project released Version 1.3.12 of the popular Apache
Web server this week. The new release fixes what Apache calls a cross-
site scripting problem that could allow malicious HTML tags to be
inserted into client-side scripts. Download the new version at:
http://www.apache.org/dist/
********

Problem with Linux htdig package

Both FreeBSD and Debian are reporting a problem with the htdig package
that runs on their respective platforms. The problem is with the
htsearch and could allow a user to read any file on the local machine
accessible to the user ID that the script is running under (which in
most cases is =01+nobody=01,).

For more information from Debian:
http://www.debian.org/security/

to download a patch from FreeBSD:
http://www.freebsd.org/ports/
********

nmh Linux package patched

Versions of nmh prior to 1.0.3 have a vulnerability that could allow
malicious users to modify the MIME headers in a mail message that may
cause nmh=01,s mshow command to execute arbitrary commands. A patch is
available at:
ftp://ftp.mhost.com/pub/nmh/nmh-1.0.3.tar.gz
********

Zombie Zapper 1.1 available

Zombie Zapper 1.1 helps shut down the Troj_Trinoo denial-of-service
client on Windows NT and Unix machines. More information at:
http://razor.bindview.com/tools/index.shtml
********

Problem with MySQL password authentication

According to the makers of FreeBSD, a vulnerability in the MySQL
database server (prior to Version 3.22.32) could allow anyone that can
connect to the database to access it without a password. More
information at:

Hi John, as per our discussion and e-mails, I am suggesting the following 
dates for the subject offsite:  April 14 & 15 th (Friday & Sat).  Place and 
agenda to follow once this date is nailed up.   The heads of each group will 
decide who will attend.  We would also invite Kevin Hannon, Scott Yeager, Tom 
Gros, Ted Seitz and Jean Mrha once the dates and agenda are agreed upon by 
the Technical folks.

As before, the idea is to introduce the two of the most technical groups 
within Enron and to exchange ideas and issues.  The Enron research team will 
provide trading and modeling presentations and the Optical Network 
Engineering team will present networking and components related topics.

Take away from the two days will be to provide John Griebling's group with 
better understanding about how the trading markets have developed in general 
and energy markets in particular via Enron (i.e.,  how the sausage was 
made!).  Likewise, John's group will provide us with better understanding of 
optical networking from a technical perspective.  Particularily, how EBS is 
planning to develop the Puplic Switched Optical Network (PSON) that John has 
'branded' our pooling point based network!

Please reply ASAP if these two days (April 14 & 15) will work.  Additionally, 
John, is the original suggestion to hold it in Scott Yeager's cabin somewhere 
up in Colorado mts. still holds?  If yes, I should probably let Scott know!  
If not, I'll try to find other places--any suggestions, anyone? 

Regards,

Ravi.

Vince and Stinson,

I checked the file and the maintenance that automatically renews on 4/1/2000  
is for the following products:

All 4 of your @GLOBAL licenses
SPAV
SWING

I will go ahead and contact FEA and see about getting the renewal invoice for 
these.  I'll send it to Shirley for payment once I have it.

The products:  @INTEREST, SEAPC, and SEAPP have not been on maintenance for a 
while.  FEA told us a couple of years ago I believe that they do not have 
maintenance available for these products any longer.  So, you don't need to 
worry about cancelling @INTEREST.

Also, just FYI - your @ENERGY.1 and @ENERGY.2 licenses have maintenance 
through 10/20/2000.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Otherwise, I will proceed 
with contacting FEA about you renewal of the @GLOBAL, SPAV, and SWING 
licenses.

Jana,

Thanks again for the invitation to join you at the Rodeo. It was a great 
pleasure
to meet you and your husband.

What   about getting together next week for a movie and/or dinner? I shall 
call you
later this week to find out when you are free. I have a trip to NYC on 
Tuesday and 
Wednesday, but Thursday or Friday should be fine.

I have  a speaking engagement on April 6 in Florida (a conference organized by
Florida Power and Light). This means I shall miss the meeting of
the Symphony Partners on that day. Please, keep me in mind for the following
meetings and I shall be very glad to join you.

Martin,

Thanks.

I did not find anybody in EBS who seems to know or be involved in any 
e-procurement issues.  In Enron Corp, however, there is an initiative called 
iBuyIt.  This is a system that Corp is deploying for e-procurement through 
Corp and ENA, and will get to EBS sometime late this year.

John Gillespie is in charge of the iBuyIt initiative.  Perhaps he is the 
appropriate contact.  I left a voice mail with him, but have not yet received 
a response.

Please, take a look at Question 3.
Who is the right person at EBS?

Vince

Jinbaek Kim <jinbaek@ieor.berkeley.edu> on 03/15/2001 01:12:32 AM
Dr. Kaminski,

Sorry for the late response,
it took me some time to coordinate things.
Finally, it's almost dont :-)
It turned out that from June to August
will be best for me for work at ENRON
(Say June.4 to August.4)

But I still need to know several things from your side.
Could you answer following questions?

First:
Is my suggested working period is OK with you?
If so, let me know what to do for settlement
during the period.

Second:
I got a list of work, I might be able to do for
DealBench team from Ross and Suresh.
I'd like to know it is still a valid work list:
The list he sent is as following:

> 1.  Write a paper in layman's terms that answers
> questions like the following:
> Benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and
> sellers, particularly in reverse auctions
> Explanation how multi-variable auctions are not
> as efficient as price-only auctions (is this true?)
> How many participants are recommended for a
> successful live auction
> What types of goods and services are best suited
> for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes
> Opinions on lotting strategies
> Trends in online private auctions

> 2.  Identify appropriate recent auction research (3
> or 4 papers out of the 90+ you provided)and obtain approvals from the
> authors to post on our site

> 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction
> literature (with hyperlinks?)

> 4.  Would you be willing to offer auction consulting
> services to our customers (if they are interested)

Third:
There is an e-procurement forum at Haas School of business,
in May 22. The chair of the forum is my advisor Prof. Arie Segev.
A person from Wells Fargo Bank will talk about Wells Fargo's role
in e-marketplace payment initiative,
where ENRON broadband services is also one of key players
along with Citibank.
He asked me whether you can contact a person at
ENRON broadband services, who's related to the initiative.
He wants to know whether we will have a speaker from ENRON
to see ENRON's perspective, in the Forum.

Here is a link to news related to the initiative,

http://www.internetweek.com/story/INW20000808S0001

Fourth:
My advisor wants to know whether
there could be any opportunity to do a case study,
regarding ENRON's business.
He is interested in e-procurement and e-marketplaces.
Business model and System architecture...

Thanks for reading this long email.
I'll look forward to your answer..
I am sorry for giving you so much burden
to answer those questions possibly not easy to answer.

Warm regards,
Jinbaek

Go Bears!

Dear Dr. Kaminski,

I currently hold a post-doctorate position in the Mathematics
Department at the University of Texas at Austin (with a Ph.D.
in theoretical physics). Although my position here is renewable
until summer 2001, I would like to move on to a more dynamic field
where I can still use my analytical skills and mathematical knowledge.
Since attending a series of lectures on mathematical finance given
by Dr. Marc Potters last summer I started studying the subject on my
own and found it intriguing and challenging.

I am interested in a position in your group (RAC) at Enron.
Last fall in a Career seminar at UT you mentioned that people who are
interested can send you their resume. If this is still relevant, please
find below my resume (in Word 97 and text formats).
Thank you for your time.

Yours,

SHOPPING AROUND THE WEB

Electronic commerce is still so young that teething troubles were
only to be expected. But just watch it grow, argues our survey:
http://www.economist.com/l.cgi?f=20000226/index_su7636

Where e-commerce wins hands down, and where it doesn't:
http://www.economist.com/l.cgi?f=20000226/index_su6868

There may be room online for established firms and for virtual newcomers.
But which ones?
http://www.economist.com/l.cgi?f=20000226/index_su3796

Amazon's amazing ambition:
http://www.economist.com/l.cgi?f=20000226/index_su6484

Can the web merchants deliver the goods?
http://www.economist.com/l.cgi?f=20000226/index_su3412

Everything has its price. The web can help you find out what it is:
http://www.economist.com/l.cgi?f=20000226/index_su1876

Before e-commerce can go global, it needs to overcome a few tiresome
obstacles:
http://www.economist.com/l.cgi?f=20000226/index_su0724

Retailers must change---or bite the dust:

Sounds like there are several Enron people very interested in our
seminar.  Many thanks for passing the idea around.

Do you think that these groups might provide some sponsorship?  I didn't
know whether you have already asked them and they are thinking about it or
whether I need to approach them directly.  I would appreciate any
suggestions you have.

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I enjoyed our discussion this morning. It sounds like there is a great deal
of overlap between Enron business units and my interests. I am very much
looking forward to meeting you and your colleagues. Thank-you for the
invitation to interview with your group.

Sincerely,

Bryan,

I talked to Vasant about the model review in London. He thought that he could 
accomplish this from Houston,
but I think direct  communication makes things much easier. I think his trip 
to London
makes a lot of sense. KMV confirmed the meeting on the 20th. We hope to get 
more information about
the scope of their model and assess its the applicability to your business.
Vasant, after a few days of immersion in your operations, will be able to 
assess better the usefulness of the
model.

vince - it is highly unlikely that I can make the trip but I spoke with 
vasant today and he will try to get to london beforehand and will have good 
idea of our needs.  hopefully this will not cause too many problems.

Stinson,

Should we get him as well?
It seems he has the right skills. 
We might have maxed out on the
number of summer interns through
the A/A program. We would have to
hire him directly.

Vince

Hi Ravi:

I had sent an email about a week back with my resume for the summer
internship. I think the address I sent it to was not correct, so I am
resending it. I will also tell the others in the group to send there resumes
to you. Thanks.

Regards,
Shikhar

Interview for Lee

FYI. 

Shirley (3-5290) is making travel arrangements for me.

It makes sense for all of us to stay in the same hotel, 
irrespective of individual travel arrangements

Vince

Dear Vince,

Thanks for your note.  I look forward to seeing you on the 20th.

We usually recommend our visitors to stay at the Park Hyatt on Battery
Street.  It's a 5 minute cab ride (or an easy 15 minute walk) to our
offices.  Should you decide to walk, it is important that you take Sansome
Street rather than Montgomery.  They are one block apart, but one goes up to
the top of Telegraph hill and ends before continuing at the bottom of a
cliff and the other is relatively flat and is continuous.  There are
detailed directions on our website (www.kmv.com).

See you on the 20th.

Regards,

Rob

Robert,

This is to confirm the meeting on March the 20th at 9:00 a.m. Enron will be
represented by
Bill Bradford, Bryan Seyfried,,Vasant Shanbhogue and myself.

Could you, please, advise me what is the best hotel where we could stay
overnight,
close to your location?

Vince:
 This is regarding Puneet Mathur who we interviewed last week and decided to 
make an offer to join the Retail research team. I called him to inquire about 
his current compensation. His current base salary is $115,000 with a minimum 
bonus of 20%. His last pay raise and bonus were in September 1999 and he is 
expecting a raise and a bonus this September. The offer we would like to give 
him ($85-90K base) is obviously way below his expectations. And I don't see 
how we can offer him what he expects from us ($125K base - on par with mine), 
as it would be placing him well above Ronnie & Osman who are definitely more 
experienced and, in my view, more qualified. Let me know what to do.

Thanks,
Krishna.

below for details.)

   Highlights:
DNRC Update
The DNRC has a whopping 330,000 members, each one so shockingly
attractive and intelligent that he or she can be used as a
defibrillator.  If you see someone whose heart has stopped, yell
"clear" then press your hands on the person's chest (do not make
the "honk-honk" sound if the victim is female) then start telling a
witty joke.  This method has never actually started anyone's heart,
but sometimes the bystanders get a kick out of it.

After Dogbert conquers the world you will have dominion over the
so-called In-duh-viduals. A DNRC member suggests that Induhviduals
above the age of 18 be called adolts.  I like that.  I propose that
the ones under 18 be called juvenile duh-linquents.

Shakespeare Hoax
I have come to the unsettling realization that Shakespeare was an
Induhvidual.  In case you haven't read any Shakespeare since you
were a gullible child, here's a little sampling of the Great Bard's
work from Macbeth:

-- start --

"That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
Hark! Peace!
It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd their possets,
That death and nature do contend about them,
Whether they live or die."

-- end --

Now, maybe someone drugg'd my posset, but I'm fairly certain that
none of that makes any sense.

When I was a kid, if something made no sense to me, I assumed the
problem was on my end. But now that I am an adult, and I know
everything there is to know, I realize that the source of most
confusion is Induhviduals - sometimes economists, occasionally
poltergeists, but mostly Induhviduals.

Maybe the word "bard" meant something different a few hundred years
ago and that's what caused the confusion - as in, "He was so full
of bard you could grow squash in his earholes."

Or maybe some Irish people attended Shakespeare's plays and said
they were BORED, but it came out sounding like BARD to the English.
That could've happened.

There's really no excuse for Shakespeare's shoddy work.  If you
were Shakespeare, and you had nothing to do all day but sit around
in huge pants and write plays, don't you think you could at least
make them comprehensible?  To me, that seems like the minimum
requirement for a play: The audience should have a vague idea of
what the actors are saying.

I'm certain that the fans of Shakespeare will tell me I would enjoy
his work if only I took the time to understand it.  But that's like
saying I would love polka music if I took the time to translate it
in my head into the sound of a band I like.

I guess I just expect more from my bards.

Induhvidual Debating Technique
Lately I have found myself in e-mail discussions with Induhviduals
who employ debating tactics that are very similar.  I suspect they
are learning these methods in some sort of top-secret Induhvidual
training facility.

The Induhvidual debating technique involves four steps:

1.    Exaggerate your opponent's statement into an absurd absolute.

2.    Make an inappropriate analogy.
3.    Change the topic to something easier to defend.
4.    Claim victory.

For example:

Me:           Vegetables are good for you.

Induhvidual:  That's ridiculous.  If you ate a truckload of
              vegetables all at once you would die.

Me:           No one eats a truckload all at once.

Induhvidual:  Let me give you an analogy. If you tried to swim
              across the ocean, and you didn't know how to swim,
              and you had no arms or legs, you'd never make it.
              Surely you can agree with that.

Me:           Um...that's different.

Induhvidual:  Ha!  So now you agree with me that swimming is good
              exercise!

The worst part is that not only will you be frustrated at your
inability to make your point, you will be branded as the person who
thinks swimming is bad exercise.

True Tales of Induhviduals
Here are some more True Tales of Induhviduals as reported by
brilliant and observant DNRC members.

True Tale 1
My company posted a notice next to the time clock.  It said the
company calendar had a typo, that the union-won holiday wasn't
really a holiday at all.  The company blamed the printer for this
mistake.  (Nice try.)

But that's not the funny part.  The first line of the notice said,
"Please Take Notice." So the guy standing next to me took it.

True Tale 2
There are two doors in the restroom at work.  One is the exit and
the other, on the other side of the room, is a closet.  The closet
door is clearly labeled "closet."

The other day I was using the restroom and I heard an Induhvidual
open a door and exclaim, "Darn it! That's the closet again!"

True Tale 3
My boss had recently learned how to use spreadsheet software.  He
proudly called me into his office to show me a new trick he'd
learned. At one point during his demonstration he was moving his
mouse toward himself and it reached the edge of his desk. I watched
in amazement as he deftly rolled his mouse around the edge of the
desk and underneath.

I stifled my giggling and politely said, "You know, you don't need
to do that with the mouse." Whereupon he took offense and said, "I
know.  I usually grab a book and put it next to the desk and roll
the mouse onto it, but I just can't reach my books right now."  I
said, "Yeah, that's what I do," and excused myself before I broke a
rib trying not to laugh.

True Tale 4
I attend one of the top universities in the UK.  My housemate
recently surpassed his usual high standard of stupidity.  He needed
to open a bottle.  After hanging around looking helpless, someone
handed him a wine opener (the corkscrew type) that had a bottle
opener on one end.  My housemate disappeared for five minutes and
reappeared with an apologetic look on his face.  "I've broken it.
I'm sorry."

Under questioning he confessed that he had been trying to screw the
corkscrew through the top of the metal bottle cap.

True Tale 5
A VP of our company stood up at our company meeting and asked all
employees to look over the new website to make sure it was
"grammerly correct."

True Tale 6
My friend asked to be moved to a cubicle in a quieter place in the
office and her manager agreed. A couple of days later, the office
manager came by her new cube, distressed. He said that he had
really messed up because he gave her a cube that was too big for
her level/title in the company. Her cube was for a P-2 engineer
while she was only a P-1. The difference in size was only two
inches, but still, something had to be done.

A few days later, the office manager returned and said that to fix
the problem, my friend would be promoted to P-2 so she would then
be in the right size cube.

True Tale 7
Recently the Southern Hemisphere was treated to a total lunar
eclipse. During this event one Induhvidual standing in my street
suggested that we photograph it. Someone explained that the moon
would be difficult to photograph because it was completely darkened
by the shadow of Earth.  Her response was, "What about if I use the
flash?"

True Tale 8
A customer returned to our wireless phone store with the phone she
had recently purchased.  She complained that the phone worked fine
for the first two days and then suddenly went dead. I asked her how
long she had charged the battery.  She replied, "What do you mean,
charge?"

Upon further interrogation it became clear that she thought the
one- year warranty on the battery meant it would last that long.

True Tale 9
This is a True Tale that involves a sign I spotted nailed to a tree
along a dirt road somewhere in Iowa:

          I lost 75 lbs.
          Free Samples!
            555-1212

True Tale 10
I recently went into a pizza shop in Katoomba (near Sydney,
Australia) that advertised, "log fire inside."  Next to the fully
enclosed, glass-fronted firebox was a sign, "Please don't touch the
fire."

True Tale 11
I work at a secure R&D facility in the electronics industry. One
day a sign at the guard's desk located in the front lobby said,
"Guard is on rounds.  Visitors wait here!"

Being an upstanding DNRC member, I took it upon myself to add (in
big, bold letters) "...and don't steal my laptop!!!"

True Tale 12
About four years ago we had a multiple choice test for one of our
digital design subjects.  A friend of mine had no clue in this
subject but could clearly see the answers of the person to his
left. So he copied them.

At the end of the exam we were informed that there were
TWO tests, alternating by row!  He had cheated off the wrong test!

But he got a good grade anyway!!  Why?  Because the person he had
cheated off had cheated off the person sitting next to him! Moral
of the story: Two Induhviduals make a right.

True Tale 13
The other day at the gas station, while waiting in line to pay for
my gas, I commented to another customer how expensive gasoline had
become.  Her reply was, "You know, it doesn't really affect me; I
always put in twenty dollars every time I gas up."

True Tale 14
I was in a meeting with a manager - one of those meetings where the
sole purpose is for her to make a speech and everyone to be
impressed - and she showed an example of how the figures would be
added up. It became apparent that she had no idea how you add or
subtract negative numbers.  I pointed out that the result of her
first example was wrong. What followed was a lively debate on how
you are meant to add or subtract negative numbers.  The prevailing
opinion was that there wasn't just one correct way of doing it, so
all the different manufacturers of calculators went with their own
conventions. I was told that my calculator worked differently than
hers. (And how many meetings have you been to that included a
concurrent test of two calculators?)

The meeting ended with her bemoaning the fact that she wasn't
getting any "buy-in" for her idea. A few days later she received,
anonymously, a picture of Prof. Stephen Hawking, with the caption,
"You must be at least this smart to invent your own branch of
math."

True Tale 15
An Induhvidual in my physics class did his math with a pen. He had
to use lots of Liquid Paper to cover the mistakes. It was
recommended to him that he use a pencil. The next day I saw him
covering his pencil marks with Liquid Paper.

True Tale 16
A few days ago I went to the copy place.  I needed 80 copies. The
guy told me that if I made fewer than 100 copies, each copy would
cost 4 cents. But if I made at least 100 copies I would get the
discounted rate of 2 cents per copy.

I told him to make 80 copies of the front of the document and make
20 copies of the blank back. I could use the blank paper later on
for other purposes. He probably never thought of this situation
before; he gave me an angry look but copied the documents anyway.

True Tale 17
While waiting for a subway train, I overhead a woman complain
about the service: "I leave my apartment every day at the same
time, and every day I'm fifteen minutes late for work."

True Tale 18
This is a direct quote from a newsletter I just received. It is the
summer vacation edition and includes this tip on a list of
"Luggage-Packing Secrets of the Pros."

     "SECRET TIP #3: Double the security of luggage padlocks
     with economical electrical ties. Since they must be cut
     to be removed, they're tamper-evident. (Remember to pack
     scissors!)"

Um...and where do you pack those scissors?

True Tale 19
After pulling a ditsy temp secretary off phone duty (she put my
phone number instead of the caller's on phone messages), I assigned
her to something safe: labeling files.  This task did not include
the filing itself, which would have required a thorough grasp of
the alphabet; it only involved affixing colorful self-adhesive
labels to the outside edge of each file indicating the contract
number. The Induhvidual cheerfully labeled throughout the
afternoon, completing 150 files.  The next day, my regular
secretary asked why our files had been sealed closed with colorful
self-adhesive labels.

True Tale 20
This is one I actually heard several years ago.

      "We've got to separate the weed from the shaft."

Invent Your Own Folk Saying
Sometimes I sit around inventing clever folk sayings in case I ever
need them.  Here are some of the ones I've come up with.  You might
have seen some of these in Dilbert books.

     I was happier than a kitten with a Q-tip.

     He was deader than a shrunken head at a Hackey Sack festival.

     I was busier than a beaver in a coffee lake.

     He changed more times than a baby in a beer-drinking contest.

     I was more nervous than a fan store owner with a comb-over.

     He was tenser than Jesse Jackson on Father's Day.

If you have any good ones of your own, send them to me at
scottadams@aol.com. I'll publish the best ones in the next
newsletter.

Dilberito
I've been reading a lot about Mad Cow disease.  Scientists aren't
sure what's causing it.  My theory is that the cows are mad because
we keep eating them.

The obvious solution is to eat Dilberitos instead.  They're
vegetarian, yummy, and have 100% of your daily values of vitamins
and minerals.  Check Dilberito.com for availability.

If your college cafeteria doesn't carry them yet, see if your
credits can be transferred to someplace that does.

Dogbert Answers My Mail
In this section Dogbert answers the mail that I am too polite to
answer myself.  These are all based on real e-mail.  The names have
been changed to make them funnier.

Dear Mr. Adams,

My boyfriend enjoys your comics.  I usually give him Dilbert books
for presents, and I was wondering if you had any books that would
be an appropriate fit for Valentine's Day?

          Heather

Dear Heavybreather,

It's a bit late, but I recommend the latest Dilbert compilation, A
Treasury of Sundays.  If that doesn't put your boyfriend in the
mood for hot love it's probably because you cut your hair short so
you would save time getting ready in the morning.

         Sincerely,

         Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

It's been a while since I worked at a company that uses buzzwords
and mission statements.  This one caught me off guard.  I thought
you might know the meaning...

           "OPERATIONALIZING THE STRATEGIES"

          Dennis

Dear Densest,

The phrase OPERATIONALIZING THE STRATEGIES can be understood by
breaking it down into its components:

OPERATIONALIZING = Remove internal organs using sharp instruments

THE = Put them in a paper bag

STRATEGIES = Light on fire, put on neighbor's porch, ring doorbell

         Sincerely,

         Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

I have totally missed the humor of today's Dilbert comic.  Please
point me in the direction of the meaning, unless you don't care, in
which case just ignore me. Or have Dogbert insult me in the next
newsletter. That would be neat too.

          Gilbert

Dear Goober,

Please give me your address and I will have the answer delivered to
your house immediately.  Look for it in a flaming paper bag on your
porch.

         Sincerely,

         Dogbert

[Note:  I swear this next letter is real.]

Mr. Adams:

I have looked at(read) dilbert for one month and to this day I have
found nothing(and I mean nothing) interlectual or funny about your
column. Are you trying to show us(me) how stupid we are by reading
this trash? Well, you have succeded in that endeavor---- but no
more----I read the comics for entertainment and a good outlook for
the day. Dilbert only diffuses that feeling. Thanks but no thanks,

Dear Hippopotamus,

I'm sorry you found nothing interlectual about the Dilbert comic

Rosemary Fitzgerald <rfitzgerald@IIRLTD.CO.UK> on 02/23/2000 10:50:48 AM
Dear Mr. Kaminski

I am emailing to introduce myself to you as the new producer for the PoweRisk 
conference. I am in the process of developing the draft programme for the 
2000 event, and this is the reason that I am contacting you.

Building on the success of last year's event, which attracted over 230 
delegates from across Europe and the US, PoweRisk 2000 will once again 
feature more than 50 leading power industry experts and academics world-wide. 
There will also be a comprehensive exhibition running alongside, cocktail 
parties,, champagne roundtables, in-depth workshops * and numerous other 
opportunities to catch up with your colleagues.

Throughout the course of my research, I have been speaking with many of the 
people who attended the workshop you led with Prof. Geman and Alexander 
Eydeland last year. The feedback has been extremely favourable and many 
expressed a wish to see you both participating in the main conference this 
year.

I appreciate that you have an incredibly busy schedule, and to this end, I 
wanted to contact you at this early stage with regard to the dates for this 
year's PoweRisk conference and to outline my list of queries to you, prior to 
calling your office tomorrow.  I would very much like to extend an invitation 
to you to deliver an address at this year's main conference. The conference 
will be taking place in Paris, on the 4th and 5th of October (with workshops 
taking place on the 6th)

The workshop topic last year dealt with the latest developments in risk 
management, pricing and trading of electricity derivatives. I would be most 
grateful if you could spare me some time tomorrow on the phone to discuss 
this area with me, and in particular the issues that you are finding most 
relevant to your work with Enron at present.

The need to build a programme which truly reflects the needs of the global 
power trading and risk management industry is clear in such a 
conference-saturated market. To achieve this we formed our Energy Derivatives 
Advisory Board last year for advice on all aspects of programme development 
and speaker acquisition. Chaired by Prof. Helyette Geman, the Board members 
currently include: Ehud. I. Ronn, Mark B. Garman, Dragana Pilipovic, Blake 
Johnson, Les Clewlow, Chris Strickland and Christian Vrolijk. This year we 
are expanding the scope of the Advisory Board and  inviting a number of new 
members*, including Jeffrey Skilling of Enron, Bruce Williamson of Duke 
Energy, Heinz Dieter Waffel of PreussenElektra, Harvey Padewer of Duke 
Energy, Alexander Eydeland of Southern Company Energy Marketing, John Shapiro 
of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Jeff Porter of Koch Industries

Donna,

Sorry to hear about it. I shall stop by tomorrow  to say hello.
It's too bad: so many good friends of mine will be leaving the comapny.

Vince

   

You have probably heard that our group is being broken up. Some people were 
put in other groups but I was not fortunate enough to be one of those 
people.  HR will try for the month of March to find a position for me within 
Enron but that is not likely to happen.

Tomorrow is my last full day here - I will be in and out for the month of 
March.

I am informing nice people that I like and you are one of those.

Robert,

This is to confirm the meeting on March the 20th at 9:00 a.m. Enron will be 
represented by
Bill Bradford, Bryan Seyfried,,Vasant Shanbhogue and myself.

Could you, please, advise me what is the best hotel where we could stay 
overnight,
close to your location?

So the day of love has passed and some of us are reveling in the piles of 
Valentine's cards we have received. Of course, all of mine are e-cards so I 
can only frolic near my computer not among the masses of paper greetings that 
shamelessly fall short of the sentiment our greeting cards convey (and no! I 
didn't HAVE to say that...)

International Women's Month is being celebrated this March. Make sure you 
send a card to the women who have inspired you. Remind them that their 
presence in your life has made an impact! Celebrate their existence!

Spring is on its way, which means, the end of those winter blues. Hooray! I'm 
so glad to have the beautiful, blossoming flowers and the allergic reactions 
to look forward to. It's time to invest in those tissues! But in all 
seriousness, I love spring. It's a time to regenerate, to plant and plan for 
the summer days to come.

I can't forget St. Patrick's Day. I have far too many Irish friends (or 
friends who, in the very least, like to "act" Irish) to let that one slide on 
by without comment. I'm already worried about the level of "party" I have to 
achieve to prove my "spirit"! Remember to enjoy this holiday safely (if 
soberly won't apply). Happy St. Patrick's Day!

 <<REAL OPTIONS VALUATION IN THE NEW ECONOMY>>

This is a draft of what I was thinking of presenting.  I was not planning to
go over any specific options or OPAs (these are covered by confidentiality
clauses and I have to be careful from a competitive standpoint) but to give
the audience a few of the "real world" applications and challenges.  I
welcome any thoughts or comments.

Ken,

It seems that there may be an Internet bias as well (more affluent 
and educated households are on-line).

One solution: develop a control group. Arm-twist clerical 
employees of the School to fill out the questionnaire
and also ask them to provide the questionnaire to their friends  and families.

Vince

Stinson,

The 1st presentation.

  - Dilberitos
  ------------------------------------------------

Stop the Vote Campaign
It's a presidential election year in the United States, and that
means it's time for me to "get involved."

This year I'm organizing a "Stop The Vote" campaign aimed at
preventing Induhviduals from casting ballots.  I'll borrow a
strategy used by all politicians: hallucinations of what the
Founding Fathers intended.

As you know, people were very wise in the 1700s. Unfortunately,
something happened that made us all idiots.  I blame television.
That's why we prefer to make our important decisions on personal
freedom based on the wisdom of dead, slave-owning dandies instead
of using our own defective brains.

We have no recordings of the Constitutional debates, but I'm sure
it went something like this:

---- Re-creation ----

Jefferson:  We haven't put anything in the Bill of Rights about
genetic manipulation, Internet encryption, in vitro fertilization,
or mandatory drug testing.

Adams: Just say "et cetera."  No one is going to read it anyway.

Hancock: Let's include something to encourage public nudity.  Cable
TV won't be invented for years and I can't wait that long.

Jefferson:  Okay.  I'll call that the right to bare arms.

Franklin:  That might be misinterpreted.

Jefferson:  Who's the world-class writer here?  I keep your stupid
Almanac next to my chamber pot, and I don't mean for the reading.

Franklin:  I am soooo sorry for making a suggestion.  By the way,
your house slave "Jeff" has your eyes.

All:  HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!

Adams:  You're all a bunch of asses.  I think you're giving me an
embolism.

Jefferson:  You have the right to ass-embolisms.  Hey, maybe I
should include that.  How do you spell it?

Dilbert TV Show Update
According to my e-mail, many Dilbert TV fans tape the show so they
have permanent copies in their tape libraries.  While Dilbert is
being taped, they watch other shows that are not tape-worthy.
Unfortunately, only live viewing of TV shows counts for ratings.
This isn't a problem for some TV shows, like "Wheel of Fortune,"
because their viewers use VCRs to crack nuts.  But the mathematical
sets of "people who can program VCRs" and "people most likely to
watch 'Dilbert'" are almost the same.  This has been a problem.

The episode airing February 22nd (9:30 PM EST) in the USA will
probably determine whether the Dilbert show gets renewed.  That's
the episode featuring Jerry Seinfeld as the voice of Comp-U-Comp,
an evil computer who has taken over a company and fired everyone
except the guy who guards the electrical plug.  Eugene Levy plays
the plug guard.

Jerry's lines are mostly written by Larry Charles, one of the
original writers for Seinfeld, now Executive Producer for Dilbert.
So if you liked Seinfeld, this is the closest thing you're going to
get.

And if you know any Induhviduals who are in Nielsen families this
month, please tell them that there's some sort of "millionaire
prize" for watching "Dilbert" and answering questions posed by the
voices in their own heads.

Dilbert Episode Airs On the Internet
As part of our overall pimping for the Seinfeld voice episode,
we're putting an entire show (The Merger episode) on the Internet
in streaming video, starting February 17th and running through
February 29th.  You can find links to it at
www.dilbertondemand.com.  You need the Windows Media Player, which
you can download from the site.

As far as we know, this is the first television cartoon show
streamed over the Internet in its entirety.  We made sure we didn't
research that fact too thoroughly so we could honestly say, "as far
as we know."

You'll need a reasonably fast connection, but you can view the
entire show, in bite-sized chunks, at your leisure.  Don't settle
for mere bragging about your DSL or cable modem connection;
DEMONSTRATE your digital superiority!  Invite a neighbor who has a
pitiful 28.8 modem over to drool on you.  If you wear a raincoat,
it's a strangely satisfying experience and you can hose it off
later.

If you know anyone recently involved in a merger, the Dilbert
episode on the Internet (The Merger) is the one they'll want to
see.  Find out what's in store for companies who seek "synergy."

True Tales of Induhviduals
I begin the True Tales section with a personal sighting.  I
recently came upon a local road that was closed for improvements.
Signs warned "Road Closed" and "Bridge Out."  As I turned around to
head for the detour, another motorist waved me down.  We rolled
down our windows and he shouted, "Do you think we should just move
the barricades and go for it?"

I don't know how fast one must drive in order to compensate for a
"Bridge Out" situation, but I decided not to try it.

True Tale 2
Some of our corporate policies have been rewritten.  Here's an
example from our expense reporting procedures.

"Receipts are required for all expenditures of $25 or more and, in
addition to this, receipts for a lesser amount are also required."

Editor's note: It sounds as if some of the people in the HR are
idiots and, in addition to this, the rest of them are too.

True Tale 3
We received a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency
stating that unless we provided answers to their outstanding
questions within two weeks they would recommend that our power
plant construction project not proceed.

Apparently they failed to notice that, a) we already answered the
questions, b) their approval had already been issued and, c) the
$600 million power plant had been built nearly two years ago.

Editor's note: If those are the sort of questions the EPA calls
"outstanding" I'd hate to hear their dumb ones.

True Tale 4
We had a Christmas raffle in the "Business Intelligence"
department.   The boss drew a number and called it out.   The
department statistician stood up to tumultuous applause and went up
to collect his prize.  Meanwhile, another employee -- who turned
out to be the real winner -- stood up to collect that same prize.
Upon investigation, the statistician for Business Intelligence had
confused ticket 593 for 539.

Editor's note: On the surface it looks as if the statistician is a
boob.  But he's the only one in the room who realized that 39% of
the time the real winner isn't present to win.  I suspect he's a
DNRC member just playing the odds.

True Tale 5
When a project is finished in my department we place a red dot
sticker on the folder to signify its completion.  One day we ran
out of red dots but still had a large supply of green and blue
dots.  Dots weren't used for any other purpose so I suggested using
the ones we have, despite their non-red color.  Color was
insignificant.  There were only five of us in the group, so
communicating the change would be easy.

My money-saving suggestion was met with resistance from cow-orkers.
 They pointed out that we've "always used RED dots" and maybe I
should check with the department manager.  I mentioned my idea to
the manager and he said I should "bring it up at the next staff
meeting."

Editor's note: Ironically, it's not a dot.com company.

True Tale 6
I paid for lunch with a credit card.  The manager put it through
the electronic card machine and got a "no dial tone" error.  She
tried again with the same result.  Then she asked me if I had
another card.

Editor's note:  That's exactly why you should pay for your lunch
using a phone company calling card.  They have dial tone.

True Tale 7
We tested our Y2K power contingency plans a few weeks before New
Year's.  The Induhviduals in IT didn't expect any downtime, so the
test was performed during the normal work day.  The idea was that
when power was cut, the six generators would kick on and we
wouldn't notice a thing.

Three generators failed to start. Two threw their breakers due to
the high load on them.  The last was overwhelmed when the previous
two cut out and threw a tremendous surge through the lines, blowing
up hundreds of light bulbs, frying fax machines, radios and pencil
sharpeners along the way.   The surge jumped circuits in our
industrial level surge protector and traveled through our "surge
protected" lines to every desktop in the company plus the server
room.  After taking out over a hundred monitors and almost forty
PCs, the surge proceeded to destroy our server room air
conditioner, four huge UPS systems, thirteen servers and both
AS/400s.  Several small fires started throughout the building,
including our now half-melted Christmas tree and our
molten-menorah.

The surge then jumped the lines into the main power grid, blowing
up two transformers, one of which fell on the IT manager's car
(poetic justice) and cutting power on the entire block.  The
remaining generator then proceeded to burst into flames, eventually
blowing up all six generators and burning up seven cars.

This all occurred within about thirty seconds and sent 38 people to
the hospital, cost the company over $650,000 in equipment (not to
mention the impending lawsuits), destroyed eight cars and caused
weeks of downtime.  Three people quit the company.  One woman is
still in the hospital with electrical burns.  The resulting
publicity got us on television in five states.

Editor's note: That story sounds too amazing to be true but I'm
printing it anyway under the theory that there's no such thing as
bad publicity.

True Tale 8
Our university library just got new computers. The library
thoughtfully provided headphones so students can listen to sound
files without disturbing anyone nearby.   The problem is the
headphone cords have been clamped to the desk in such a way that in
order to use them, you must have your head no more than six inches
from your keyboard. It is great fun to see the stu-duh-nts trying
to use them.

True Tale 9
I went to a Georgia DMV office to obtain a driver's license.
Customers are required to produce two pieces of ID.  I presented a
utility bill and a copy of my latest tax return, both acceptable
types of ID according to their published list.

The agent behind the counter said she could not accept my tax
return as ID because it was typed.  She said, "How do we know this
is legitimate?  Anyone can get a computer or typewriter to produce
this return."  I argued, unsuccessfully, that it was also easy to
obtain pens and pencils to create hand-written returns.  I was told
to come back with a hand-written return or another acceptable form
of ID.

True Tale 10
I went to a fast-food restaurant one morning for breakfast.  The
moment I opened the door, I was almost swept off my feet by an
overpowering odor of gas.  I struggled up to the counter out of a
vague sense of duty, and said  "You've got an enormous gas leak
back there somewhere!" gesturing towards the kitchen.

The girl behind the counter shrugged and said, "Yeah, I know, but
I've been here since seven o'clock and I've gotten used to it."

True Tale 11
I went to ask our new principal if we could have the Monday before
finals off as a study day.  We had always gotten a study day in the
past but it wasn't on the schedule this time.  He thought for a
second and then responded, "No, you have school that day."

True Tale 12
About a year ago I went to buy a video for a friend's birthday.
The video was rated for adult viewing only.   I was 15 years old,
but they sold it to me anyway.

When I got home I found out that my friend wanted the sequel, not
the original, so I took it back to the store.  The video clerk said
he couldn't return the video because I didn't look 18.

I was confused, so I attempted to clarify.  "So, because I don't
look 18 you're going to MAKE me take this ADULT-rated video, rather
then let me change it for the sequel that is NOT ADULT-rated?"

"Yeah, it's company policy.  If it changes we'll be in touch."

Eventually I convinced him he was breaking the law by selling me
the adult video instead of letting me exchange it for the non-adult
one.   As I left, the guy behind the counter yelled at me, "Next
time, don't watch the video first!"

It was still in its shrink-wrap.

Dogbert Answers My Mail

e-mail to me.  Some names have been changed to make them easier to
mock.

Dear Mr. Adams,

You were duped in your last newsletter.   Someone submitted a
supposedly True Tale of Induhviduals about a little boy and a
pager.  That is actually an urban legend more than twenty years
old.  Shame on you for falling for that.

        Jim,

Dear Chimp,

Just because it's an urban legend doesn't mean it didn't happen.
In fact, just this morning Mr. Adams woke up in a bathtub full of
ice and found a note saying one of his kidneys was missing.  It
wasn't stolen; he got talked into donating it to a celebrity
auction for the National Ear Hair Foundation.  I'm working with him
on learning to say no.

        Sincerely,

        Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

No offense, but no one will cry when you die because Dilbert is
just some goofy guy. Some of the biussness (sic) stuff is HARD to

Dogbert is so egotistical whereas Snoopy is so easy to know, and
Charlie Brown is not some GOOFY guy, if you know what I mean.

Dear Marsupial,

No offense taken. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to

Dear Mr. Adams,

What is that round black thing on Dogbert's face?  My friend says
it's his mouth but I say it's his nose.

      Floyd

Dear Flawed,

I get this question often, thanks to Mr. Adams' prodigious artistic
range.  Allow me to clarify some of the shapes in the Dilbert
strip.  In general, the black circles are dog noses.  The black
ovals are mouths.  Rectangles are desks or sometimes computers. 
When the ovals are turned the other way and are not filled with
black they are glasses.  Everything else is random.

I have already requested a transfer to "For Better or For Worse."
The dog mortality rate there is high, but I'm willing to take the
chance.

      Sincerely,

      Dogbert

Paulo Rocha e Oliveira <paulo@MIT.EDU> on 02/10/2000 12:04:56 PM
Stinson,

Thank you for your e-mail.  My phone number is (617) 492-9551.  

I graduated from Princeton University in 1996 (mathematics), and came 
straight to MIT for a
Ph.D. in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management.  In my first
three years I took all the required coursework in mathematics,
optimization, stochastic processes, etc., as well as a number of courses in
psychology (at MIT and Harvard).  I am working with Prof. Gabriel Bitran,
and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations.  In
particular, I am interested in the interaction between customers and
companies (hence the interest in psychology).  The (tentative) title of my
PhD thesis is "Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet", and I am
sending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that will
give you an idea of what this research is about.

Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to meeting you and your research
group next week.

Paulo

Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet

Objective:

To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold
on
the internet.

Motivation:

This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and 
optimization
models are not appropriate for internet-related businesses.  The technological
innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of
information
which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices.
Furthermore,
companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can
have access to.

The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue
faced
by internet companies.  Consumers usually search for generic products (e.g.
VCRs
or computers) without knowing exactly what they will buy.  Companies can show
different products and different prices to each consumer.  This type of
flexibility
was not available until the internet came about.

The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet.  The
methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of
other settings, such as pricing services.  Services are unique, and there are
many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a
given company.  Our model will help companies decide which services to offer
to which customers and how much to charge for these services.

Research Strategy:

Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components
which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies.  These
components are choice models and optimization models.

Choice Models:

Choice models describe how customers make choices.  The management literature
draws on two main sources for these models: psychology and economics.  The
common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic
elimination methods.  These methods consist of the elimination of options
based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice
remains.
These methods tend to be very context-specific and do not lend themselves very
easily to mathematical analysis.  Economists focus on utility-maximing models
that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological
models.
The most common economic model of choice is the logit model.  The problem with
these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how
consumer make choices on the internet.  The first step in our research will
be
to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between
customers
and companies on the internet.

Optimization:

Traditionally, the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a
certain planning horizon.  On the internet, the problem of maximizing revenue
still exists, but there is also a need to learn about customers.  Short term
profit is based on sales, but long term profit is based on how well you know
your customers and are able to retain them.  The optimization problem must
therefore include a short term component (sales) and a long term component
(learning).

Dear Vince,

I hope you are well and that things round at Enron aren't too hectic. It is
my pleasure to invite you to speak at Energy & Power Risk Management
Magazine Conferences' new event, Australian Energy 2000, addressing the
second Industry Briefing - "Learning from US experience: Lessons to be
learned from the restructuring North American markets". I appreciate that
you are speaking a lot for us at the moment (for which I am of course
grateful) but, when researching, yours was a name that came up repeatedly
as someone the market would like to hear from. I am hoping that perhaps you
might need to see Paul Quilkey at some point in July and that we can
provide you with another reason to cross the globe.

Rather like the industry briefing that you are giving at Power 2000 this
year in Houston, this address will be presented to the entire conference
before breaking into their streams.

Australian Energy 2000 will take a focused look at the latest problems
facing energy players, with the two in-depth streams I mentioned above: one
dedicated to energy pricing and trading and the other looking at risk
management and the latest business issues.

This conference will be of the highly technical level that people have come
to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage participation
from speakers in modifying the programme to suit the audience and issues at
hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please let
me know; any help would be gratefully received.

This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy & Power Risk
Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to attract the
leading market players by providing a first-class programme with top-rated
speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy industry.

I have attached a copy of the programme for your information.

Unfortunately my schedule for this event is very tight. Please let me know
if you would like to participate by reurn email as it is unlikely that we
can speak on the phone as I am currently based in Hong Kong. If you would
like to send a colleague, then I would be happy to discuss this but it
would be great if you could complete the EPRM grand slam by addressing our
three major annual events on three different continents!

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Joel Hanley

  India: Enron aftermath

   Business Line - 02/21/2000

   A Study of the Enron Project 

   * Publishers: Orient Longman, New Delhi * Price: Rs. 195

   THE Enron power project at Dabhol in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra has 
been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the
   inception of the project proposal in 1992; and the sordid tale ends only 
in 1997, with the Supreme Court of India refusing to even
   admit an appeal against the Bombay High Court decision, of December 1996, 
which while commenting that "This case has
   highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of Independence, 
political considerations outweigh the public interest and
   the interest of the State and to what extent the Government can go to 
justify its actions not only before the public but even before
   the courts of law" - yet dismissed a public interest petition against the 
project on the (purely technical) ground of res judicata, even
   though new facts, new arguments, new evidence of the violation of the laws 
of the land had been advanced by the petitioners.

   The fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and 
recorded, despite the petitioners adducing the required
   evidence, can only be termed as strange, perhaps bizarre.

   Abhay Mehta's simple, factual documentation - in fact a chronological 
narration - of all events, including the process of bending all
   rules, of subverting the law for promoting a project involving 
unparalleled future liabilities for Maharashtra, indeed for the whole of
   India - is not only masterly, it is devastating.

   It is a short, pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by 
all thinking citizens of this country. Barring the
   concluding chapter, the epilogue, there are no personal comments, only 
facts, disseminated from the original papers, mostly 'secret'
   documents.

   All documentation has been carefully, faithfully recorded, including 
extracts from supposedly 'top secret' minutes of cabinet
   committee meetings; and the specific violations of the law (which were 
opposed by a few public spirited civil servants, much to
   their disadvantage) have been pointed up. Apart from an introductory 
'Primer on Electricity' - introduced for the benefit of the
   layman, explaining some technical issues relating to electricity 
generation, transmission and distribution - and the background of the
   events of 1991, the foreign exchange crisis, and the aftermath of the 
crisis, the other fifteen chapters, three appendices and fourteen
   annexes of the small book (of 226 pages) packs in an enormous volume of 
factual information. The strange saga of the Enron
   project, and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single 
project poses for the country, need to be briefly recounted
   here, for essentially, it is the coming generation which would have to 
face the problem.

   The MSEB has contracted to buy - and if not used, to pay for - 2000 MW of 
electricity (for a period of 20 years) from the
   Dabhol Power Company (the legal entity set up by Enron, as an unlimited 
liability company registered in India, through a maze of
   intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more 'front' 
companies registered in various tax-free havens.

   Abhay Mehta has indicated the total payments to Enron over 20 years amount 
to $ 35 billion (at 1998 exchange rates, around Rs.
   1,25,000 crores) over the life of the project. One must record that: (a) 
crude oil/oil product prices have as of writing, more than
   doubled since the above calculations were made. A per the 'doctored' 
figures presented by the company (and its advocate), the
   charge per unit of electricity supplied, at the 1998 level of prices, was 
to 4.39 cent (per unit) as 'capacity charge' and 3.43 cents
   (per unit) for 'energy costs'.

   The former is indexed to the US inflation rate, and the latter to 
international fuel prices. The former may be assumed to have gone
   up only marginally (rounded to 4.4 cents per unit); we know that fuel 
prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999.
   Assuming the 'fuel costs' to have increased less than 100 per cent - even 
though international prices have more than doubled - we
   may assume (for 1999) energy costs of 6.85 cents per units, making for a 
total payment of 11.25 US cents per unit of electricity
   supplied by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to MSEB in late 1999, in Phase 
I of the project.

   Within another two years, at 2000 MW, the annual offtake (for 365 days X 
24 hours/day) would be 17.52 billion KWH; and at
   11.25 cents per unit, the total payment amounts to $1.97 billion annually; 
for 20 years, this workout to $ 39.4 billion.

   This is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or 
capacity charge. At today's exchange rate - about Rs.43.5 per US
   dollar - in rupee terms this works out to wore than Rs. 175,000 crores (as 
compared to Rs. 125,000 crores indicated by Abhay
   Mehta). This is the cost to MSEB in rupee; and to the country in foreign 
exchange as payment to just one project authority, for
   supply of part of the power required in Maharashtra.

   The really significant point to note in this connection is that this 
payment - and considerably more, depending on (a) future increase
   in'capacity charges' depending on US inflation rate, and international 
prices of LNGaphtha (for 'fuel costs'), and (b) depreciation of
   the exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis the US dollar - is obligatory; 
the assets of the MSEB, the Maharashtra government
   indeed, all assets of the Government of India (present and future) are 
mortgaged to Enron, by way of sovereign guarantees
   extended by both governments.

   The other significant point in this connection is that - as predicted by 
all independent Indian experts as well as the World Bank -the
   Enron project he forced the MSEB to cut its offtake of Tata Electric 
Company's and its own much cheaper thermal power
   already; in a postscript dated August 1999, Abhay Mehta has indicated that 
already, the MSEB had stopped buying between 200
   and 250 MW of power from Tata Electric (available at Rs. 1.80 per unit) 
and has had to backdown its own Chandrapur thermal
   power station (cost of this power being Rs. 1.20 per unit), while forced 
to buy more expensive Enron power at Rs. 5 per unit.

   The loss to MSEB on this count alone comes to Rs. 460 crore per year.

   This had in fact, been predicted earlier even by the World Bank.

   It is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was 
contrived, by a deliberate campaign of 'disinformation', of
   blatant lies, of sidelining of expert opinion, not only of independent 
experts but also the GOI's own official advisers in this matter,
   namely, the Central Electricity Authority as well as that of the World 
Bank, which was resolutely opposed to this project. The
   detailed facts, the letters exchanged in the above context, the pressure 
tactics adopted, the flouting of all procedures norms, even
   statutory provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, are all carefully 
documented by Abhay Mehta.

   Mehta correctly concludes: "We frequently blame external agencies - like 
the World Bank - for all our problems, when, as a
   matter of fact, we ourselves are our own worst enemies. In the instant 
case, the World Bank not only advised the Government of
   India against the project, it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of 
the total inadvisability of this project. In fact, one must note
   here that in 1996, neighbouring Pakistan, which had entered into a 
somewhat similar MoU with Enron, cancelled the project (and
   the Power Purchase Agreement with Enron), for a $ 670 million, 782 MW 
residual oil-fuelled power plant, even though that
   Agreement had stipulated Enron power supply at a fixed rate of 6.4 US 
cents per KWH over a 30 year period. (Note the
   estimated rate of 11.25 cents per KWH for Dabhol power for the MSEB in 
December 1999, which works out to around Rs. 5
   per unit).

   One could go on; but one must leave the reader to go through Abhay Mehta's 
crisp, factual, matter of fact narration of the Enron
   saga, and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the 
story, about 'The Next Round of Scams'.

   For quite some time, the ruling elite in India has been intent on 
'privatising' all public enterprises; and even 'utilities' are no
   exception. The 'unbundling' of infrastructure with a view to privatisation 
of all the 'profitable' segments. All this - as per the current
   'disinformation campaign' - is supposedly in the interest of 
rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply.

   The author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the 
Government - by the Torrent Group - of the Ahmedabad and
   Surat Electricity companies at less than one-tenth of the market value of 
the assets of thee facilities. Again, much like the Enron
   saga, all objections by the Finance Department of the Gujarat government 
were overruled.

   And, Abhay Mehta has predicated that this onslaught - the break-up of 
power utilities into three segments, generation, transmission
   and distribution, - with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the 
new thrust by the ruling elite, for reasons that do not require to
   be spelt out.

   Though Mehta had the examples of the Torrent Group takeover of Ahmedabad 
and Surat Electricity companies, and of the break
   up of the Orissa State Electricity Board before him, yet his statement can 
be stated today to be prophetic; the UPSEB is now on
   the firing line. The recent strike by the workers and engineers of the 
UPSEB in protest of the announced UP government decision
   to trifurcate the UPSEB; and the Union Minister of Power, Mr. Rangarajan 
Kumaramangalam's statement that the UPSEB is a
   loss making, inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities 
after the trifurcation - need to be noted.

   That 40 per cent of the dues of the UPSEB are from the UP Government; that 
tariffs for UP electricity supply are fixed by the UP
   government and not by the UPSEB; that the UPSEB does not have the cash 
even for routine maintenance as a result of the above
   - these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider. That the 
remedy for UPSEB lies in a different kind of reform and
   restructuring, is not even to be debated. The whole idea is to privatise 
the profitable segments, and to leave the public sector entity
   with all the problem areas, including rural energy supply. It is against 
this background that Abhay Mehta's book needs to be widely
   disseminated, read, and its implications understood.

   What is at stake is not a 'utility' here or a PSU there. What is at stake 
is the future of some 80 per cent of the have-nots in this
   country.

   What is at stake is the 'pillory' of the assets of the nation for private 
aggrandisement.

Dear Mr. Kaminski

I am emailing to introduce myself to you as the new producer for the PoweRisk 
conference. I am in the process of developing the draft programme for the 
2000 event, and this is the reason that I am contacting you.

Building on the success of last year's event, which attracted over 230 
delegates from across Europe and the US, PoweRisk 2000 will once again 
feature more than 50 leading power industry experts and academics world-wide. 
There will also be a comprehensive exhibition running alongside, cocktail 
parties,, champagne roundtables, in-depth workshops * and numerous other 
opportunities to catch up with your colleagues.

Throughout the course of my research, I have been speaking with many of the 
people who attended the workshop you led with Prof. Geman and Alexander 
Eydeland last year. The feedback has been extremely favourable and many 
expressed a wish to see you both participating in the main conference this 
year.

I appreciate that you have an incredibly busy schedule, and to this end, I 
wanted to contact you at this early stage with regard to the dates for this 
year's PoweRisk conference and to outline my list of queries to you, prior to 
calling your office tomorrow.  I would very much like to extend an invitation 
to you to deliver an address at this year's main conference. The conference 
will be taking place in Paris, on the 4th and 5th of October (with workshops 
taking place on the 6th)

The workshop topic last year dealt with the latest developments in risk 
management, pricing and trading of electricity derivatives. I would be most 
grateful if you could spare me some time tomorrow on the phone to discuss 
this area with me, and in particular the issues that you are finding most 
relevant to your work with Enron at present.

The need to build a programme which truly reflects the needs of the global 
power trading and risk management industry is clear in such a 
conference-saturated market. To achieve this we formed our Energy Derivatives 
Advisory Board last year for advice on all aspects of programme development 
and speaker acquisition. Chaired by Prof. Helyette Geman, the Board members 
currently include: Ehud. I. Ronn, Mark B. Garman, Dragana Pilipovic, Blake 
Johnson, Les Clewlow, Chris Strickland and Christian Vrolijk. This year we 
are expanding the scope of the Advisory Board and  inviting a number of new 
members*, including Jeffrey Skilling of Enron, Bruce Williamson of Duke 
Energy, Heinz Dieter Waffel of PreussenElektra, Harvey Padewer of Duke 
Energy, Alexander Eydeland of Southern Company Energy Marketing, John Shapiro 
of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Jeff Porter of Koch Industries

* (all confirmed and invited Board Members are past speakers at the ICBI 
PoweRisk event)

This year, I would also like to invite you to join our Energy Derivatives 
Advisory Board. In return for your evaluation of the draft programme and 
suggestions of possible improvements and potential speakers, you would be 
entitled to full branding as an Advisory Board member on the conference 
brochure and all conference documentation, first choice on speaking slots, a 
free pass if not speaking, and further discounted registration for clients or 
colleagues.

I will call your office tomorrow and would be very grateful if you could 
spare me a few moments to discuss the above proposals. I will also email this 
letter to you.

My contact details are as follows:
Tel: +44 171 915 5194
Fax: +44 171 915 5101
Email: rosef@icbi.co.uk

I look forward to speaking to you and very much hope that I will have the 
opportunity of working with you on this year's PoweRisk conference.

Yours sincerely

Rosemary Fitzgerald
Director, PoweRisk 2000

Vince/Stinson:

The following is an update on LJM deal:

1) I participated on a conference call with AA (Jitendra and others) and our 
Accounting/Credit Group (Wes, Bill Bradford and others) yesturday, in which 
we discussed the best approach for definining credit reserves at year-end for 
the puts we own. 
2) A big chunck of the meeting was dedicated to explain AA the details of the 
deal. Little progress was made on achieving the meeting's goal.
3) Apparently, Accounting did want to expose the calculation we made for puts 
value that considers credit risk - the two factor model we developed. That 
line of action was implied on a pre-meeting we had early that morning. From 
my understanding, Accounting argues that we should not make any credit 
reserve because we could not liquidate our position by year-end.     
4) At a certain point Jintendra suggested me to use a two factor 
MC-simulation for calculating the position with credit risk. The approach is 
actually a more simplified version of the model we have. I and nobody 
mentioned the results we got from our 2-factor model.
5) At that same afternoon I knew from Accounting that we are in a process of 
unwinding our position. 

These are the main points. Please let me know if need more details.

   A Study of the Enron Project 

   * Publishers: Orient Longman, New Delhi * Price: Rs. 195

   THE Enron power project at Dabhol in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra has 
been mired in nationwide controversy ever since the
   inception of the project proposal in 1992; and the sordid tale ends only 
in 1997, with the Supreme Court of India refusing to even
   admit an appeal against the Bombay High Court decision, of December 1996, 
which while commenting that "This case has
   highlighted to the people as to how even after 50 years of Independence, 
political considerations outweigh the public interest and
   the interest of the State and to what extent the Government can go to 
justify its actions not only before the public but even before
   the courts of law" - yet dismissed a public interest petition against the 
project on the (purely technical) ground of res judicata, even
   though new facts, new arguments, new evidence of the violation of the laws 
of the land had been advanced by the petitioners.

   The fact that the fresh violations of the law were not even considered and 
recorded, despite the petitioners adducing the required
   evidence, can only be termed as strange, perhaps bizarre.

   Abhay Mehta's simple, factual documentation - in fact a chronological 
narration - of all events, including the process of bending all
   rules, of subverting the law for promoting a project involving 
unparalleled future liabilities for Maharashtra, indeed for the whole of
   India - is not only masterly, it is devastating.

   It is a short, pithy book which deserves to be read from cover to cover by 
all thinking citizens of this country. Barring the
   concluding chapter, the epilogue, there are no personal comments, only 
facts, disseminated from the original papers, mostly 'secret'
   documents.

   All documentation has been carefully, faithfully recorded, including 
extracts from supposedly 'top secret' minutes of cabinet
   committee meetings; and the specific violations of the law (which were 
opposed by a few public spirited civil servants, much to
   their disadvantage) have been pointed up. Apart from an introductory 
'Primer on Electricity' - introduced for the benefit of the
   layman, explaining some technical issues relating to electricity 
generation, transmission and distribution - and the background of the
   events of 1991, the foreign exchange crisis, and the aftermath of the 
crisis, the other fifteen chapters, three appendices and fourteen
   annexes of the small book (of 226 pages) packs in an enormous volume of 
factual information. The strange saga of the Enron
   project, and the sheer magnitude of the future problems this one single 
project poses for the country, need to be briefly recounted
   here, for essentially, it is the coming generation which would have to 
face the problem.

   The MSEB has contracted to buy - and if not used, to pay for - 2000 MW of 
electricity (for a period of 20 years) from the
   Dabhol Power Company (the legal entity set up by Enron, as an unlimited 
liability company registered in India, through a maze of
   intricate crossholdings of equity by half a dozen or more 'front' 
companies registered in various tax-free havens.

   Abhay Mehta has indicated the total payments to Enron over 20 years amount 
to $ 35 billion (at 1998 exchange rates, around Rs.
   1,25,000 crores) over the life of the project. One must record that: (a) 
crude oil/oil product prices have as of writing, more than
   doubled since the above calculations were made. A per the 'doctored' 
figures presented by the company (and its advocate), the
   charge per unit of electricity supplied, at the 1998 level of prices, was 
to 4.39 cent (per unit) as 'capacity charge' and 3.43 cents
   (per unit) for 'energy costs'.

   The former is indexed to the US inflation rate, and the latter to 
international fuel prices. The former may be assumed to have gone
   up only marginally (rounded to 4.4 cents per unit); we know that fuel 
prices have more than doubled internationally over 1999.
   Assuming the 'fuel costs' to have increased less than 100 per cent - even 
though international prices have more than doubled - we
   may assume (for 1999) energy costs of 6.85 cents per units, making for a 
total payment of 11.25 US cents per unit of electricity
   supplied by the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) to MSEB in late 1999, in Phase 
I of the project.

   Within another two years, at 2000 MW, the annual offtake (for 365 days X 
24 hours/day) would be 17.52 billion KWH; and at
   11.25 cents per unit, the total payment amounts to $1.97 billion annually; 
for 20 years, this workout to $ 39.4 billion.

   This is not counting any further inflation in either energy costs or 
capacity charge. At today's exchange rate - about Rs.43.5 per US
   dollar - in rupee terms this works out to wore than Rs. 175,000 crores (as 
compared to Rs. 125,000 crores indicated by Abhay
   Mehta). This is the cost to MSEB in rupee; and to the country in foreign 
exchange as payment to just one project authority, for
   supply of part of the power required in Maharashtra.

   The really significant point to note in this connection is that this 
payment - and considerably more, depending on (a) future increase
   in'capacity charges' depending on US inflation rate, and international 
prices of LNGaphtha (for 'fuel costs'), and (b) depreciation of
   the exchange rate of the rupee vis-a-vis the US dollar - is obligatory; 
the assets of the MSEB, the Maharashtra government
   indeed, all assets of the Government of India (present and future) are 
mortgaged to Enron, by way of sovereign guarantees
   extended by both governments.

   The other significant point in this connection is that - as predicted by 
all independent Indian experts as well as the World Bank -the
   Enron project he forced the MSEB to cut its offtake of Tata Electric 
Company's and its own much cheaper thermal power
   already; in a postscript dated August 1999, Abhay Mehta has indicated that 
already, the MSEB had stopped buying between 200
   and 250 MW of power from Tata Electric (available at Rs. 1.80 per unit) 
and has had to backdown its own Chandrapur thermal
   power station (cost of this power being Rs. 1.20 per unit), while forced 
to buy more expensive Enron power at Rs. 5 per unit.

   The loss to MSEB on this count alone comes to Rs. 460 crore per year.

   This had in fact, been predicted earlier even by the World Bank.

   It is pointless here to go into the details of how precisely all this was 
contrived, by a deliberate campaign of 'disinformation', of
   blatant lies, of sidelining of expert opinion, not only of independent 
experts but also the GOI's own official advisers in this matter,
   namely, the Central Electricity Authority as well as that of the World 
Bank, which was resolutely opposed to this project. The
   detailed facts, the letters exchanged in the above context, the pressure 
tactics adopted, the flouting of all procedures norms, even
   statutory provisions of the Electricity (Supply) Act, are all carefully 
documented by Abhay Mehta.

   Mehta correctly concludes: "We frequently blame external agencies - like 
the World Bank - for all our problems, when, as a
   matter of fact, we ourselves are our own worst enemies. In the instant 
case, the World Bank not only advised the Government of
   India against the project, it stood resolutely firm in its assessment of 
the total inadvisability of this project. In fact, one must note
   here that in 1996, neighbouring Pakistan, which had entered into a 
somewhat similar MoU with Enron, cancelled the project (and
   the Power Purchase Agreement with Enron), for a $ 670 million, 782 MW 
residual oil-fuelled power plant, even though that
   Agreement had stipulated Enron power supply at a fixed rate of 6.4 US 
cents per KWH over a 30 year period. (Note the
   estimated rate of 11.25 cents per KWH for Dabhol power for the MSEB in 
December 1999, which works out to around Rs. 5
   per unit).

   One could go on; but one must leave the reader to go through Abhay Mehta's 
crisp, factual, matter of fact narration of the Enron
   saga, and switch over to the point made by him in the epilogue to the 
story, about 'The Next Round of Scams'.

   For quite some time, the ruling elite in India has been intent on 
'privatising' all public enterprises; and even 'utilities' are no
   exception. The 'unbundling' of infrastructure with a view to privatisation 
of all the 'profitable' segments. All this - as per the current
   'disinformation campaign' - is supposedly in the interest of 
rationalisation and greater efficiency of poorer supply.

   The author has referred in this context to the acquisition from the 
Government - by the Torrent Group - of the Ahmedabad and
   Surat Electricity companies at less than one-tenth of the market value of 
the assets of thee facilities. Again, much like the Enron
   saga, all objections by the Finance Department of the Gujarat government 
were overruled.

   And, Abhay Mehta has predicated that this onslaught - the break-up of 
power utilities into three segments, generation, transmission
   and distribution, - with a view to their privatisation is likely to be the 
new thrust by the ruling elite, for reasons that do not require to
   be spelt out.

   Though Mehta had the examples of the Torrent Group takeover of Ahmedabad 
and Surat Electricity companies, and of the break
   up of the Orissa State Electricity Board before him, yet his statement can 
be stated today to be prophetic; the UPSEB is now on
   the firing line. The recent strike by the workers and engineers of the 
UPSEB in protest of the announced UP government decision
   to trifurcate the UPSEB; and the Union Minister of Power, Mr. Rangarajan 
Kumaramangalam's statement that the UPSEB is a
   loss making, inefficient unit and that privatisation of the facilities 
after the trifurcation - need to be noted.

   That 40 per cent of the dues of the UPSEB are from the UP Government; that 
tariffs for UP electricity supply are fixed by the UP
   government and not by the UPSEB; that the UPSEB does not have the cash 
even for routine maintenance as a result of the above
   - these are facts that nobody is prepared even to consider. That the 
remedy for UPSEB lies in a different kind of reform and
   restructuring, is not even to be debated. The whole idea is to privatise 
the profitable segments, and to leave the public sector entity
   with all the problem areas, including rural energy supply. It is against 
this background that Abhay Mehta's book needs to be widely
   disseminated, read, and its implications understood.

   What is at stake is not a 'utility' here or a PSU there. What is at stake 
is the future of some 80 per cent of the have-nots in this
   country.

   What is at stake is the 'pillory' of the assets of the nation for private 
aggrandisement.

Dilbert Newsletter 29.0
   Highlights:
  ------------------------------------------------
  - Stop the Vote Campaign
  - Dilbert TV Show Update
  - True Tales of Induhviduals
  - Dogbert Answers My Mail
  - Dilberitos
  ------------------------------------------------

Stop the Vote Campaign
It's a presidential election year in the United States, and that
means it's time for me to "get involved."

This year I'm organizing a "Stop The Vote" campaign aimed at
preventing Induhviduals from casting ballots.  I'll borrow a
strategy used by all politicians: hallucinations of what the
Founding Fathers intended.

As you know, people were very wise in the 1700s. Unfortunately,
something happened that made us all idiots.  I blame television.
That's why we prefer to make our important decisions on personal
freedom based on the wisdom of dead, slave-owning dandies instead
of using our own defective brains.

We have no recordings of the Constitutional debates, but I'm sure
it went something like this:

---- Re-creation ----

Jefferson:  We haven't put anything in the Bill of Rights about
genetic manipulation, Internet encryption, in vitro fertilization,
or mandatory drug testing.

Adams: Just say "et cetera."  No one is going to read it anyway.

Hancock: Let's include something to encourage public nudity.  Cable
TV won't be invented for years and I can't wait that long.

Jefferson:  Okay.  I'll call that the right to bare arms.

Franklin:  That might be misinterpreted.

Jefferson:  Who's the world-class writer here?  I keep your stupid
Almanac next to my chamber pot, and I don't mean for the reading.

Franklin:  I am soooo sorry for making a suggestion.  By the way,
your house slave "Jeff" has your eyes.

All:  HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!

Adams:  You're all a bunch of asses.  I think you're giving me an
embolism.

Jefferson:  You have the right to ass-embolisms.  Hey, maybe I
should include that.  How do you spell it?

Dilbert TV Show Update
According to my e-mail, many Dilbert TV fans tape the show so they
have permanent copies in their tape libraries.  While Dilbert is
being taped, they watch other shows that are not tape-worthy.
Unfortunately, only live viewing of TV shows counts for ratings.
This isn't a problem for some TV shows, like "Wheel of Fortune,"
because their viewers use VCRs to crack nuts.  But the mathematical
sets of "people who can program VCRs" and "people most likely to
watch 'Dilbert'" are almost the same.  This has been a problem.

The episode airing February 22nd (9:30 PM EST) in the USA will
probably determine whether the Dilbert show gets renewed.  That's
the episode featuring Jerry Seinfeld as the voice of Comp-U-Comp,
an evil computer who has taken over a company and fired everyone
except the guy who guards the electrical plug.  Eugene Levy plays
the plug guard.

Jerry's lines are mostly written by Larry Charles, one of the
original writers for Seinfeld, now Executive Producer for Dilbert.
So if you liked Seinfeld, this is the closest thing you're going to
get.

And if you know any Induhviduals who are in Nielsen families this
month, please tell them that there's some sort of "millionaire
prize" for watching "Dilbert" and answering questions posed by the
voices in their own heads.

Dilbert Episode Airs On the Internet
As part of our overall pimping for the Seinfeld voice episode,
we're putting an entire show (The Merger episode) on the Internet
in streaming video, starting February 17th and running through
February 29th.  You can find links to it at
www.dilbertondemand.com.  You need the Windows Media Player, which
you can download from the site.

As far as we know, this is the first television cartoon show
streamed over the Internet in its entirety.  We made sure we didn't
research that fact too thoroughly so we could honestly say, "as far
as we know."

You'll need a reasonably fast connection, but you can view the
entire show, in bite-sized chunks, at your leisure.  Don't settle
for mere bragging about your DSL or cable modem connection;
DEMONSTRATE your digital superiority!  Invite a neighbor who has a
pitiful 28.8 modem over to drool on you.  If you wear a raincoat,
it's a strangely satisfying experience and you can hose it off
later.

If you know anyone recently involved in a merger, the Dilbert
episode on the Internet (The Merger) is the one they'll want to
see.  Find out what's in store for companies who seek "synergy."

True Tales of Induhviduals
I begin the True Tales section with a personal sighting.  I
recently came upon a local road that was closed for improvements.
Signs warned "Road Closed" and "Bridge Out."  As I turned around to
head for the detour, another motorist waved me down.  We rolled
down our windows and he shouted, "Do you think we should just move
the barricades and go for it?"

I don't know how fast one must drive in order to compensate for a
"Bridge Out" situation, but I decided not to try it.

True Tale 2
Some of our corporate policies have been rewritten.  Here's an
example from our expense reporting procedures.

"Receipts are required for all expenditures of $25 or more and, in
addition to this, receipts for a lesser amount are also required."

Editor's note: It sounds as if some of the people in the HR are
idiots and, in addition to this, the rest of them are too.

True Tale 3
We received a letter from the Environmental Protection Agency
stating that unless we provided answers to their outstanding
questions within two weeks they would recommend that our power
plant construction project not proceed.

Apparently they failed to notice that, a) we already answered the
questions, b) their approval had already been issued and, c) the
$600 million power plant had been built nearly two years ago.

Editor's note: If those are the sort of questions the EPA calls
"outstanding" I'd hate to hear their dumb ones.

True Tale 4
We had a Christmas raffle in the "Business Intelligence"
department.   The boss drew a number and called it out.   The
department statistician stood up to tumultuous applause and went up
to collect his prize.  Meanwhile, another employee -- who turned
out to be the real winner -- stood up to collect that same prize.
Upon investigation, the statistician for Business Intelligence had
confused ticket 593 for 539.

Editor's note: On the surface it looks as if the statistician is a
boob.  But he's the only one in the room who realized that 39% of
the time the real winner isn't present to win.  I suspect he's a
DNRC member just playing the odds.

True Tale 5
When a project is finished in my department we place a red dot
sticker on the folder to signify its completion.  One day we ran
out of red dots but still had a large supply of green and blue
dots.  Dots weren't used for any other purpose so I suggested using
the ones we have, despite their non-red color.  Color was
insignificant.  There were only five of us in the group, so
communicating the change would be easy.

My money-saving suggestion was met with resistance from cow-orkers.
 They pointed out that we've "always used RED dots" and maybe I
should check with the department manager.  I mentioned my idea to
the manager and he said I should "bring it up at the next staff
meeting."

Editor's note: Ironically, it's not a dot.com company.

True Tale 6
I paid for lunch with a credit card.  The manager put it through
the electronic card machine and got a "no dial tone" error.  She
tried again with the same result.  Then she asked me if I had
another card.

Editor's note:  That's exactly why you should pay for your lunch
using a phone company calling card.  They have dial tone.

True Tale 7
We tested our Y2K power contingency plans a few weeks before New
Year's.  The Induhviduals in IT didn't expect any downtime, so the
test was performed during the normal work day.  The idea was that
when power was cut, the six generators would kick on and we
wouldn't notice a thing.

Three generators failed to start. Two threw their breakers due to
the high load on them.  The last was overwhelmed when the previous
two cut out and threw a tremendous surge through the lines, blowing
up hundreds of light bulbs, frying fax machines, radios and pencil
sharpeners along the way.   The surge jumped circuits in our
industrial level surge protector and traveled through our "surge
protected" lines to every desktop in the company plus the server
room.  After taking out over a hundred monitors and almost forty
PCs, the surge proceeded to destroy our server room air
conditioner, four huge UPS systems, thirteen servers and both
AS/400s.  Several small fires started throughout the building,
including our now half-melted Christmas tree and our
molten-menorah.

The surge then jumped the lines into the main power grid, blowing
up two transformers, one of which fell on the IT manager's car
(poetic justice) and cutting power on the entire block.  The
remaining generator then proceeded to burst into flames, eventually
blowing up all six generators and burning up seven cars.

This all occurred within about thirty seconds and sent 38 people to
the hospital, cost the company over $650,000 in equipment (not to
mention the impending lawsuits), destroyed eight cars and caused
weeks of downtime.  Three people quit the company.  One woman is
still in the hospital with electrical burns.  The resulting
publicity got us on television in five states.

Editor's note: That story sounds too amazing to be true but I'm
printing it anyway under the theory that there's no such thing as
bad publicity.

True Tale 8
Our university library just got new computers. The library
thoughtfully provided headphones so students can listen to sound
files without disturbing anyone nearby.   The problem is the
headphone cords have been clamped to the desk in such a way that in
order to use them, you must have your head no more than six inches
from your keyboard. It is great fun to see the stu-duh-nts trying
to use them.

True Tale 9
I went to a Georgia DMV office to obtain a driver's license.
Customers are required to produce two pieces of ID.  I presented a
utility bill and a copy of my latest tax return, both acceptable
types of ID according to their published list.

The agent behind the counter said she could not accept my tax
return as ID because it was typed.  She said, "How do we know this
is legitimate?  Anyone can get a computer or typewriter to produce
this return."  I argued, unsuccessfully, that it was also easy to
obtain pens and pencils to create hand-written returns.  I was told
to come back with a hand-written return or another acceptable form
of ID.

True Tale 10
I went to a fast-food restaurant one morning for breakfast.  The
moment I opened the door, I was almost swept off my feet by an
overpowering odor of gas.  I struggled up to the counter out of a
vague sense of duty, and said  "You've got an enormous gas leak
back there somewhere!" gesturing towards the kitchen.

The girl behind the counter shrugged and said, "Yeah, I know, but
I've been here since seven o'clock and I've gotten used to it."

True Tale 11
I went to ask our new principal if we could have the Monday before
finals off as a study day.  We had always gotten a study day in the
past but it wasn't on the schedule this time.  He thought for a
second and then responded, "No, you have school that day."

True Tale 12
About a year ago I went to buy a video for a friend's birthday.
The video was rated for adult viewing only.   I was 15 years old,
but they sold it to me anyway.

When I got home I found out that my friend wanted the sequel, not
the original, so I took it back to the store.  The video clerk said
he couldn't return the video because I didn't look 18.

I was confused, so I attempted to clarify.  "So, because I don't
look 18 you're going to MAKE me take this ADULT-rated video, rather
then let me change it for the sequel that is NOT ADULT-rated?"

"Yeah, it's company policy.  If it changes we'll be in touch."

Eventually I convinced him he was breaking the law by selling me
the adult video instead of letting me exchange it for the non-adult
one.   As I left, the guy behind the counter yelled at me, "Next
time, don't watch the video first!"

It was still in its shrink-wrap.

Dogbert Answers My Mail
In this section, Dogbert answers my mail.  These are based on real
e-mail to me.  Some names have been changed to make them easier to
mock.

Dear Mr. Adams,

You were duped in your last newsletter.   Someone submitted a
supposedly True Tale of Induhviduals about a little boy and a
pager.  That is actually an urban legend more than twenty years
old.  Shame on you for falling for that.

        Jim,

Dear Chimp,

Just because it's an urban legend doesn't mean it didn't happen.
In fact, just this morning Mr. Adams woke up in a bathtub full of
ice and found a note saying one of his kidneys was missing.  It
wasn't stolen; he got talked into donating it to a celebrity
auction for the National Ear Hair Foundation.  I'm working with him
on learning to say no.

        Sincerely,

        Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

Your stupid ******* comic strip is a piece of ****.  Give up
cartooning and **** my ****, you *******  ****-******.

Dear Esophagus,

There is no call for such language.  If you do it again, it will be
your "*."

       Sincerely,

Dear Mr. Adams,

No offense, but no one will cry when you die because Dilbert is
just some goofy guy. Some of the biussness (sic) stuff is HARD to
understand and it isn't something that you can feel like you know.
Dogbert is so egotistical whereas Snoopy is so easy to know, and
Charlie Brown is not some GOOFY guy, if you know what I mean.

      Marshall

Dear Marsupial,

No offense taken. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get back to
"buissness."

      Sincerely,

      Dogbert

Dear Mr. Adams,

What is that round black thing on Dogbert's face?  My friend says
it's his mouth but I say it's his nose.

      Floyd

Dear Flawed,

I get this question often, thanks to Mr. Adams' prodigious artistic
range.  Allow me to clarify some of the shapes in the Dilbert
strip.  In general, the black circles are dog noses.  The black
ovals are mouths.  Rectangles are desks or sometimes computers. 
When the ovals are turned the other way and are not filled with
black they are glasses.  Everything else is random.

I have already requested a transfer to "For Better or For Worse."
The dog mortality rate there is high, but I'm willing to take the
chance.

      Sincerely,

      Dogbert

Dilberitos
If you're wondering where to find those delicious and
coincidentally-vegetarian Dilberitos that have 100% of your daily
values of vitamins and minerals, they're in grocery stores now, in
the frozen food section.  Check www.dilberito.com for store
details.

I can't guarantee that eating Dilberitos will help you live long
enough to dance on the graves of all your enemies (an excellent
aerobic exercise), but it's worth a try.

Dilbert Fodder
What's bugging you about your job?  Let me know and you might see
it in a Dilbert comic, TV show or newsletter.  The best comic
fodder involves workplace peeves, devious strategies, frustrations
of dealing with others, conflicting objectives, unintended
management consequences, and of course my favorite - idiot bosses.

And I love True Tales of Induhviduals.

And if you're seeing any new management trends that need to be
mocked, I can help.  Send your suggestions to me at
scottadams@aol.com.  Short ones are better.

Vince, both Matt and April think that this type of research would be 
value-additive to EBS.  I will be out all next week in a meeting with John 
Griebling and other on a deal that is being worked out.  I understand that 
you are following up with HR on all of our summer intern offers. Please make 
sure Palo is given an offer and that he will work with April and Matt (he did 
talk to Matt) on the topics that April and I suggested.

Regards,

Looks interesting.

I would guess that there is a TON of research available (from @Home, AOL, 
Roadrunner, Real, Microsoft, etc.) on Broadband's impact on the strategic 
value of web properties.  Compiling this would be very helpful.

Hi April & Matt, here is additional information on the summer intern that 
I've mentioned.

Matt, I know you know nothing about this! My discussion with April on the 
possible research topic let me (& April) to believe that you would provide 
great input on what the student can work on while he is here.

Vince:  Here is the information that I have on Paulo.    He would be slated 
to work for the summer with April Hodgeson and Matt Harris on how streaming 
media products may add value to advertising or some related area.    
Actually, he would also be a good fit for helping to think ways to analyze 
our Enron On-line data.    I have asked if he can send a resume.   In the 
mean time, most of his relevant information is attached below.

Stinson,

Thank you for your e-mail.  My phone number is (617) 492-9551.  

I graduated from Princeton University in 1996 (mathematics), and came 
straight to MIT for a
Ph.D. in Operations Management at the Sloan Schoolof Management.  In my first
three years I took all the required coursework in mathematics,
optimization, stochastic processes, etc., as well as a number of courses in
psychology (at MIT and Harvard).  I am working with Prof. Gabriel Bitran,
and I am interested in the mathematical modeling of service operations.  In
particular, I am interested in the interaction between customers and
companies (hence the interest in psychology).  The (tentative) title of my
PhD thesis is "Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet", and I am
sending you the summary which I sent to Tom Gros a few weeks ago that will
give you an idea of what this research is about.

Thanks again, and I'm looking forward to meeting you and your research
group next week.

Paulo

Pricing Substitute Products on the Internet

Objective:

To develop new tools to decide pricing policies for goods and services sold
on
the internet.

Motivation:

This research is motivated by the fact that traditional choice and 
optimization
models are not appropriate for internet-related businesses.  The technological
innovations associated with the internet brought about an overload of
information
which inevitably affects the ways in which consumers make choices.
Furthermore,
companies have a great deal of influence on how much information consumers can
have access to.

The problem of pricing substitute products is an important strategic issue
faced
by internet companies.  Consumers usually search for generic products (e.g.
VCRs
or computers) without knowing exactly what they will buy.  Companies can show
different products and different prices to each consumer.  This type of
flexibility
was not available until the internet came about.

The problem of pricing substitute products is not unique to the internet.  The
methodology developed by this research should be transferable to a number of
other settings, such as pricing services.  Services are unique, and there are
many cases where customers will only buy one of many services offered by a
given company.  Our model will help companies decide which services to offer
to which customers and how much to charge for these services.

Research Strategy:

Our research strategy is to divide the pricing problem into two components
which can be combined to generate optimal pricing strategies.  These
components are choice models and optimization models.

Choice Models:

Choice models describe how customers make choices.  The management literature
draws on two main sources for these models: psychology and economics.  The
common approach in psychology models is to use what are called heuristic
elimination methods.  These methods consist of the elimination of options
based on the sequential elimination of features until only one choice
remains.
These methods tend to be very context-specific and do not lend themselves very
easily to mathematical analysis.  Economists focus on utility-maximing models
that are significantly more mathematically tractable than psychological
models.
The most common economic model of choice is the logit model.  The problem with
these types of models is that they are not very accurate reflections of how
consumer make choices on the internet.  The first step in our research will
be
to develop choice models that capture the interactions going on between
customers
and companies on the internet.

Optimization:

Traditionally, the optimization problem consists of maximizing revenue over a
certain planning horizon.  On the internet, the problem of maximizing revenue
still exists, but there is also a need to learn about customers.  Short term
profit is based on sales, but long term profit is based on how well you know
your customers and are able to retain them.  The optimization problem must
therefore include a short term component (sales) and a long term component
(learning).

Ravi,

Maybe Stinson can get on this conference call. I shall be at the office on 
Thursday
 only this week.

Hi Vince, Mark Holsworth reviewed our contract on such a short notice.  I 
thank Mark for responding to our short-notice request.  It turns out that we 
need to get this database to move forward on a number of things and have 
legal save some time for us is an excellent help.  As mentioned below, It 
appears that PennWell's folks want to chat some more about this. 

Mark, can you schedule a conference call with these people to finalise this 
contract.  I will be out of town all week next week on a lock-down deal 
meeting. Vince may be able to get on the conference call.  I would greatly 
appreciate it if you could help us close this one!

Ravi -

I would like to schedule a conference call between you, me, PennWell's
counsel (Toni Turner Budd), and Enron's counsel to discuss your changes and
finalize the KMI End-User License Agreement.  I propose that we have the
conference call at 2:00 PM CST this Monday, February 21.  Please let me know
if you are available at this time and, if not, propose an alternative time
for the call.  In addition, please provide me with a telephone number where
I can reach you for the conference call.

PennWell is looking forward to finalizing the license agreement and
delivering the KMI data to Enron.

Hi Amy

A colleague of mine interviewed someone last week who is a PHD whose
background is as a developer within catastrophe risk management. He is
looking to move into more of a quantitative role which will utilise his
developing  skills and also his statistical and theoretical knowledge as
well. The issue is that he is based in Chicago and I wondered if there
would be any interest from your headquarters there.

Please find attached his details.

Speak to you soon.

Dear Mr Kamins

I am delighted that you would like to speak at the forthcoming "Real Options" 
conference.  Would your company be covering travel and hotel expenses?  If 
not I would need to get internal sign off to cover any expenses you would 
have.  Please can you tell me either way so that I can make the requisite 
inquiries if required.

The speakers at the conference have provided me with between 5-8 bullet 
points for their talks.  Could you email me a few ideas with regard to the 
content of the talk and I will email back my ideas.  I have attached one of 
the talks at the conference to give you an idea of the style of the talks 
which have already been included.

I look forward to speaking with you later this afternoon.

Kind regards

Dear Ms. Shaw,

I have just returned from London. One of the points on my
agenda was an internal seminar  on the topic of real options
my group offered to the Enron unit in London. Real options is
a valuation technology I have been promoting internally
for quite a long time.

I shall be glad to speak at your conference. Proposed topic:
"Real Options and Valuation of Fixed Assets in the Energy Industry".

Please, let me know if this of interest to you.

Julia Shaw <JSHAW@IIRLTD.CO.UK> on 09/24/99 06:13:07 AM

Dear Mr Kaminski,

I was given your name by Ann Wagoner and I believe that you area speaking at 
her
conference on Real Options.  I work in the London office of IIR and am putting
on a similar conference.  Your company has been mentioned by a wide variety of
people who I have spoken with about real options.  A number of people have
mentioned that your company is regarded very much as a market leader.

I would like to discover if a representative from ENRON might be interested in
speaking at the conference.  I have attached the draft programme with agreed
speakers to date.  The conference is by no means set in stone and if a speaker
from ENRON decided to become involved I would ensure that you were given a 
good
speaking slot in the conference and would have editorial control over the 
talk.

I very much hope that ENRON will become involved with the conference and I 
look
forward to speaking with you today or next week about the prospect.

Vince,

I do not think that there is match with our group but I forwarded Steve's 
resume
to Ford Cooper and Joe Phalen of the Water Group.

Regards,
Osman

Charlene,
I am sending you as promised the information I have about 3 of our summer 
interns.
I shall fax you this morning two additional resumes I have in hard copy.

In the case of Paulo Rocha we don't have a formal
resume, just a letter from him with the summary of his skills.

Thanks for your help. Enron desperately needs this talent.

Vince

Drogi Panie Andrzeju,

Probuje skontaktowac sie z Jarkiem Astramowiczem, by znalezc sposob 
dofinansowania Waszej imprezy. 
Jedyna mozliwosc, by to zrobic jest poprzez Enron Poland. Mnie byloby
bardzo trudno usprawiedliwic to z mojego budzetu.

W. Kaminski

Szanowny Panie Kaminski!

Nazywam sie Andrzej Wodnicki i jestem czlonkiem Stowarzysznia Studentow 
AIESEC przy Szkole Glownej Handlowej (dawnej SGPiS).

Prosze o poswiecenie paru chwil na przeczytanie tego maila.
(Kontakt do Pana otrzymalem od kolegi, ktory organizowal prezentacje firmy 
ENRON na SGH, a posrednio od Pana Jarka Astramowicza, przedstawiciela ENRON 
na Polske.)

W imieniu AIESEC Polska chcialbym zwrocic sie do Pana z wielka prosba pomocy 
przy wydarzeniu, ktore w tym roku organizujemy.
AIESEC Polska, a w szczegolnosci AIESEC przy Szkole Glownej Handlowej ma 
zaszczyt organizowac w tym roku European Leadership Development Seminar. Jest 
to seminarium na temat przywodztwa skierowne do obecnych i przyszlych 
czlonkow Rad Wykonawczych Komitetow Lokalnych  AIESEC w calej Europie.
Po raz pierwszy AIESEC Polska ma mozliwosc organizacji takiego wydarzenia i 
stanowi ono dla nas olbrzymie wyzwanie.

Przygotowywalismy sie do niego od kilku lat i obecnie jestesmy juz w koncowej 
fazie organizacji EuroLDS 2000.
Projekt rozpoczyna sie 7 marca 2000 roku Oficjalnym Otwarciem przez Pana 
Prezydenta Aleksandra Kwasniewskiego w Sali Kongresowej. Pozniej odbeda sie 
Dyskusje Panelowe (udzial wielu znakomitych gosci - m.in Jan Krzysztof 
Bielecki, Jacek Saryusz Wolski, Andrzej Olechowski)  oraz wyklady i 
prezentacje regionow Polski w Auli Spadochronowej Szkoly Glownej Handlowej, a 
nastepnie delegaci udadza sie do hotelu Mrongovia na szkolenia, casy i 
wyklady na temat przywodztwa. (Szczegolowy program EuroLDS 2000 przesylam w 
zalaczniku.)

Jak do tej pory staralismy sie mozliwie najwiecej dokonac wlasnymi silami, 
jednak obecnie na 3 tygodnie przed tym wydarzeniem stoimy przed pewnym 
problemem i stad tez pojawil sie pomysl skontaktowania Pana, jako osoby, 
ktora moglaby nam wydatnie pomoc.

Chcielibysmy poprosic Pana o wsparcie finansowe.
Wspolpracujemy juz z wieloma firmami i instytucjami (m.in. Deloitte & Touche, 
Arthur Andersen, Fundusz Phare, Fundacja Konrada Adenauera oraz wieloma 
innymi), jednak na obecnym etapie organizacji projektu wciaz brakuje nam 
12000 $.
Poczatkowo chcielismy nawiazac kontakt z Pania Eileen Price z Londynu, jednak 
wydaje nam sie, ze Pan jako zalozyciel AIESEC w Polsce powienien po pierwsze 
o takim wydarzeniu wiedziec, a po drugie mamy nadzieje, ze moze nam Pan pomoc.

Bardzo prosze o odpowiedz,

Z powazaniem

California=01,s power crisis has generated heated debate over the last seve=
ral=20
months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We=
=20
want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.=
 =20
Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation=
=20
and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California=01,s current problem is as straightforward as supp=
ly=20
and demand.  California=01,s economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This incr=
eased=20
the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory=20
restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So=
=20
demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The resul=
t,=20
predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10=20
percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related=
=20
factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state=01,s regulations=
=20
forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for=
=20
power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market=
=20
when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases lo=
ng=20
term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  I=
n=20
California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the=20
equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in th=
e=20
most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine=20
while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawat=
t=20
was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remain=
ed=20
in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep=20
competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesa=
le=20
prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the=20
regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California=01,s problems were caused by regulation, not deregulat=
ion. =20
Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new=
=20
generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile=
=20
spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned=
=20
the state=01,s policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, w=
hich,=20
if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron=01,s Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than f=
ix=20
the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the=20
politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

? Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the=
=20
state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the=
=20
same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a=20
market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We ar=
e=20
interested only in having a market that works so that we can package produc=
ts=20
for our customers.
? As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from=
=20
the problems the states=01, utilities, and their customers, now face.  We=
=20
protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply=20
power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on=
=20
the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a =01&turnback=018=
 of our=20
customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

? As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California=20
market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers direct=
ly=20
from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES=01,s market price risk by=20
allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
? EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue =
to=20
receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
? EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them=
=20
with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in=20
reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its=
=20
crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron=20
continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western=
=20
power markets.  Enron=01,s primary business is managing risk for our custom=
ers=20
with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more=
=20
demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California=01,s crisis is also straightforward.  In summary=
, the=20
state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot mark=
et=20
and shore up the financial stability of the state=01,s utilities.

Increasing Supply

California=01,s process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing=
=20
short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in les=
s=20
than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simpl=
y=20
must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations=20
generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the=
=20
regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and=20
displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can=
=20
have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new=20
facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand. =
=20
They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail=
=20
market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and deman=
d=20
at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market=
.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from=20
volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer=
=20
term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the han=
ds=20
of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market=
. =20
Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over the=
ir=20
price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State=01,s Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to=20
greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to=
=20
arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recov=
er=20
their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and=
=20
distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is=
=20
needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that=
,=20
while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters=
=20
worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don=01,t work; have never work=
ed;=20
and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages=
,=20
which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how=20
ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether =
it=20
is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Vall=
ey=20
or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current=20
shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in=20
California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that=
=20
the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in,=20
constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in=
=20
California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power=20
generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, road=
s=20
and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about t=
he=20
crisis from the media, it=01,s important for you to know this:  We at Enron=
 will=20
continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real=20
solutions to the state. 

Ravi,

Our compensation for summer interns is very generous. It's more than what an 
engineering student expects.

Vince

P.S.  Any progress on the resumes in electronic form? I want to send a 
package to Charlene today.

Ravi Thuraisingham@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 02/17/2000 02:34:01 PM
Hi, Vince please put your best effort in making sure that we differentiate 
summer interns and associates that EBS Research will be hiring.  I am talking 
about compensation here.  Ken Rice mentioned that EBS is in the process of 
developing a technical equivalent of our AA pool. EBS research people can 
potentially rotate through this pool in the future.  I just don't want to 
risk losing people like Giuseppe (& get the word out that we are low-ballers) 
because we have to fit them into certain set of categories that was designed 
for the energy business.  I realize that you have estabilished such 
differentiation for research as a whole, but I think that would have to be 
moved up a notch in the case of EBS.

Ravi.

Yes, it's a good idea.

Goodmorning Vince ,

We added a bookcase to the conference room on the 19th floor
however ,due to the departments growth I think we could use
another one.

Vince , in the long run it would save us some time.

Please let me know if this is okay!

According to Alex,  Li Xiao gave your email address to Alex.  Did Li Xiao 
talk to you first about Alex? I don't know for certain.  Alex contacted you

associations, etc.).  Please forward the types of documentation you have 
which may be inventoried for other Enron employees' use.  If there are other 
individuals like yourself with access to this type of information, please

Czy Enron moze pomoc w organizacji tej imprezy?
Bylaby to dobra okazja nawiazania wielu pozytecznych kontaktow.

Szanowny Panie Kaminski!

Nazywam sie Andrzej Wodnicki i jestem czlonkiem Stowarzysznia Studentow 
AIESEC przy Szkole Glownej Handlowej (dawnej SGPiS).

Prosze o poswiecenie paru chwil na przeczytanie tego maila.
(Kontakt do Pana otrzymalem od kolegi, ktory organizowal prezentacje firmy 
ENRON na SGH, a posrednio od Pana Jarka Astramowicza, przedstawiciela ENRON 
na Polske.)

W imieniu AIESEC Polska chcialbym zwrocic sie do Pana z wielka prosba pomocy 
przy wydarzeniu, ktore w tym roku organizujemy.
AIESEC Polska, a w szczegolnosci AIESEC przy Szkole Glownej Handlowej ma 
zaszczyt organizowac w tym roku European Leadership Development Seminar. Jest 
to seminarium na temat przywodztwa skierowne do obecnych i przyszlych 
czlonkow Rad Wykonawczych Komitetow Lokalnych  AIESEC w calej Europie.
Po raz pierwszy AIESEC Polska ma mozliwosc organizacji takiego wydarzenia i 
stanowi ono dla nas olbrzymie wyzwanie.

Przygotowywalismy sie do niego od kilku lat i obecnie jestesmy juz w koncowej 
fazie organizacji EuroLDS 2000.
Projekt rozpoczyna sie 7 marca 2000 roku Oficjalnym Otwarciem przez Pana 
Prezydenta Aleksandra Kwasniewskiego w Sali Kongresowej. Pozniej odbeda sie 
Dyskusje Panelowe (udzial wielu znakomitych gosci - m.in Jan Krzysztof 
Bielecki, Jacek Saryusz Wolski, Andrzej Olechowski)  oraz wyklady i 
prezentacje regionow Polski w Auli Spadochronowej Szkoly Glownej Handlowej, a 
nastepnie delegaci udadza sie do hotelu Mrongovia na szkolenia, casy i 
wyklady na temat przywodztwa. (Szczegolowy program EuroLDS 2000 przesylam w 
zalaczniku.)

Jak do tej pory staralismy sie mozliwie najwiecej dokonac wlasnymi silami, 
jednak obecnie na 3 tygodnie przed tym wydarzeniem stoimy przed pewnym 
problemem i stad tez pojawil sie pomysl skontaktowania Pana, jako osoby, 
ktora moglaby nam wydatnie pomoc.

Chcielibysmy poprosic Pana o wsparcie finansowe.
Wspolpracujemy juz z wieloma firmami i instytucjami (m.in. Deloitte & Touche, 
Arthur Andersen, Fundusz Phare, Fundacja Konrada Adenauera oraz wieloma 
innymi), jednak na obecnym etapie organizacji projektu wciaz brakuje nam 
12000 $.
Poczatkowo chcielismy nawiazac kontakt z Pania Eileen Price z Londynu, jednak 
wydaje nam sie, ze Pan jako zalozyciel AIESEC w Polsce powienien po pierwsze 
o takim wydarzeniu wiedziec, a po drugie mamy nadzieje, ze moze nam Pan pomoc.

Bardzo prosze o odpowiedz,

Z powazaniem

Andrzej Wodnicki
Prezydent EuroLDS 2000

Vince & Stinson,

I was given your names by Lynn Dunphy in recruiting and am taking the liberty 
of forwarding you the attached CV.  Steve Roeder is a former collegiate 
swimmer and currently coach of the master's swimming program in The Woodlands 
(my wife is president of the program).  He is also currently employed at Air 
Liquide USA (or one of its subsidiaries) over in the Galleria area.  As a 
consequence of Air Liquide's pending merger with BOC, Steve believes that 
there will be significant personnel reductions sometime during 2000 and is 
taking action now to try to locate his next professional challenge.

Lynn suggested there might be a fit with your group and I would be grateful 
if you could have a look and let me know whether you might be interested.  
Alternatively, if you don't see a fit (or are adequately staffed at the 
moment), I would be grateful for any suggestions you might have as to whom I 
might contact internally on Steve's behalf.

Many thanks in advance.

Mike- 
Thanks for taking the time to talk last evening.? I really appreciated it.? 
(By the way, how is life in the White House now that you are living with a 
President?? Is Air Force One all that it is cracked up to be?)

Please see the attached document.? By reading between the lines, hopefully 
one can see that, whereas my training has been highly technical, my desire to 
transform my career into the business side of a high-technology application 
is set in this good foundation (rather than limited by it).

Thanks again for your support.

Vince,
I just found out that none of my vacation days from the last year is in the 
computer system
(it says that I have 0 C/over days).

It was November 3, 1999 when I asked your approval to carry over 12 vacation 
days to the next year .
I was thinking that if you (or HR) do not approve I could at least take these 
days in 1999. 

I know that your tried to help me and sent to  Brad McSherry the 
justification for me to carry over 10 days.
I bothered you a few times in November and December 1999 and since your 
response was optimistic
I did not take any of those 10 days in 1999. But I never heard from HR.

Now I am not sure - may be these days are not in the system by mistake. 
I would like to take 5 of them in March ( from 3/13/00 to 3/17/00).

What is your advice? Should I contact Brad McSherry? Even negative response 
from HR in November or
December last year would be better than loosing vacation days.

I really appreciate your help,
Tanya.

Tanya Tamarchenko
12/02/99 12:51 PM
Hi, Vince,
sorry to bother again with my question.

I first e-mailed my question a month ago (on Nov. 3).

Since we still have not heard from HR, is it fair to assume that I can carry 
over my 10  vacation days to the next year? 
If not - I have to take 5 days before Dec. 17, because then I go on vacations 
anyhow. I would really prefer not to take off
most of December, there are quite a lot of things going on.

Thank you for your help in resolving this question.

Tanya.

Jennifer,

Yes, we shall look at him. Thanks for thinking of us.

Vince

   

Vince,

I had sent this candidate to Mike Roberts with our weather group, but thought 
I'd send him your way as well.  Koch in Wichita is laying off quite a few of 
their employees, and this candidate has been given a lay-off notice.  He is 
open to moving to Houston.  His stats are below.  If you want to speak with 
him, feel free to give him a call!

Thanks!

Jennifer Richard

Mike,

A few months ago, you came and spoke to our HR group about what your group 
does.  Thank you VERY much!  We all loved the information, and your talk gave 
us a better picture of what you guys do!

I spoke to an analyst who is currently working for Koch in Wichita, and is 
about to be laid off.  He is going to stay until he gets his severance, and 
thinks that may be in about 4-6 weeks.  His current salary is $80k.  His last 
raise was 2 years ago, and at that time he was making $74k.  His last bonus 
was also two years ago, which was $30k.  He is considering Enron as one of 
his options.  If you are interested, feel free to give him a call at work.  

Thanks!

Just checking you all out!!!  
The following short quiz consists of 4 questions and tells whether you are
qualified to be a "professional". Scroll down for each answer. The questions
are not that difficult.

1.  How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator?

The correct answer is: Open the refrigerator, put in the giraffe and close
the door. This question tests whether you tend to do simple things in an
overly complicated way.

2.  How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator?

Wrong answer: Open the refrigerator, put in the elephant and close the
refrigerator.

The correct answer is: Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe,
put in the elephant and close the door. This tests your ability to
think through the repercussions of your actions.

3.  The Lion King is hosting an animal conference. All the animals
attend except one. Which animal does not attend?

The correct answer is: The Elephant. The Elephant is in the refrigerator.
This tests your memory. Okay, even if you did not answer the first three
questions correctly, you still have one more chance to show your abilities.

4.  There is a river you must cross, but it is inhabited by crocodiles. How
do you manage it?

The correct answer is: You swim across.  All the Crocodiles are attending
the Animal Meeting. This tests whether you learn quickly from your mistakes.
According to Andersen Consulting Worldwide, around 90% of the professionals
they tested got all 4 questions wrong. But many preschoolers got several
correct answers. Anderson Consulting says this conclusively disproves the
theory that most professionals have the brains of a four year old.

Hello Margaret.  We are looking for a speaker for a meeting that is being

The potential topic is a national perspective on pricing pressures/trends on 
natural gas, electricity and oil and their impact on agricultural production 
costs, as well as types of risk managment tools that are being used to offset 
the price fluctuations.

Do you know of anyone, either within the Corporation or outside, who would be 
available to travel to Omaha to make this presentation?  

I would appreciate any assistance that you could provide, Margaret.

Vince/Stinson:

I just came back from a meeting with Accounting (Ryan Siueck) and Credit (Rod 
Nelson - works with Bill Bradford) in which we presented the two-factor model 
for calculating credit loss on our LJM's position. Rod seemed positive with 
the model conceptual approach. He will position Bill Bradford on that. 
Accounting will have a meeting with AA to discuss the treatment on credit 
reserves on this deal tomorrow 9:00 AM. They feel my participation is not 
necessary. 

At year-end the difference on both valuations - without and with credit risk 
- indicates a credit loss of about 100 MM.

Hi Caroline,

We would like to set up an afternoon/evening of first round screening 
interviews with the 5 candidates (whose CVs are attached below) for Monday 
21st February, starting from 3pm and going on until 6pm or so.  Right now we 
have five candidates, and I would imagine that a half an hour interview per 
person is fine.  The interviewers will be Vince Kaminski , Ben Parsons, 
myself and Steve Leppard.  My suggestion is that each candidate has three 
interviews as follows:

Vince Kaminski and Anjam Ahmad
Ben Parsons
Steven Leppard

Depending on the number of candidates we would then interview from 3pm 
through to 6.00pm or 7pm.  I will be receiving the CVs of at least two more 
candidates from Huxley associates later.  One constraint is that Kirstee 
Hewitt can only START interviews at 5.30pm.

CVs:
ZIA AKBAR KIRSTEE HEWITT RAMA GATIGANTI RENE LEDIS AMIT BARTARYA
  

Regards & Thanks,

Anjam

P.S. The candidates are already aware that they are being considered; the two 
positions are a junior value-at-risk and credit risk model quantitative 
analyst, the other position is a generalist quantitative analyst position.

Lynn,

I am forwarding you the resume of a very bright and motivated young man
who attended a lecture I gave recently at LSU.

I think we should consider him for an analyst position.

Today's focus: Bandwidth trading
Last week Enron Broadband Services held a press event to talk about the
company's trading of bandwidth.

While bandwidth trading, or intermediation, as Enron's CEO Joseph Hirko
prefers to call it, does not directly affect customers, it's something
they should be aware of.

Enron has developed "pooling points" in Los Angeles and New York, where
Enron and other serv-ice providers buy or sell bandwidth. Carriers
have been leasing capacity from each other for decades and ISPs have
been setting up private peering connections with each other for
several years, so the concept of using each other's bandwidth is not
new.

But Enron has set up a system that's based primarily on Lucent network
management gear, which Enron claims will allow it to do two important
things: Guarantee performance over multiple net-works; and change
circuits in a matter of seconds, as opposed to days or months.

Today, when carriers buy capacity from each other, they ink deals that
sometimes span 20 years. But Enron plans on changing that. The
company's idea is to treat bandwidth as a commodity. Instead of
signing a 20-year deal, the carrier signs up with carrier ABC because
it is offering a competitively low rate on T-3 connections for that
month. But next month carrier XYZ is expected to lower its rates, so
the carrier then switches its circuits from ABC to XYZ.

Enron has the capability to change circuits every five seconds, says Tom
Gros, vice president of global trading at Enron. So the idea is that
carriers are going to be able to get high-quality bandwidth at reduced
rates. Nothing wrong with that idea, but a few questions come up.

One: Will your carrier or ISP share those savings with you, the business
customer? Well, that's hard to say. This is a difficult question to
answer because most Enron's "intermediation" partner deals are
confidential. Global Crossings, a wholesale carrier, is the only deal
that's been announced because it was Enron's first.

So chances are you won't even know if your carrier is working with
Enron, who claims several other carriers are in fact working with
them.

Two: Doesn't constant circuit changes bring up monitoring issues for
business users? Gros says it should not, and in fact end users should
expect even better monitoring capabilities. Now while En-ron very well
might provide its carrier and ISP partners with high-end monitoring
tools, I would take the position that it's highly unlikely that
carriers are going to make those tools available to their cus-tomers.
Why? Well the answer gets back to the first issue. If all of the deals
are confidential, end us-ers aren't going to even know their circuits
are getting switched around.

Would you want to know if your carrier or ISP is participating in
bandwidth trading?

Ben,

I spoke with Anjam and gave him the information about my trip.
Here is the short summary:

1. If you are free for dinner on  Sunday, I would be glad to meet with you 
(as well
as Anjam and Steve). I would like to review what's going on in Houston and 
London.

2. We can arrange the interviews for all  the candidates you lined up Monday 
afternoon
(Tuesday  and Wednesday mornings are the alternative dates). We treat the 
interviews as internal
to the Research Group  and we shall arrange full interview schedules at a 
later day for those candidates
who pass our internal test.

3. Please, feel free to put on my agenda other meetings you think might be 
useful.
Please, coordinate the meetings with Anjam and Steve. I am busy on Tuesday 
afternoon
(I a speak at a conference).

Absolutely - I can't find the previous email but it may have been lost during 
the few days they moved my email box from London to Houston - I know I had a 
lot of lost emails - do you have his phone number and email and we can sort 
out a password for a few days for him too.

Louise, 

Some time ago I sent you a message regarding Ed Krapels. He is writing a book 
on energy
commodity markets and would like to learn more about EOL. 

Can you give him a  call and chat with him for 10 minutes. He is a good 
friend of Enron and
it would be free ad for us.

Vince

Celeste,

I would like to ask you for a favor. We would like to have Sevil as an intern 
in our group
this summer. She prepares a Ph.D. dissertation  on transmission: a critical 
issue to the power
markets everywhere.

I have also a few other students I would like to take in as summer interns. I 
shall send you 
the resumes in separate messages.

Vince Kaminski

sevil yaman <syaman_98@yahoo.com> on 02/10/2000 10:22:28 PM
Hi Dr. Kaminski,

As I told you last Monday in Dr. Kao's class I am
looking for a summer internship position in your group
in which I can use my economics background together
with my quantitative skills and knowledge in
electricity markets. Currently, I am a third year
Ph.D. student at the Economics Department of  the
University of Houston. At the end of this semester
I'll be completing my coursework and starting to write
my dissertation which analyzes the access pricing
issue in network industries, especially in electricity
transmission.
I would like to give you a few examples from my
coursework. In addition to basic Statistics I-II and
Econometrics I-II, I have taken "Macroeconomic
Modeling and Forecasting" (Time Series) class in which
I learned RATS. In "Applied Econometrics" class, it
was given a great deal of attention to the case method
learning approach that involved extensive computer
analysis. We were taught SAS. As a term paper I worked
on electricity demand forecasting. This semester I am
taking "Special Topics in Applied Econometrics" course
in which I am being taught Qualitative Dependent
Models, MLE, Panel Data Techniques, and so on, and as
software STATA. Moreover, this semester I am also
taking "Options Theory and Its Applications" class and
auditing Dr. Kao's class. I definitely agree with you
in what you mentioned in your lecture last Monday
about the understanding of the options theory as a
necessity in the energy sector.
Besides, I spent my last summer in the Oil and Gas
unit of the World Bank as a research assistant. This
work experience in which I had great exposure to the
energy market issues and my own research area, which
is regulation of transmission pricing (congestion
pricing), made me believe that the ongoing
restructuring of the electricity sector, especially
the transmission network issue, could be well
understood by working in the industry.
Dr. Kaminski, attached you can find my resume. I would
be glad if you could find a chance to review it and
get back to me soon.

Many thanks,

=====

Martin,

Please, take a look at Question 3.
Who is the right person at EBS?

Vince

Jinbaek Kim <jinbaek@ieor.berkeley.edu> on 03/15/2001 01:12:32 AM
Dr. Kaminski,

Sorry for the late response,
it took me some time to coordinate things.
Finally, it's almost dont :-)
It turned out that from June to August
will be best for me for work at ENRON
(Say June.4 to August.4)

But I still need to know several things from your side.
Could you answer following questions?

First:
Is my suggested working period is OK with you?
If so, let me know what to do for settlement
during the period.

Second:
I got a list of work, I might be able to do for
DealBench team from Ross and Suresh.
I'd like to know it is still a valid work list:
The list he sent is as following:

> 1.  Write a paper in layman's terms that answers
> questions like the following:
> Benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and
> sellers, particularly in reverse auctions
> Explanation how multi-variable auctions are not
> as efficient as price-only auctions (is this true?)
> How many participants are recommended for a
> successful live auction
> What types of goods and services are best suited
> for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes
> Opinions on lotting strategies
> Trends in online private auctions

> 2.  Identify appropriate recent auction research (3
> or 4 papers out of the 90+ you provided)and obtain approvals from the
> authors to post on our site

> 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction
> literature (with hyperlinks?)

> 4.  Would you be willing to offer auction consulting
> services to our customers (if they are interested)

Third:

"Exotic Options for Interruptible Electricity Supply Contracts" (February
2000)
 PWP-071 by Rajnish Kamat and Shmuel S. Oren.

This paper presents the design and pricing of financial contracts for the
supply and procurement of interruptible electricity service. The proposed
contracts consist of bundling simple forwards with exotic call options that
have two exercise points with different strike prices. Such options allow
hedging and valuation of supply curtailment risk while explicitly
accounting for the notification lead time before curtailment.
The proposed instruments are priced under the traditional GBM price process
assumption and under the more realistic assumption of a mean reverting
price process with jump diffusion. The latter results employ state of the
art Fourier transforms techniques.

Dr . Kaminski, 

Thank you for giving me an opportunity to talk with you and Zimin.  It's my 
great pleasure to meet  with you 
and your group members.
 
I met Zimin last week. We had a wonderful talk.  After our meeting, I  handed 
in him my current resume.
He may already forwarded my resume to you.  If not, I will be very happy to 
send you a copy.

By talking with you, Zimin  and by attending your presentation yesterday at 
UH,  I find I am really interesting the 
fields that you are working on .  I am deeply impressed by the research works 
your team have done and I am 
looking forward  I am able to become one of your members.  I am also looking 
forward  to be able to do researches 
under your guidance.  

I strongly  feel that your research department  provides the kind of jobs and 
environments that I have been looking
for a long time.  My career objective matches your research fields and 
directions.  I believe my training in  mathematics
and computer science will provide me some necessary backgrounds in energy 
risk management  .  I am also sure that 
by working with you,   I can greatly expand my IT skills and experiences.  I 
also can learn tremendously from
 you and your research teams.

Currently after finishing my programing work as an IT spcialist,  I am 
reading John Hull's book and try to catch up necessary
background in Finance and related fields.  I am also readingyour "Managing 
Energy Price Risk" book.   
Thank you for giving me a copy of this book.  

Again, thank you  for giving me this opportunity and I am looking forward to 
working in your team.

Ed,

Louise must be very busy. I sent her another message regarding your request.
I shall call her if there is no reply from her within 3 days. 

Please, let me know.

Vince

ekrapels <ekrapels@esaibos.com> on 02/04/2000 01:58:59 PM
Dear Vince,

I have not heard from Louise and assume I cannot access Enrononline. As a
result, I have written what I can discern in the attached draft chapter for
the Risk Guide to Electricity Hedging. Could you review the Enrononline
section and let me know if I have any factual errors? Obviously, I welcome
any other comments you might have.

Don't warry about any textual problems -- me editors will catch those.
English is, after all, my thrid language (he said, defensively).

Sorry I couldn't gain access. Enrononline looks interesting and the stock
market seems to be giving you a strong pat on the back. Well done.

Thanks for your help.

Ed,

I sent a message to Louise Kitchen who runs the EnronOnline effort.
She should be getting back to you shortly.

Dear Vince,

Greetings from Boston, where we're doing all we can to help keep the price

As I may have told you earlier, I'm writing a "Guide to Electricity Hedging"
for Risk Publications similar to the report on Oil. I had planned to write a
significant section on Enrononline, and in the midst of my research on the
topic was denied access by Enron's gatekeeper. Can you help get me in?

As always, the best from here.

I'm sure you have already heard this, but here is a summary.  Kim.
El Paso, Enron Terminate $38 Million Mega-Deal

     In a stunning announcement late yesterday, El Paso Natural Gas said it 
had reached a
     The decision to release Enron from the three capacity agreements was 
somewhat
     puzzling, given that Enron last week had asked to be let out of only one 
contract - the
     famed Block II agreement (614 MMcf/d) - due to the restrictions that 
FERC had
     placed on the delivery rights of the capacity. In a Jan. 27 letter, 
Enron notified El Paso
     of its intent to exit the Block II contract, but the letter didn't 
indicate that it wanted to
     terminate the Blocks I and III contracts. See Daily GPI, Feb. 3) 

     "They asked for it [to be released] and we agreed to it. It was a mutual 
agreement,"
     said El Paso spokesman Mel Scott. The capacity agreements will be 
terminated on Jan.
     31. Afterward, El Paso said it will hold open season from Feb. 7 to Feb. 
14 for the
     capacity. 

     "It is unfortunate that the recent FERC order modified the capacity 
rights in a way that
     will not allow the capacity to serve the purpose that Enron North 
America originally
     intended when they outbid the prearranged transactions. In the interest 
of fairness and
     good customer relations, we have agreed to release them from the 
contracts," said John
     W. Somerhalder II, president of El Paso Energy's Pipeline Group. 

     El Paso Natural Gas has asked FERC to reconsider the mid-January order 
that
     essentially has reduced the commercial value of the Block II firm 
transportation
     capacity that Enron had agreed to acquire. With the collapse of its 
contract deal with
     Enron, it couldn't be immediately determined whether El Paso will 
continue to pursue
     rehearing. 

     El Paso is seeking rehearing after being rebuffed by FERC in its request 
to stay the
     provision in the order restricting delivery rights of Block II capacity. 

     The pipeline is seeking a reversal of a decision in which FERC said El 
Paso's 1996
     turned-back capacity settlement bars El Paso from marketing Block II 
capacity on a
     primary basis to any delivery point other than the one at Pacific Gas &
     Electric-Topock, AZ. That ruling stripped the Block II capacity of 
primary delivery
     access to the Southern California Gas-Topock delivery point, which is 
the most
     sought-after by shippers of San Juan Basin gas. 

     It was a major blow to El Paso and Enron, which had contracted for the 
Block II
     capacity in December on the condition that it would have primary 
delivery access to the
     Southern California market.. 

     Without a favorable decision on rehearing, "the result may well be a 
diminution of the
     value of Block II capacity," El Paso told FERC. "Without question, 
Enron, as a new
     shipper on the capacity" and future holders of that capacity "will 
suffer a disadvantage in
     the market...." 

     El Paso contends the Commission's ruling, if unchanged, would thwart the 
intent of the
     1996 settlement, which called for the pipeline and its customers to 
share the risks of
     unsubscribed capacity on El Paso's system, and for El Paso to share a 
portion of the
     revenues it received from re-marketing the capacity. 

     "An essential element in El Paso's ability to maximize the revenues it 
agreed to share
     with its firm customers was the ability to market the 614 MMcf/d of 
Block II capacity
     on a primary basis to delivery points other than PG&E-Topock," the 
pipeline noted.
     Stripping El Paso of delivery-point flexibility for Block II capacity 
"will have a serious
     adverse impact on [its] ability to generate the maximum possible 
revenues for its
     capacity and thereby recover the costs it and its customers would 
otherwise have to
     absorb." 

     El Paso further said the Commission's decision was at odds with a 1998 
order
     addressing whether the pipeline could re-market capacity turned back by 
PG&E to the
     SoCal-Topock delivery point on a primary basis. Since the 1996 
settlement was silent
     on whether El Paso could re-market the capacity to delivery points other 
than
     PG&E-Topock, the Commission reasoned the settlement didn't preclude El 
Paso from
     selling the capacity at SoCal-Topock. 

     "That ruling established the proper interpretation of the 1996 
settlement. Now, the
     Commission has re-interpreted that same provision in a manner that is 
completely
     contrary to its previous ruling. The Commission provides no explanation 
as to how
     these two rulings can be reconciled or, alternatively, why it has 
changed its mind...." 

     El Paso said it was also seeking rehearing because it "cannot find any 
evidence" in the
     mid-January order that the Commission "even read, much less considered" 
its response
     as to the "proper interpretation" of the1996 settlement.

Jinbaek,

The answer to the 1st question is yes.
The project list is fine with me and is still valid. We are an organization
driven by the needs of our internal customers.

I shall froward your message to the  person in EBS.
Hopefully, we shall get a positive response.

Vince

Jinbaek Kim <jinbaek@ieor.berkeley.edu> on 03/15/2001 01:12:32 AM
Dr. Kaminski,

Sorry for the late response,
it took me some time to coordinate things.
Finally, it's almost dont :-)
It turned out that from June to August
will be best for me for work at ENRON
(Say June.4 to August.4)

But I still need to know several things from your side.
Could you answer following questions?

First:
Is my suggested working period is OK with you?
If so, let me know what to do for settlement
during the period.

Second:
I got a list of work, I might be able to do for
DealBench team from Ross and Suresh.
I'd like to know it is still a valid work list:
The list he sent is as following:

> 1.  Write a paper in layman's terms that answers
> questions like the following:
> Benefits of auctioning online for both buyers and
> sellers, particularly in reverse auctions
> Explanation how multi-variable auctions are not
> as efficient as price-only auctions (is this true?)
> How many participants are recommended for a
> successful live auction
> What types of goods and services are best suited
> for live auctions versus sealed bid quotes
> Opinions on lotting strategies
> Trends in online private auctions

> 2.  Identify appropriate recent auction research (3
> or 4 papers out of the 90+ you provided)and obtain approvals from the
> authors to post on our site

> 3. Create a list/bibiliography of relevant auction
> literature (with hyperlinks?)

> 4.  Would you be willing to offer auction consulting
> services to our customers (if they are interested)

Third:
There is an e-procurement forum at Haas School of business,
in May 22. The chair of the forum is my advisor Prof. Arie Segev.
A person from Wells Fargo Bank will talk about Wells Fargo's role
in e-marketplace payment initiative,
where ENRON broadband services is also one of key players

Revolution" - Monday, February 7, 2000

Dear Mr. Kaminski:

I am pleased to invite you as our guest to attend a special private CERA
workshop on "Energy and E-Business: The New Quiet Revolution," to be held
next Monday, February 7th from 9:00-11:00AM at the Westin Galleria Hotel in
Houston Texas, in conjunction with CERAWEEK 2000.  This event will be an
interactive forum to stimulate new thinking and an integrative framework for
how e-business will transform the energy industry - and the resulting
strategic and operational challenges.

The morning will include brief presentations by CERA experts focused on
e-business developments in various energy segments - retail, upstream, and
power - followed by discussion among participants on the implications and
lessons.

This event inaugurates CERA's "E-Squared" Energy and E-Business Retainer
Advisory Service - a new program offering continuous analysis and insight on
how e-business is changing energy industry strategy and structure - and how
companies can take advantage of the internet opportunity.  At the conclusion
of the session we will present our plans and research agenda for your
consideration and discussion.  We value your contribution to shaping this
new CERA offering.

To view the agenda for this session, and to obtain an enrollment form,
please go to  http://eprofile.cera.com/cfm/track/mc.cfm?p=524&c=2804

Participation is limited to CERAWEEK participants and invited guests.  To

interest in the HR application support lead position.

Vince, how was it left with the headhunter on how to contact him?

Greg

   
	
	

Since I only talk to a very few headhunters that we've already done business 
with and who have provided good people, I'll say "no, I have no current 
needs" which is what I tell every headhunter that calls (at least one a day).

RE: EUROPEAN ENERGY 2000, 3 & 4 APRIL 2000, AMSTERDAM

I hope all is well in sunny Houston. It is with great pleasure that I enclose 
details of our forthcoming annual European congress, European Energy 2000. I 
would very much like to invite you to become involved as a chairperson and 
speaker for the following topic 'Applying weather risk management 
methodologies to the European energy market', although I would of course be 
more than happy to discuss any of the other sections with you eg. 'Estimating 
volatility for efficient pricing, trading and risk management'.

I hope we can work together on this event and I look forward to hearing from 
you soon. As always, my deadline is quite tight so I would appreciate 
receiving a response from you at your earliest convenience.

Dr. Les Clewlow and Dr Chris Strickland hold Associate Research Positions
at both the School of Finance and Economics, University of Technology,
Sydney and the Financial Options Research Centre, University of Warwick,
UK.  Together they have over 20 years combined experience in the financial
and energy derivative markets and have published many articles in academic
and trade journals.  They are the authors of the book "Implementing
Derivatives Models" (Wiley, 1998) and editors of "Exotic Options: The State
of the Art" (ITP, 1998). Their forthcoming book, "Energy Derivatives:
Pricing and Risk Management," is due to be published during the second
quarter 2000.  Currently, their interests are concentrated in the energy
derivatives area, where they have developed a wide range of pricing tools
for electricity options and other energy derivatives.

THIS NOTE IS FROM TED MURPHY (not bjorn hagelman)

My understanding is that yet another meeting has been scheduled with the 
intent of diverting resources from the GRMS project to some other project.

While I am not privy to the urgency of this other project, I do know that we 
have a very large, multi -phase project going in GRMS.
GRMS stands for the GLOBAL RISK MONITORING SYSTEM.  It is not intended to be 
a commercial trading product not is its primary purpose for commercial 
decision-making.  Conceptually, it is a risk warehouse for the primary 
purpose of RAC due to the deficiency of current front office trading systems 
and their inability to provide timely, aggregated information useful to RAC.  

RAC has spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed task 
list to accomplish its objectives.  As a firm we are woefully behind our 
press clippings in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile.  
My most recent sojorn  in Europe is a classic example of the current systems 
inabilty to aggregate and meet the needs of RAC having abetted poor decision 
making and causing cash losses in well in excess of the GRMS budget or that 
of the Market Risk Group in RAC.  

The GRMS project is a requirement that Bill Bradford and I have in order to 
do our jobs.  We have delegated authority to Debbie Brackett and Rudi Zipter 
to make decisions regarding priorities and as such meet regularly with 
Jonathon and his team as well as Rick Buy to provide updates.  While progress 
is never as fast as we would like it, in every instance in which we have only 
to rely on RAC, Jonathon's team and Research to make a deadline it haas been 
hit.  The primary reason for any delays whatsoever has been the diversion of 
resources off the project or the reliance for cooperation from some other 
source - most recently the IT staff in London was a tremendous impediment to 
deadlines.  

Please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note, 
but I feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening.  
Also, I have had several employees come to resignation over their frustration 
on the lack of management support for this project, usually manifesting 
itself in the lack of resources or the diversion of resources devoted to it.

I think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphase 
project and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted.  Please let us 
do our jobs.  I do not denigrate the efforts of others, but I believe that 
they must either submit their detailed requirements to us for our 
consideration of their worthiness to put in OUR que or develop their own 
project with their own resources.

Thank you for your consideration of this opinion.  As it relates to things 
that will effect the ability of Market Risk to do its job, please consult me 
as I would you.

Mr. Vincent J. Kaminski
Vice President, Research
Dear Mr. Kaminski:

We want to make a special offer to you regarding the mid-project workshop
for CERA's new study "High Tension: The Future of Power Transmission in
North America".  This session will be held on Friday, February 11, 2000 from
8:30AM - 1:30PM in the Monarch Room at the Westin Galleria Hotel, in
Houston, Texas.

In consideration of your participation in CERAWEEK 2000, we invite you to
enroll in the workshop for a special, stand-alone fee of $5,000.
Participation in the workshop (normally available only to those enrolled in
the study) will provide you with the workshop briefing book, a recap of work

Dear Vince,
1.Thanks for the beautiful"parchemin"
2.I am glad I bought some Enron shares after meeting
Mr Skilling last April with Bob Merton
3.After a terrible month of January,we may have found
a possible route to improve my son's health
4.We have added to our software forward start plain-
vanilla and Asian options,caps,floors(consistently
with the Asian options and swaptions);a whole variety
of swings of different specifications.
I really believe it is quite good(in particular the consistent
modelling of forward &Futures price moves)
I am putting a new brochure in the mail for you and
would be delighted if you decided to use part of it
(or the totality!)as a comparison with your own results.
Kind regards
Helyette

Vince:

Is the following all right to send to the group?

The question has arisen as to whether Enron has "personal days", that, 
you can take in case of repair problems at home; car problems; sick spouse, 
sick child, etc.

I checked with HR and the Policy Manual and the answer is "no", but they
can be designated at the discretion of the supervisor.  I talked this over
with Vince and he has decided that the Research Group will be allowed
two (2) personal days per year to take care of personal business and
not have to take a vacation day, discretionary day, or leave of absence.

If you have advance notice (such as an air conditioner repair scheduled),
please let me know when you are going to take these days.  If an 
emergency arises with no notice, please call in and let me know that you 
are taking a personal day.  It will be coded on your time sheet.

These two personal days will in no way cancel or take the place of, "funeral 
leave", "family leave", or "civic duty leave".  They are just a way of being 
able to take care of repair problems and other personal problems that arise.  
These should be very beneficial and I am sure very much appreciated by 
all of us.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Shirley

Jodi,

Chris can set up a conference call with myself, Stinson Gibner and Zimin Lu 
to discuss
the real option applications. My assistant Shirley Crenshaw, 3-5290, will be 
glad to help him.

Vince

   

Vince - 

Per my voicemail, the following is the message I received from Chris Swenson 
about the Kellogg Class he is trying to form.  Please let me know if you 
would be able to help him.  Thanks.

Jodi

Hi Jodi,

I have been remiss in keeping up with you and letting you know what is
going on
in my little world here at Kellogg.

In other matters, life at Kellogg has me very busy at the moment.  I am taking
a full load, including Fin Decisions and am helping Prof. Petersen write a new
class called Advanced Valuation, which will be offered in the spring.  A big
part of the focus of this class is going to be on real options, which is cool
stuff.  And as poor as my timing is, I would like to ask you a
question/favor.
For purposes of this class, do you think it would be possible to obtain
some of
Enron's thoughts on real options?  I was thinking, for example, that a
fuel-switching analysis would be neat to included in the case packet.  Of
course, none of the numbers or names need be real-- only the concepts.  Well,
let me know what you think of that-- who knows, Enron might actually like the
free exposure.

All the best,

Chris

Dear Vince,

I just left voice mail for you.  We are interested in obtaining copies of
the papers you'll be using as the basis for your presentations on Thursday
and Friday so that we can get these materials distributed.  Can you call me
at 225-388-0447 so we can discuss this?  I would also like to be able to go
over the schedule with you just to make sure that we are on the same page.

Thanks for taking the time to visit us.  We are looking forward to your visit.

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

about it). I would like an overhead projector for it, if possible. Thanks,

Steve,

We can accelerate the process. We need some internal approvals.
Please, talk to Richard Lewis and  let him know I think it's OK
to publish it because it is a very high level theoretical paper.

I have received an inquiry through one of our employees (David Barr)
from Chicago Partners, a consulting firm in Chicago. They specialize, among 
other
things, in regulatory economics and could be useful as experts in our 
discussions with

expert.

Please, let me know if you are interested.

Thanks.

Ian,

Sorry for a delay in responding to you.
I am currently in London, flying back to Houston tomorrow.

The problem is not  with the lawyers. We worked on our presentation
materials together with a professor from another university
and we agreed to use these materials only internally.

We have to honor our commitment to him. I am sure
that this is exactly what you would have expected from us if we had
made a similar commitment to you.

Vince
 

 What do I need to do to move this thing forward?
I suspect that the problem is basically with the lawyers.  They only know how 
to stop things, but in a way they play a role in global society.  If it were 
not for the handicaps they lay on us the rest of the world would never have a 
chance.

Ian,

Sorry for a delay in getting back to you.
I have one challenge I did not anticipate
when I talked to you  the first time about our Real Options
internal seminar.

The materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
from another school, and there is some  sensitivity regarding
the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the
materials
outside Enron.

Please, give me some time to find out if I can work
around this issue.

Vince

I still have not heard from your lawyer.  I would like to see whar
materials you are using and assess how we could work on the topic of
real
options with Enron

Hi Vince

Bryan Seyfried will be in Houston on the 9, 10 & 11th February and was hoping 
to arrange an hour with you on one of these days.  He is available any time 
except the morning of 10th February.

Could you please let me know if this is possible and if so what time suits 
you.

Thanks
Danya

Chris,

No problem. Feel free to mention our names.

Hi Vince,

I have pulled a list of names together that I would like to send some
samples of our chapters of the book too, in the next couple of days,  in
order to try and get one or two sentence "reviews" for the dust jacket of
the book. I obviously won't say anything about Enron's sponsorship until it
is official sorted out, but is it OK if I indicate that yourself and Grant
are contributing material to the book?

I'm proposing to send 5 or 6 chapters to the following - unless you have
any objections or suggestions?

David Shimko
Ehud Ronn
Helyette Geman
Mark Garman
Dragana Pilipovic
Corwin Joy
Ilia Bouchouev
Alexander Edyleland
Steve Thomas

Hope the writing is going OK, and regards to Grant.

Best regards.

Chris

Jason,

There was a problem with the request. I could not approve it (the system would
not let me do it). There must have been a  mistake in the way it was 
submitted).
Please, ask Shirley to resubmit.

Vince

   
	
	

Vince,

A few weeks ago we talked about installing an additional Bloomberg terminal 
on the 31st floor for Mike's weather team.
 I have submitted a security request, and we are now waiting for your 
approval.  
Could you, please, go over that request and give Mike Roberts and me your 
feedback?

Jason Sokolov

Kevin,

Thanks for your concern.

On Saturday I came to work and did some things that I needed to do.
Also, there were some things  left undone that  I felt I should do. 

Mainly the conference room - We will schedule all birthday's and meetings in 
the large conference room therefore , I made the room look more spacious.

Also on Monday - we need to check with the painters too see if they are going 
to repair our walls.

We also need to get the additional pictures from the cage and get 
them placed on the wall whereby the move can be completed.

If either of you have any questions or know of more things to do please
let's get together and discuss.

                                                                Thanks

Vince:

Michael Crew would like you to be a speaker on Wednesday, May 23rd
instead of the 24th at the Rutgers Conference.  Is this ok?

He is preparing the agenda and needs to know as soon as possible.

Shirley

Shirley,

This is to follow up today's conversation with Anita.  As mentioned Paul 
Kleindorfer invited Vince to be our dinner speaker on Thursday, May 24.  On 
reflection given the strong line up for Wednesday - Fred Kahn et al - we 
would very much like Vince to be the speaker on Wednesday.  This will 
conclude the day very well giving participants a strong incentive to be there 
for the Wednesday. 

I gather that this change should be acceptable to Vince.  

We will show Vince's name as follows:

 

Wincety J. Kaminski

Managing Director - Research

ENRON

Jeremy will be em ailing you the program with this information immediately.

We would like to go to press today.  Failing that we can go to press 
tomorrow.  We would very much appreciate your confirming this and making any 
corrections or changes.  If you would respond to all of us it would be 
appreciated.

Sandeep,

Can DPC sell to MSEB and have EIPL buy an equivalent amount of power from 
MSEB at another spot on their grid, and then EIPL sell to the 3rd party state?

Pinnamaneni Krishnarao@ECT
01/27/2000 04:00 PM
Sandeep:
 I met with Bob today and discussed the deal structure we put together. On 
the mark-to-market issue, Bob and his colleague Wess told me that as long as 
payments are tied to one particular plant, we cannot m-t-m them. They had 
same problem with plants here in the US (like the peaking plants) and they 
had to separate the plant from power sales to be able to m-t-m the assocated 
cashflows.  What they did is: they sold power from the plant to an outside 
party and bought it back from them at completely different (multiple) 
locations. The buyback is not tied to any specific plant and is marked to 
maket. Even if Enron can somehow mark-to-market a deal with DPC, it can do so 
for only 50% of the cashflows because only 50% of DPC is owned by outsiders.  
And a simple loan to an affiliate cannot also be marked to market.

 Bob was suggesting that if EIPL buys options from DPC and from some other 
plants and in turn sells power to AP or Karnataka then we could have a case 
for m-t-m. Politically DPC selling power to EIPL may not be the best 
solution, to put it rather mildly!

Our alternatives, as I see them, are
1. Do the deal as we structured it. The only difference is that Enron doesn't 
mark it to market and income is      earned only in 2002-03.
2. Do the deal as we structured it. EIPL/Enron then sells the contract to 
another party at a profit. The problem, of course, is finding this party and 
forking part of the profit to them. 
3. Same deal, except revenue securitization is done through an outside party 
in India (not EIPL).

Bob said he will think about the issues some more this week. Let me know when 
you will be here next week so we can meet with Bob together. I will be going 
to Boston for Tuesday and/or Wednesday (Feb.1-2). I can book an appt. with 
Bob for us.

Sandeep Kohli@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
01/23/2000 09:45 PM
Bob,

I wanted to continue the analysis on mark-to-market that I had spoken to you 
about on the phone.  

I thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction 
by phone, so I am having Krishnarao who is in Vince's group explain the 
transaction to you.

Krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in India, and he has just 
returned to Houston from India after working with the team here.

He will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction.  I would 
like you to please spend some time with him, and then based on the discussion 
please send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to 
market.

Please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from 
the Indian side.  This is a very important transaction for us, and we may 
need to repeat this in coming months, hence setting up the system to account 
for these maybe well worth it.  Also, what I am concerned about is that there 
will be an Enron India (EIPL) account in India based on Indian GAAP, and upon 
consolidation there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US.  It is here that 
we would like to have mark-to-market accounting.  EIPL is structured through 
Mauritius, and then Caymen Islands.

Another key question to consider is that when we m-t-m the transaction in the 
US there will be a tax accruing in the year of m-t-m (say 2000).  However, in 
India, as a result of the accrual accounting, there will not be any income 
showing till the year 2002 or 2003.  We will need to know how that would get 
treated, and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the 
US.  I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied, since none of 
the income is being brought back into the US (remains overseas - subpart-F 
and other concerns).

Finally, we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and 
getting a fixed for floating swap in the US (this is still not allowed to 
Indian Corporates).  I need you to think about this too, and see if some type 
of accounting will solve this issue.  Krishna knows what I am talking about, 
and will brief you on the same.

Krishna - Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here.

Look forward to your help and comments.  This is going to be an exciting 
project for us all.

Regards,
Sandeep.

THIS NOTE IS FROM TED MURPHY (not bjorn hagelman)

My understanding is that yet another meeting has been scheduled with the 
intent of diverting resources from the GRMS project to some other project.

While I am not privy to the urgency of this other project, I do know that we 
have a very large, multi -phase project going in GRMS.
GRMS stands for the GLOBAL RISK MONITORING SYSTEM.  It is not intended to be 
a commercial trading product not is its primary purpose for commercial 
decision-making.  Conceptually, it is a risk warehouse for the primary 
purpose of RAC due to the deficiency of current front office trading systems 
and their inability to provide timely, aggregated information useful to RAC.  

RAC has spent over a year developing a business plan scope and detailed task 
list to accomplish its objectives.  As a firm we are woefully behind our 
press clippings in our ability to aggregate and understand our risk profile.  
My most recent sojorn  in Europe is a classic example of the current systems 
inabilty to aggregate and meet the needs of RAC having abetted poor decision 
making and causing cash losses in well in excess of the GRMS budget or that 
of the Market Risk Group in RAC.  

The GRMS project is a requirement that Bill Bradford and I have in order to 
do our jobs.  We have delegated authority to Debbie Brackett and Rudi Zipter 
to make decisions regarding priorities and as such meet regularly with 
Jonathon and his team as well as Rick Buy to provide updates.  While progress 
is never as fast as we would like it, in every instance in which we have only 
to rely on RAC, Jonathon's team and Research to make a deadline it haas been 
hit.  The primary reason for any delays whatsoever has been the diversion of 
resources off the project or the reliance for cooperation from some other 
source - most recently the IT staff in London was a tremendous impediment to 
deadlines.  

Please excuse the frustration that is apparently coming through in this note, 
but I feel like the boy with his finger in the dyke and no one is listening.  
Also, I have had several employees come to resignation over their frustration 
on the lack of management support for this project, usually manifesting 
itself in the lack of resources or the diversion of resources devoted to it.

I think we have proven collectively that we can organize a modular multiphase 
project and provide tangible deliverables when not distracted.  Please let us 
do our jobs.  I do not denigrate the efforts of others, but I believe that 
they must either submit their detailed requirements to us for our 
consideration of their worthiness to put in OUR que or develop their own 
project with their own resources.

Thank you for your consideration of this opinion.  As it relates to things 
that will effect the ability of Market Risk to do its job, please consult me 
as I would you.

Bryan,

FYI

Vince
Dan sent this information as a follow up to our meeting this week.  If there 
is any additional information you would like to see, please let me know.

In the absense of any objections, I would like to begin having our analysts 
use the Financial Stress score to underwrite small exposures where financial 
statements are not received.  In addtion to saving some expense, this will 
allow greater consistentency.  And moving forward, I believe we can map 
expected defaults from FStress score ranges to those implied in credit 
spreads, and in doing so map to E-ratings for use in credit reserve 
analytics.  I've had prelimiary discussions with Rabi and Amititava regarding 
this.

Any additional insights would be helpful, and thanks for your help.

Mark,

Attached are a presentation on the Financial Stress Score and the countries
that have risk scores available today. Please let me know if you have any
questions.

In response Vince's question regarding false positives from the model, that
is a little difficult to answer.  The model is predicting the likelihood of
a company experiencing financial distress.  We are not saying that all
companies with a high risk score will experience financial distress.  In
other words, it is not really a yes or no proposition.  It' not like a drug
test where the test either comes back positive or negative and ocassionally,
you get a false positive test result.  We are identifying companies that are
at high risk for failure.  Some of those high risk companies will fail and
some will not fail.  How many in each classification that will ultimately
fail is addressed in the performance charts attached below.

Please let me know if you have any other questions or need any additional
information.

Co slychac. W Polsce zimno, ponuro, w Gdansku aktualnie odwilz, co  sprzyja
grypie. Uciekamy przed grypa na tydzien do Bialki Tatrzanskiej pod
Zakopanem. Bylismy tam w zeszlym roku przez 4 dni w zimie i bardzo nam sie
podobalo. Gory w zimie sa naprawde piekne. Bylismy pierwszy raz w zimie w
gorach od 25 lat.
Bardzo bedziemy chcieli wpasc jutro do Pabianic (albo  w drodze powrotnej do
Gdanska). Nie wiem, czy to sie uda, bo wieczor zapada bardzo wczesnie, a ja
nie moge jezdzic w nocy. Latwo sie mecze i szybki zasypiam .Bylem u Twoich
dziewczyn we wrzesniu, przypominalem sobie stare czasy jak nocowalismy u Was
z rodzicami, ojciec siedzial na lezaku pod jablonia. Ech.
Bylo, minelo.Slyszalem, ze Wicusiowi idzie nadzwyczajnie. Pamietam, jakim Ty
byles ulubienicem taty (Peptydy w Juracie, pamietasz).
Michal ze swoja narzeczona wybiera sie w lecie do Ameryki. Chcialby
podszkolic sie w angielskim i przy okazji troche popracowac. Oboje studiuja
medycyne na trzecim roku. Jak myslisz, mogliby znalezc prace w Houston ? Czy
moglbys im w tym pomoc ? Oni chcieliby tylko znalezc prace, nie chca Was w
niczym absorbowac.
Co o tym myslisz ?
Jak bedziesz znowu w Polsce, daj znac. Musze z przyjemnoscia powiedziec, ze
poglady polityczne Eli, Jadzi i nasze sa identyczne. Nawet nie mamy sie o co
poklocic. Generalnie sie zgadzam  z Balcerowiczem, ale uwazam, ze
reforma zdrowia jest do d.  Doznajemy tego na wlasnej skorze.
Trzymajcie sie cieplo i do uslyszenia.

    Dear Mr. Kaminski:

    How are you doing? I want to find out if we can meet again for a quick 
lunch.

    You might know that in Maharashtra, India there is now a new Chief 
Minister
    (CEO of the State Government). I am proud to say that he and I are from 
the same
    town, Latur.

    I would really enjoy talking with you again, at your convenience.

    I will call you tomorrow to follow up.

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating

Title: Briefing Note: Demand Overtakes Hydro in 2000
Author: Moritzburke, Zenker, Snyder
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: California Energy ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5166&m=1054 ,

Western energy markets are starting the new year with precipitation 
conditions that suggest a repeat of 1999's hydroelectric conditions: 
near-normal snowpacks in the Pacific Northwest and Canada and low snowpacks 
in California. More significantly, even if snowpacks remain high in the 
Pacific Northwest, normal demand growth coupled with normal runoff patterns 
in the second and third quarters of 2000 would

*  reinforce the likelihood that gas prices will again set the floor for 
on-peak power prices

*  keep differentials across western power markets narrow

*  support higher power prices and increase volatility as gas-fired 
generation is run more intensively to meet demand in a market with tightening 
capacity margins

From 1999 to 2000, natural gas demand will swing upward by nearly 1,200 
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day in the third quarter in response to a 
return to normal hydroelectric output and demand growth. Gas price increases 
will follow from this increased demand. Although differentials between Topock 
and the Henry Hub during the third quarter of last year averaged only $0.05 
per MMBtu above the Henry Hub price, CERA expects to see differentials this 
year averaging around $0.25 per MMBtu above Henry. This stronger western 
demand should also narrow differentials between the Henry Hub and the San 
Juan Basin, and to a lesser extent, between Henry and the Permian Basin.

Western Snowpack and Hydro Capacity: A Subregional Story
Since the beginning of winter the Pacific Northwest has received normal 
precipitation, with greater snowpacks in the northern part of that region 
than in the southern part. California currently lags behind historical 
precipitation levels at roughly 26 percent of average (see Figure 1). Given 
current conditions, it is possible that California will end winter at 
below-average hydroelectric conditions.

Western hydroelectric facilities are concentrated in Oregon, Washington, and 
British Columbia, which contain over 75 percent (roughly 46,500 megawatts 
[MW]) of the Western Systems Coordinating Council's (WSCC's) hydroelectric 
capacity, producing 80 percent (roughly 253,500 gigawatt-hours [GWh]) of the 
region's total hydroelectric generation in an average year (see Figure 2). 
Because of this high concentration of facilities, above-average precipitation 
in the Pacific Northwest can help to offset below-average precipitation in 
California and other parts of the West, although transfer capabilities limit 
the amount of energy exported from those regions.

Power Markets for 2000: Building on 1999 Dynamics
Despite hydroelectric output that was 15 percent higher than average in 1999, 
western power prices reflected the cost of gas-fired generation resources 
during nearly all periods of the year. This was a greater proportion of the 
year than in 1998 even though hydroelectric production in 1998 was only 95 
percent of 1999 levels.* CERA expects several factors to strengthen this 
dynamic in 2000, assuming normal weather conditions:

*  Western demand growth. Normal weather and economic growth will increase 
regional demand by roughly 2 percent in 2000. Growth will be strongest in the 
second and third quarters, at 6 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, adding 
9,000 GWh of demand in the second quarter, followed by 6,000 GWh in the third.

*  Return to normal hydroelectric production levels and patterns. Not only 
was 1999 hydroelectric production above normal, but 1999 Pacific Northwest 
runoff was prolonged by cool weather in the second and third quarters. Normal 
runoff dynamics in 2000 would remove roughly 6,500 MW of hydro capacity from 
the Pacific Northwest resource stack from the second to the third quarters 
(see Figure 3). By contrast, Pacific Northwest hydroelectric capacity was 
depleted by an estimated 3,000 MW from the second to the third quarters in 
1999 as a result of slower snowpack melt. This provided unseasonably high 
hydroelectric availability in the Pacific Northwest through the third and 
fourth quarters. The combination of reduced hydroelectric availability in a 
normal-weather year in 2000, a shifting of hydroelectric production back to a 
second quarter peak, and higher West-wide demand will increase the pull on 
nonhydroelectric generation resources (see Figure 4).

*  Energy exports to California. Sustained hydroelectric availability in 1999 
in the Pacific Northwest allowed exports from the region to California to 
remain strong through the third and fourth quarters, with exports at 150 and 
290 percent of normal, respectively. Exports added roughly 1,400 average 
megawatts (aMW) above average--and as much as 2,000 aMW in August--to 
California's resource base throughout the year. For 2000, CERA expects normal 
hydroelectric exports to average roughly 2,000 aMW (total of 17,500 GWh) 
during the year and 2,400 aMW (total of 5,300 GWh) in the third quarter (see 
Figure 5).

In 2000 the combination of normal load growth, normal spring and summer 
weather, and reduced hydroelectric availability will cause capacity margins 
to shrink, particularly in California (see Figure 6). The impact on power and 
gas prices will be

*  Higher average power prices. Lower average streamflows will diminish the 
output of run-of-river hydroelectric facilities during peak summer demand 
periods. As runoff dwindles into the summer, production from reservoir-fed 
facilities is available for a decreasing period of the on-peak hours. Other 
generation resources, particularly gas-fired, will be used to meet demand 
during a growing number of shoulder and off-peak hours in 2000. On-peak power 
prices will be driven higher by the increased use of gas-fired generation 
during shoulder hours. Off-peak power prices will respond to the greater 
reliance on gas-fired generation during those hours.

*  Higher average gas prices. Gas demand for power generation is expected to 
increase by 600 MMcf per day on average in 2000 and by up to 1,200 MMcf per 
day in the third quarter. This will contribute to price strength in western 
gas markets and to the higher costs of generating power.

Natural Gas Market
Although the effects of a return to normal hydro conditions become most 
evident in the third quarter as overall generation loads increase, CERA 
expects that some decline in hydroelectric output relative to last year is 
already causing a modest increase in gas demand in California. Although 
January West Coast weather has been comparable to last year, flows into 
California are up by 300 MMcf per day so far this month; storage withdrawals 
are up on a year-over-year basis as well. Based on the lower snowpack and 
lower average precipitation in California this month relative to last 
January, in-state hydroelectric generation explains approximately 400 MMcf 
per day of increased gas demand.

Normal hydroelectric generation this year will likely bring a 250 MMcf per 
day increase in western gas demand for power generation during the first 
quarter. Early indications of normal-to-above-normal snowpack and 
precipitation in the Pacific Northwest should center these increases in 
California.

This modest demand increase has helped support prices in the western markets, 
with regional weather differences contributing to western strength as well. 
Weather in both the United States as whole and the West averaged 10 percent 
warmer than normal during December, but during January temperatures in the 
West averaged only 8 percent warmer than normal while temperatures in the 
United States averaged 30 percent below normal.

Western Regional Prices
Over the next two months as seasonal heating loads within the West begin to 
tail off and hydroelectric generation increases modestly, differentials 
between western producing basins and the Henry Hub should widen. At the same 
time, as required flows into California decline, the Topock premium above 
Henry Hub prices should decline, with prices eventually falling below the Hub 
price. However, with normal weather in the West, that general weakening in 
western prices will likely take place toward the end of February and into 
March. Given the warm January, CERA expects heating load to decline by only 
400 MMcf per during February. Loads look sufficient to sustain western 
differentials near current levels.

California
As more normal winter weather takes hold in the East, prices should increase 
in that market relative to California. So far this month, strong flows into 
the state have held Topock differentials around $0.10 per MMBtu relative to 
the Henry Hub. During February flows into the state are expected to decline 
somewhat as heating demand begins to decline. Table 1 shows expected flows 
into California for winter 1999/2000 compared with winter 1998/1999. That 
weakening in the Topock differential is limited, however. Expected lower 
storage inventories in California relative to last year, as well as a low 
upside to eastern prices, should keep Topock prices from falling more than 
$0.05 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub during February. Topock prices are 
expected to maintain a $0.03 per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub price (see 
Table 2).

Pacific Northwest
Although some cold weather in the Pacific Northwest has held Malin prices 
close to Topock prices during January, CERA expects the Malin price to weaken 
relative to Topock during February--and more dramatically in March. Two 
factors are expected to contribute to this weakening:

*  Hydroelectric output. Although February will bring a decline in heating 
load in both the Pacific Northwest and California regions, gas will receive 
some support from decreased hydroelectric generation relative to last year in 
California. In the Pacific Northwest gas demand is limited during spring even 
in normal hydroelectric generation conditions.

*  Canadian flows. Flows to the West Coast on Pacific Gas Transmission during 
the first quarter of 1999 dropped from an average of 2.6 Bcf per day during 
1998 to 2.4 Bcf per day as Canadian supplies headed into the Midwest on the 
Northern Border expansion. This year, given the year-over-year increase in 
Canadian supply, those flows into the Pacific Northwest should rebound to 
1998 levels.

The Topock-Malin differential so far this month has averaged only $0.06 per 
MMBtu. During the first quarter of 1999, that differential averaged $0.09 per 
MMBtu. Because of the forces described above, CERA expects a wider 
differential--$0.13 per MMBtu--this February.

Rocky Mountains
Similar forces will drive a widening in Rocky Mountain prices relative to 
prices in the south. Regional Rockies supplies are likely to increase as 
regional demand declines--although warm January weather will limit declines 
to 100 MMcf per day during February. The decline in heating load in the 
Pacific Northwest, with continued strong Canadian imports, will allow 
increased exports from the Pacific Northwest into the Rocky Mountain region 
on Northwest pipeline--similar to 1998 conditions. Within the Rockies, supply 
builds continue in the Powder River Basin; the new Fort Union and Thunder 
Creek gathering systems are now delivering a total of approximately 100 MMcf 
per day into the Rocky Mountain interstate pipeline system. Rockies 
differentials to the Henry Hub should average $0.25 per MMBtu during February.

Southwest
As demand declines and supply builds in the Rocky Mountains, CERA expects the 
spread between Rocky Mountain and San Juan Basin prices to increase slightly, 
but for February, Rockies heating load will likely keep the prices close. 
Although the differential between the two basins has averaged $0.03 this 
month and held at less than $0.05 during December, a $0.05 per MMBtu spread 
appears likely for February. This slight increase marks only the beginning of 
a wider divergence. CERA expects the differential between the two basins to 
widen to over $0.15 per MMBtu this summer as San Juan prices gain support 
from strong demand in California power markets.

Happy New Year, GPCM Licensees and Evaluators!

Today I've returned to my office to find our computers working just fine,
thank you.  I hope yours are likewise operational.

In today's e-mail, I received a note from Skipping Stone about a new
service that would be possibly of interest to your traders.

The service seems to involve consolidation of the various pipeline EBBs
continuous updates of capacity release information into a comprehensive
report of available, biddable capacity deals.

Though this information might not be particularly crucial for GPCM users,
it very well might be of interest to your trading organizations.

Here's the website info:  http://www.capacitycenter.com/.

By the way, we are working on a new website dedicated to GPCM.  We would
like to get some feedback on what we have currently and what you would like
to see there to help you improve your GPCM operation.

It's not been "prettified" yet, but you can see a pre-release version at
http://gpcm.rbac.com.

This is the first cut at the problem you gave us, done by my associate

Vince-

Here is an analysis of the fund giving at the church.

First off, it appears from the data that a special "appeal" for fund giving 
was made (from the pulpit?) on April 19, 1998 and April 25, 1999, (perhaps 
tied rhetorically into Income Taxes?). Then, by going back and incorporating 
obvious dates from the calendars for 1997-1999, the following regression 
analysis is made, where each effect is added independently:

giving this Sunday = $4403

+ a minor $3 weekly time trend (i.e., multiply by the number of weeks since 
Jan. 5, 1997)

+ no pure effect from last week's contributions (i.e., denies first-order 
autoregressive effects)

+ $2426 if Easter Sunday or the Sunday nearest Christmas

+ $9695 if (pastoral appeal) April 19,1998 or April 25,1999

- $340 if the Sunday falls on the weekend of a Monday Federal holiday

- $50 if the Sunday following Thanksgiving

- $73  if a Summer weekend (June 1 thru August 31)

The pure time trend is very small, so an annual projection based on all 3 
years data would be for giving to increase only a minor amount ($150) for 
2000 assuming a similar appeal for giving is made this April.

Mark your calendars for Friday, January 21 from 11:30 am to 1 pm.  The String 
Trio of New York will be performing in room 5C2.
This lecture/demonstration will feature the Trio taking an in-depth look at 
the labeling and stereotyping in our society,and in particular,
in the arts. It is being provided via the courtesy of DaCamera, and has 
received excellent reviews throughout the nation!

This promises to be an entertaining and educational performance.  Please 
e-mail your RSVP to Deb Gebhardt. The first 80 people
to respond to this invitation will be notified.  Please feel free to bring 
your lunch!

Shelley,

My colleague, Clayton Vernon, who has a background in  economics, wrote a 
short summary of arguments
against the ROFR. 

We are working on the second approach to the problem: we try to come up with 
a numerical estimate of the
value of this option. The fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has 
distributional consequences:
he has something  of value he never paid for. Having a numerical estimate of 
the value of this option
could help to argue against it. The value of such an option is case specific; 
so we shall rather 
produce a template you can use for valuation case by case.

Vince-

Here is an essay on the issue you are discussing:

The Adverse Economic Impact of "Rights of First Refusal"

An option to "first refuse" to match a competitor's offer is a restraint of 
free trade and an impediment to efficiency in the marketplace. This economic 
conclusion is unambiguous.

If an "incumbent" has the right to match an offer made by a competitor, for 
an item or service of value, then few competitors will invest the time and 
expense necessary to prepare and submit offers, those offers will be lower 
than they would have been otherwise, and the contract will often be awarded 
to an inefficient incumbent instead of a more efficient challenger.

In a traditional auction, where all bids are sealed and the item up for 
auction is awarded to the highest bidder, we can safely predict the item will 
be awarded to the bidder who values it the most, at a price reflecting the 
full value of the item up for auction.  This is the efficient result in a 
market economy, because the financing of the high bid reflects resources 
freely allocated to the high bidder.  If the auction has open bids, we can 
again safely predict the item to be awarded to the correct bidder, albeit at 
a slightly lower price to the donor of the item since the bidder with the 
highest valuation can simply increment by an infinitesimal amount the 
second-highest valuation.

Now, in a modified auction, where an incumbent bidder has the right to match 
the highest bid and retain the item for himself, each competing bidder must 
justify his own due diligence and bid preparation expenses against the 
following, and likely, scenario: the incumbent does not spend himself for due 
diligence, but instead uses these savings to help finance his matching the 
top bid from a competitor.

Simply put, the incumbent with a "right of first refusal" can be safely 
predicted to simply match their competitor's bid by "rule of thumb." But the 
incumbent's valuation of the item up for auction can be less than the 
valuation of the competitor, by the amount of the due diligence and 
administrative expenses.  And, the incumbent firm expropriates the expertise 
of his competitors, not only in their valuations themselves, a nontrivial 
financial exercise, but in any operational details required to be submitted 
along with the bid.

Furthermore, in an esoteric concept known as the "Winner's Curse," a bidder 
realizes that if his bid actually prevails, if the incumbent fails to match 
it, he almost certainly overbid.

Given this, most competitors will not even bother to bid in an auction when 
an incumbent has the right of first refusal, and those that submit a bid do 
not rationally invest the time, expense and expertise necessary; they may 
just "fire off" a "low-ball" bid.  After all, in almost every conceivable 
"state of the world" arising from the auction the competitors expect to lose 
money.  So, the incumbent almost always retains the contract at a 
below-market price, despite the incumbent not necessarily placing the highest 
value on the contract because the incumbent cannot put the contract to its 
most efficient use.

Lou,

Thanks a lot.

My name is Fati Liamidi.  I work as an Associate in the URM group in EES. 
I have come up with an value proposition which I think could make sense for
my group and wanted to run it by one of your colleagues to see if they could 
help me out in terms of pricing. 
Would you mind directing me toward somebody in your group who would be 
willing to talk to me?  The idea involves options. 

Thanks you very much in advance.

Vince,

My name is Jeanne Anne Klein and I am a financial modeler working with 
Mingcheng Lian on a high profile pipeline project in China. 

Zimin Lu referred us to you regarding questions we have on the Real Option 
Valuation Approach.  We are very enthusiastic about what we have read and 
heard about this valuation method.

We have been doing some preliminary research on the Real Option Valuation 
approach and believe that integrating this approach into our financial model 
would bring a significant increase to the value to the project.   We have 
identified some deal aspects we believe would be ideal to valuate as real 
options.  Our goal is to work with the development team to structure the deal 
to incorporate the Real Option Valuation approach into the model enabling us 
to arrange the contracts within the deal to optimize the project's value.

We would like to arrange a meeting with you at your ealiest convenience to 
brainstorm on additional deal aspects that can be valued using the real 
option approach as well as on ways to quantify these aspects using the Real 
Option valuation Method. 

Please advise if you will be able to meet with us within the next week or 
two. 

Thank you for your kind attention,

Jeanne Anne

I agree. This would happen when there is an insufficient pipeline capacity
to move gas. The market developments you describe happen quite
often and this is one of the reasons we want to have the model you are working
on.

Clayton Vernon@ENRON
01/17/2000 09:30 AM
Vince-

I forgot to mention to you one other development I propose, a theory I call 
"uncoupling" of basis. As an example, severe cold weather specific to the 
Midwest can result in an elevation of spot market prices at Henry Hub, where 
prices elsewhere in the Northeast are such that the basis appears to be less 
than the commodity charge to ship gas from Louisiana to the Northeast. This 
can happen when gas is not being moved in the spot market from Louisiana to 
the Northeast at that time.  The notion of "equilibrium" cannot, in my view, 
always assume "spot" gas is flowing along all nodes of the network.

Clayton

Naveen,
the "analytical VAR" approach is working for Equity portfolio. 
It gives us the tool to examine the tails' behavior for this portfolio and 
calculate "Expected Tail Loss".
The same should be done for commodities portfolio as well.

Meanwhile, as we discussed, we can give some rough estimates of the losses 
corresponding to percentiles other than 5th.

Look at the figure below. You can see VAR numbers for 5%, 1%, 0.5% and 0.1% 
calculated with 
1) simulations (100 thousand simulations);
2) analytical VAR (gamma-delta positions representation)

 1) and 2) are very close because there are not many options in Equity 
portfolio.

3) simulations (1000 simulations) to calculate 5% VAR. Then in order to 
approximately estimate VAR for 1%, 0.5% and 0.1%
I scaled 5% VAR with factors corresponding to normal distribution (for 
example: Norminv(0.001,0,1)/Norminv(0.05,0,1) for 0.1%).
The result of such extrapolation in this case is quite good (just 5% 
different from the correct number). 
We probably can use such rough estimates of tail for commodities portfolio 
until we have proper methods implemented. 

Tanya Tamarchenko
02/28/2001 01:17 PM
Debbie,
I am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of 
"analytical" VAR in RisktRAC.

Here is why this effort is very important:
1. We need to calculate VAR for other percentile but 5 (1% or even 0.2% as 
mentioned by Rick Buy)
and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations;
2. We need to present additional risk measures (such as Mean Tail Loss) to 
the Board.

The analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested 
already so there will be no problems
with the algorithm itself.

We need to get together and discuss IT implementation.

What do you think?

Vince,

Just to update you on how things are going with regard to EOL -

I had a meeting with John Arnold yesterday to show him what had been 
accomplished to date, and I think that he was fairly impressed by the 
information available. I asked him for his input, and he expressed his 
interest in having a couple of reports made up that couldn't be created from 
the format the data was in. I spoke to Clayton about this, and he has already 
made changes that will reflect a number of the modifications John requested.

I am also continuing to research the issue of an automated trading platform 
for EOL. I have some information about how the NASDAQ operates, and I have 
looked at some websites for ECNs, such as Archipelago, Island and Instinet. I 
have also had a look at the International Securities Exchange (ISE) web-site, 
but they do not seem to explain much about their system. Any further 
suggestions would be appreciated.

I want to find out more about where EOL is currently and what modifications 
may be necessary in the existing system, finish reading the material at the 
websites I have investigated, and then I will try to put together a 
presentation for you and/or Greg Whalley.

Mr. Kaminski;

 I am a Research Associate at Meridien Research
(www.meridien-research.com) in the greater Boston Area. We specialize in the
reporting and analysis of technology in the financial service industry.  I
work in the Risk and Trading Group.
 Currently I am working on a report on Energy Risk Applications.  I
introduced myself to Mr. Scott Neal who informed me that I should contact
you (see below). I would like to spend some time talking to you about
Enron's risk management for energy trading.  And if possible, I would like
to be able to include Enron in my report since they are the global leader in
Energy.
 If it is possible, I would like to talk this week.  My calendar is
pretty open so whenever you would like to talk.  I think the conversation
should take about 45 minutes to an hour.  If you would like a list of
questions, I would be more than happy to provide them.
 I can be reached at 617-796-2830 or dkovelsky@meridien-research.com.
 I look forward to talking to you,

Cheers,

I believe Vince Kaminski could possibly be of assistance in this matter.

Damon Kovelsky <dkovelsky@meridien-research.com> on 03/12/2001 02:05:06 PM

Mr. Neal,

     I wrote you last week a request to spend some time talking to you
about Enron's Energy Risk Management for a report I am writing on energy
risk management applications.  I understand that you are a busy man, but I
would just like a half hour to talk.  If you would like a list of
questions,
I would be happy to provide them.
     This conversation does not have to be on the record if you don't
want it to.  The main purpose for my enquiry is to understand how energy
risk applications are being used "on the ground".  I would like to be able
to write about Enron, but it is not required.
     I look forward to hearing from you.

Cheers,

I want to thank you for considering me as a speaker.

Hi Vince,

I would like to invite you, or one of your staff, to be a speaker at
Infocast's upcoming conference "Market Price Volatility: How to Model,
Assess, and Manage Price Volatility in Today's Power Markets," scheduled for
May 10-12, 2000, in Chicago.  I am attaching a copy of the draft program
agenda for your review.  As you may note, we wish to take our recent Houston
meeting a step farther by making this next session a more
technically-oriented meeting.

There are two spots you may wish to consider:

1. The session entitled "Case Study in Modeling Volatility," scheduled for
Wednesday, May 10th, from 3:30 to 5:00 pm.  You will note below, what we had
in mind for the case study.
2. The talk "A Real Options Approach to Asset Valuation," scheduled for
Thursday, May 11th, from 10:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I am running behind schedule in finalizing this program, so I will give you
a call shortly to follow up with you.  If you wish, please feel free to call
me at 818-888-4445 ext. 28.

I hope you can join us.

CASE STUDY GUIDELINES
1. Model should be for a particular market. Examples: PJM, Chicago, ECAR,
Southern California.

1B (optional). Model should be for a particular purpose. Examples: valuing a
new combustion turbine at the Florida/Georgia border, bidding on a portfolio
of power plants up for sale in NEPOOL, valuing a retail portfolio in
Pennsylvania.
2. Model should be estimated on a particular data set. Examples: daily NYMEX
close prices for Palo Verde, PJM hourly spot prices for 1998-1999.
3. Case study should describe several candidate models, for volatility
and/or market price, that were considered. Case study should discuss why
these models were considered. Candidate models should be described
mathematically and verbally.
4. Evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly
identified, and quantified to the extent possible. Examples of evaluation
criteria: residuals that are not autorcorrelated, stationarity, R-squared,
Akaike information criterion.
5. Parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed. The
estimation procedure employed should be briefly described.
6. Some diagnostics of model fit (vis-a-vis data set) should be presented.
7. If possible, predictive power of model should be assessed.

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the 
documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this 
almost a year, it never 
strikes you that we need a documentation ? 

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on 
Exotica documentation ?   

Zimin 

Paulo Issler
05/02/2001 11:52 AM
I am surprised that we do not have the documentation ready.
I can make that for you. It is not there because you did not put that 
together by the time it was created and all the changes I have made did not 
required changes on the functionality.
Paulo Issler
 

Zimin Lu

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" 
parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.

Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating 
his Asian option portfolio. 
He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see 
the difference made to the model.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new 
input parameter 'Sig' is.

Thanks,

Greg,

Two things I did not manage to mention to you at the meeting on Monday.

1. Joe Carson. I was very positively impressed by Joe Carson.
     Enron  badly needs a senior economist of his stature and 
     experience. He has many contacts in the industry and can represent 
     Enron well. He is very pragmatic and, also, I expect a cool head on old 
     shoulders.

     One negative is that he wants to work out of New York. The tradeoff is 
between
     maintaining  his contacts and working closer with the desks. 

2. Tony Mends. I think you, or Louise, should explore the possibility of 
using the skills of Tony Mends.
    Tony and I are good friends so I may be biased. I think that he is a very 
smart
    and efficient person and can contribute a lot to the organization that 
relies

Dear Vince:

        I am in some preliminary dialogues with some faculty in the math
department about the possibility of establishing a special program perhaps at
master's level on financial engineering.  The attach pdf file is my own
sketch about the program. Since you have extensive knowledge about these
things, can you give me some comments.

Included is the rest of the prices for 4th and 5th Generation 
Semi-submersibles in the Gulf of Mexico.  The only additional Data is from 
Sept 99 through Dec 99.

Attached are the historical numbers for the Semi-submersibles 4th and 5th 
generation day rates.  Their price is 155,000/day for the next 4 years.  I 
would think that a floor of $100,000 would be the place to start Jan 1, 2001 
through Dec 31, 2004.  We need to know the Call strike that would make it 
costless.

I plan on making some examples discussion purposes to discuss with them on 
Friday of this week.  I will update you ASAP on the balance of day rate 
prices.  Let me know what else you will need to prepare the statistical 
analysis.   The numbers include highs and lows; let me know your ideas on how 
to address this in the quote.

Thanks,

Vince,

FEA has arrived at a very simple, direct, and inexpensive approach to
licensing our two VaR-related patents as a package.  I hope that you will
agree that our proposed license fee of $2,500 plus $1 per employee, with
licenses to go to all of your affiliates, would be an attractive offer.  I
would love to sign up Enron for this package as an early customer.  Do you
think you could forward the attached pdf license agreement to the
appropriate people at Enron, together with your recommendation? I am highly
motivated to get Enron as a licensee, and I strongly believe that it will be
a worthwhile effort for both parties.

There is a merger and acquisition dilemma facing the power industry today.
The fact that no clear-cut winning strategy has emerged makes the dilemma
more difficult to resolve. In a December 1 CERA North American Power client
conference call and web presentation, Paul Parshley, CERA Director,
discusses:

*  The long term strategy and short term returns of M&A: What does it mean
for multi-service providers, super-regional provides and the global power
and energy companies?

*  The M&A wave continues: Is it better to be near the front of the pack and
embark on an unproven and risky strategic option and hope for the best, or
to wait until strategic options are better understood and run the risk of
missing the best opportunities?

*  Stock prices of recently merged or acquired companies: Is Warren Buffet
right about the power industry?

Dear Vince,

Do you think you would be able to confirm a talk title and bullet points for 
your 'new research' talk by the end of the first week of January?  In terms 
of the panel discussion we will confirm the actual content and structure 
closer to the date of the conference - in the meantime, if you have any ideas 
as to how we can make the panel as discussive as possible that would be great.

Best regards,
Oliver

    -----Original Message-----
    Oliver,

    I can cover both presentations.

    Vince

    Dear Vince,

    Thank you for agreeing to take part in our annual US congress.
    There were 2 things that I would ideally like you to be involved in.  The 
first
    would be to present any new research you may have.  This would be part of 
stream
    3 (see attached) which looks at new research in derivatives modelling and
    analysis.  If you would like to present any new research that fits into 
the
    rough areas outlined that would be great.
    The second would be part of a panel discussion on weather derivatives 
(number 44
    attached).  I have also invited Jeff Porter (Koch) and Ravi Nathan 
(Aquila).
    Please let me know if you would like to present any new research and/or 
take
    part in the panel.

    i look forward to hearing from you soon.

    Best regards,
    Oliver

Hi Shirley,
I would like to request for a new PC.  My current PC is quite old with not 
enough memory.  Twice 
I ran out of memory and had to have IT people coming to clean it for me. 
Their suggestion is
to either get a new hard drive or a new PC.  Given that Dell has Pentiumc III 
Processor at 800 MHz
on market, I would like to request a PC with process at 500 MHz or higher 
level. 
Thank you very much.

Vince/Vasant,

It has been some time since we spoke at the San Antonio conference.  
Unfortunately,as soon as I got to India I was diagnosed wih a slip disc and 
had to be in bed for a long time.

In the mean time the team continued to work on the concept of a sale to 
another state out of the Dabhol plant.  I have developed the concept whereby 
we are now looking at a firm component (over peak period), and an infirm 
power sale during the monsoon.

The series of quesions and comments from my team in te attachment below 
should help you a bit to get a feel for the proposal.  I am currently in 
Houston and reachable at 281-345-9870.  I maybe needing a surgery for the 
slip disc but am currently on medication hoping that surgery won't be needed.

I would like to wis you all a very happy X'Mas and a Great New Year, and will 
catch you in the NEw YEar in Houston to discuss this wit you further.  I can 
see that soem structuring help will be needed on this, and would like to get 
some help from your end.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Team,

Please find my comments in the word document attached. 

Please go through this and run the sensitivities and get a good idea of way 
to structure thsi.  Having gone through the comments, I feel that it maybe 
necessary to get some help on the structuring side.  I will try to get you 
some structuring expertise asap.  In the mean time, I would like you all to 
focus on getting resources together and working this to the next pass.

Lets see where we can get with this.

Regards,
Sandeep.

As discussed, please find enclosed  a word document which essentially 
discusses most of the issues involved with a Firm Power sale of 50 MW from 
Phase I, which would have to be sorted out with MSEB. 

Vivek & I have also worked out a methodology for computing tariff for this 
firm power sale during the peak period. In doing this, we have tried to keep 
the tariff formula as simple as possible, while simulating the PPA tariffs to 
the extent possible. (Currently, we have just shown the tariff computation; 
will put the tariff formula in the next mail)

The tariff structure & the issue list obviously need further refinement, 
before we discuss it with MSEB.

Looking forward to your comments on both the issue list as well as the tariff 
computation.

regards,

Rajesh S

risk,
operational risk, balance sheet management, insurance and corporate risk
management.
Special sessions will give delegates an insight into the progress of GARP's

surveys
sponsored by the association.

***Take the GARP Member Survey!***

GARP, in association with CWB, has developed the "Risk Management and
Technology
in the 21st Century-Member Survey".  Over the next few weeks, we will be
collecting
your opinions on a variety of issues about the challenges risk managers will
face
in the coming years.  The survey is comprehensive, and covers many aspects
of the
risk management industry including:

*the current state of the industry
*the technological and business issues institutions have faced in order to
get
 where they are today and how those problems were overcome
*how risk management will change and grow in stature due to technology
*lessons learned

The results of the survey will be presented at GARP 2000 and posted on the
GARP
web site shortly thereafter.

The survey contains 27 questions and will take approximately 15 to 20
minutes
to complete.

Vince,

Bijoya is currently working on the development of the website for the new 
credit trading initiative, and we thought it would be a good idea to put my 
recent technical article "Measuring Credit Risk" on it. Are you okay with 
this release, or does it contain any proprietary information we should edit 
out?

Derek,

I am sending you the information you requested in your message.

Please, keep in mind that:

1. Even if we develop the model, in most cases we don't control it  and have 
no
    oversight over its uses. A spreadsheet or generic tools we develop can be 
easily
    used and/or  modified by the end user, without our knowledge
    and involvement.  

2. We typically act as internal consultants and solve narrow, highly complex 
problems that require 
    special skills. We  may not provide solutions to the entire problem,  
though our involvement may
    be interpreted later as our unconditional endorsement of the proposed 
solution.

Over the past few weeks, we have spent time talking to you as well as others 
involved in model development.  As we have completed the first phase of our 
project, we are know moving into the second phase which is testing.  As part 
of this phase, we need your help in identifying Research Group's involvement 
in specific models.  We would appreciate if you could please respond back to 
us with your involvement in developing/reviewing these models based on the 
criteria set forth below.  

Based on our review of Schedule B, we have determined the following Exotic 
Options were valued by models that are not included in the Research Group 
Library.

Commodity  Book   Description (per Schedule B)

Gas   NG Price  FPL - PV Effect
Gas   NG Price  FPL - PV Effect
Gas   NG Price  FPL - PV Effect
Gas   West   West Basis Options 2 Model
Gas   Central   Basis Options

Power   Power-East  LCRA - Spread Option
Power   Power-West  Swaption - Welded Tube

Liquids   Refined Products Heating Oil Exotic Options - Valued in Lotus 
(ASPREAD)

NOX   NOX   Exotic Option
Interest Rate  Interest Rate  Interest Rate

In addition, we would appreciate if you could describe Research Group's 
involvement on the models listed below.

Aruba
Oglethorpe
NPI (JEDI)
Peakers
Bug
Snake River
Structured Credit (Fair Value)

Developing/Reviewing Criteria:
 Low - discussed modeling issues over the phone and/or answered one or two 
general questions

 Medium - answered several questions and were consulted on coding issues

 High - discussed the model in detail, provided assistance with coding and 
may have developed a portion of the   model

 Total Review - completely reviewed the model

 Complete Development - Research Group developed the entire model

Once we have an understanding of Research Group's involvement, we will 
perform more detailed testing procedures. 
Thanks for your cooperation in this matter, and if you have any questions, 
please give myself (x3-6496) or Andy (x3-3348) a call.

Shirley, 

Please, put it on my calendar.

Vince

Vince,

I am delighted that you accept our invitation.  We hope it works out that you 
can attend the whole conference as we are confident that you will find the 
program stimulating and will enjoy getting to know our participants.  The 
pleasure will certainly be mutual.  You will bring a new and different 
perspective from which we can all benefit.

Vince: 

For two decades now, I have been a member of the faculty helping to 
organize the Eastern Conferences on Regulation and Competition that Michael 
Crew of Rutgers has chaired.  This year will be, in fact, the 20th 
anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining 
us to celebrate what we have learned and what we haven't about the 
economics of network industries.  Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a 
number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and 
the prospects for the future.  The conference will take place at a 
beautiful site in the Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from 
Wednesday afternoon May 24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check 
for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site/hotel at the 
following website URL: 

http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~crri/WS.htm 

Michael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an 
after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key 
research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone 
and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power 
markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would 
be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but 
knowing your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would 
not be a problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes, 
followed by a short Q&A period. 

Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of 
Enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price 
discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy 
markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives 
on the "new science of risk management" and what can be expected from it 
could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event. 

Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether 
your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event. 
Michael and I would, of course, be very happy to follow up with you in 
discussing the nature of the presentation, participants and so forth, if 
this is a go.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks for your message regarding the Model Risk project. I think it's a very
important issue and really critical to Enron. The model risk represents a
very significant exposure to the company: a wrong model results in bad
decisions and eventually leads to accounting errors and incorrect financial
statements.

Here are my comments.

1. Reasons of model risk. The main source of model risk in Enron is omitted
in your list. I think it's due to the fact that the responsibility for the
final model approval and validation is dispersed in the organization and
there no single unit/person that is vested with the authority to audit,
approve  and monitor valuation models. The popular perception is that this is
done by the Research Group, but this could not be further form the truth.
Given the way the organization evolved over the last few years, we became a
group of internal consultants, working on highly specialized, partial
problems (sometimes, we work on a project from A to Z, but it's an exception
to the rule).

It's imperative that this is communicated to the senior management in a
precise, non-ambiguous way. I think that this is the main source of potential
problems and the first shortcoming of the modeling process to be corrected.

2. I would expand point 3 in your draft (inappropriate application of models)
and add two lower level points: a) wrong inputs b) incorrect model used for a
given transaction. TVA is an example of point a: a transaction in case of
which the inputs have not been being updated for an extended period of time
in the past.

3. Under Control Strength you can mention that several audits of the Research
Group model by Arthur Andersen and Darrell Duffie have been initiated at our
insistence.

4. Audit scope. I don't think you can address the issue of the model risk if 
you exclude
from your review Risk Analytics and IT. The model development
activity cannot be divided into separate, independent processes. 
I am afraid your recommendations will be highly inaccurate if your audit 
scope will
remain as is.

Hi.

I hope you got my message. Rob (if you don't know) has been "swiped" by Risk
to edit one of the new newsletters - Risk Management Operations - and so no
longer works with Books. We were very sad to see him go, but it is a great
opportunity for him and nice to see some intelligent internal promotion for
a change! Was there anything in particular you needed, Vince? Just to say
also that the energy titles (especially MEPR2) have received some excellent
reviews at contingencyanalysis.com which may interest you. Rob may have
mentionned the Utility Risk title we'd like to publish next year; any views
on that from you would be welcome, obviously. Let me know if and when you're
around and we can catch a coffee.

In the meantime, I hope you and your family have some good quality holiday
time. Best regards, as always. Sh?n

Dear Vasant,

I am currently working with Bryan Seyfried and the Credit Markets/Trading 
group
in London, and am in the process of designing and building a website as an
information portal.

I am in possession of a paper that you co-authored entitled "Actively Managing
Credit Risk", which was published in Risk Publications.

Bryan has asked Bijoya (who is interning here during her X-mas holiday from 
the
LSE) to update this paper and generate a new White Paper about the current 
state
of the credit market and the developments we are pursuing and creating. This
will be used on our website and be published later in time.

Could you please - if you have the time - contact and maybe work with Bijoya 
to
draft this White Paper? Bryan is in Houston today and may be able to give a
better idea of what he is exactly looking for ... Otherwise, he will be in
London again next week.

I thank you in advance, and hope that we can pull something together in the 
next
few weeks.

Please contact me at any time!

Regards from London

Katja

We are pleased to announce the formation of the Credit Markets Group which is
responsible for developing innovative products to better manage the risk of 
our
internal credit portfolio as well as, looking  for opportunities to provide
third party credit protection.  Initially, we will be making markets in
bankruptcy protection on reference credits which are currently in our 
portfolio
but we expect to add additional credit products and reference credits very
quickly.

The team will utilise EnronOnline as its primary trade execution tool, looking
to quickly build market share by capturing the eyes of our current 
counterparts.
Simultaneously,  we will launch an external web site focused on credit
protection where potential customers will have access to real time prices and
filter on specific reference credits as well as, access to credit models and
research papers on effective credit risk management.  Utilising e-commerce
business principles, we expect to aggressively claim the space for corporate
credit protection.  We expect to make a public announcement about these new
products in late January.

In order to effectively access the global market for credit protection, the
group will be based in London with an initial local desk set up in Houston as
well.  Bryan Seyfried will be transitioning out of RAC, where he was 
responsible
for the Trading Controls and Research teams in Europe, to lead the group and 
he
will report to me.

        a)      the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination
        groups which focus on energy, finance and power development solutions
        for electric and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops, energy service
        companies and IPP?s;
        b)      the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on
        delivering a broad range of products and services to the heavy
        industrial customers including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics,
        refined products, metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial
        gases, fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing 
the
        Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream Coverage/ Origination groups which
        focus on energy, finance and industries.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear that 
the
heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both ENA and
Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand its
industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial solutions by
having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron Corp.  Against 
this
backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function will expand its product
offering to include not only ENA?s existing energy commodities, energy 
services,
finance, assets and pulp and paper capabilities but also EES?s energy
outsourcing capability and Global Fuel?s chemicals, plastics and refined
products risk management capability.  These additional capabilities will be
offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels groups. Given the size 
and
importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper will be returning from 
Portland
to manage this business. Under Greg?s leadership, the Downstream Origination
effort will be segmented into three sub-groups given the nature of these
industries and our product offering:
        a)      Pulp and Paper ? Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the
        coverage activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be
        responsible for the provision of innovative
        products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the
        provision of paper risk management products;
        b)      Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products ? We have asked Jim
        Ajello to lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group
        will be responsible for the provision of innovative products and
        services in the chemicals and refined products industries;
        c)      Non-Integrated Industrials ? Bruce Garner, formerly leader of
        Bankers Trust?s global metals and mining group in London, has joined 
ENA
        to lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be
        responsible for the provision of innovative products and services for
        the metals and mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases,
        fertilizers, transportation, textiles and glass manufacturing
        industries.

Midstream Coverage/Origination

        a)      Eastern Coverage/Origination ? This group? activities will 
focus
        on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and 
gas
        utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the
        Eastern Interconnect. We have asked  Janet Dietrich to assume the
        leadership of this group;
        b)      Western Coverage/Origination ? This group?s activities will
        focus on energy, finance and power development solutions for electric
        and gas utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in
        the WSCC. They will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities
        (QF) restructuring opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked
        Chris Calger to assume the leadership of this coverage group. Chris 
will
        relocate to Portland from Calgary where he currently leads the 
Canadian
        downstream origination efforts;
        c)      IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination ? This group?s activities 
will
        focus on the provision of structured energy, finance and asset 
solutions
        for the emerging merchant power generators who control large 
portfolio?s
        of merchant power generation either through development or 
acquisition.
        We have asked  Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In
        addition, Mike will continue to manage the power development 
activities
        in the Eastern Interconnect;
        d)      Eastern QF Restructuring ? This group will focus on the QF
        restructuring opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the
        existing restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power
        assets.  We have asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this
        business. Greg Blair, formerly of Enron Asia?s development group, Doug
        Clifford, formerly of Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of
        Cogen Technology, will join this newly formed business.

2) Commercial Transactions:

The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff
Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of
transactions within ENA ? and thereby, improve ENA?s efficiency in executing
transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity of
client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction
Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity 
Structuring
and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical Analysis and
Upstream Asset Management.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction with
the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of which 
will
be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This dedication to
specific groups should provide a closer link, better service and greater
accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG resources are
designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to the highest value
transactions across the coverage functions:

        a)      Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the
        Eastern and Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members 
of
        this group include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and 
Russ
        Porter. Billy Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the
        Vice-President of Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. 
Russ
        Porter joins us today from Dynegy where he was a manager with
        responsibilities for power origination.
        b)      Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA?s
        industrial origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and
        Refining, Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries
        as coverage is established.  The senior members of this team include
        Rodney Malcolm, Jay Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.
        We anticipate announcing two to four more additions to this team 
within
        the next few weeks.
        c)      Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the 
IPP
        Merchant Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring
        groups.  The senior members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy
        Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud and John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in
        1996. Most recently, he was the Vice-President of Origination for the
        Latin American group in Azurix.  We anticipate announcing two more
        additions to this team within the next few weeks.
        d)      Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the
        Producer Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of
        this team include Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope 
to
        announce the addition of at least one VP to this group prior to 
yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and
Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary
responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will
continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior
commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dual
responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the 
Capital
Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remain largely
unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction Development teams
and their respective origination groups will be located together.

We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverage 
and
industry knowledge in all ENA?s markets particularly in the industrial 
markets.
It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability between the
Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.

Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in North
America by working with us to implement these changes.

This year's delayed heating season has provided much-needed breathing room
for gas markets. With significantly warm weather in November and December,
fourth quarter demand has dropped considerably below expectations, and
storage inventories have remained higher than projected.  This has
temporarily eased the upward pressure on prices, but the fundamentals remain
aligned for tighter gas markets to come.  In a December 14, 1999 Conference
Call, CERA's North American Natural Gas Team discussed the status of the
current market:

? Warm weather so far this winter released pressure in the North American
gas market - this pressure has already begun to resurface.
? Winter storage and supply appear adequate, injections next summer could
still challenge supply availability.
? Northeast price volatility will continue, with or without added pipeline
capacity.
? Canadian supply - meeting demand.

Hi Vince ,
It has been brought to my attention that several

lunch from time to time.
The person right now is Trisha Tlapek she
has to be at her desk .
Please , could  I provide  daily lunches for her.

Dear Vince,

Do you think you would be able to confirm a talk title and bullet points for 
your 'new research' talk by the end of the first week of January?  In terms 
of the panel discussion we will confirm the actual content and structure 
closer to the date of the conference - in the meantime, if you have any ideas 
as to how we can make the panel as discussive as possible that would be great.

Best regards,
Oliver

    Dear Vince,

    Thank you for agreeing to take part in our annual US congress.
    There were 2 things that I would ideally like you to be involved in.  The 
first
    would be to present any new research you may have.  This would be part of 
stream
    3 (see attached) which looks at new research in derivatives modelling and
    analysis.  If you would like to present any new research that fits into 
the
    rough areas outlined that would be great.
    The second would be part of a panel discussion on weather derivatives 
(number 44
    attached).  I have also invited Jeff Porter (Koch) and Ravi Nathan 
(Aquila).
    Please let me know if you would like to present any new research and/or 
take
    part in the panel.

    i look forward to hearing from you soon.

    Best regards,
    Oliver

All:

Best wishes for a restful and pleasant holiday season!  The time off is well 
deserved.

I also wish to express my sincere appreciation for the hard work and 
dedication displayed by each of you over the past year.  I'm well aware of 
the long hours and individual contributions that are not always widely 
known.  However, comments and notes received, particularly during the last 
half of 1999, suggest that others not only notice your individual 
contributions but have also come to appreciate RAC's value to the overall 
organisation.  Your individual efforts during 1999 reflected well on us all.

I look forward to seeing each of you after the holiday season and wish you a 
happy and prosperous New Year. 

Warmest Regards,

Steve

Vince-

I spoke with Roy Kass of the Energy Information Agency this morning. Apart 
from clarifying the timeliness, or lack thereof, of the published 
state-specific wellhead production estimates, he indicates their scientists 
find severe weather in the fields (freezes, hurricanes) to be a far more 
significant issue in production, and in wellhead prices, than is severe 
weather in the Northeast, for instance. Also, he agrees with you as to there 
being strictly increasing marginal costs in production, there being a rich 
texture of wells in terms of their efficiency, technologies, maintenance and 
investment issues.

Clayton

Shannon,

Thanks. The same to you.

Sorry to have missed your class. I had a very bad case

Good afternoon Vince.   You and I corresponded over a year ago on the
subject of Enterprise Risk Management.   I would like to bounce a couple of
thoughts off of you about this subject from my perspective as the Audit
Manager, but also at an enterprise level as well.   I don't have a phone
number for you, just an email address.   If you could send me a phone number
I would like to give you a cal sometime next week.   If you would like to
give me a call, that would be fine also.

If you are not involved in the ERM process at this time and there is someone
else I could visit with, I would appreciate their name and phone number.

Thanks Vince.

Dear Vince,

Attached please find an edited and slightly complemented version of my
paper.  I am being told that it will be included in the March issue of
Energy and Power Risk Management, which is going to be devoted to the
subject of power trading.  Your comments will be much appreciated.

Hi Vince,

I had intended to call as soon as I set up another meeting in Houston but
that had to be put off due to scheduling problems and a heavier than usual
workload here.

I would like to get together sometime after the first of the year to discuss
some research initiatives.  I may also be interested in the position at
Enron that you mentioned the last time we spoke.  I am currently considering
a few new positions and would like to expand my search.  If you have an
interest in discussing the position then just let me know.  I'll be leaving
town on Wednesday, December 22, and returning December 29 but I am always
virtually here at any of my addresses, e.g., mailto:macminn@cheerful.com
<mailto:macminn@cheerful.com> .

Merry Christmas,
Richard

This year's delayed heating season has provided much-needed breathing room
for gas markets. With significantly warm weather in November and December,
fourth quarter demand has dropped considerably below expectations, and
storage inventories have remained higher than projected.  This has
temporarily eased the upward pressure on prices, but the fundamentals remain
aligned for tighter gas markets to come.  In a December 14, 1999 Conference
Call, CERA's North American Natural Gas Team discussed the status of the
current market:

? Warm weather so far this winter released pressure in the North American
gas market - this pressure has already begun to resurface.
? Winter storage and supply appear adequate, injections next summer could
still challenge supply availability.
? Northeast price volatility will continue, with or without added pipeline
capacity.
? Canadian supply - meeting demand.

Vince-

I have a simplified version of Brad's model in mind.

The "no arbitrage" condition equates trading margins across the country. 
Costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network. Wellhead supply is 
almost completely price- elastic, while burner-tip demand is almost 
completely price inelastic. Storage is rationalized as a perpetual call 
option.

The least time-variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing 
gas from storage to the pipeline, followed by the costs of delivering gas 
from the wellhead to the pipeline. The intermediate-variant parameters are 
the capacity-dependent costs paid to the pipeline (above shrinkage) for 
transmission. The most time-variant parameters are the trading margins and 
the valuations of the storage option.

There are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork. 
They are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways: using a short 
time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability 
mentioned above, or point-estimates ("calibrations") using only today's data 
based on a node-based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with 
the same region of origination, albeit markedly different terminus, price 
versus capacity similarly, "competing" for outflows.

I will write this up for you in Scientific Word and present it to you at your 
earliest convenience.

Dear Vince,

Thank you for a stimulating presentation about real options at the IIR
conference in New York on Monday the 13th of December. Your explanation of 
real
options and it's applications for a number of valuation problems interested me
very much. With reference to our previous conversation I wonder if it is
possible  for you to forward the slides from the presentation.

Thank you very much for your help

He is a research assistant of Prof. Darrell Duffie from Stanford
and I met him in this capacity. A very bright fellow.

I could not assess his commercial skills but he has enough common
sense to identify the winner (as his interest in Enron demonstrates).

Dear Vince Kaminski

Thank you so much for the kind invitation for the meeting.

I have been always inspired by and having respect for the
recent revolutionary achievements of Enron in the energy markets
My former employer McKinsey Tokyo in fact featured
your company*s success in the last Quarterly, and it clearly states
(in Japanese though) that the quantitative research capability at Enron
is now at the world*s top level, which has been always behind the scene.

I am extremely honored to receive the email from you and in fact
interested in knowing the opportunity of working in the energy field;
However, very unfortunately I will have to come back to Japan, or at
least to the East Asian region,  upon graduation due to an inevitable
family reason. My wife*s father passed away recently and an old
mother-in-law is now left alone without relatives. I understand that
Enron has not yet embarked on the next big project of freeing
the outdated Japanese energy market, (which by the way I strongly
hope ) so I may not have a very good chance of making contribution
at your company right now.

Lastly, if you need a staff in Tokyo in some future who understands
 both the risk management analytics at the F622 level and the local
language and business custome better than average, please contact
me any time.  I will be happy to assist as much as possible.

Yours sincerely,

Kinder Morgan Buys Interest in Trailblazer

    Kinder Morgan Energy Partners has bought Columbia Energy Group's
one-third interest in Trailblazer Pipeline for $38 million. Trailblazer owns
a 436-mile, 492 MMcf per day natural gas pipeline from Rockport, Colorado, to
Beatrice, Nebraska. The purchase allows Kinder Morgan to take advantage of
increased natural gas exploration in the Rocky Mountains. Last week, it
agreed to acquire another third of Trailblazer as part of a $700 million
purchase of natural gas pipelines from its parent, Kinder Morgan Inc. Enron
owns the other third.

Sent by: Enron Europe General Announcement
We are pleased to announce the formation of the Credit Markets Group which is 
responsible for developing innovative products to better manage the risk of 
our internal credit portfolio as well as, looking  for opportunities to 
provide third party credit protection.  Initially, we will be making markets 
in bankruptcy protection on reference credits which are currently in our 
portfolio but we expect to add additional credit products and reference 
credits very quickly.

The team will utilise EnronOnline as its primary trade execution tool, 
looking to quickly build market share by capturing the eyes of our current 
counterparts.  Simultaneously,  we will launch an external web site focused 
on credit protection where potential customers will have access to real time 
prices and filter on specific reference credits as well as, access to credit 
models and research papers on effective credit risk management.  Utilising 
e-commerce business principles, we expect to aggressively claim the space for 
corporate credit protection.  We expect to make a public announcement about 
these new products in late January.

In order to effectively access the global market for credit protection, the 
group will be based in London with an initial local desk set up in Houston as 
well.  Bryan Seyfried will be transitioning out of RAC, where he was 
responsible for the Trading Controls and Research teams in Europe, to lead 
the group and he will report to me.

Summary:
When the energy industry completes the chapter on 1999, two footnotes will 
certainly have been made to record the two dominant weather events of the 
year in the West: the abundant precipitation and the mild summer. Significant 
year-over-year weather changes have always affected western energy markets, 
with swings in hydroelectric generation and summer weather determining the 
outputs of gas-fired, coal-fired, and even nuclear generation. The shift from 
a dry year to a wet year can change annual gas use for power generation by as 
much as 1 billion cubic feet per day or 36 percent of total generation 
demand. Consequently, a return to normal summer weather in 2000 would 
significantly boost gas flows for power generation, while also adding to coal 
generation and increasing both power prices and volatility. Gas markets in 
the West and across the continent in November have experienced unseasonably 
low demand and--as in recent days--sudden drops in prices. CERA sees the 
current weathe!
!
r effects as temporary and expects prices to rebound with the arrival of more 
seasonally normal weather.

Summary:
The momentum behind Russia's Blue Stream gas export pipeline to Turkey has 
suddenly dissipated; because of delays on the key "protocol" on tax 
concessions for contractors, project financing has hit a snag. Both sides 
insist the delay is only "technical," but recent events suggest more serious 
problems. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's decision not to sign the tax 
protocol in Moscow last week could be a reflection of Turkish concern not to 
embarrass the United States at the upcoming OSCE summit, or to endanger the 
Baku-Ceyhan pipeline, which the Turks strongly favor. After the summit the 
Turks could return to their own game plan--to nail down their future gas 
supplies, whatever their source. But that may be too simple a reading. The 
Turkish ruling coalition recently has shown signs of strain, and Blue Stream 
has come under attack from several directions inside Turkey. Although once 
the summit ends, the Turks and Russians could continue negotiations on Blue 
Stream--but in the char!
!
ged political atmosphere in both Ankara and Moscow, nothing is certain.

Summary:
Russia's 1999-2000 election cycle is being closely watched to see who wins 
and, more importantly, if the elections are held freely and fairly. Despite 
allegations that Yeltsin's "Family" clique will find a way to subvert 
elections, Russia looks more likely to stay on track, at least in next 
month's parliamentary elections. Broader public discussion of the danger of 
electoral corruption and fraud has taken place, a more balanced Central 
Election Commission has been established, and the interaction of regional 
players in the electoral process has occurred--all positive developments on 
the eve of elections. Yet, despite the implementation of positive changes, 
electoral abuses are likely to occur. Only time will tell how significant 
such abuses will be and what they will mean for the future composition of the 
Russian government.

Summary:
Russia's nascent party system brings with it a complicated web of old and new 
players and coalitions of players all hoping to cross the 5 percent threshold 
in the December 19 parliamentary elections. The formation of a multitude of 
parties and quasi-parties poses a challenge to constituents struggling to 
develop an understanding of who makes up these parties, where they sit on the 
political spectrum, and how they will best represent their interests if 
elected to office. Yet some parties in the upcoming elections do enjoy the 
benefit of some level of experience, with almost a third of this year's 
candidates having run in the last election. Furthermore, the consolidation of 
political factions since 1995 has helped establish more lucid political 
categories with which to classify parties. Although immature, Russia's party 
system has made headway since the 1993 and 1995 elections and will certainly 
prove to be an interesting race to watch.

Summary:
Lukoil's acquisition of a controlling stake in Bulgaria's largest oil 
refinery, Neftokhim, marked a new step in Lukoil's expansion into the East 
European downstream. But Lukoil is not the only contender. Yukos has proved 
to be a serious competitor, expanding into the markets that have 
traditionally belonged to Lukoil. Despite availability of alternative sources 
of supply, East European refineries continue to rely heavily on Russian 
crude, putting Russian producers in a strong negotiating position vis-.-vis 
the refineries and Western competitors.

Summary:
Two months into the 1999/2000 heating season in Europe it is already clear 
that a new basis for pricing and trading gas in the Continental business--the 
march to market--has begun. Principal-to-principal gas trade at Zeebrugge is 
taking place, with an increasing number of participants. A new "standard 
contract" and a so-called Hub Services Agreement were launched last week, 
under the auspices of Belgium's Distrigaz. Together these agreements provide 
mechanisms for day-ahead and within-the-day trading.

Summary:
Technology and geopolitics feature prominently in CERA's November 1999 Global 
Energy Watch. E-commerce is growing exponentially, with the energy industry 
contributing to this new revolution in information technology. A major 
geopolitical shift is under way, with OPEC and participating non-OPEC 
countries committed to limiting production by an additional 2.1 million 
barrels per day to reduce excess oil inventories. The result--a near doubling 
of oil prices in less than a year--assures that companies and oil-producing 
governments will end 1999 with stronger balance sheets and budgets more in 
line with societal and corporate needs. The Asia Pacific region's 
recoveries--while not assured--look stronger than six months ago. China,

Summary:
Substantial sections of Africa are now open for business within the global 
power community, and early entrants have found rewarding opportunities up and 
down the power value chain. But incomplete reform processes and 
often-difficult operating conditions mean that investment in Africa comes 
with substantial risks. CERA argues that successful investors will draw not 
just on favorable skill sets and fuel supply positions, but also on localized 
understanding of emerging regional markets, augmented crucially by 
on-the-ground experience.

Summary:
The successful privatization of the northwest region of the Comg?s concession 
area indicates that private investors are responding to the government's 
desire to create a competitive energy market. Agip, a part of ENI of Italy, 
made a winning bid of US$143 million, or US$86 million above the base price. 
Agip already tried to purchase Comg?s but lost to the consortium of British 
Gas and Shell by US$231 million. Agip's purchase of the concession is central 
to the creation of a competitive gas distribution network in S?o Paulo. This 
greenfield concession is outside the congested metropolitan area, meaning 
that it will have a lower cost per mile of construction to develop its 
infrastructure-potentially resulting in lower tariffs than BG/Shell's 
existing Comg?s concession.

Summary:
Monthly power prices in October continued down September's lower price path. 
Although demand levels were similar to September's, hydro output continued to 
increase its share of output, but counteracting this increase was higher 
unavailability of thermal generators. This low price path appears to be the 
forecast for the months to come, with fluctuations around $15 per MWh being 
the result of changes in demand, thermal unavailability, and hydro output. 
Dramatic price spikes have not occurred and are not expected in the near term 
without some unexpected loss of low-cost capacity. The price spikes that do 
occur will likely be infrequent and around $30 per MWh. Looking ahead, the 
concern of the market continues to be that if new low-cost capacity is added 
to the already oversupplied market, power prices have only one way to 
go--flatter and down.

Summary:
Brazilian oil product demand continues to be affected by the economic slump 
in addition to higher product prices. Nevertheless, CERA expects that fourth 
quarter demand will improve, with a significant recovery in the first quarter

regions, which account for approximately 70 percent of total product demand 
in Brazil.

Summary:
The natural gas industry faces the challenge of developing adequate supply 
resources and infrastructure for what could become a 30 trillion cubic foot 
(Tcf) market in the United States over the next decade. CERA assesses the 
long-term impact of this challenge on the North American gas market through a 
series of three distinct and internally consistent scenarios.

Although all three scenarios are highly plausible, market indicators as of 
the winter of 1999 point to a longer-term path more consistent with the 
Gas-Favored scenario, with a near- to midterm risk that the market could be 
driven up to a balance more similar to the Supply Realignment scenario. Key 
uncertainties to watch over the next year as signposts to the future path of 
price include the extent of the supply response, the stability of the US 
economy, and penetration of gas into the power generation market.

Summary:
A late start to the heating season temporarily releases pressure in the gas 
market, but it does not change market fundamentals. The warm weather during 
the first half of November has delayed storage withdrawals. However, it has 
not endured long enough to allow storage inventories to offset the supply 
decline of 1.0-1.5 Bcf per day, despite added imports. In the event that warm 
weather persists for a few more weeks, natural gas storage inventory levels 
will be adequate for the winter season. However, it is more likely that the 
return of seasonal weather will bring with it a sharp rebound in prices and a 
market scenario of tight supply.

Summary:
Amid the enthusiasm for growing gas use in power generation, there is a 
downside risk to the future of industrial gas use that has gone largely 
unnoticed. Indeed, the industrial sector's use of natural gas, the largest 
source of demand for natural gas in North America, is in danger of not 
growing at all or even declining over the next several years. A variety of 
threats is set to act on North American industrial gas demand, not the least 
of which is the potential for continued high gas prices throughout North 
America over the next several years.

These threats have not received wide attention because they have been 
obscured by the Asian financial crisis, which forced North American 
industrial demand growth to a standstill beginning in 1998. While the worst 
of the global commodities surplus may have passed, there is as yet no rebound 
occurring in industrial gas consumption in North America. Instead, gas 
consumption in several key gas-intensive industries is now being suppressed 
by a different set of threats: global industrial competition, high domestic 
gas prices, ample supplies of low-cost gas outside of North America, 
continuous energy efficiency improvements, and structural change.

Summary:
The rush to develop new sources of gas supply in North America is on-and the 
Rocky Mountains could be at the forefront of new supply development. Overall 
US natural gas productive capacity has declined recently through low prices 
and depressed drilling activity. However, demand pressure in North America is 
intensifying-driven by a wave of new gas-fired power plants currently under 
construction. The resulting higher gas prices further spotlight the need for 
additional supply capability from a number of regions-especially the Gulf of 
Mexico, western Canada, offshore eastern Canada, and the Rockies, the focus 
of renewed interest as an area of huge resource potential capable of meeting 
a substantial portion of the demand growth. The Rockies (even without the San 
Juan Basin) could be capable of sustaining a production level of up to 10 Bcf 
per day by 2015, with sustained high gas prices and integration of the 
pipeline infrastructure. This CERA report evaluates the resource base, ex!

challenges facing Rockies' producers.

Summary:
Knocking more NOx out of power generation is nothing new, but the move from 
regulation to the marketplace means that the competitive impacts of 
additional nitrogen oxide emissions reductions are as complex and significant 
now as the environmental impacts. The potential tilt to the competitive 
playing field has moved both old and new NOx regulations into the courts. 
Industry restructuring also means that the market will determine who pays the 
billions of dollars in NOx emission control costs. Pending court decisions 
will determine how much NOx emissions are allowed in power production and 
will also define one of the key attributes of the future competitive power 
business landscape.

Fuel cells have achieved some successes, but more in niche applications 
rather than as a mass technology at this stage. Several divergent issues such 
as power restructuring, technological developments, environmental issues,

suffers under economic constraints, however, and developments in the fuel 
processing component of the fuel cell system will be critical to rapid

Summary:
As 1999 closes, OPEC and non-OPEC Mexico face the tricky task of determining 
the next step after their success in reversing the price collapse of 1998. A 
decision must be made on when and how to allow unused capacity back in the 
market. The stakes are high: if they fail to bring on capacity in time, then 
prices could soar upward even further and undermine much of the demand growth 
that is helping the price recovery. CERA's new Autumn World Oil Watch 
provides an updated price outlook for late 1999 and 2000 based on our 
assessment of OPEC's possible choices. Adding upward price pressure this 
quarter, we have revised our estimate of OPEC adherence to the March 
production agreements to roughly 80 percent for the fourth quarter.

Dear Vince Kaminski

Thank you so much for the kind invitation for the meeting.

I have been always inspired by and having respect for the
recent revolutionary achievements of Enron in the energy markets
My former employer McKinsey Tokyo in fact featured
your company*s success in the last Quarterly, and it clearly states
(in Japanese though) that the quantitative research capability at Enron
is now at the world*s top level, which has been always behind the scene.

I am extremely honored to receive the email from you and in fact
interested in knowing the opportunity of working in the energy field;
However, very unfortunately I will have to come back to Japan, or at
least to the East Asian region,  upon graduation due to an inevitable
family reason. My wife*s father passed away recently and an old
mother-in-law is now left alone without relatives. I understand that
Enron has not yet embarked on the next big project of freeing
the outdated Japanese energy market, (which by the way I strongly
hope ) so I may not have a very good chance of making contribution
at your company right now.

Lastly, if you need a staff in Tokyo in some future who understands
 both the risk management analytics at the F622 level and the local
language and business custome better than average, please contact
me any time.  I will be happy to assist as much as possible.

Yours sincerely,

Vicek,

po tym jak nasi koledzy z FX Desk i Interest Rate Desk troche nas osmieszyli 
cytujac wysokie ceny na FX i twierdzac, ze nie ma rynku na CPI hedge, 
probujemy uratowac twarz przed PSE, ktora otrzymala dwa wiazace cytaty cenowe 
od JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.

Jakakolwiek pomoc z Twojej strony bedzie tym bardziej cenna. Na dzien 
dzisiejszy wyglada, ze moze uda nam sie to zrobic z PSE ale dopiero w 
styczniu. Wartosc transakcji dla nas zmniejszy sie do prawie zera (musimy 
nadrobic w oczach PSE) i dlatego walczymy o kazdego $$$$ w NPV.

Dzieki - Jarek.

Vince, 

We are still trying to work the PSE swap transaction, now that the forex desk 
has been able to find a fix for CPI in the market. 

Further to my voicemail, our colleagues in credit are calculating the reserve 
on the PSE swap.  They are currently using 9.5% fixed based on the 1 year 
implied volatility.  Volatility of USD/DM has been in the range of between 7% 
and 11%.  Can one of your research staff justify a suitable 20 year 
volalatility number for USD/Euro.  Ideally, we would like a fast turnaround.  

In addition, is there someone who could consider the correlation between US 
CPI and the $/euro exchange rate.  The credit guys are currently assuming 
that there is no correlation and may consequently be double dipping the 
credit reserve on this basis too.  

Grateful for any help or suggestions you could provide. 

Sid 

Vincent,

I met you at the Risk conference last week in Houston. I enjoyed your
presentations very much.
I was wondering if you could give me some references regarding the
calculation of correlation coefficients from a GARCH model.

Thank you.

two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.
c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=
=20
Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni=
or=20
members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=
nd=20
John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the=

weeks.
d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20
Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu=
de=20
Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition=
=20
of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=

Vince-

1. We can detect "hoarding" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against 
the actual inflow.

2. We can detect "market power" by dissociating the seller from the buyer, 
distinguishing between the physical "cost" in gas to run the generators and 
the transmission cost in dollars, i.e. the basis.

3. (As you noted) We can detect "storage" as the difference between inflow 
and consumption.

It appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model 
of gas prices: flow rates at interconnects (from telemetry) and spot-market 
prices. There is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing 
capacity, as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts. The dynamics of gas 
prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for 
the weather, as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors: 
hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas.  We can "calibrate" the 
price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage, and the price 
elasticities of demand for transmission, as well as the extent of hoarding, 
from the two sets of numbers mentioned: flows and prices.  What the basis 
trader needs to understand are the incentives, and disincentives, for storage 
and capacity-hoarding, in terms of the calibrated price-elasticities, and 
each of these are as-if exotic call options at the consumption hub.  Finally, 
flows are "explained" by the model, and can be imputed from prices if 
necessary, resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of 
the weather.

I believe the problem is quite tractable, and I would like to proceed with a 
model.

Vince and Vasant:

Here is a brief summary of my meeting with Chris Germany, Capacity Trader at 
the East Desk, related to gas transmission:

Typically, pipelines lease capacity billed on a monthly basis. An example 
might be the pipeline between South Texas and Brooklyn, where you might pay 
$12.00 per month per 10,000 decatherms of capacity ($0.40 per day), a fixed 
payment. Variable charges are 6% for fuel costs ("shrinkage") and 6.5% for 
overhead expenses.  A gas trader might call South Texas and be quoted a 
delivery price tomorrow of NYMEX - $0.10 ("basis"), and might call Brooklyn 
and be quoted a delivered price of NYMEX + $0.25 .  The trader's spread is 
$0.35, and variable costs of transmission are $0.125, so the trader would 
offer the leaseholder of capacity up to $0.225 for firm capacity tomorrow.  
As for the distinction betweem firm and interruptible, the leaseholders have 
an excellent knowledge of the firm-equivalent of interruptible capacity. 
Also, many pipelines don't discount firm capacity from the tariff maximum 
("it's not worth their time to haggle") (There is a further issue of 
"secondary markets" not important to the model yet).  For South Texas and 
Brooklyn, there are several different routes the gas can physically take 
(pipelines of Enron, Texas Eastern, etc).  And, once the trade is in the 
system traders can cover the (Enron) positions on each end of the pipeline, 
in so doing freeing up the capacity for other contracts.

Vicek,

po tym jak nasi koledzy z FX Desk i Interest Rate Desk troche nas osmieszyli 
cytujac wysokie ceny na FX i twierdzac, ze nie ma rynku na CPI hedge, 
probujemy uratowac twarz przed PSE, ktora otrzymala dwa wiazace cytaty cenowe 
od JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley.

Jakakolwiek pomoc z Twojej strony bedzie tym bardziej cenna. Na dzien 
dzisiejszy wyglada, ze moze uda nam sie to zrobic z PSE ale dopiero w 
styczniu. Wartosc transakcji dla nas zmniejszy sie do prawie zera (musimy 
nadrobic w oczach PSE) i dlatego walczymy o kazdego $$$$ w NPV.

Dzieki - Jarek.

Vince, 

We are still trying to work the PSE swap transaction, now that the forex desk 
has been able to find a fix for CPI in the market. 

Further to my voicemail, our colleagues in credit are calculating the reserve 
on the PSE swap.  They are currently using 9.5% fixed based on the 1 year 
implied volatility.  Volatility of USD/DM has been in the range of between 7% 
and 11%.  Can one of your research staff justify a suitable 20 year 
volalatility number for USD/Euro.  Ideally, we would like a fast turnaround.  

In addition, is there someone who could consider the correlation between US 
CPI and the $/euro exchange rate.  The credit guys are currently assuming 
that there is no correlation and may consequently be double dipping the 
credit reserve on this basis too.  

Grateful for any help or suggestions you could provide.

Pavel,

A commentary on IMF policy with respect to Russia and other countries.
Stiglitz is a very bright person and I agree completely with
his points. Privately, he is even more outspoken.

Vince

VKaminski@aol.com on 12/12/99 11:41:09 AM
 W ASHINGTON -- Joseph E. Stiglitz said Wednesday that he would
     resign as the World Bank's chief economist after using the position
     for nearly three years to raise pointed questions about the
     effectiveness of conventional approaches to helping poor countries.

     Stiglitz, who joined the World Bank in February 1997 after serving
     as chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers,
     said he would leave the bank at the end of the year and would soon
     return to his academic post at Stanford University.

     His departure will remove from Washington perhaps the most
     outspoken voice in the debate over how rich countries can best aid
     economic development in poor and crisis-afflicted nations. Over the
     last two years in particular, Stiglitz had antagonized officials at
     the International Monetary Fund and within the Clinton
     administration by criticizing their response to the financial
     crisis in Asia and their strategy for encouraging the development
     of democratic capitalism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
     Union.

     Stiglitz said the decision to leave had been his. Treasury
     Secretary Lawrence Summers praised Stiglitz as a "major creative
     and intellectual force," and administration officials said the
     United States had not sought Stiglitz's removal. Caroline Anstey, a
     spokeswoman for the World Bank, said Stiglitz had "absolutely not"
     been forced out, and the bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn,
     praised Stiglitz for having helped to move the institution "away
     from the so-called Washington consensus."

     But Wolfensohn has suggested in the past that Stiglitz was too
     quick to second-guess the international aid agencies and the big
     industrial nations that control them. "I think that his recent
     things about Russia, in my judgment, are not wholly correct,"
     Wolfensohn said during the bank's annual meeting this autumn. "I
     think to stand back later and say, 'If you'd done it my way
     everything would have been different,' is a little generous to
     yourself."

     Stiglitz made no secret Wednesday of feeling constrained in his
     ability to speak out as freely as he wished. He said he was looking
     forward to the unfettered freedom of expression afforded by his
     return to the academic world.

     "Whenever you're in an organization there are some pressures,"
     Stiglitz said in an interview. "I felt that it was important for my
     intellectual integrity to be able to express myself as forcefully
     as I thought was appropriate."

     A liberal with a strong belief that governments and institutions
     have a significant role to play in economic development and that
     market forces cannot be counted on to deal with every problem,
     Stiglitz challenged the prevailing orthodoxy among policy makers in
     Washington.

     He said that the monetary fund went overboard in Asia in demanding
     that the countries ensnared in the financial crisis cut their
     budgets, arguing that fiscal austerity sometimes extracted too high
     a price from poor people without generating a corresponding
     improvement in international economic confidence.

     He took issue with the view held by the fund and the U.S.
     government that controls on the international flow of capital were
     counterproductive or impractical, saying that in some cases it was
     justified to restrict short-term flows of money in and out of a
     developing economy. He said industrialized countries sometimes
     pushed developing nations too fast to deregulate their financial
     systems.

     He suggested that the United States and the monetary fund had
     failed to acknowledge that their prescription for Russia -- quick
     privatization of state-owned industries, an end to state oversight
     of the economy, abolition of price controls and an opening up to
     the rest of the world -- had not produced the intended results and
     indeed had left many people worse off.

     "Stiglitz has been a very strong advocate for the poor and the
     excluded, and he's been one of the best things in the World Bank in
     the last decade," said Seth Amgott, a spokesman for Oxfam, which
     promotes poverty-fighting policies. "He's also been very pointed
     and insightful in discussing the role of the IMF. We're not used to
     that kind of candor."

     Stiglitz won few friends among economists and policy makers at the
     Treasury Department and the monetary fund. But his message was
     greeted enthusiastically in poor countries, and he said he was
     leaving the bank feeling that he had helped to stimulate a more
     vigorous debate about the policy prescriptions that wealthy nations
     impose on developing countries.

     "On some of the specific issues, there has emerged really a broad
     consensus behind the views I took," Stiglitz said.

     "There's a recognition that policies in East Asia were excessively
     contractionary on the fiscal side," he continued. "There's a
     recognition that capital market liberalization, in the absence of
     adequate regulatory structures, exposes countries to much higher
     risks. And on the debate about economies in transition, there's a
     general consensus that the issues I've been raising are the right
     issues, and that while no one has the answers, we're not going to
     get answers until we're willing to ask the questions."

     Stiglitz had told friends recently that he intended to leave, and
     he informed Wolfensohn Wednesday morning of his decision.
     Wolfensohn said Stiglitz would continue to act as an adviser to him
     and Stiglitz would lead the search for a new chief economist.

     Ms. Anstey, the bank's spokeswoman, said that asking Stiglitz to
     head the search committee was a signal of the institution's
     "intention to select someone who will continue the
     Wolfensohn-Stiglitz agenda" of focusing more on the needs of poor
     countries and less on more orthodox policies developed in
     Washington.

     Stiglitz said his approach was built around two basic themes:
     giving more of a voice to poor nations in setting policy and
     recognizing the crucial role that government must play in economic
     development.

     "We are rebalancing our thinking about the role of the state,"
     Stiglitz said. "Some of the failures, like in East Asia, involve
     cases where government did too little, like in financial
     regulation, rather than too much."

Vince,

I have written a paper, which supposedly is going to be published in the
February 2000 issue of EPRM, probably after some editorial cuts (at least
this is what I am being told by them).  I would appreciate your thoughts if
you would have time to read it.

Regards,
Martin

Hi Ludmilla:

Attached is Vince's itinerary to London the 20th - 23rd.

Shirley

1) Coverage/Origination:

To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product=
=20
technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20
businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=
=20
under the leadership of Dave Delainey :
a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,=
=20
co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;
b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a=
=20
broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20
including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=
d=20
mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,=
=20
textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20
Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=
t=20
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=
=20
ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=
=20
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=
=20
Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=
=20
will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=
gy=20
commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=
es=20
but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=
als,=20
plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional=
=20
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=
=20
groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=
=20
will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20
leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three=
=20
sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:
a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage=
=20
activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=
or=20
the provision of innovative=20
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=
n=20
of paper risk management products;
b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=
o=20
lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20
chemicals and refined products industries;
c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers=
=20
Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=
 the=20
coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t=

asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20
formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=
=20
Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=
=20
this newly formed business.

2) Commercial Transactions:=20

The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20
Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=
=20
transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=
ecuting=20
transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=
=20
of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20
Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20
Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=
=20
Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=
=20
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=
=20
with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=
=20
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This=
=20
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=
=20
and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=
=20
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:

a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=
=20
Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20
include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=
=20
Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=
=20
Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=
=20
from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20
origination.
b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=
ial=20
origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20
Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=
=20
established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=
=20
Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing=
=20
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.
c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=
=20
Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni=
or=20
members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=
nd=20
John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the=
=20
Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We=
=20
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=
=20
weeks.
d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20
Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu=
de=20
Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition=
=20
of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=
=20
Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=
=20
responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will=
=20
continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=
=20
commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua=
l=20
responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20
Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai=
n=20
largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20
Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located=
=20
together.

We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag=
e=20
and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri=
al=20
markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe=
en=20
the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20

Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor=
th=20
America by working with us to implement these changes.

Dear Vasant,

I am currently working with Bryan Seyfried and the Credit Markets/Trading 
group in London, and am in the process of designing and building a website as 
an information portal.

I am in possession of a paper that you co-authored entitled "Actively 
Managing Credit Risk", which was published in Risk Publications.

Bryan has asked Bijoya (who is interning here during her X-mas holiday from 
the LSE) to update this paper and generate a new White Paper about the 
current state of the credit market and the developments we are pursuing and 
creating. This will be used on our website and be published later in time. 

Could you please - if you have the time - contact and maybe work with Bijoya 
to draft this White Paper? Bryan is in Houston today and may be able to give 
a better idea of what he is exactly looking for ... Otherwise, he will be in 
London again next week. 

I thank you in advance, and hope that we can pull something together in the 
next few weeks.

Please contact me at any time!

Regards from London

Hi Vince

RE: EUROPEAN ENERGY 2000, 3 & 4 APRIL, AMSTERDAM

I hope all is well. I wondered whether or not you would be interested in 
chairing the stream of your talk?
I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Kind Regards

Our convention is whoever finalizes the model should write the 
documentation.  It does not make sense
to write one when changes are anticipated.  You have been working on this 
almost a year, it never 
strikes you that we need a documentation ? 

I created Exotica.xll, does that also give you an excuse not working on 
Exotica documentation ?   

Zimin

I am surprised that we do not have the documentation ready.
I can make that for you. It is not there because you did not put that 
together by the time it was created and all the changes I have made did not 
required changes on the functionality.

Tai Woo,

Here are the c-codes for the CrudeAPO.  'Sig' is the spot
volatility meaning the price volatility within the delivery period. 
You should consult  with Pavel for the definition of this "extra" 
parameters.   We 
would like to see the Position Monitor once you get it running.
We might have some additional suggestions.

Paulo,

Why don't we have a documentation on CrudeAPO you worked on ?
I can not find it in Exotica help file.   Please supply that to Tai, thanks.

This morning, Zimin told me that Pavel is using a special model in evaluating 
his Asian option portfolio. 
He asked me to talk to you in order to access to the code so that I can see 
the difference made to the model.

As I cannot find the doc. describing this model, please tell me what that new 
input parameter 'Sig' is.

Thanks,

Stinson,

Any comments?

Emma,

Mergers and acquisitions are not my cup of tea.

Chairing stream 1 on day 1 seems to be a better match.

Vince

Hi Vince

Thanks for getting back to me quickly! As it happens, all of the sessions
you suggested are already taken!

So, would you be interested in chairing EITHER stream 1 on day 1 of the
conference - "Pricing and Trading in the US Power Market"  OR stream 3 on
day 2 of the conference - "Latest Developments in the US Energy Industry".
For your information, the people presenting on day 1 in stream 1 include:

- Spyros Maragos, Dynegy on volatility
- Sanjeev Khanna, PG & E on correlation
- Gary Morsches, Southern on optimising information to accurately price and
trade electricity
- Blake Johnson, Stanford University on modelling power prices
- Craig Pirrong, Olin School of Business, Washington University on building
the optimal forward curve

On day 2, stream 3, there are only 3 talks in that stream, as after lunch we
will be breaking for plenary sessions and the Industry Briefing sessions
too. But the people who will be speaking in that stream are:

- Venu Nagali, Stanford University on real options
- Ram Challa, Sithe Energies (he was formerly at Bankers Trust) on
generation assets

I have the slot on Mergers and Acquisitions in stream 3 on day 2 as still
available but I'm not sure if that session is your area of speciality? Let
me know.

Thanks Vince and very much looking forward to working with you again.

Emma

FYI. Indian papers and politicians are complaining about the high prices for 
power that the state govt. in Maharastra is paying to Enron. The reason: 
Naphtha prices more than doubled in 1999 and the fuel cost is a pass through 
(I can't believe they let it floating!). They requested our help in pricing 
caps on naphtha.
Krishna.
Pinnamaneni Krishnarao
12/09/99 01:33 PM
Hi guys!
 I calculated the premiums for monthly caps for different cap (strike) levels 
using the 1999 prices as forward prices. The scenarios I included are:
1. At-the-money (ATM) caps: cap level = forward price (FP)
2. Out-of-the-money (OTM) caps: cap level = (1+x) * FP where x = 5%, 10%, 15% 
& 20%
3. Constant cap level across months: $168 (average of FPs), $200, and $250.

Brief results: Historical naptha volatility is 34% over last 2-years (which 
is higher than over the 10-year period - see the volatility chart). Premiums 
expressed as percent of the average naptha price for 2000:
 
             ATM =  10.4%
            ATM*=  13% (Assumiung FP = $224/MT)
    5%  OTM = 8.4%
   10% OTM = 6.8%
   15% OTM = 5.5%
   20% OTM =   4.4%
   $168 Cap  = 15%
   $200 Cap  = 9%
   $225 Cap  = 6%.

 If you are looking to protect from any price move up from the current level, 
you will be looking at 10-15% range. Please keep in mind these are only 
indicative, since we are just guessing the forward prices. Given such drastic 
changes in prices during the last year, we really need to get an indication 
of the forward prices. I made some inquiries here and found the name of the 
person trading naptha. It is John L Chismar in Singapore ( 
Ph.011-65-838-9016; email: jchisma@ect.enron.com). Please contact him today 
and try to get an indication of the forward prices and volatilities for 2000. 

 It would be much easier if we can install our Exotic Options Library in your 
office. We need to place it in a common drive that all of you can access. If 
any of the common drives you use is G, J, M, O, or P, I can send you the 
files to be installed. If your common drive has another initial, we need to 
do some programming here before sending to you. 

 Call me to discuss/clarify further. You can call me at home if necessary 
(home ph. 281-240-5705; I am awake till 11PM usually). 
best wishes,
Krishna.

Hi Mr.Krishnarao,

Was really nice talking to you! As per out telecon please find attached an

Appreciate the help from you!!

   As way of introduction, I wanted to write a bit about Mars inc. and then
about CDS,
the unit I head.  Mars is a private company, considered to be the largest
privately owned
manufacturing company in the world.  Mars is not in the habit of disclosing 
its
finances,
so the best I could do is refer to Forbes' estimate of $15 Billion annual
revenue and
to the profit margins of similar companies between 5-12%.  Mars is in the
business of
manufacturing confectionery (m&m, Dove bar, skittles, twix, - all (R))
food (Uncle Ben rice (R))  pet food (Pedigree, Whiskas Waltham (R)) and other
products.

Mars has prospered during the years because of a unique philosophy that
emphasizes the
long term goals of the company.  Part of the philosophy is to look for win-win
solutions with
its suppliers, customers and partners.

As can be understood from the nature of the company, a large chunk of its
expenses
goes towards purchasing commodity like products, and hence the history of
researching
those commodities and the weather that influences their supply and the demand
(people
eat less ice cream in the winter and less chocolate in the summer).

CDS has a history of few decades in forecasting  weather and has been very
successful,
with an envious track record, in helping Mars get a competitive advantage in
these arenas.
CDS is a global group (in 4 countries across two continents) which supports 
the
purchasing
function and the corporate at large in these and other arenas.  It is a
multidiscipline and
multinational team with a lot to offer.

Not having a ready access to the energy markets, and with a risk profile based
on
manufacturing expertise, Mars has decided to look for potential partners in 
this
area.
Enron presence in the market place certainly makes it an interesting party to
talk to.

In talking to Enron, we are careful to suggest that Mars is not committing to
anything
at this point, and all we are after is to find out if there is an interest to
pursue the opportunity
we discussed in the future.

I am looking forward to our video conference call.

Kind regards,

Avi

Companies Turn to Grades, and Employees Go to Court

By REED ABELSON

An increasingly popular technique for evaluating employees is
prompting lawsuits charging discrimination at three big companies.

 At issue is the ranking of managers, professionals and sometimes
lower-level employees from best to worst, or grading them on a bell
curve, and then using that ranking to help determine pay and
sometimes whether to fire someone.

 In their suits, all filed over the last year or so, employees at
Microsoft, Ford Motor and Conoco say the rating systems are unfair
because they favor some groups of employees over others: white
males over blacks and women, younger managers over older ones and
foreign citizens over Americans.

 A growing number of companies are turning to grading systems, also
known as forced rankings or distributions, as a way of making sure
managers evaluate employees honestly and make clearer distinctions
among them. At companies that do not compare employees with one
another this way, nearly every employee can come away feeling above
average, like the children of Lake Wobegon. But under the grading
system, managers are forced to identify some people as low
performers.

 At General Electric, for example, supervisors identify the top 20
percent and bottom 10 percent of their managerial and professional
employees every year. The bottom 10 percent are not likely to stay.

 As John F. Welch Jr., General Electric's chief executive, wrote
last month to shareholders, "A company that bets its future on its
people must remove that lower 10 percent, and keep removing it
every year =01* always raising the bar of performance and increasing
the quality of its leadership."

 Ranking or grading employees is also common at technology
companies like Cisco Systems and Hewlett- Packard. But recently the
concept has been catching on more broadly, according to management
consultants. One reason is that as the economy slows, companies
often lay off employees. Cisco, for example, announced earlier this
month that it would let go as many as 5,000 workers =01* and would use
grading as one way to identify people to lay off.

 "Companies are playing their version of `Survivor,' " said David
Thomas, a professor at the Harvard Business School.

 Another reason is that some companies are eager to copy Mr. Welch,
long viewed as one of the most successful managers in America.

 Defenders of these systems say anyone who gets a low grade is
likely to view the process as unfair. " `A' students love grades;
`F' students hate grades," said John Sullivan, a human resources
professor at San Francisco State University.

 But the techniques, which some employees label with terms like
"rank and yank," have come under sharp criticism. While they appear
to offer an objective way to judge employees, they can be
vulnerable to bias, Mr. Thomas said. Managers may stereotype
employees when evaluating them on vague criteria like career
potential =01* deciding that older workers, for example, may have a
harder time keeping up with new technology.

 In some cases managers can view these systems "as a tool to be
used to weed out the ones you don't want," said Thomas S. McLeod, a
lawyer in Canton, Mich., who represents employees suing Ford in
another case.

 Critics of the system also argue that companies should not apply a
bell curve, in which a small number of employees get the highest
and lowest rankings and a much larger number are grouped in the
middle. The bell curve model assumes a normal distribution among a
very large group of random individuals, not small groups.

 What is more, across a company, people who belong to a
particularly talented unit will suffer if a certain number of them
must be given poorer grades than they would get in another unit.

 "You end up with dysfunctional results," said Edward E. Lawler
III, a business professor at the University of Southern California.

 Some lawsuits contend that Microsoft's grading systems are
discriminatory. One, filed last October, seeks class-action status
on behalf of blacks and women. The suit states that the rating
system "permits managers, who are predominantly white males, to
rate employees based upon their own biases rather than based upon
merit."

 According to the lawsuit, employees are rated on a five-point
scale, with only a certain percentage permitted to receive each
score. Employees doing the same job in the same unit are also given
a "stack ranking," from most to least valuable. Managers decide
those rankings largely using what are called "lifeboat
discussions," where they choose which employees they would want
with them if stuck in a lifeboat. Managers had no other clear
criteria, according to Christine Webber, a lawyer at Cohen,
Milstein, Hausfeld & Toll who is representing the employees.

 Grading is highly subjective at Microsoft, according to Peter M.
Browne, a former executive who is also suing the company, charging
discrimination. Mr. Browne, who is black, said managers were forced
to use a curve in evaluating even small groups. He said he had to
rate a group of five on a curve, for example, in deciding which
ones would not receive stock options.

 "You weren't told anything =01* just meet the curve," Mr. Browne
said.

 He says managers ended up favoring people with whom they
socialized. "People gravitate to people who are like them, and the
system just forces that," he said.

 Microsoft defends its system as fair and helpful. "We want to give
the highest compensation to the very top performers," said Deborah
Willingham, senior vice president for human resources, adding that
the system included checks and balances to ensure fair treatment.
Employees can appeal their ratings, for example, and are largely
responsible for developing the criteria by which they are
evaluated.

 Ms. Willingham also said the company did not ask its managers to
give a fixed percentage of their employees any given score. "We
don't force that curve to look any certain way," she said.

 Microsoft has no formal "stack rank" policy, she said. And when
managers do have lifeboat discussions, they are a tool to consider
which employees they would want to keep if they were starting
again.

 While the company would not comment on the lawsuits, Microsoft
"expressly prohibits discrimination," Ms. Willingham said.

 Similar criticisms emerged in a lawsuit brought last month against
Ford. It argues that the company's new grading system discriminates
against older workers. The company, which adopted what it calls its
performance management process a year ago, gives its 18,000
managers A, B or C grades. Last year, the company awarded 10
percent an A, 80 percent a B and 10 percent a C.

 Ford also faces a second lawsuit asserting that it unfairly
discriminated against older white males in its grading.It would not
comment on the litigation but defended its use of grades. "We
believe the system is fair and nondiscriminatory," a company
spokeswoman said. "We are in a very competitive industry, and we
need all of our employees to be the best they can be."

 At Conoco, employees contend that the company discriminated
against United States citizens and older workers when it laid off a
dozen geophysicists and other scientists in 1999 based on a ranking
from one to four, according to a lawsuit filed last year. The
majority of those let go were Americans, according to the suit, as
opposed to British, Norwegian and Canadian professionals.

 "The rating system was selectively enforced, and there were
instances of manipulation," said John Zavitsanos, the lawyer
representing the workers. Even though some were given higher
ratings on earlier rankings, they were eventually given the lowest
possible rating of four.

 Conoco, based in Houston, has extensive operations in the North
Sea, and many of the senior managers at the division in question
are British, according to Mr. Zavitsanos.

 While Conoco said it could not comment on the litigation, it said
its evaluations were based on several factors, including
performance, skills and expertise. The company said ratings often
changed as more information was collected and people were evaluated
in larger groups. Conoco company also denied that decisions were
based on anything other than individual capabilities.

 Companies "do need something in making pay decisions, downsizing
decisions," said Jim Kochanski, a consultant with Nextera
Enterprises. The problem is that companies may not take enough care
in deciding how people should be ranked. "They can get it very
wrong," he said.

Hello all,

The program for the 2000 Texas Finance Festival has been formalized and can
be found on our web site at

http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/martinj/festival2.html

I do need to remind you of a few things before we converge on San Antonio.
First, be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations.
At last count there were only 6 rooms left.  Second, I need a completed
application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count.
I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate
boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a
form.

Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on Friday
so plan on arriving early Friday or coming in on Thursday evening if you
can.  Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and
interesting things to visit in the immediate area (the Alamo is across the
plaza from the hotel).

We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on
Friday and Saturday evenings.  The Friday evening dinner begins at 6 p.m.
so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the
Alamo at 8:00 p.m.  For Saturday we are still working out plans for the
evening so stay tuned.

There will be more information later as the conference nears.  Looking
forward to seeing you all and in beautiful, sunny San Antonio.

Charlene wants the entire batch of potential summer intern resumes sent to 
her in one step.
I want to complete this by Friday. Catch me after lunch to talk about it.

Vince

Ravi Thuraisingham@ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 02/17/2000 10:11:36 AM
Hi Vince, Paulo Oleira (one of the M.I.T attending our meeting on wed)'s 
research interest turned out to be a match for April Hodgeson (VP of content 
origination). I had him talk to April (Stinson was on the call as well) to 
discuss his research interest and what he would likely to do for April.  I 
suggested (and April agrees) that Paulo would intern with her and Matt and 
perform research on how end users (consumers and business) improved 
experience with ePowered content can be quantified.  This may include 
performing control experiments at M.I.T.  We decided not to over specify what 
he would do since it is likely to change as soon as he arrives.  I suggested 
once he starts, he will work with April and Matt Harris (VP enterprise 
origination) and they will define what the student needs to complete for the 
internship.  

Addiontionally, Tom Gros agrees that this type of research are needed and 
this is a great way to start.

I will proceed to have recruiting contact the student with an offer to start 
around May 22, 2000 unless someone tells me otherwise.

Regards,

Ravi.

P.S. Charlene, please include Paulo in your May 22, 2000 start group.  Paulo 
will report to me within EBS research group but will work on a day-to-day 
basis with April and Matt. As you've mentioned that compensation is somewhat 
fixed but please keep in mind that this person is a PhD candidate with very 
specialized skill set. Please contact Vince before extending an offer that 
may be too low, etc.

Celeste,

We need to make sure that the interns in Vince's group are coordinated and 
incorporated with the rest of the summer associates.  They should be offered 
the same starting dates, I believe they are May 22, 2000 June 5, 2000.  I am 
not sure about the June date.  Would you check and let Vince know.  They 
should also be offered the same starting salary package as the others.  They 
will be included in training (a few days) and any other events we host.
Thanks

Companies Turn to Grades, and Employees Go to Court

By REED ABELSON

An increasingly popular technique for evaluating employees is
prompting lawsuits charging discrimination at three big companies.

 At issue is the ranking of managers, professionals and sometimes
lower-level employees from best to worst, or grading them on a bell
curve, and then using that ranking to help determine pay and
sometimes whether to fire someone.

 In their suits, all filed over the last year or so, employees at
Microsoft, Ford Motor and Conoco say the rating systems are unfair
because they favor some groups of employees over others: white
males over blacks and women, younger managers over older ones and
foreign citizens over Americans.

 A growing number of companies are turning to grading systems, also
known as forced rankings or distributions, as a way of making sure
managers evaluate employees honestly and make clearer distinctions
among them. At companies that do not compare employees with one
another this way, nearly every employee can come away feeling above
average, like the children of Lake Wobegon. But under the grading
system, managers are forced to identify some people as low
performers.

 At General Electric, for example, supervisors identify the top 20
percent and bottom 10 percent of their managerial and professional
employees every year. The bottom 10 percent are not likely to stay.

 As John F. Welch Jr., General Electric's chief executive, wrote
last month to shareholders, "A company that bets its future on its
people must remove that lower 10 percent, and keep removing it
every year =01* always raising the bar of performance and increasing
the quality of its leadership."

 Ranking or grading employees is also common at technology
companies like Cisco Systems and Hewlett- Packard. But recently the
concept has been catching on more broadly, according to management
consultants. One reason is that as the economy slows, companies
often lay off employees. Cisco, for example, announced earlier this
month that it would let go as many as 5,000 workers =01* and would use
grading as one way to identify people to lay off.

 "Companies are playing their version of `Survivor,' " said David

 Another reason is that some companies are eager to copy Mr. Welch,
long viewed as one of the most successful managers in America.

 Defenders of these systems say anyone who gets a low grade is

with it for today, but as I said in my earlier e-mail, I'll be soliciting 
articles from people who have not yet contributed.  May I use your name? 

ThankYou!

John and Krishna,

Vince,

Hi, hope you are well.
?
I'm just dropping a note regarding invoice 215 which was for 5 people  
attending the energy and weather course.? Our records show that it hasn't  
been paid, which is good.? We will re-do the invoice and charge you only  for 
Alex and Tom's attendance since Paulo didn't show.? Is this OK with  you?? By 
the way, we only charged $250 a person for the weather course  since it was 
suppose to be an exchange of information session, and Enron Weather  paid for 
the venue.
?
Nice to have finally met you in Houston!

Hill Huntington <hillh@stanford.edu> on 03/01/2001 04:29:29 PM
Dear Mr. Kaminski:

Thank you for talking with me about a possible RTP conference.  I would
like to include some discussions of what has been learned in other industries.

As I indicated, Frank Wolak suggested that I contact you.  In discussing
power markets with Frank and other colleagues at Stanford and EPRI, it
seems quite evident that real-time pricing for retail customers is the
"forgotten resource" in more efficient power markets.  There seems to be a
lot of confusion about what RTP means and it also seems that many
researchers need to address some practical but important problems.  I was
asked whether a group like Stanford's EMF might explore this topic and give
it the visibility that would have it considered more seriously by
policymakers.

Frank thought that you might be someone who could help me structure a
useful approach and who might also see whether Enron could become a major
sponsor.  I was hoping that this issue was sufficiently important to Enron
that the company might consider providing $25,000.  As you may appreciate,
it requires some thought and effort to make sure that the product of the
conference is widely circulated among key government groups.

I would be very interested in hearing from you if you can provide ideas and
recommendations for people (perhaps yourself or a colleague) to
participate.  I would also appreciate any consideration by Enron of
providing funding for this effort.

Thank you,
Hill Huntington

Maureen had mentioned to me a while back that our group had approval to hire 
an junior/full economist.  She then asked me to contact Johns Hopkins SAIS to 
get resumes of possible candidates.  I have completed all this.  But, before 
I begin contacting these potential candidates, I wanted to confirm with you 
that we have the approval to hire another person at the either junior or 
associate economist level.

Thank you.

Norma,

I would like to proceed on two fronts with Sevile (both H1 visa and
the Green Card. I shall rather work hard to keep my employees happy
here than try to attach them to the job through immigration arrangements.
They can see through such arrangements and it de-motivates them.

Vince

Jeff,

I fully support Sandeep's request to move Anshuman Srivastav to Houston.
I anticipate that we shall be working on Dhabol related issues for the next 
two years
until all the business problems are successfully resolved.

Anshuman is a very capable employee, with the right combination of skills to
attack the Dhabol modeling challenge. He understands the Indian markets as 
well
as international fuel markets. He has also a very good grasp
of power industry fundamentals and of the technology used at the Dhabol power 
plant.

Vince

Sandeep Kohli@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
03/12/2001 12:40 PM
Vince,

This is a follow-up of our meeting with Jeff Shankman on Friday, as well as 
our discussions with the Global Assets Group on DPC issues.

As you see, there is a need for developing a comprehensive fuel strategy for 
DPC that encompasses both the LNG phase, and the naphtha side.  Furthermore, 
any fuel strategy we develop will have to be in consonance with the power 
side of the business.  There is a lot of analytical work that will be 
required in this context over the next several months, and we will need a 
person who understands both the power and the fuel side of the business at 
DPC.

I believe Anshuman is just such a person.  He has worked closely with me over 
the last 2 yrs., and has been trained in the derivatives side of the business 
(he has attended all three levels of Derivatives classes offered at Enron).  
Over the last month, his presence in Houston has greatly helped me in melding 
the Henwood study with the picture on the LNG/fuel side.  I believe his 
presence in Houston will be critical to us developing a comprehensive 
fuel/LNG strategy for Dabhol, together with the Global Markets and Asset  
groups.

I am therefore requesting you to explore the possibility of Anshuman being 
moved on a more permanent basis to Houston.  As you are aware, Anshuman 
himself would welcome such an arrangement.

Regards,
Sandeep.

Enron is hosting a special event on Saturday, March 31st.  The first annual 
Enron "Trash Bash" to clean up the banks of Buffalo Bayou between Shepherd 
Drive and Sam Houston Park. 

I am chairing the Check-In Team which consists of:
Registering all of the Volunteers
Handing out Enron T-Shirts and Caps
Passing out Gloves and Garbage Bags
Making Clean Up Section Assignments
For anyone who might be interested in helping me, please call me at ext. 
30329.

Also, we need a lot of volunteers to walk along Buffalo Bayou and pick up 
trash.  This would be a great family project, a good project for your childs 
youth group or boy scout or girl scout troop.  It will also be fun.  They 
will have live bands, lyou get an Enron T-shirt and Enron Baseball Cap, lunch 
will be served at Sam Houston Park and there are a lot of good door prizes.   
If you want to volunteer for the "Trash Bash" clean up, just show up at Sam 
Houston Park on Saturday, March 31, 2001, at 8 AM to Register.  Clean up 
starts at 9 AM and lunch will be served at 11:00 AM and after lunch door 
prizes will be drawn and then you can go home feeling like you have done your 
part for Houston's Waterway Environment.

I hope you will think about it and bring your friends, family, ect. and help 
Enron clean up the Environment.

Thanks, Anita

Good morning,

Watch for a severe selloff today. But it should turn around and the buyers 
will bring it back up. I am anticipating that this will be the reversal day

Sam,

Minor corrections.

Vince

I will sign an agreement not to use the materials

Ian,

Sorry for a delay in getting back to you.
I have one challenge I did not anticipate
when I talked to you  the first time about our Real Options
internal seminar.

The materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
from another school, and there is some  sensitivity regarding
the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the
materials
outside Enron.

Please, give me some time to find out if I can work
around this issue.

Vince

I still have not heard from your lawyer.  I would like to see whar
materials you are using and assess how we could work on the topic of real
options with Enron

Vince:

For two decades now, I have been a member of the faculty helping to organize 
the Eastern Conferences on Regulation and Competition that Michael Crew of 
Rutgers has chaired.  This year will be, in fact, the 20th anniversary 
conference and a number of notable personages will be joining us to celebrate 
what we have learned and what we haven't about the economics of network 
industries.  Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a number of other 
distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and the prospects for 
the future.  The conference will take place at a beautiful site in the 
Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from Wednesday afternoon May 
24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check for yourself the nature of 
the program and the conference site/hotel at the following website URL:

http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~crri/WS.htm

Michael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an 
after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key 
research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone 
and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power 
markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would be 
pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but knowing 
your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would not be a 
problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes, followed by a 
short Q&A period.

Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of Enron 
in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price 
discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy 
markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives 
on the "new science of risk management" and what can be expected from it 
could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event.

Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether your 
schedule will allow your participation in this very special event.  Michael 
and I would, of course, be very happy to follow up with you in discussing the 
nature of the presentation, participants and so forth, if this is a go.  I 
look forward to hearing from you.

Anne,

Thanks for contacting me about this.
As a matter of fact, I wanted to talk to  you about it 
today as this matter was outstanding for a long time.

I think we should go ahead and adjust Gwen to manager,
effective March 1. The compensation would be her current base plus
10K. This is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a  manager.
Such promotions take place in March and I think
Gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management
(i.e. my and Maureen's procrastination).

 
On unrelated and more serious matter. Gary Hickerson is the primary client 
for Maureen's services. He communicated to me  a few weeks ago that he is 
unwilling to underwrite Maureen's position (he is in general unhappy with
her contribution). This means that Maureen will have to find another sponsor 
or leave Enron.
Given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal 
customer
will be quite a challenge.
Gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to Maureen from his budget. 
I would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes.

Vince
 

Vince,

Just wanted to touch base with you.  I have tried to contact Maureen so that 
Gwen's title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested, but 
have not heard any response from her.  Would you like for me to wait until I 
hear from Maureen or should I go ahead and proceed in  changing her title?  I 
just want to make sure that Gwen is in the right peer group during PRC.  

Also, I am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through 
Shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing, and your 
expectations during PRC.

Thanks,
Anne

We are having some scheduling conflicts for Andrew visit this coming
Monday.  As the schedule currently, his seminar will be at 1:00 pm in the
Dean's Conference Room.  I realize that this is not the best time for you
and I apologize for any inconvenience.  We may also need to use the same
time slot for Philippe's visit on the 19th.

We plan to meet somewhere in the Village for an informal reception at 5:30
Monday afternoon.  I will let you know the specifics on that once I have
figured them out!  From there you, George, Dave, and Jeff are scheduled to
go to dinner with Andrew around 7:00 pm.  You may join in for cocktails or
meet up with the other group for dinner - your choice.  Dave or Jeff will
let you know the dinner plan.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I have attached PDF files with the papers for both Andrew and Philippe's
seminars.

You can get to Andrew's vitae through this link
http://fisher.osu.edu/fin/faculty/karolyi/resume.htm and Philippe's vitae
through this link http://www.gsm.uci.edu/~jorion/resume.pdf .

Thank you.

Rebecca,

I share some of your concerns regarding Mr. Sud. He is retired and he chose
to contact us rather indirectly (or on the spur of the moment).
I understand  that things are done differently in different cultures but I 
did not meet him and could not
form my judgment based on personal observations.

However, the information  he gave us seems to be too important not to convey
to you and not to act upon.

P.S.  Shirley, please send my bio to Layla

Yes, That's fine.  If you can please give me her full contact details
including e-mail and address I will have her registered as a co-speaker.

If you would like to bring your own copies to the event I would ask you to
send 200 copies directly to the venue.  Although if you can get it to me on
Friday I can still insert it!

Could I please trouble you for a short biography?

Kind Regards

Layla

Layla,

A few points.

I shall be glad to attend the reception.

I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my
presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and
Power 1999):
the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you.

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the
presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her
the credit when the
credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?

Vince

Please respond to <loleary@riskwaters.com>

Dear Speaker,

Pre-Congress Cocktail Reception - Sunday 13th May @ 5:30pm in the Juniper
Room
We would be delighted to have you attend our pre-congress cocktail
reception. We will be extending this invitation to all our sponsors,
exhibitors and EPRM/Risk Waters Group staff.   We hope this will provide a
perfect opportunity for you to meet all our staff and clients before the
formal opening of EPRM 2001 USA

+ RSVP

I would also like to remind you that I need any missing presentations by
Thursday 3rd May.  It is essential that I get these in as the delegates
rely
on these to make notes and get very upset if they are not included in the
packs.

If you still haven't informed me of your AV requirements, please do so as
quickly as possible.  I also require a short biography.

I would like to point out that I will not be taking any presentations on
disk to the event.  If you are using a laptop, your presentation should be
loaded onto the laptop that you bring with you.  You must bring your own
laptop and disc, with connecting cables.

Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Hi Vince,

 regarding David Port's response to Kevin Kindall's email, I feel that I 
should respond, at least to make our position clear.  Please indicate if the 
following response is appropriate -------

"Hi David,

  I understand that you were slightly upset over a comment Kevin Kindall made 
in one of his weekly reports.  The intention was never to disparage anybody.  
It is just that since Research gets data from a large number of sources, we 
feel obligated to the data donor to ask any requester for clarification of 
need.  I completely understand that RAC typically has access to much 
sensitive information and they have a right to know much information.  We 
just want to make sure there is open flow of information (it is in 
everybody's best interests and the company's best interests) and that 
everybody is aware of how data is flowing.  

Best wishes,
 Vasant"

Kevin - thanks for the update.

On the Stock option Plans, if your angle is what I suspect, I suggest you get 
with Rudi Zipter, who has done a great deal of work on this exposure, 
including characterising and actually booking the short option positions in 
Enron's equity system. We are already working with Ben Glisan's team firming 
up a hedging program. We are well advanced in this effort so if you get with 
my people it could save you a great deal of time.

Secondly, I am afraid I do take some exception to your references to Naveen's 
team in your last point. Generally in RAC I don't believe we are obliged to 
explain why we need information, except as a courtesy - otherwise that would 
compromise our role somewhat. Specifically, I am aware of the sensitivity of 
Raptor, just as I am of the sensitivity of all the information my group is 
privvy to on a daily basis. Again, we have done a good deal of work on these 
structures too (I see a position report daily). As I have discussed with 
Vince, Naveen's request would have been derived from a discussion we all had 
with Rick, concerning "meltdown" scenarios and their effect on, amongst other 
things, funding vehicles. 

But I would rather have had a conversation about this than see slightly 
disparaging remarks about my people in email traffic.

Hi all,
Martin has kindly arranged the following presentation for us.  Come and enjoy 
it. 

Zimin, Alex

Giuseppe Paleologo of Stanford and Enron Research Summer Intern fame will 
present a talk on 
  IP Pricing 
at 1pm in EB 46C2, Friday, March 9.

Below is a description of the topic.

Because of the bursty and intermittent nature of IP traffic, 
"oversubscription" is possible.  
In telephone or cell phone networks, selling more lines than the physical 
capacity is 
commonplace.  When too many users access the lines at 5pm, busy signals 
result.  With service level agreements that call for damages to be paid when 
capacity is unavailable, simple busy signals will not do.  An approach to 
this 
issue and thoughts on the trade off between oversubscription and liquidated 
damages will be the focus of this interesting talk.

Greg,

This is the agenda for the recruiting trip to Stanford next week.

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Thank you very much for your prompt response. I look forward to receiving a
copy of your article.

I would also appreciate it if you could let me know whether Enron provides
research grants to individuals who are working in the area of Energy Risk
Management.  Towards my research, I am trying to develop a model to estimate
electricity spot price.

In any case, I will be getting in touch with you again a year or so down the
line when I am nearing completion of my dissertation because Enron is my
dream job.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Ian,

Sorry for a delay in getting back to you.
I have one challenge I did not anticipate 
when I talked to you  the first time about our Real Options
internal seminar.

The materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
from another school, and there is some  sensitivity regarding
the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the materials
outside Enron.

Please, give me some time to find out if I can work
around this issue.

Vince

I still have not heard from your lawyer.  I would like to see whar materials 
you are using and assess how we could work on the topic of real options with 
Enron

Yannis,

I have looked at the outline of the proposed course and
find that practically all the topics of the program are the
staple of what we do every day. I don't think Research  should spend 
money for this class.

If we want to establish a relationship, we can easily do it
by asking him to work on a research project.

Debbie,
I am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of 
"analytical" VAR in RisktRAC.

Here is why this effort is very important:
1. We need to calculate VAR for other percentile but 5 (1% or even 0.2% as 
mentioned by Rick Buy)
and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations;
2. We need to present additional risk measures (such as Mean Tail Loss) to 
the Board.

The analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested 
already so there will be no problems
with the algorithm itself.

We need to get together and discuss IT implementation.

What do you think?

Laura,

We shall have phone interviews with both candidates you brought up to our

both real as welll as financial.  Would it be possible for you, either via

Is this ok to pay?

Robert Johnston has asked me to charge Vince's department for 1/3 of the cost 
of the annual subscription to IIF.  The annual cost is $47K.  Therefore the 
cost for 1/3 is $15,666.67.  This information is for Maureen Raymond's use.

I will be happy to process the invoice for payment but in order for me to do 
so, I will need the proper coding for Vince's department.

     Last nite after using the gym I tried to return to my cubicle to pick up 
my coat, brief case, etc.

     I was unable to get onto our floor.

     Is there a time-sensitive access for my badge?

     If so, can this be remedied.  I will be using the gym most nites and 
don't want to have to bring my gym bag home each nite.

Thanks,
Iris

Neither the Republican presidential candidate, nor
the Democratic presidential candidate had enough
votes to win the election. Therefore, it was decided
that there should be an ice-fishing contest between 
the two candidates to determine the final winner.

There was much talk about ballot recounting, court
challenges, etc., but a weeklong ice-fishing competition 
seemed the fairest way to settle things.  The candidate 
that catches the most fish at the end of the week wins. 
After a lot of back and forth discussion, it was decided 
that the contest would take place on a remote and cold 
lake in Minnesota.  There were to be no observers present 
since both men were to be sent out on this remote lake and
return daily with their catch for counting and verification.

At the end of the first day, George W. Bush returns to the 
starting line and he has 10 fish. Soon, Al Gore returns and 
has zero fish. Well, everyone assumes Al is just having 
another bad hair day or something and hopefully he will 
catch up the next day.

At the end of the 2nd day, George W. comes in with 20 fish 
and Al Gore comes in again with none. That evening, Bill 
Clinton gets together secretly with Al Gore and says; "Al, 
I think George W. is cheatin'.  I'ma gonna dress this good 
ole' Southern Boy, James Carville, up in a costume and send 
him out on the lake to act as a spy".  

The next night (after George W. comes back with 50 fish and 
Al Gore with none), Bill gets Carville and Al Gore together 
and says to Carville: "Well, what about it boy, is George W. 
cheatin'?" "  He sure is, Bill, he's cuttin' holes in the ice!"

Debbie,
I am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of 
"analytical" VAR in RisktRAC.

Here is why this effort is very important:
1. We need to calculate VAR for other percentile but 5 (1% or even 0.2% as 
mentioned by Rick Buy)
and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations;
2. We need to present additional risk measures (such as Mean Tail Loss) to 
the Board.

The analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested 
already so there will be no problems
with the algorithm itself.

We need to get together and discuss IT implementation.

What do you think?

Tanya

Layla,

A few points.

I shall be glad to attend the reception.

I am falling behind in getting my presentation ready. Sorry for the delay.
I can commit to delivering the required number of copies on the day of my 
presentation
(or a day before). I have done it on two occasions before (Power 2000 and 
Power 1999):
the copies were produced by our company Copy Center at no cost to you. 

My associate, Tanya Tamarchenko, is helping me with one aspect of the 
presentation and
I would like her to deliver part of my speach. It's only fair to give her the 
credit when the
credit is due.  Is it OK to include her as an additional speaker?

Vince

Dear Speaker,

Pre-Congress Cocktail Reception - Sunday 13th May @ 5:30pm in the Juniper
Room
We would be delighted to have you attend our pre-congress cocktail
reception. We will be extending this invitation to all our sponsors,
exhibitors and EPRM/Risk Waters Group staff.   We hope this will provide a
perfect opportunity for you to meet all our staff and clients before the
formal opening of EPRM 2001 USA

+ RSVP

I would also like to remind you that I need any missing presentations by
Thursday 3rd May.  It is essential that I get these in as the delegates rely
on these to make notes and get very upset if they are not included in the
packs.

If you still haven't informed me of your AV requirements, please do so as
quickly as possible.  I also require a short biography.

I would like to point out that I will not be taking any presentations on
disk to the event.  If you are using a laptop, your presentation should be
loaded onto the laptop that you bring with you.  You must bring your own
laptop and disc, with connecting cables.

Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Kind Regards

I did get your phone message about the summer, but I still haven't heard from

Good morning, Vince.  Did you get a chance to put a little something together 
for today's newsletter?

Sam

Steve,

Welcome back. Let's have coffee ASAP and review all the projects under way.

Vince

Hi Vince,

Winston is telling me that he has started a serious of presentations to 
certain members of your group to help everyone better understand the various 
components that have been documented.

How is that going from your perspective?......are your people getting 
anything out of it?

Also, the VaR documentation was completed last week, and I've just asked for 
a full printed copy of it to be created mand given to your department.

I've just engaged a small team to document the Credit Reserve model as a 
final piece and then we are done with the core documentation.

regards

Steve

Jinbaek,

This is fine though you are welcome to spend more
time with us this summer.

Vince

Dr. Kaminski,

Thanks for your answer.
Before I tell you the time frame,
I'll need to talk with my advisor, first.
Because here is an on-going-project.
I need to coordinate the schedule.

I'll appreciate it if you understand my situation,
and give me some time (less than a week, of course).

For your reference,
probably
the dates I'd like to ask you will be
from mid-May to mid-July (2 months)

Warm regards,
Jinbaek

Perfect.  Thanks, Vince.

In all likelihood, it would be just fine, it is just not customary for job
talks to include others.  Again, since you are a member of the Risk
Management Chair Search Committee (you may not know of this official
capacity, but I believe it is the case), we by all means hope that you will
be able to attend the seminar as well as dinner.

I will get details on the schedules to you early next week.

A good idea.  I shall forward it to the AG traders.

Nelson,

I know you are focusing on agricultural products for trading, so I just 
wanted to know if we are looking at Wool.  I know that it's traded in 
Australia and New Zealand, so we might be able to look into it as well.  
Please let me know.  Thank you.

Dr. Kaminski,

Thank you very much.
Of course, I'll be happy to have an opportunity
to work at such a wonderful company.
I was contacting with Surech Raghavan at Deal Bench team,
and was going to express my appreciation to you again
after settling down process with them.

For the period of working,
I still need to coordinate with my advisor and
may need to adjust according to that.
but anyway, I'll try to coordinate smoothly.

Please let me know whether I should keep contacting
with Deal Bench team,
for working period and
for misc. living support such as finding a place, rent a car, etc.

I appreciate you so much again,
for arranging such meetings and giving me an opportunity.
All this opportunity will not be available to me,
without your kind help.

Warm Regards,
Jinbaek

Hello,

Sorry for a delay in getting back to you.
We would like very much to offer you a summer internship.

Please, let me know if you are interested.

Barbara,

I called Vlady Gorny and explained that the presentation by Jorion is not 
offered
under the umbrella of the  seminar sponsored by Enron and that it is a 
closed meeting for the School faculty.

I don't think that Enron would open its job interviews to Rice observers
who expressed interest and I made this comment to Vlady. He is OK with this.

You can let his program director know that I have explained   to Vlady
that it is a meeting for limited audience and that he does not expect to be 
invited.

Please, let me know the details of the dinners.

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

An innovative Argentine bond issue that gained an above-sovereign rating,
Enron=01,s moves to create a European bandwidth boom, further clever
catastrophe protection from Swiss Re and awareness of a potential increase
in institutional trading costs through the decimalisation of US equity
markets represented some of the key headlines this week.

The political risk insurance deal was put together by Sovereign Risk
Insurance, a Bermuda-based joint venture between ACE and XL Insurance,
which raised Argentina=01,s Salta Hydrocarbon Royalty Trust=01,s note issue=
 to
investment grade debt. Notably, the ranking was higher than Argentina=01,s
sovereign rating. Given the Basel Committee=01,s endorsement, similar deals
are likely to emerge elsewhere.

Enron, meanwhile, believes a liquid European bandwidth market will emerge
within a year. The US firm is significantly ramping up its European energy
operations.

Swiss Re, which first put together earthquake protection deals in
California in 1997, has developed yet another innovative reinsurance and
investment capital deal to give $100 million protection to policyholders
of the California Earthquake Authority.

Meanwhile, the move to decimalisation and minimum price increments of one
penny in the US equity markets could result in an overall decline in
market liquidity and higher costs for institutional client trades
according to research by US investment bank Goldman Sachs (see top story).

Thank you to you, Ken and Christie for coming to campus for the Enron Tiger
Team Mid-Project review.  The students are working hard and appreciate your
insight and suggestions to the project.  Thank you for your support of the
Wharton School.

Kim Whitsel (whitselk@wharton.upenn.edu) of Tiger Team 1 has informed me
that she is very much interested in a summer internship at Enron this year.

I don't believe some of the students understood the process you had setup
for them at Enron as part of the Tiger Team. Being concerned with having
summer employment, they interviewed with other firms and ultimately accepted
positions. The students asked that I express to you that this does not mean
they are not interested in full time work at Enron next year.  I apologize
and take responsibility for the lack of communication in this regard.  I
think it is a lesson learned and perhaps, in the future, we can make the
agreement to students understood in advance of their "dedicated interview
week" and eliminate their need to interview at all. This can also be an
added advantage of applying to be a member of the Tiger Team.

Please let me know if you have any questions and exactly how Kim Whitsel
should proceed.

I don't know if you are already aware of this, but Maureen Raymond has been

travel before the end of next week at the earliest.  
Tara is the appropriate HR representative in London; I will ask her to keep 
both you and Houston HR informed of the situation.

Many thanks,  Tani 

Bernard,

Yes, I can  read a DVI file. You can also  cc
my home address: Vkaminski@aol.com. I shall
try to send you an answer to your question on weekend.

Vince

Vince,

I can send you a Scientific Word DVI file (at the weekend) if you can read
SCientific Word files ?  The dissertation hasn't been reviewed by Les or the
External yet - although its been at FORC for 2 months. I think that the
Empirical Chapter is probably the one which would be of most relevance to
both our company's businesses - although I ultimately didn't have the time
to 'explicitly' price the jump risk-premium which I conjectured is possibly
implicit in the prices of exchange-traded electricity futures-options -
rather I developed an implicit estimation procedure which will enable a
rough assessment (with a little bit of further work, but not too much) be
made of the price of jump risk in wholesale power markets.

In other words, I assumed spot jump-risk to be undiversifiable, and
essentially devoted 2 Theoretical Chapters to :

1) proving that a jump-diffusion trading model is "incomplete" (synthesising
the securities markets framework with martingale representation theory) -
note that I did not assume that markets could be dynamically completed with
'term structure' securities as in the HJM w/ jumps papers of Shirakawa and
Das and;

2) deriving an explicit risk-adjustment process for 'implementing' the price
of jump-risk using a jump-diffusion marginal indirect utility of wealth
process (ie. a jump-augmented production economy approach in the spirit of
CIR, Bates, Ahn & Thompson).

Incidentally, I would be keen to find out if you or any of your team done
much work on real-asset valuations in a spark-spread option-valuation
framework ?  I'm about to start a project evaluation of embedded
optionality, and have a dilemna whether I should model the spot or forward
gas / power price processes.  With the former, I can model mean-reversion
and jumps explicitly (obviously, important for capturing the optionality of
out-of-the-money plant, which might otherwise be ignored in a pure-diffusion
framework) but am not maximising the informational content of the available
market data (that is, assuming there was a long-term market forward curve
for electricity); whereas in the latter the driftless forward supposition
means that I have to capture mean-reversion via the futures volatility
function, and jumps are less easy to calibrate.  Any suggestions ?

Regards

Bernard

Bernard,

I am forwarding your message to my assistant and she will mail you a
reprint.
I would be glad to take a look at your dissertation. Is it available as a
publication, working paper?

Vince

Hello Vince,

My name is Bernard Murphy - I received your e-mail address from Les
Clewlow,
who was my PhD supervisor at the Financia Options Research Centre at
Warwick
Business School.  I've just finished my PhD on Electricity Price Jump
Diffusions :  A Theoretical and Empirical Study in Incomplete Markets -
hence my interest in electricity price modelling and derivative pricing.  I
was looking to get hold of a copy of your 1997 paper, which has recently
come to my attention :

"The Challenge of Pricing & Risk-Managing Electricity Derivatives", The US
POwer Market, Risk Publications, pp. 149-171.

and Les suggested that I contact you directly (Les is travelling at present
and doesn't have an electronic copy available) to request an e-copy.

Incidentally, I am Lecturer in Finance / Financial Mathematics at
University
of Limerick (Ireland) and have taken a year out to work for Caminus UK,
where I am working on introducing and developing a markets-based approach
(spark-spread) to real asset valuations in the UK power industry.

Thanks in advancve

Her resume has been forwarded to you.
I am enclosing it just in case.
Thanks for your help.

Vince:

Thank you to you, Ken and Christie for coming to campus for the Enron Tiger
Team Mid-Project review.  The students are working hard and appreciate your
insight and suggestions to the project.  Thank you for your support of the
Wharton School.

Kim Whitsel (whitselk@wharton.upenn.edu) of Tiger Team 1 has informed me
that she is very much interested in a summer internship at Enron this year.

I don't believe some of the students understood the process you had setup
for them at Enron as part of the Tiger Team. Being concerned with having
summer employment, they interviewed with other firms and ultimately accepted
positions. The students asked that I express to you that this does not mean
they are not interested in full time work at Enron next year.  I apologize
and take responsibility for the lack of communication in this regard.  I
think it is a lesson learned and perhaps, in the future, we can make the
agreement to students understood in advance of their "dedicated interview
week" and eliminate their need to interview at all. This can also be an
added advantage of applying to be a member of the Tiger Team.

Please let me know if you have any questions and exactly how Kim Whitsel
should proceed.

Thank you,

Hello Vince,

My name is Bernard Murphy - I received your e-mail address from Les
Clewlow,
who was my PhD supervisor at the Financia Options Research Centre at
Warwick
Business School.  I've just finished my PhD on Electricity Price Jump
Diffusions :  A Theoretical and Empirical Study in Incomplete Markets -
hence my interest in electricity price modelling and derivative pricing.  I
was looking to get hold of a copy of your 1997 paper, which has recently
come to my attention :

"The Challenge of Pricing & Risk-Managing Electricity Derivatives", The US
POwer Market, Risk Publications, pp. 149-171.

and Les suggested that I contact you directly (Les is travelling at present
and doesn't have an electronic copy available) to request an e-copy.

Incidentally, I am Lecturer in Finance / Financial Mathematics at
University
of Limerick (Ireland) and have taken a year out to work for Caminus UK,
where I am working on introducing and developing a markets-based approach
(spark-spread) to real asset valuations in the UK power industry.

Thanks in advancve

God grant me the senility to forget the people I never liked 
anyway, the good fortune to run into the ones that I do, and the 
eyesight to tell the difference. Now that I'm 'older' (but refuse to 
grow up), here's what I've discovered:  

1 ?- I started out with nothing, and I still have most of it.  
2 ?- My wild oats have turned into prunes and All Bran.  
3 ?- I finally got my head together; now my body is falling apart.  
4 ?- Funny, I don't remember being absent minded...  
5 ?- All reports are in; life is now officially unfair.  
6 ?- If all is not lost, where is it?  
7 ?- It is easier to get older than it is to get wiser.  
8 ?- Some days you're the dog; some days you're the hydrant.  
9 ?- I wish the buck stopped here; I sure could use a few...  
10 - Kids in the back seat cause accidents.  
11 - Accidents in the back seat cause...kids.  
12 - It's hard to make a comeback when you haven't been anywhere.  
13 - The only time the world beats a path to your door is when you're  
        in the bathroom.  
14 - If God wanted me to touch my toes, he would have put them on my knees.  
15 - When I'm finally holding all the cards, why does everyone decide  
        to play chess?  
16 - It's not hard to meet expenses... ?they're everywhere.  
17 - The only difference between a rut and a grave is the depth.  
18 - These days, I spend a lot of time thinking about the hereafter...I go  
        somewhere to get something and then wonder what I'm here after.  
19 - I ?AM UNABLE TO REMEMBER IF I HAVE MAILED THIS TO YOU BEFORE OR NOT.

Long time no see,
How have you been...must be busy and living a challenging life?
I have been pretty busy too,
to finish a project and write a paper, these days.

Everything looks going OK for my summer internship.
I took necessary steps to work out of campus, and sent
signed contract to Molly a week ago..

Here is what I am expecting to do in the summer.
Please let me know if you have any change in mind.
Actually, I wonder a little bit if DealBench changed its business model...
and maybe you got priority in something different
because it has been quite a while since we talked.
I'd like to what's going on in DealBench team...
Raghavan and Ross,
if we talk over phone it will be great!

Dr. Kaminski,
If you think there is something else interesting to work with during the
summer,
to both you and I, please let me know.
My interest is auction, market design, and simulation.
I am taking a financial engineering class, (mostly on option pricing)
and working on electricity generator valuation problem based on
spark spread option.

All of you,
Let's keep in touch until we meet in June!!

Best Regards,
Jinbaek

Hi, Vince,

How are you doing? I called Wed to set up a meeting with you, unfortunately 
you were out of town. Since I just got my computer and email account set up 
today, it was not that convenient to contact you. Please let me know when you 
are available. Please see the following for the interesting article about 
Enron, and it is exactly what you have been worried about and now it is 
starting to catch Wall Street's attention. So I belive what you have been 
promoting to do is very constructive to the company.

In addition, please let me know if you need any help with Tiger Team. I 
didn't forget yesterday's conference, but I was so tied up in a meeting and 
couldn't leave. The learning curve is quite steep for a freshhand like me at 
the very beginning. 

You are such a remarkable person, and I feel lucky I got the chance to work 
for you. I really appreciate your help and your kindness to me, and I benefit 
from it tremendously. Please please let me know if there is anything I could 
help.

Best Wishes!

Is Enron Overpriced?
It's in a bunch of complex businesses. Its financial
statements are nearly impenetrable. So why is Enron
trading at such a huge multiple?
Bethany McLean

03/05/2001
Fortune Magazine
122+
(Copyright 2001)

   In Hollywood parlance, the "It Girl" is someone who commands the
spotlight at any given moment--you know, like Jennifer Lopez or Kate
Hudson. Wall Street is a far less glitzy place, but there's still
such a thing as an "It Stock." Right now, that title belongs to
Enron, the Houston energy giant. While tech stocks were bombing at
the box office last year, fans couldn't get enough of Enron, whose
shares returned 89%. By almost every measure, the company turned in a
virtuoso performance: Earnings increased 25%, and revenues more than
doubled, to over $100 billion. Not surprisingly, the critics are
gushing. "Enron has built unique and, in our view, extraordinary
franchises in several business units in very large markets," says
Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer.

   Along with "It" status come high multiples and high expectations.
Enron now trades at roughly 55 times trailing earnings. That's more
than 2 1/2 times the multiple of a competitor like Duke Energy, more
than twice that of the S&P 500, and about on a par with new-economy
sex symbol Cisco Systems. Enron has an even higher opinion of itself.
At a late-January meeting with analysts in Houston, the company
declared that it should be valued at $126 a share, more than 50%
above current levels. "Enron has no shame in telling you what it's
worth," says one portfolio manager, who describes such gatherings as
"revival meetings." Indeed, First Call says that 13 of Enron's 18
analysts rate the stock a buy.
   But for all the attention that's lavished on Enron, the company
remains largely impenetrable to outsiders, as even some of its
admirers are quick to admit. Start with a pretty straightforward
question: How exactly does Enron make its money? Details are hard to
come by because Enron keeps many of the specifics confidential for
what it terms "competitive reasons." And the numbers that Enron does
present are often extremely complicated. Even quantitatively minded
Wall Streeters who scrutinize the company for a living think so. "If
you figure it out, let me know," laughs credit analyst Todd Shipman
at S&P. "Do you have a year?" asks Ralph Pellecchia, Fitch's credit
analyst, in response to the same question.

   To skeptics, the lack of clarity raises a red flag about Enron's
pricey stock. Even owners of the stock aren't uniformly sanguine.
"I'm somewhat afraid of it," admits one portfolio manager. And the
inability to get behind the numbers combined with ever higher
expectations for the company may increase the chance of a nasty
surprise. "Enron is an earnings-at-risk story,'' says Chris Wolfe,
the equity market strategist at J.P. Morgan's private bank, who
despite his remark is an Enron fan. "If it doesn't meet earnings,
[the stock] could implode."

   What's clear is that Enron isn't the company it was a decade ago.
In 1990 around 80% of its revenues came from the regulated gas-
pipeline business. But Enron has been steadily selling off its old-
economy iron and steel assets and expanding into new areas. In 2000,
95% of its revenues and more than 80% of its operating profits came
from "wholesale energy operations and services." This business, which
Enron pioneered, is usually described in vague, grandiose terms like
the "financialization of energy"--but also, more simply, as "buying
and selling gas and electricity." In fact, Enron's view is that it
can create a market for just about anything; as if to underscore that
point, the company announced last year that it would begin trading
excess broadband capacity.

   But describing what Enron does isn't easy, because what it does is
mind-numbingly complex. CEO Jeff Skilling calls Enron a "logistics
company" that ties together supply and demand for a given commodity
and figures out the most cost-effective way to transport that
commodity to its destination. Enron also uses derivatives, like
swaps, options, and forwards, to create contracts for third parties
and to hedge its exposure to credit risks and other variables. If you
thought Enron was just an energy company, have a look at its SEC
filings. In its 1999 annual report the company wrote that "the use of
financial instruments by Enron's businesses may expose Enron to
market and credit risks resulting from adverse changes in commodity
and equity prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates."

   Analyzing Enron can be deeply frustrating. "It's very difficult
for us on Wall Street with as little information as we have," says
Fleischer, who is a big bull. (The same is true for Enron's
competitors, but "wholesale operations" are usually a smaller part of
their business, and they trade at far lower multiples.) "Enron is a
big black box," gripes another analyst. Without having access to each
and every one of Enron's contracts and its minute-by-minute
activities, there isn't any way to independently answer critical
questions about the company. For instance, many Wall Streeters
believe that the current volatility in gas and power markets is
boosting Enron's profits, but there is no way to know for sure. "The
ability to develop a somewhat predictable model of this business for
the future is mostly an exercise in futility," wrote Bear Stearns
analyst Robert Winters in a recent report.

   To some observers, Enron resembles a Wall Street firm. Indeed,
people commonly refer to the company as "the Goldman Sachs of energy
trading." That's meant as a compliment. But the fact that part of
Goldman's business is inherently risky and impenetrable to outsiders
is precisely the reason that Goldman, despite its powerful franchise,
trades at 17 times trailing earnings--or less than one-third of
Enron's P/E. And as Long Term Capital taught us, the best-laid
hedges, even those designed by geniuses, can go disastrously wrong.
"Trying to get a good grip on Enron's risk profile is challenging,"
says Shipman.

   Nor at the moment is Enron's profitability close to that of
brokerages (which, in fairness, do tend to be more leveraged). While
Wall Street firms routinely earn north of 20% returns on their equity-
-Goldman's ROE last year was 27%--Enron's rate for the 12 months
ended in September (the last period for which balance sheet
information is available) was 13%. Even less appealing is Enron's
return on invested capital (a measure including debt), which is
around 7%. That's about the same rate of return you get on far less
risky U.S. Treasuries.

   Enron vehemently disagrees with any characterization of its
business as black box-like. It also dismisses any comparison to a
securities firm. "We are not a trading company," CFO Andrew Fastow
emphatically declares. In Enron's view, its core business--where the
company says it makes most of its money--is delivering a physical
commodity, something a Goldman Sachs doesn't do. And unlike a trading
firm, which thrives when prices are going wild, Enron says that
volatility has no effect on its profits--other than to increase
customers, who flock to the company in turbulent times. Both
Skilling, who describes Enron's wholesale business as "very simple to
model," and Fastow note that the growth in Enron's profitability
tracks the growth in its volumes almost perfectly. "People who raise
questions are people who have not gone through [our business] in
detail and who want to throw rocks at us," says Skilling. Indeed,
Enron dismisses criticism as ignorance or as sour grapes on the part
of analysts who failed to win its investment-banking business. The
company also blames short-sellers for talking down Enron. As for the
details about how it makes money, Enron says that's proprietary
information, sort of like Coca-Cola's secret formula. Fastow, who
points out that Enron has 1,217 trading "books" for different
commodities, says, "We don't want anyone to know what's on those
books. We don't want to tell anyone where we're making money."

   In addition to its commodities business, Enron has another
division called Assets and Investments that is every bit as
mysterious. This business involves building power plants around the
world, operating them, selling off pieces of them, "invest[ing] in
debt and equity securities of energy and communications-related
business," as Enron's filings note, and other things.

   Actually, analysts don't seem to have a clue what's in Assets and
Investments or, more to the point, what sort of earnings it will
generate. Enron's results from that part of its business tend to be
quite volatile--profits fell from $325 million in the second quarter
of 1999 to $55 million in the second quarter of 2000. In written
reports, Morgan Stanley chalked up the decline to the poor
performance of Enron's "significant number of investments" in telecom
stocks; Dain Rauscher Wessels blamed it on a lack of asset sales.

   In any event, some analysts seem to like the fact that Enron has
some discretion over the results it reports in this area. In a
footnote to its 1999 financials, Enron notes that it booked "pretax
gains from sales of merchant assets and investments totaling $756
million, $628 million, and $136 million" in 1999, 1998, and 1997.
"This is an enormous earnings vehicle, which can often be called upon
when and if market conditions require," notes UBS Warburg analyst Ron
Barone. Not everyone is so chipper. "We are concerned they are
liquidating their asset base and booking it as recurring revenue,
especially in Latin America," says analyst Andre Meade at Commerzbank-
-who has a hold rating on the stock. At the least, these sorts of
hard-to-predict earnings are usually assigned a lower multiple.

   There are other concerns: Despite the fact that Enron has been
talking about reducing its debt, in the first nine months of 2000 its
debt went up substantially. During this period, Enron issued a net
$3.9 billion in debt, bringing its total debt up to a net $13 billion
at the end of September and its debt-to-capital ratio up to 50%, vs.
39% at the end of 1999. Nor does Enron make life easy for those who
measure the health of a business by its cash flow from operations. In
1999 its cash flow from operations fell from $1.6 billion the
previous year to $1.2 billion. In the first nine months of 2000, the
company generated just $100 million in cash. (In fact, cash flow
would have been negative if not for the $410 million in tax breaks it
received from employees' exercising their options.)

   But Enron says that extrapolating from its financial statements is
misleading. The fact that Enron's cash flow this year was meager, at
least when compared with earnings, was partly a result of its
wholesale business. Accounting standards mandate that its assets and
liabilities from its wholesale business be "marked to market"--
valued at their market price at a given moment in time. Changes in
the valuation are reported in earnings. But these earnings aren't
necessarily cash at the instant they are recorded. Skilling says that
Enron can convert these contracts to cash anytime it chooses by
"securitizing" them, or selling them off to a financial institution.
Enron then receives a "servicing fee," but Skilling says that all the
risks (for example, changes in the value of the assets and
liabilities) are then transferred to the buyer. That's why, he says,
Enron's cash flow will be up dramatically, while debt will be "way
down, way down" when the company publishes its full year-end results,
which are due out soon.

   That's good, because Enron will need plenty of cash to fund its
new, high-cost initiatives: namely, the high-cost buildout of its
broadband operations. In order to facilitate its plan to trade excess
bandwidth capacity, Enron is constructing its own network. This
requires big capital expenditures. So broadband had better be a good
business. Both Enron and some of the analysts who cover it think it
already is. Included in the $126 a share that Enron says it's worth
is $40 a share--or $35 billion--for broadband. Several of Enron's
analysts value broadband at $25 a share, or roughly $22 billion (and
congratulate themselves for being conservative). But $22 billion
seems like a high valuation for a business that reported $408 million
of revenues and $60 million of losses in 2000. Not all analysts are
so aggressive. "Valuing the broadband business is an "extremely
difficult, uncertain exercise at this point in time," notes Bear
Stearns' Winters, who thinks that broadband, while promising, is
worth some $5 a share today.

   Of course everything could go swimmingly. Enron has told analysts
that it plans to sell between $2 billion and $4 billion of assets
over the next 12 months. The bullish scenario for Enron is that the
proceeds from those sales will reduce debt, and as earnings from new
businesses kick in, the company's return on invested capital will
shoot upward. Along with broadband, Enron has ambitious plans to
create big businesses trading a huge number of other commodities,
from pulp and paper to data storage to advertising time and space.
Perhaps most promising is its Enron Energy Services business, which
manages all the energy needs of big commercial and industrial
companies. Skilling has told analysts that its new businesses will
generate a return on invested capital of about 25% over the long run.

   But all of these expectations are based on what Wolfe, the  J.P.
Morgan strategist, calls "a little bit of the China syndrome"--in
other words, if you get x% of y enormous market, you'll get z in
revenues. For instance, Enron says the global market for broadband
and storage services will expand from $155 billion in 2001 to
somewhere around $383 billion in 2004. "Even a modest market share
and thin margins provide excellent potential here," writes Ed
Tirello, a Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown senior power strategist. The
problem, as we know from innumerable failed dot-coms, is that the y
enormous market doesn't always materialize on schedule. And Enron
isn't leaving itself a lot of room for the normal wobbles and
glitches that happen in any developing business.

   In the end, it boils down to a question of faith. "Enron is no
black box," says Goldman's Fleischer. "That's like calling Michael
Jordan a black box just because you don't know what he's going to
score every quarter." Then again, Jordan never had to promise to hit
a certain number of shots in order to please investors.

Gary,

I got your message.  The best way to proceed is to establish direct 
communication
between you and Julie and negotiate a deal.

Vince

Vince,
I did cancel but I think they will charge us anyway.? Waiting to hear  from 
them.
?
OK, just let us know.
?
Thanks,
Julie
Julie,

I? forwarded? your message to the  weather desk.
I think you can cancel Hyatt and save some  money.

Vince

Please respond to "Julie" <julie@lacimagroup.com>

Vince,
Enron is fine (although I think we  have to pay for the Hyatt anyway).

Good discount (I have a feeling that  my idea of a good discount and the
weather desk's idea is probably  different?): for the one day, $1100 per
person. If you think that there  will be around 10 people or more,? then we
can offer a day rate,  regardless of the number of people.

Thanks Vince

Julie

PS  - Of course when I announced that we were cancelling, people  started
responding that they wished to attend. Ugh!

Julie,

Enron location makes more sense. No reason  to? pay for the hotel.
Also, I think that one day makes more  sense.

I? contacted the weather desk about including other people  at the? training
course. I think that they would be interested if they  got a good? discount.

Vince

Please respond to "Julie" <julie@lacimagroup.com>

Vince,

Great. Just to let you  know,? we decided not to wait on the indecisive
ones, and postponed  the open? course. It's yours, whatever you want: 1
day (specific to  what you? feel will be of the most benefit), 2 days, Hyatt
or Enron,  or not at? all. I hope this doesn't cause problems for you.
Special  deal, for sure. I? owe my godfather.

Julie

Julie,

That's definitely an option.

We?  can provide the room. Maybe we can cut with you a special deal?  for
Enron
and increase the # of people attending. I am forwarding?  your message to
our weather?  desk.

Vince

Joe,

What do you think about ?  it?

Vince

Please respond to "Julie" <julie@lacimagroup.com>

Vince,

We just wanted to let you?  know that we only have 3 people signed up for
the
weather?  derivatives course (all from Enron) so far. We have a couple
more
that  have expressed strong interest, but we are awaiting their?  final
decision. If no one else signs up, Chris and Les thought that?  you guys
could probably get through the first day pretty easily, and?  thus thought
it
may be an option to teach just the 2nd day?  material (pricing) only at
Enron
(doing it at the Hyatt is an ?  option as well but the room might be on the
large side)? We would ?  obviously reimburse you for the day not taught. We
can teach both  days? as well, but thought you may want to save some time.

I  just? wanted to give you some time to think about it. We will know  where
we? stand on final numbers by next ?  Wednesday.

Professor Jim Elsner from the Department of Meteorology/Geography at Florida 
State University will be visiting the Weather Risk Management group on 
Thursday, 22 February 2001.  Professor Elsner is a leading expert in 
hurricane climate studies, whose current studies include variations in 
tropical cyclone frequency over a variety of time scales and shifts/trends in 
hurricane landfall probabilities and their relationship to climate and 
climate change; he is noted for his seasonal predictions for number of 
hurricanes and landfall probabilities along segments of the U.S. coastline.  
Moreover, he is a leading authority in non-linear dynamics and chaos theory 
and has published a number of papers on these topics.  

His talk will focus on a proposed research topic, which will provide Enron 
with climatological instruments for use in the insurance and long-term 
derivative markets.  The research involves a
Bayesian analysis of the longest available record of hurricane activity along 
the U.S. coastline.  His current, proposed study addresses the hurricane 
threat in the United States, but the methodology can be applied elsewhere.  
The techniques also can be applied to climate extremes including 
precipitation and
temperature.

The talk entitled, "Predictive U.S. Hurricane Climate" is scheduled for 9 
a.m. at the Hyatt -- Arboretum 5 (2nd Floor).

All are cordially invited to attend.

Best regards,
Todd Kimberlain

Vince,
Have you heard back from the weather people?
?
Do we need to order in PCs for people who are attending, or do most have  
laptops?? 
?
Thanks,

Kristin,

Thanks a lot for the resume.
We shall arrange a phone interview with Richard. This is out standard 
procedure.
A phone interview is  followed by the on-site interview, after we determine 
what is the best team to interview
the candidate.

Vince

Vince,

Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in 
becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab 
experience.  

Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back 
to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the 
attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel 
I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the 
qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.

I talked to him in New York and he is considering

I think John will like him more than Punit.

Black and Blue: The California Electricity Restructuring Saga
George Gross
Professor
Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering
University of Illinois at Urbana =01) Champaign

Abstract

California led the nation in the electricity restructuring arena. Starting
with the various and numerous forums of all the stakeholders at the
California Public Utility Commission, a wide =01) sweeping regulatory refor=
m
act giving customer choice to everyone was enacted in 1996. The
implementation of the restructuring began in 1998. Since May 2000, the
prices in the wholesale California electricity markets have stayed at
extremely high levels. Since the restructuring has frozen the prices at the
retail level, the market developments have put the two largest California
utilities on the verge of bankruptcy. In addition, the state has suffered
major impacts due to the shortage of electricity in the past 9 months. Ther=
e
are key developments at both the state and federal levels impacting the
California situation. This presentation will review the major reasons for
this =01&dismal and
dangerous situation=018 in California. The focus will be on the market
developments and their interaction with the regulatory initiatives. The
experience to date will be assessed in terms of key issues in market
redesign and supply availability. The importance of the California
developments to the restructuring across the nation will be discussed.

George Gross is Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and
Professor, Institute of Government and Public Affairs, at the University of
Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. His research and teaching activities are in
the areas of power system analysis, economics and operations, utility
regulatory policy and industry restructuring. Formerly with the Pacific Gas
and Electric Company, Dr. Gross founded the company's Management Science
Department and held other key management and policy positions. A Fellow of
IEEE, Dr. Gross was awarded the Franz Edelman Management Science Achievemen=
t
Award by the Institute of Management Science.

My interview with Howard will be scheduled on a different day.

[Vince,]
Jeff,

I cannot interview Howard on Tue (business trip) [OK- I will let London know 
this].
I think the organization is very interested in him [Thank you for your 
help...I always consider working for you, primarily- not just Enron as a 
company...my goal is to make you happy and do what you want; My mission was 
to get Howard to you, I understand he will go in front of the directors in 
London- what can I do to help you interview him? I understand that ?Melanie? 
is doing this...and the Manager of Risk at RW is directing Howard. Do you 
want me to set Howard up with you after the second round in Enron London?]

I don't know what "illicts your attention" means [Sorry, mistype in the 
car...was traveling to the snow with my girlfriend on a "mini-vacation" today 
(I neglect her and took off to make her happy)...I constantly think of my 
work (never peace of mind) and because I remain loyal to you...I recieved 
this email information on Howard today(form Enron London) and felt it was 
important enough for you to be aware of (the 2nd interview) and make sure you 
were happy regardless of where I'm going or what I'm doing (you said last 
time you were going to interview this guy by video conference and Rachel said 
she was going to set it up with you)- I didn't know, otherwise. If I don't 
know something then I can't report to you accurate information therefore, I 
forward everything to you- so, it is transparent or maybe you knew something 
different or something I overlooked. I usually send everything and anything 
related to this guy (Howard) because I know you liked him and I can't afford 
any mi!
stakes- sorry to be a pest. Anything you want me to do please tell me- I'll 
do it. Thanks, Vince. Jeff]

Larry, Ken Parkhill passed your contact info along to our project team. We 
plan to call you at 3:15pm EST today (Monday) i.e. 2:15pm Houston time. 
Attached is a presentation describing the scope of our project. We are 
interested in discussing your experiences with competitor trading exchanges 
like ICE, DynegyDirect, HoustonStreet.com, etc. relative to EnronOnline. Look 
forward to talking with you today.

Thanks,
Vincent

Hello Team 1,

I spoke with Larry Gagliardi on the Crude/Refinery Products desk this
morning and he agreed to talk with you after 12:30 today or after 2:30 any
other weekday.  He is very familiar with the other platforms and should be
a great resource.  Larry suggested that you surf EOL to find names of power
and/or natural gas traders, and call them up.  Please let me know if you
have difficulty finding/contacting folks this way and I will see if I can
help.

Larry's office number is 713-853-0543, and his email is
Larry.Gagliardi@enron.com.

good luck

Chaim,

I received a number of phone messages from you.
The project is now in the hands of John and I shall
be very happy to assist him when he is ready to move.
He is looking at the licensing agreement right now.

Till then, I have to wait for him to make  a decision.
My role in this project is one of a facilitator, technical
consultant.

Vince

FYI
John:

Thanks so much for getting back to me.  We remain keenly interested in doing
the preliminary project for you so that you can know how MarketPoint works
and how it might help you.  We are ready to go on the test process as soon
as you and your people are ready.

You heard from Dr. Chaim Braun, Altos Vice President, who called you at my
request to inquire about your demonstration project.  I will mention to
Chaim that you expressed your interest via email to me.  There is no need to
phone him back until you are ready to go.  Chaim's email address is
chaim.braun@altosmgmt.com and he can be reached at the main Altos number
650.949.3541.  My personal phone number is 650.218.3069.

I look forward to working together.

Dale

Sorry so much time has passed since we last discussed your North American
Gas Model.  I am however still interested in setting up a test process to
familiarize some of our key people with the model and the database, etc.

I am now reviewing the licensing agreement that you submitted in December
and will be back in touch soon.  I need to discuss this further with the
business segments, but I suspect that our interest will be focused more on
the Long Term gas model.

Another member of your firm had called last week, but I somehow misplaced
his name and number.  I thought that an e-mail response would suffice for
now.  My apologies.

Regards,

John Goodpasture

Jeff,

I cannot interview Howard on Tue (business trip).
I think the organization is very interested in him.

I don't know what  "illicts your attention" means.

Vince

Hi Vince, I'm on vacation from Friday (today) until Tuesday. Rachel/London 
sent me this confirmation last night and think it illicts your attention- Did 
they get it right to meet you satisfaction? I hope your interview goes well 
with Howard too. It's all set.

Any feedback on the guys from Ford Credit and Citigroup/Oxford University? I 
own them outright- no other firms involved! FYI: My fees are always much less 
on these candidates (exclusive ownership by myself) as there are no middlemen 
involved from these "other firms". I luckily have been attracting very 
talented candidates with just doing business "as myself" rather than MRI. I 
am very encouraged. Please check them out, Vince... as you know- I always 
send you them first then on to my other clients -if you reject them.
Bye Vince, Thank you for the business!
Jeff
PS- Use my cellphone if you want me (the next 4 days) for anything; I'm here

Celeste,

Thanks a lot. Please, let us know whom you are willing to take based on the 
campus interviews,
and I shall absorb the overflow. My experience with the Teams 1 & 3 is that 
they are outstanding students
and we shall be able to offer them a fulfilling summer internship.

Last year we took 8 summer interns into research and all of them very happy 
with the program.

Vince

02/16/2001 10:28 AM
Vince:

Just want to confirm our conversation regarding your interest in the Wharton 
Tiger Teams 1& 3 and your intent to hire interested members into the summer 
associate program.  You stated that you could take all members into your 
research group for the summer.  Kristin Gandy is now in the process of 
obtaining from either you or members of your department the names of the 
individuals on teams 1 & 3.  Some of these individuals may have interviewed 
with us during the campus process.  If they did and were turned down by the 
team for a summer position, we will not extend offers to those individuals.  
Otherwise, if you are willing to take the additional Tiger Team Members into 
your group based on the experience you and your staff have had in working 
with these students, then the Associate Program will facilitate those offers.

At mid summer and the end of the summer, these Wharton MBAs' performance will 
be evaluated and cross-calibrated with other summer associates to determine 
whether they receive an offer to join the full-time Associate Program.  
Offers will be given to those summer associate who achieve extremely high 
performance ratings.

As soon as Kristin receives the names of these individuals and determines 
which members did not already interview, she will get out both a verbal and 
offer to them.

As follow-up, Jana Giovannini, Manager of Staffing in Career Development, 
will staff those that accept our offer from this Tiger Team list into your 
group for the summer.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me.

Regards,
Celeste Roberts

Phillip,

How can I install new programs on my laptop, without 
the administrator's privileges?

One example: when I travel I use AOL to get access to my mail
and to communicate with the office. Windows 2000 does not allow 
me to install it.

 Also, I have my private statistical software
I often use when I work at night during business trips.
I would like to load it as well.

Vince

Mark,

Thanks. Vince

Vince,

I must apologize.  I have not had time to look over the proposal in any 
detail.  When I first spoke with your friend, it was apparent that he was 
still pre-business plan stage.  He has since sent me some ideas and 
information.  I think the concept has merit, but there are so many political 
issues that I am concerned about the ultimate business viability. 

Give me the weekend to look over the information.

Thanks,
Mark

Mark,

Any further thoughts on the blood bank concept?
Please, let  me know if I can be helpful?

Vince

Christie,

Meeting at 5:30 is fine with me. The presentation is at  6:30.
I sent you a message regarding a dinner on Tuesday.
Can  you join me and Ken Parkhill?

Vince

Hi Vince!

Thanks for the information below!

I spoke with Tom Piazze today.  I'll be meeting with him at 3:30 on the 20th 
to discuss the WeBI contract.  I'll also be meeting with Wharton's broadband 
(technical people) before our meeting with the students.  Further, I hope to 
meet with the people in charge of the Business Plan Competition.

Tom  suggested you might want to call Howard Kurnreuther (sp?) and possibly 
stop in to see him while we are at Wharton.

I'll be getting to Wharton sometime Tuesday; I'll try to get a reservation at 
the Inn at Penn.  I'll then be leaving early Wednesday morning by train to 
New York.

Shall we meet in tha Lobby at the Inn at Penn before going to meet the 
students (I think the meeting with the students is at 6pm-ish)--say, 5:30?  
Please let me know!

Also, we still need to give Wharton an answer as to whether we're interested 
in another $50,000 investment in eFellows.

Thanks Vince!

Have a great wekend!

Dear Christie:

Thank you for your voice mail. Things  are moving along nicely with the 
competition.   Phase II deadline was today, so we hope to have some 
statistics in the next few weeks.  I have attached the statistics from Phase 
I, for your files.  Listed below are ways that Enron could be involved, let 
me know in which (or all) of these Enron would be interested in participating.

* We want to start listing our sponsors, so it would be really good if we 
could get your logo.

* Also, does Enron wish to be a Judge in Phase III and the Venture Fair 
(VF)?  For Phase III, we would mail each Judge about 3 full blown business 
plans to be ranked. We anticipate this taking no more than 1 afternoon

*  For the VF, we would need a Judge to be present for the entire day.   The 
VF is by invitation only and we anticipate about 350 students, venture 
capitalists, business entrepreneurs and faculty.  The VF will be held in 
Philadelphia on April 30th.

* At the VF we will provide an opportunity for our sponsors with a 6 foot 
table for exhibits or materials to hand out.  We will need to know if you 
wish to use the exhibit space.

*  We plan on providing our 25 semi-finalist teams with one-on-one 
mentoring.  If Enron is interested, that would be about 1/2 or 1 day 
commitment.

*  There might be an opportunity for a workshop to the University community.  
Would Enron be interested in participating in something like this?

I look forward to working with you to make this year's BPC a success.  Thank 
you.

Sincerely,

Anne Stamer

The problem with this guy is that we maxed out on the number of interns we

him.

Dear Ms. Gandy:

Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to visit the Owen
Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt on January 23-24 for on-campus
interviews for the Summer Associate positions at Enron. It was a pleasure
talking with you, and I hope I conveyed to you how excited I am about the
prospect of applying my skills at Enron.

I realize that Enron offers a limited number of positions and greatly
respect your choice of Summer Associates. I would like to ask you if there
is any opportunity for me to work at Enron during this summer for free. I am
confident that my sincere interest in derivatives will allow me to greatly
contribute to Enron during this summer. I am particularly interested in
Enron Research Group. (I had a phone interview with Mr. Gibner on January
31st, and I sent him email yesterday asking for the opportunity to work for
free during this summer).

I am looking forward to hearing from you. If I can provide more information
or answer additional questions, please feel free to contact me either by
telephone (615-496-1132) or via e-mail
(Dmitri.Villevald@owen2002.vanderbilt.edu). Also, I am always ready to fly
to Houston for additional interviews.

Again, thank you for your time and consideration.

Julie,

Enron location makes more sense. No reason to pay for the hotel.
Also, I think that one day makes more sense.

I contacted the weather desk about including other people at the training
course. I think that they would be interested if they got a good discount.

Vince
 

Vince,
?
Great.? Just to let you know, we decided not to wait on the indecisive  ones, 
and postponed the open course.? It's yours, whatever you want:?  1 day 
(specific to what you feel will be of the most benefit), 2 days, Hyatt or  
Enron, or not at all.? I hope this doesn't cause problems for you.?  Special 
deal, for sure.? I owe my godfather.
?
Julie
?

Julie,

That's definitely an option.

We can  provide the room. Maybe we can cut with you a special deal for Enron
and  increase the # of people attending. I am forwarding your message to
our  weather desk.

Vince

Joe,

What do you think about  it?

Vince

Please respond to "Julie" <julie@lacimagroup.com>

Vince,

We just wanted to let you know  that we only have 3 people signed up for the
weather derivatives course  (all from Enron) so far. We have a couple more
that have expressed strong  interest, but we are awaiting their final
decision. If no one else signs  up, Chris and Les thought that you guys
could probably get through the  first day pretty easily, and thus thought it
may be an option to teach just  the 2nd day material (pricing) only at Enron
(doing it at the Hyatt is an  option as well but the room might be on the
large? side)? We would  obviously reimburse you for the day not taught. We
can teach both days as  well, but thought you may want to save some time.

I just wanted to give  you some time to think about it. We will know? where
we stand on final  numbers by next  Wednesday.

documents so that I can proceed with the visa application?  
To date, I have not heard anything from him.

Please advise
Thanks
Margaret

   

I spoke today to Sandeep Kohli about Anshuman's job description, and he said 
that he would be happy to start on it right away (finally!).  Anyway, he then 
asked if we had any job description templates for visa applications, and I 
told him that I would check with you to see.   Can you help him with anything?

Please, put on my calendar

Professor Jim Elsner from the Department of Meteorology/Geography at Florida 
State University will be visiting the Weather Risk Management group on 
Thursday, 22 February 2001.  Professor Elsner is a leading expert in 
hurricane climate studies. who is currently investigating 
interannual/decadal/multi-decadal hurricane variations and shifts/trends in 
hurricane landfall probabilities and their relationship to climate and 
climate change; he also issues seasonal predictions for number of hurricanes 
and landfall probabilities along segments of the U.S. coastline.  Moreover, 
he is a leading authority in non-linear dynamics and chaos theory and has 
published a number of papers on these topics.  

His talk will focus on a proposed research topic, which will provide Enron 
with climatological instruments for use in the insurance and long-term 
derivative markets.  The research involves a
Bayesian analysis of the longest available record of hurricane activity along 
the U.S. coastline.  Deliverables will address the hurricane threat in the 
United States, but the methodology can be applied elsewhere.  The techniques 
also can be applied to climate extremes including precipitation and
temperature.

The talk is scheduled for 9 a.m. and the room assignment will be announced.

All are cordially invited to attend.

Best regards,
Todd Kimberlain

John,

I think it's a good idea. Please, go ahead and call
him directly.

Vince

Vince,

What do you think about asking Andy Fastow to come to the Texas Finance
Festival this April as our luncheon speaker?  If you agree I'll go ahead
and call him.  If you have an opportunity to speak with him about the
conference that would be great.  The date is April 21st (that's a Saturday).

Hope you are enjoying NY.  Shirley tells me that you're running up your
frequent flyer miles again.

your friend,

john

This is great!

SAY IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN !

Clinton isn't president

A man goes to the White House and asks to see
President Clinton.  The Marine on duty tells the
guy that Clinton isn't President any longer, please
leave.

The man goes away.

The next day he comes back to the White House and 
asks to see President Clinton.  Marine on duty tells 
the guy that Clinton is not the President any longer, 
please go away.

The man goes away.  The next day he comes back again, 
and again the same Marine is on duty.

The man asks to see President Clinton and the Marine 
says, -- WHY DO YOU KEEP COMING HERE ASKING FOR HIM?  
CLINTON IS NOT PRESIDENT ANYMORE!!!

The man smiles happily and says,
"I know, I just like hearing it."

Hi,

 As per your request, here is a very rough draft of the document you 
requested.  It is far from being complete.

 Hopefully while in London I will have time to work on it some more.

 Your comments and feedback would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Julie,

That's definitely an option. 

We can provide the room. Maybe we can cut with you a special deal for Enron
and increase the # of people attending. I am forwarding your message to 
our weather desk.

Vince

Joe,

What do you think about it?

Vince

Vince,
?
We just wanted to let you know that we only have 3 people signed up for the  
weather derivatives course (all from Enron) so far.? We have a couple more  
that have expressed strong interest, but we are awaiting their final  
decision.? If no one else signs up, Chris and Les thought that you guys  
could probably get through the first day pretty easily,?and thus thought it  
may be an option to teach just the 2nd day material (pricing) only at Enron  
(doing it at the Hyatt is an option as well but the room might be on the 
large  side)?? We would obviously reimburse you for the day not taught.? We  
can teach both days as well, but thought you may want to save some time.?  
?
I just wanted to give you some time to think about it.? We will know  where 
we stand on final numbers by next Wednesday.

Dear Vince,

    I just wanted to thank you for inviting me to visit Enron last Friday and
for the generous amount of time you spent with me personally while I was
there.  I found our discussions both informative and stimulating.

    Vince, I was genuinely impressed by the caliber of the group you have
assembled at Enron.  Their individual and collective expertise is obvious;
and they were most generous in exchanging ideas and sharing opinions with me.

    If you or any of your people have, over the weekend, developed further
questions or thought of additional information that might be helpful, I'm
standing by.  I'm eager to continue our dialogue.

    Sincerely,

    Larry Thorne

Here is a short note on potential research with Wharton.  Please review and 
edit and then we can send some indication to the Wharton guys.    ----------

 The objective would be to define the amount of risk an enterprise can take, 
and the difference between this and the actual amount of risk the enterprise 
chooses to take based on the capital structure and reporting structure.  In 
particular, one can view Enron as a hierarchy of companies, and assuming we 
can separately quantify the risks of each unit, what framework would one use 
to analyze risk at Enron? 
  A related question is how one should represent risks in the different 
units?  Risks may be of different types --- short-term volatility risk, 
catastrophic risk, liquidity risk, etc --- what should one focus on for a 
first cut?
 Another related question is to decide on the optimal amount of insurance 
both at the unit level and the enterprise level, and relate the decision to 
get insurance to the cost/benefit of insurance.

Joao,

I shall be traveling Tue and Wed this week. Please,
call me at 713 853 3848 on Thursday or Friday.

Steve,

I sold EFS. I think insurance stocks are going up
on the hopes of further interest rates cuts.

We bought 100 books.

Yes, please, send me the copy of an article.

Good Morning, 

Welcome back. Will get some picks to you tonight. Are you still in EFS?  Hope 
so, it is breaking out to new levels today.

Question, the new book on Deriatives, how many copies did the company 
purchase on the initial run?

Also, there was an article about the 90%  non-recourse loan programs in 
E-COMPANY magazine this month, do you want a copy of the article?

Steve

Vince,

Attached is a copy of the typeset version that I will be reading today.  I
will check to make sure that all the changes you gave me this weekend are
incorporated.  I will also be writing a 200 word summary for the paper
today and will pass that by you as well.

Have a great day.

john

p.s. I'll call Shirley about the revenue question I sent you yesterday.

I was recently informed of a risk-reducing strategy that we have on the 
Merchant Asset portfolio.  It seems that we have a vertical bear spread 
hedging our holdings of Hanover Compression.

Since these holdings represent about 10% of the porfolio, I felt that 
parametric VaR would not be accurate enough.  As a result, I have changed the 
model to a Monte Carlo simulation with the following details:

Following my conversation with Vince, I changed the method of parameter 
estimation to RiskMetrics standard (assume a zero mean and estimate daily 
volatilities and correlations using exponential weighting with a 0.94 lambda).

I use the Cholesky decomposition to produce correlated random normals, which 
I then use to simulate Geometric Brownian Motion prices.

I treat the Hanover Compression stock holding and bear spread together as a 
synthetic short put at 34 and long call at 92.  I do full revaluation of the 
options with the Black-Scholes.  I keep volatility and the interest rate 
constant for the sake of computational speed.

I write my Monte Carlos through VBA and formulas in Excel, so this model does 
not need Crystal Ball.

Regards,

Eugenio

TradeSpark says online energy trades top $16 bln 

 ? 
NEW YORK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Online energy exchange Tradespark said Thursday  
it has handled energy trades with a notional value of more than $16 billion  
since trading began on Oct 2, 2000.  

TradeSpark (www.tradespark.com) said natural gas instruments accounted for  
over $9 billion of the trades logged to date, and electricity instruments 
for  
about $6 billion.  

More than 125 companies and roughly 550 traders are registered to use  
TradeSpark to execute their energy trades, the company said in a statement.  

In January, traders who did not work for one of TradeSpark's founding  
partners accounted for 58 percent of all trades, up from 48 percent in  
December.  

TradeSpark's founding partners include electronic commerce firm eSpeed Inc. < 
ESPD.O>, brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald, energy firms Williams Cos. <WMB.N> and  
TXU Corp. <TXU.N> and Royal Dutch/Shell <RD.AS> <SHEL.L> affiliate Coral.  

Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N> has announced plans to become a partner at a later date.

David,

Please, send me an E-mail with you phone number.

Dear Mr Kaminski,

Firstly, I wanted to tell you how privileged I feel to be considered for
some of the opportunities within your prestigious firm.
I am strongly interested in what Enron Global Markets has to offer in its
research side.  Your Training Program is widely recognized within the
financial industry as being one of the best, and I would be more than
honored to be part of it.  I believe that as member of Enron I can learn a
lot more quantitative ways of trading energy products, and I can also learn
how to get a feel for the Energy markets from some of the best people in th=
e
business.
Thus, I would sincerely appreciate to be considered as a potential member o=
f
your rotational program.  Indeed, I believe that my employment experiences
have provided me with valuable skills that will be very useful in your
Group.  These skills include the ability to synthesize quantitative
information quickly and accurately, the facility to deal with sophisticated
financial products, and more importantly the ability to work as part of a
team by fulfilling responsibilities diligently and sometimes prior to
deadlines.  I genuinely hope to contribute to Enron=01,s success by bringin=
g
these skills, along with my strong mathematical background and knowledge of
the Energy Industry.
Finally, I wanted to commend you on your high level of professionalism, and
the clarity with which you exposed the opportunities available within Enron=
.
You surely are a genuine proof that your Group is committed to working with
people who exhibit a superior level of professional capabilities.

Sincerely Yours,

David A. Michalon

 spoke to Howard, he is intereste in speaking to someone higher up the
 foodchain at Enron. He got the impression that those people he met would
 report into him. He really needs to speak to someone higher up and discuss
 the roles strategic potential.

 He is interested mainly in structuring which this role is not. But he
 recognised where it might lead and this would potetially be interesting to
 him but needs to speak to someone who is involved in the strategic direction
 of enrons credit.com.

 Vuthy is aware that Enron have intimated they want to see him again. Howard
 has told me there is a lot happening for him both here and in the US. Vuthy
 will arrange to get Howard interviewed here in London early next week.

Hello everyone,

I wanted to get a message out to each of you to update you on the February
23 conference plans.  The conference promises to provide an exciting
opportunity to share the ideas of a diverse group of academic and industry
professionals on a topic that is dear to all our hearts, the future of
business education in the new economy.  I will be sharing updates and
information with you over the weeks to come but thought it might be useful
to start before the holidays.

I am attaching the most recent "description of the program of events" which
remains somewhat fluid as we develop it.  However, there are some new
developments that you will find interesting.  First, I have arranged for
"filming" of the event by our local public TV station and we will be
working toward the development of the best product possible out of the
sessions.  Second, David Palumbo (Human Code--an internet content
provider-http://www.humancode.com/index2.htm- now owned by Sapient) will
join us.  David is very knowledgable about both educational issues (he
served on the faculty of the University of Houston for 10 years before
joining Human Code).  He has some very interesting insights to offer on the
future of higher education having now worked from the industry side of the
equation).  Finally, I am currently reading a couple of books that you may
find interesting (Telecosm and The New Barbarian Manifesto).  I'm sure
there are many more interesting sources of information that you are each
aware of and it would be helpful if we all began sharing our notes.

Finally, let me suggest that each of you begin thinking about the issue(s)
that you feel most comfortable commenting upon and phrasing "lead in"
questions for me.  I would like to build a list of such questions to
circulate among all so that we begin to get a feel for the range of topics
we will encounter in the discussion and begin to formulate our individual
opinions.

I hope that this note finds you all anticipating a wonderful holiday season
and thank you for participating in this inaugural "think tank" conference
on the future of business education.

Sincerely yours,

John

Just got a copy of the attached paper and thought it may have some interest
for you guys.

On another note, I am putting together a workshop in the spring on the New
Economy and Business Education and will be seeking out some Enron network
people to join in the discussion (2-hours on Friday March 2nd).  I'll let
you know more as we work through the details.  The idea is to "brainstorm"
about the new world you guys work in every day and its implications for
what we should be doing.  Hope this is interesting to you and that you'll
want to spend the day with us.

Take care and enjoy the weekend.

Good afternoon,

I just want to give you a reminder about the one-page questionnaire
regarding arrival and departure times for the workshop.  Your responses
will make planning a bit easier on this end.  Also, please get me your
"one-page" background statement as soon as possible.  I am attaching
Michael Froehl's to give you some guidance (thanks Michael, I thought I was
going to have to prepare mine first).

Let me also tell you that the television producer has requested 15 minutes
of each of your time either the morning of the 23rd before the luncheon or
after the workshops to do individual interviews.  They will then work these
individual shots into the final edited program (bring your best TV smiles).
 By the way, I have been assured by the producer that we have final say
over whether particular comments are edited in or out of the final product
so we can all relax, this is not live TV.

I'll be out of town the end of next week but hope to have all my plans put
together the following week so please respond to both the questionnaire and
the request for a one-page background/positions/ideas write-up.

Thanks guys and I'm looking forward to seeing you all very soon.

John

p.s. In case you've misplaced it I have appended a copy of the questionnaire.

Please, don't distribute it: It's an internal document.

By the way, when is your trip?

Vince

Hi!
When we last spoke you mentioned that you have workshops on real options at 
Enron.
Is there any chance that I could see the materials that you use?  I would 
like to prepare for a visit to your HQ, which would probably be more 
effective if I knew more about what approaches your people are using.
This material would be treated with strict confidentiality and I would be 
happy to sign any confidentiality agreements

Andy,

I am sending you a draft oof a proposal regarding national forum for top 
finance practitioners and
academics. The idea came from a professor at Rice University who
has already received a commitment from a number
of most distinguished CFOs. 

Please, read the outline and see if you would be interested in joining this 
forum.
I shall be glad to help to arrange  a meeting with Prof. Ikenberry.

John,

HTML version of Enron article:

Vince

Vince,

I have made bold face edits to the attached document.  I still have two edits 
to make but am concerned that you were not reading the most recent version.  
Sorry for any confusion but the editor doesn't use the edit function in word 
so I have ended up making edits on new versions of the paper.  

I still haven't made the change regarding the take-or-pay problem (I left 
that paper at home in my briefcase and will make the change tomorrow 
morning).  Also, I haven't added anything regarding the conflict that arose 
over pay for new hires nor have I received the Business Week e-mail from you.

However, if the paper looks ok to Mark Palmer we can make these minor edits 
on the galley pages of the article.  

thanks

john

p.s. i am very disappointed about the scheduling conflict you have on Feb 
23rd.  you will be greatly missed but i certainly understand.

Hi Vince,

I am enclosing a report on my thoughts about risk and return behaviour of an  
insurance portfolio. Your input on this will be very helpful. 

I have given Vasant a copy of this report and am working with him towards 
improving  this. In the mean time, I happened to mention this idea in a 
meeting with David  Porter, Per Sekse, Brad Blesie and David Hoog and there 
seems to be some  interest in understanding how this works. In fact, David 
Hoog subsequently  reviewed this with me and suggested some changes. Those 
changes have been included in this report.

The idea here is simple and just a starting point.  While it provides a broad 
picture on how risk and return will behave at portfolio level,  I am hoping 
to be able to relax some of the assumptions to get more realistic picture in 
near future.

Looking forward to your input,

Sincerely,

Amitava

Here is your latest roster. We are up-to-date on all changes but, of
course, the students may still drop/add up to the second week of module 5.
When the time comes, please check your roster carefully and make sure that
the people on the list really are attending your course. Mistakes happen so
I just would like to make sure we have a correct record.

As always, let me know if you would like the excel folder with e-mail
addresses. I don't send them at the same time to avoid overwhelming our
e-mail system. Thanks for your help!

 Hey Ding.  If you recall, we looked at Southern Cone during July, as this 
was the feedback that we got from our presentation in late May.  The Cuiaba 
gas and power volumes may be found in several different places since there is 
more than one model.  The models do not necessarily agree with each other.  I 
have attached a few models that should contain the necessary info.  I also 
have a summary sheet template that was to be attached in MAPS.  Enjoy.

Vince, it was an excellent presentation to get some discussion going among
the practitioners on how to map the volatility process.
I think we will never be able to build a single black box to value
volatility, otherwise markets will cease to exist and we in risk will be out
of business.
However, it will be possible to build a framework to structure volatility
modeling process. Like the general equilibrium modeling approach you
proposed.
Atleast we can agree on the key drivers of supply and demand and the
significant variables of a fundamental model.

I hope we get to have a continuing discussion on this topic.

I would also request if you could please send me a copy of you power point
presentation.

Thanks

Dear Vince,

I am following up concerning your upcoming speaking engagement at Baylor on
evening of February 23.  Of course, I'll plan to see you during the
afternoon at John Martin's "new economy" conference.  That evening, you
will be the dinner speaker for the official chartering ceremony of the
Gamma Iota Sigma Risk Management and Insurance fraternity.  We are hoping
for a really good turnout that evening, and expect guests not only from
around Texas but also possibly other parts of the country.  I am not sure
what your travel plans are, but I did take the liberty of setting up a
guaranteed reservation for you at the Marriott Courtyard (Confirmation
#84857419).  Let me know if you don't need the reservation, but otherwise
it will be available to you.

I also am interested in finding out whether I might be able to attract you
to campus on another occasion to speak to my corporate risk management
classes.  Perhaps we can discuss this possibility when we see each other
about three weeks from now.

Sincerely, with best regards,

Jim Garven

RiskNews Update - week ending 02/02/2001
http://www.RiskNews.net
News for derivatives and risk management professionals
===================================================================

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

The Fed's second 50 basis point cut in interest rates in a month to stave
off a recession in the US - a move widely discounted in the marketplace -
was the subject of many headlines this week. While the cut is the largest
since the 1982 recession, and has raised eyebrows regarding the true state
of the US economy, there was also plenty of other important news.

ABN Amro unveiled plans to boost its risk management and derivatives
business by purchasing a large slice of ING Barings' North American
investment banking operations for $275 million. Competition in the US and
elsewhere will be fierce, however, with leading player Salomon Smith
Barney creating a new global interest rate and derivatives products group,
following an overhaul of its fixed-income and derivatives businesses.
There appears to be no long-term role for Citibank's Fred Chapey in the
new division. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank's decision to axe about 2,600 staff
following a restructuring of its operations into two business groups, will
have a negligible impact on its derivatives business (see Headlines).

London-based broker Tullett & Tokyo Liberty was back in the news again for
alleged racial discrimination. Laurent Weinberger, a broker on the new
issues desk until last May, initiated a racial discrimination and unfair
dismissal case against his former employer this week. Previously the firm
had a run-in with client Citibank, when a Tullett employee allegedly made
racist comments to a Citi official (see People).

RiskNews Update - week ending 02/02/2001

News for derivatives and risk management professionals
===================================================================

Dear Subscriber,

Welcome to RiskNews Update!

The Fed's second 50 basis point cut in interest rates in a month to stave
off a recession in the US - a move widely discounted in the marketplace -
was the subject of many headlines this week. While the cut is the largest
since the 1982 recession, and has raised eyebrows regarding the true state
of the US economy, there was also plenty of other important news.

ABN Amro unveiled plans to boost its risk management and derivatives
business by purchasing a large slice of ING Barings' North American
investment banking operations for $275 million. Competition in the US and
elsewhere will be fierce, however, with leading player Salomon Smith
Barney creating a new global interest rate and derivatives products group,
following an overhaul of its fixed-income and derivatives businesses.
There appears to be no long-term role for Citibank's Fred Chapey in the
new division. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bank's decision to axe about 2,600 staff
following a restructuring of its operations into two business groups, will
have a negligible impact on its derivatives business (see Headlines).

London-based broker Tullett & Tokyo Liberty was back in the news again for
alleged racial discrimination. Laurent Weinberger, a broker on the new
issues desk until last May, initiated a racial discrimination and unfair
dismissal case against his former employer this week. Previously the firm
had a run-in with client Citibank, when a Tullett employee allegedly made
racist comments to a Citi official (see People).

Dear Dr. Kaminski,
I'm an economist (M.Sc., Caltech, Ph.D., Iowa) who has been working for the
Alberta government for the last seven years on electricity deregulation in
Alberta, Canada. I have been looking for research papers on the measurement
and causes of price volatility in electricity markets.

As a policy maker, I am interested in the implications of government policy
decisions on price volatility. As an economist who has had a hand in
designing the electricity markets here, I am also interested in how the
design of electricity markets and the associated institutions affect price
volatility.

I've found two references to a seminar talk you have given recently at
Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon called "Volatility of Electricity Prices -
Measurement and  Analysis of Underlying Causes." (I've also found a
multitude of references to other work that you've done, but this seemed
closest to what I'm looking for.)

Was there a paper associated with your talk that I could get a copy of? Any
help you can give me on finding information on this topic would be greatly
appreciated.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Sid Carlson

Here is your latest roster. We are up-to-date on all changes but, of
course, the students may still drop/add up to the second week of module 5.
When the time comes, please check your roster carefully and make sure that
the people on the list really are attending your course. Mistakes happen so
I just would like to make sure we have a correct record.

As always, let me know if you would like the excel folder with e-mail
addresses. I don't send them at the same time to avoid overwhelming our
e-mail system. Thanks for your help!

Good afternoon,

I just want to give you a reminder about the one-page questionnaire
regarding arrival and departure times for the workshop.  Your responses
will make planning a bit easier on this end.  Also, please get me your
"one-page" background statement as soon as possible.  I am attaching
Michael Froehl's to give you some guidance (thanks Michael, I thought I was
going to have to prepare mine first).

Let me also tell you that the television producer has requested 15 minutes
of each of your time either the morning of the 23rd before the luncheon or
after the workshops to do individual interviews.  They will then work these
individual shots into the final edited program (bring your best TV smiles).
 By the way, I have been assured by the producer that we have final say
over whether particular comments are edited in or out of the final product
so we can all relax, this is not live TV.

I'll be out of town the end of next week but hope to have all my plans put
together the following week so please respond to both the questionnaire and
the request for a one-page background/positions/ideas write-up.

Thanks guys and I'm looking forward to seeing you all very soon.

John

p.s. In case you've misplaced it I have appended a copy of the questionnaire.

Vince,
 While I was at HSB, I designed an insurance or reinsurance financial model 
that HSB uses for new product development, pricing different reinsurance 
strategies, computing stochastic earnings forecast, and estimating 
probabilistic maintenance & repair costs. The code, written in Visual Basic & 
MS Access belongs to HSB, and I want to replicate it here for our use at 
Enron. I would like to arrange a time to specifically talk to you and perhaps 
Vasant who was briefed on the model, about how we can use your group for the 
analytical and programming support to get this model re-constructed.
 I have screen outputs from the code and Vasant thought the re-design and 
construction here at Enron is a problem that your group can do. Could you let 
me know when we can setup an hour to discuss?
Thanks,
Rick Jones

For your reading enjoyment.

We should shoot for breakfast on Thursday morning Feb. 8th.

Hi Vince,

After we hung up the phone yesterday, I sent you an email as we
agreed.  However today I looked in my "outbox" and see that nothing was
sent to you.  Thus, I'm trying again.  If this is redundant, sorry.

Attached is a copy of the Corporate Finance Forum I am trying to
organize.  Any comments or suggestions you might have would be
appreciated.  I look forward to Enron getting involved in this project if
at all possible.

Secondly, I am confirming the dates for the two visitors for the Risk
Management chair.

Philippe Jorion,  Seminar on 2/15 and dinner on 2/14
Andrew Karolyi, Seminar on 2/23 and dinner on 2/23.

Lets try to go flying sometime soon

Thanks for your help and support,

Elsa,

Thanks for the invitation. 
I shall be glad to join you.
Please, send me the details.

Vince

Vasant,

I agree.

Vince

Vince,

 he seems to have mostly equity and fixed income background (and then some 
credit exposure calculation) with not much credit data analysis experience.  
I do not think he would be appropriate for Bryan's group -- he needs a person 
who tracks market developments and understands fundamental data, and although 
this guy may be good at modeling, we already have Iris and Amitava doing the 
modeling and looking at data.  At this stage, I would prefer to hire somebody 
with direct experience in credit analysis (banking, rating agency).  I am 
worried that if we get another person without data analysis experience, then 
Amitava will find himself with two people (Iris being the other one) who are 
both inexperienced in this area, and he will find himself doing a lot of the 
work anyway.
 If you want to pursue him, we should probably do a phone interview first.

Vasant

Vasant,

What do you think?  He may be expensive.

Dear Vince:

I enjoyed talking with you on the telephone on Friday and look forward to
working with you on this project.

Just to confirm, we decided to have a conference call on February 5th and
that I would come to Houston later in the month.  The week of February 12th
is not good for me, (I will be at Yale), but I am free on Tuesday and
Wednesday of the following week.  Also, note that I will be seeing you in
Austin for the energy finance conference on Thursday and Friday of that week.

I will spend a few hours thinking about the issues we discussed in Houston
before our conference call.  Specifically, issues relating to appropriate
discount rates and the concept of risk capital.  If you have other issues
that you would like me to start thinking about prior to the call, please
let me know.

I look forward to talking with you about this in more detail.

What do you think about option 2?
--SG

Stinson,
?
Here are some options considering what you  have
said:
?
1)? We can do a full week of class from May 7 to  11.
?
2)? The second option is to split the  course over two weeks.
If you cannot possibly accomodate a full week of  training 
then we can try this.? We have done  this before and it has 
worked fairly well.? It would be like:
?
Week 1 (20 hours):? Feb 20-23, Tue-Fri,  12:00 to 5:00
Week 2 (20 hours):?  April 9-12, Mon-Thu, 12:00 to 5:00
?
These are the only two weeks that are available for Venkat  
to teach before May 7th date.? 
?
Please let me know if these would work.? I  look forward to 
hearing from you.?
?
Regards,
?
- Siva
Siva,???? I will have to  check and see if we can accomodate a 5 day 8 to  
class.??? Also, President's day is a holiday for us, so  we may have to look
at a later  date.

Stinson,

I have attached a file  along with this email
that lists the software needed for our
Java  class.

We would like to do the class from Monday thru
Friday, 8 AM  to 5 PM.? That way we can complete
the class within a?  week.? We are unable to offer
classes in the evenings or for few  hours a week.
We usually teach week long courses for our
other clients  and because of that? we won't
be available.

Currently, we can  do the class from Feb. 19th
through Feb. 23 (that is if you are working  on
Feb 19th, President's day).

I will call? you sometime this  afternoon to talk
further.? Please feel free to reach me if you  have
any further questions in the mean time.

Regards,

interview, I would very much like to meet with him.  Sean talked with him 
when you brought him in a few weeks ago and he thought it would be a good 
idea for me to meet with him so we can compare thoughts.  

Thanks, Kim.  

Kim,

This is a letter from one of the job applicants who works for PROS.
It seems that the system they develop for Williams
is more a scheduling system.

Would you like to ask him to come back for another interview,
to get more information out of him?

Vince

Dear Vince:

It was so nice meeting and talking with you too. I did
not take any pen back, I lost my pen too somewhere in
Enron.

As I mentioned to you, after I got my Ph.D in 1999, I
have been working two years as Lead Scientist and
Science Manager in energy division at PROS Revenue
Management Inc. in Houston.

I developed and implemented the mathematical models
for Trading Optimization System and Firm
Transportation Optimization System.

The Trading Optimization System becomes the most
popular product in the industry this year. Duke Energy
just signed the contract to buy this product
yesterday.  Conoco and Williams also signed the
contracts for it. According to PROS Sales Department,
the potential marketer to buy this product exceeds 15
companies in one or two years.

Enron is the ideal place for me to continue my
research and system developing efforts to combine
revenue management with risk management. I am
confident that I can make significant contributions to
Enron in this area.

I would like to thank you again for giving me this
opportunity to come to Enron for this interview. I am
looking forward to having the opportunity to work in
Enron.

Sincerely Yours

Jacob

As far as lunch is concerned, right now I am totally free for next week.

Hi John and Vince!

John, hopefully you received my voice mail regarding the matter set forth 
below.

I'm in NY now and won't  return until Thursday morning.  Perhaps it would be 
easiest for John to come to the video conference on Thursday (if he's in 
Houston) or via telephone if he's travelling??

Whatever  you both think is best..please let me know!

My assistant, Melinda McCarty, is setting up the call location at the Enron 
Building, as well as the dial-in number with Donna Piazze at Wharton.

Melinda, please include John in the distribution of the video conference 
location.

Thanks!

Christie,

As we talked last Thursday via video teleconference, we are planning to 
narrow our scope to focus on a marketing/promotion plan for NewPower 
including value-added products and services for the future.  Before we talk 
again on Thursday, we would like to speak with John Henderson again to see if 
he recommends any specific items he would like us to address.

We are having trouble contacting him and wonder if you could facilitate a 
phone meeting between us, or if it would be best to include him in our next 
video teleconference.  We are available the next two days at 1pm and 4pm 
Houston time.

We understand that John is a very busy person, and we appreciate any help you 
can give in getting us together to ensure our work is commensurate with his 
expectations.

Thanks,

Julie,

There are many employees in London? who  would be interested.
You can send? an inquiry to Steve  Leppard.

I had a presentation last night
to GARP in Houston and did  a commercial for the book.
You should put me on  commission.

Vince

Please respond to "Julie" <julie@lacimagroup.com>

Vince,

I wasn't sure if I responded to  your email, so apologise either for my
delayed response or repeating  myself.

Thanks for the 2nd order! I believe they have already  been? dispatched.
Yes, I believe we received payment; thank you very  much for? following up
with Paul. Glad the book was a hit!

On  another subject, are there any Enron employees in Europe who may  be
interested in attending either the energy or the weather course? Or,  are
the quants and risk management mostly handled out of  Houston?

Thanks again, and I'll forward an invoice on to  Shirley.

Julie

Julie,

We received the shipment of 50 books.?  Thanks.

The book was an instant hit. We need 50 more?  books.

P.S. I understand Paul sent you the check for  the? remaining  50%

Thanks,   Steve

Steve,

Thanks. I printed the fundamental info
last night and will wait for the open.

I negotiated a few contracts for  Enron's contribution to a book
(Enron was a sponsor).  It's not the same as negotiating as an author.

You can call a friend of mine, John Martin, and he will be able to help you.

Vince,

First, thank you for the get well gift... It was a pleasant suprise.

Its been a fairly rough time here, with the extra complication of having 
pnemonia on top of the Appendisitus. I've spent most of my stay in ICU so 
have reakk slept since Thursday. My breathing has been of highest concern.

Yeserday, I had my tube removed from ny nose, which was very unpleasant but 
long awated!!

I'm off to the OR this moring to have my open wound stiched up and then I'll 
probably be sent to a generall ward.

Thanks again

Steve

Julie,

There are many employees in London  who would be interested.
You can send  an inquiry to Steve Leppard. 

I had a presentation last night
to GARP in Houston and did a commercial for the book.
You should put me on commission.

Vince

Vince,
?
I wasn't sure if I responded to your email, so apologise either for my  
delayed response or repeating myself.
?
Thanks for the 2nd order!? I believe they have already been  dispatched.? 
Yes, I believe we received payment; thank you very much for  following up 
with Paul.? Glad the book was a hit!
?
On another subject, are there any Enron?employees in Europe who may be  
interested in attending either the energy or the weather course?? Or, are  
the quants and risk management mostly handled out of Houston?
?
Thanks again, and I'll forward an invoice on to Shirley.
?
Julie
?
Julie,

We received the shipment of 50 books.  Thanks.

The book was an instant hit. We need 50 more  books.

Vince

P.S. I understand Paul sent you the check for the  remaining 50%

	
	

Hi Jason,
Here's the file.  

Hi Jason,
I've attached an excel file with both sets of prices.  However, the HA Zone 
Price data set appears to be incomplete.  I'm currently looking to complete 
this set and will get back to you shortly on it's progress.  If you prefer 
the data in a different format please let me know.
Thanks,
Maria V.H.  

  

Maria,

Is it possible to get both sets of prices?
We will need to go back as far as we can.

Thanks.
Jason Sokolov

   

Jason,

Are you looking for CalPX hour ahead UMCP or CalPX hour ahead zone prices?  
We have hour ahead zone price data from 10/1/98 - current and hour ahead UMCP 
from 11/6/2000 onward.  
Maria V.H.  

   
	
	

Maria,

I am looking for historical hourly real-time (spot) power prices for CalPX.
Can you help me to locate them?

and miles by enrolling for Hilton Honors online at www.hiltonhhonors.com.  
They also have special hotel rates for London much cheaper than Enron's 
negotiated rates (I just checked with the travel agent).
I am booked on Continental, leaving next Monday evening, and returning Friday

Kim,

I talked to Dale early this morning and suggested that we meet during his 
next trip to Houston
when we decide on timing of our project.

Vince

Vince,

If Dale comes in to see you, it looks like Eric might be available to meet 
with you as well.  It would be a good opportunity for Eric to meet Dale and 
get a little more information on his model.  Eric's phone number is X54713.

Thanks, 

Kim.

Works for me.  Give me a call at 9:30.

Eric, FYI. Kim.

Dale,

Please, call me on Tuesday. My morning schedule is full but I am open in the 
afternoon.

Vince

Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?  If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May
1.)

It seems that NYMEX will not make a decision any time soon
or they rejected Tom. I think the latter is the case.

Tom is looking for a trading or origination job with Enron.
I think that we can use his expertise here.

My associates  are leaving for London tonight (Monday).
They can still interview Howard on Tuesday afternoon.

Vince

Hi Rachel. Please read the following email from my collegue in the UK who 
spoke directly to Howard a bit ago by tele about Wed/Thurs interview.
Can we do this alternative he suggested? We will have to reschedule- maybe 
NY? or after Howards trip in Houston?
Thanks,
Jeff

Hi Jeff,

 I've bad news. Howard is off to New York on Wednesday for 10 days until the
 10th of Feb. Either Enron could fly him to Houston after his holiday or
 maybe Vince's team could get out to New York. Let me know.

Globally there are probably over 80 "competitors" to EOL.  None of these 
competitors have a meaningful market share.  Some of the names that jump to 
mind are the following, but it should be easy to find others by surfing the 
web.  Good luck.

Vince,

19C is available and reserved for 9 am to 10:30, Wednesday.  

Would you like me to try and arrange a tour for the students or should we 
wait until we know more about their interests?  

Are their some other Enron folks you would like to invite for Wednesday?

Dear Vince,

bardzo dziekuje za podeslana literature, szczegolnie drugie wydanie
ksiazki. Bylismy w Londynie w czerwcu zeszlego roku, ale w ksiegarni
znalezlismy tylko piersze wydanie. Obaj z Alkiem (ojcem) wspolpracujemy z
energetyka (glownie Polska) od kilku lat. W zeszlym roku wydalismy ksiazke
"Gielda Energii: Strategie zarzadzania ryzykiem", a obecnie pracujemy nad
jej angielskim wydaniem. Na jaki adres Ci ja przyslac?

Serdeczne pozdrowienia,

Mark Lay:  Again, thank you for listening to my concept.  In my search for 
co-foounder/collaborators and
angel investors, disclosing the concept (for lack of a better title now, I 
call the system "LifeTrak")
and formulating a simple, clear picture is not easy.  The attached schematic 
depicts an overview of the
effort.  Part of the diagram hopes to separate the special interests as 
participants and member
organizations so as to be helpful in the public sector with social issues.  
The groups fall into two
natural sectors;  (1) supply generators; and (2) user/service organizations.  
In the middle is the system
and its management that interconnects those benefiting groups and the 
donor/recipient LifeTrak
cardholders.  I can embellish more on these later.  The diagram gives us a 
place to begin discuss and
talking points in order to try to simplify how the concept could be developed 
and supported and where the
revenue model which creates dramatic efficiencies generates management and 
license fee.  I hope we can
get together soon.  Although Vince Kaminski cannot directly contribute due to 
his other commitments, I
have copied him to keep him advised (hoping that he might be able to do more 
at a later date.).  Best
regards, Al Arfsten

Everyone should read the attached Risk article about calculating def probs 
from CDS quotes. 

Amazingly it is in pretty close agreement with our own methodology for both 
CDS valuation and reverse engineering def probs. The only extension in the 
reverse engineering is that instead of linearly interpolating CDS quotes, 
they propose minimising an error measure based on 'smoothness' of def prob 
curve and difference between model and market prices. 

What is also amazing is the fact that this article has been published in 
Risk, given that it is essentially the same as my credit pricing paper, plus 
one excellent idea. Given extra time, resources and brainpower, there is no 
reason why we shouldn't have similar work published ourselves.

California Timeline: 
February 2nd: 
The state legislature has to pass the enabling laws to let the state pay for 
the electricity from auction before the current emergency money runs out on 
February 2.   Republican leaders have vowed to block any additional emergency 
funds. 
The California courts gave Edison a two-week grace period (until February 2) 
on demands by the California Power Exchange that Edison forfeit $215 million 
in long-term low cost power contracts to the CPX for repayment of its debt.   
Governor Davis told the Court that he may absorb that contract in favor of 
taxpayers using his emergency "taking" powers.
February 7th:
President Bush, who had to intervene personally against his energy secretary 
to extend the Energy Department order mandating electricity sales to 
California by power generators, made it abundantly clear to all sides that 
the two week deadline was hard and would not be extended.
February 13th:
Edison worked out a three-week grace period -- through February 13 -- with 
all of its 32 banks and QFS to prevent from asking for accelerated repayment 
during that period, but if the state has not figured out a way to bridge that 
debt by then, this deadline could be a real trigger for bankruptcy.

Legislation
As mentioned in Tuesday's update, legislators are close to a long-term power 
buying deal with the so-called "green" producers (wind, solar, hydro, cows) 
of energy, accounting for 30% of California's total energy production.   This 
would allow the Department of Water Resources to buy power from them at 8 
cents per kilowatt hour.  

Bill AB1X--the key piece of legislation for setting long-term power 
contracts--is still being mulled over in the Senate, but is expected to pass 
this week.  The keys issues is still the price, which will probably be 
revised in accordance to the results of the auction.  Other legislation has 
been introduced, including three bills by Boxer that would increase federal 
support and impose "windfall profits tax" for wholesalers that sell power at 
"unfair and unreasonable" rates.  The hydro legislation is still being 
bantered about, however with going opposition from both Democrats and 
Republicans.  

Bail out scenarios
A new scenario is a market-oriented solution that would give the state of 
California "warrants" on the PG&E and Edison stock in return for lending them 
the money to get out of this current mess (still the problem of financing the 
$6B vs. $12B).   As the stock prices recovered, the state could cash in the 
warrants and rebate to electricity users some of the emergency surcharge 
needed to pay back the debt.  This is exactly the plan used to bail out 
Chrysler in the late 1970s and it worked wonders for taxpayers then.  This 
senario would also provide Davis with some political cover, as the idea of 
rebates are far more appealing than price increases.  Lots of details remain 
to be worked out, but even the consumer activist groups threatening to create 
propositions on fall ballots appeared to like this deal.  

Bankruptcy
Socal is close to an agreement with 32 bank creditors and QFs to allow a 
forbearance on debt payments through February 13th.  However, it is not 
expected that the bondholders would agree to this type of deal.  The 
bondholders could try to force the utilities into involuntary bankruptcy, but 
would probably be unsuccessful.  As long as Socal continues working with 
their creditors and show "good faith" any bankruptcy at this time would have 
to be voluntary.  As this date (Feb. 13th) fast approaches, the state will 
have to take quick action and draft and approve legislation between the 
governor, the generators and the utilities to prevent Socal and PG&E from 
bankruptcy.    As part of the forbearance agreement, Edison has contracted 
with around 400 QFs and negotiations have been directed toward separating the 
rate schedules of generation facilities fuelled between renewables and gas 
fired generation.  Socal is attempting to shift gas fired QFs to longer term 
schedules in light of the recent higher gas prices. 

Auction
After a nervous night when only one bid had come to the state's Internet site 
by midnight on Tuesday, California officials were happy to announce that they 
had almost 40 bids at an average of 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour, below the 
7.4 cent real cap state officials had set internally as the threshold between 
doable and impossible.  This was well above the 5.5 cent ceiling the governor 
had publicly stated as the preferred level.  Davis will now turn the 
negotiating process over to David Freeman, who heads the Los Angeles electric 
agency and is generally considered the dean of public-private utilities in 
the west.   One thing to note, the State of California has no intention of 
any credit guarantees for the bids with the Department of Water Resources.  
Several California legislators have made it very clear that they do not want 
the state to be ultimately responsible for these power purchases.

Executive Summary:

AB18X is the focal legislative point for the proposed bailout plan, but=20
contains several problems.
Per yesterday's morning report, the bill includes a plan in which the=20
utilities would issue stock warrants in exchange for financial assistance=
=20
from the state.
The bill will be subject to attacks from consumer groups, which will slow i=
ts=20
passage. Timing is crucial because of the February 7th deadline for the FER=
C=20
emergency order and the February 13th deadline for debt forbearance.
The bill also contains little detail about costs.  The cost of the bailout=
=20
cannot be determined until the final auction results are known and the=20
utilities reach a deal with Davis with respect to the share of outstanding=
=20
debt that must be paid by the parent companies of the utilities.
Sources report that Davis will insist  that at least 43 percent of the=20
outstanding PG&E/SoCal debt should be absorbed by the parent corporations.

1. AB18X- The "Bailout" Bill

There are a number of key problems with AB18X.=20

The bill is being presented by its drafters as a "work in progress." The=20
current bill is likely to be significantly different next week after consum=
er=20
groups blast it in committee hearings and in the press.  Also, the fiscal=
=20
effect of the bill is listed as "unknown", because the costs of the long-te=
rm=20
contracts being bid upon in the auction are not yet known.  Moreover, the=
=20
audit of the utilities and its recommendation for the share of utility debt=
=20
to be paid by the state versus the parent companies is not yet finalized (s=
ee=20
below).

The industrial users are unhappy with this bill because they will bear the=
=20
burden of the costs.  Approximately 35% of power customers in CA are=20
residential, and another approximately 10% are commercial or users with=20
emergency status; this means that half or more of all power customers in CA=
=20
will benefit from price controls on their power.  This, in turn, leaves the=
=20
large industrial customers footing the bill.  They are saying that this may=
=20
result in job losses and may even give them incentive to leave the state.

The State of California is talking about issuing revenue bonds to pay off t=
he=20
utilities=01, debt.  There is an important but subtle difference between th=
ese=20
and general obligation bonds, which draw from tax revenues and assets to pa=
y=20
debt.  Revenue bonds draw from the revenue gained from actually using=20
something.  For example, a stadium developer might issue revenue bonds to p=
ay=20
for a new stadium, then make revenue from the team that uses the stadium. =
=20
How will that work in the case of the utilities?  There is no guarantee tha=
t=20
there will be positive revenue to pay back the bonds.=20

California=01,s interruptible power contracts have a 100-hour/year limit.  =
Most=20
of those contracts are at or near that limit and will become firm power=20
contracts.  This removes another option for finding power.

2. The Audit:

Many of the details in AB18X are subject to the results of the audit and th=
e=20
power auction.  Governor Davis has commissioned a study which shows that 43=
=20
percent of the PG&E and SoCal Edison debt is owed to their parent companies=
. =20
He views this as the minimum acceptable percentage that the parent companie=
s=20
should contribute to a bailout.

The companies cannot simply eat the cost of their inter-company debt.  They=
=20
do not have the cash to do so.  The question becomes, if the subsidiaries=
=01,=20
bills are not paid, will they be forced to go into bankruptcy?

3. The Auction:

As told by us to some of you yesterday afternoon and as reported by the Wal=
l=20
Street Journal this morning, the low bids that have been announced from=20
Wednesday=01,s auction are based on off-peak power.  This is why they are s=
o=20
low.  It is estimated that if Davis were to include off-peak power, the bid=
s=20
would be closer to 9.5 cents per kilowatt hour. =20

Governor Davis is not disclosing the "true bid price" because to do so woul=
d=20
not be "in the public interest."  While they legally can keep the auction=
=20
terms secret, this makes an excellent bluff to try to get other power=20
providers to bid lower for peak power.

Since the real cost of power is higher than the auction price is making it=
=20
appear, this means that there may actually be little or no margin between=
=20
where the state buys power and where the utilities sell it.  No margin woul=
d=20
mean no funds to pay down utility debt.

4. The Rest of the West

The federal order for other states to supply CA with power requires Oregon=
=20
and Washington to draw down their own reservoirs.  The people of OR and WA=
=20
are understandably upset about this.  It is not clear how much longer this=
=20
can continue, as reservoir levels continue to drop.

The problem is the drought impacting the entire Northwest is not getting an=
y=20
better even as Washington and Oregon hydroelectric plants dump water throug=
h=20
their dams to keep the lights on this winter. Officials in these states are=
=20
now bracing for electricity surcharges that could hit 50% by mid-summer and=
=20
increase the casualties on the dot-com laden killing field.  Cities from=20
Seattle to Tacoma and beyond are already passing legislation that scales in=
=20
electricity surcharges that high and more. Seattle raised prices by 10% the=
=20
first of January, with a further, emergency 18% increase is set to pass the=
=20
city council on Monday. And city political officials warn that another 25%=
=20
increase would be in effect by mid-summer -- unless the federal government=
=20
agrees to plans by the western governors to request an emergency price cap=
=20
for the summer.

Although the Clinton administration and Bush administration steadfastly=20
refused to impose such a price cap when Governor Davis requested it many=20
times in the last month, western governors told our sources that they hope=
=20
the political and economic considerations will change by late spring.=20
"Although FERC head Hebert is a free-market freak," one government official=
=20
told our sources, "this is very different than the price cap request=20
California made. First, you could legitimately say California's problems st=
em=20
from their screwed up de-regulation plan. But the west's problems this summ=
er=20
stem from a drought, and that is significantly different. Second, the Bush=
=20
administration may want to punish Davis with thoughts of 2004 presidential=
=20
politics in their head, but that will not apply to all of us across the=20
Northwest and Southwest. We have a lot of Republicans on the hook here.=20
Third, even if you think damage to the US economy from California's trouble=
s=20
won't be that great, the damage of 50% energy surcharges rolling across the=
=20
entire western United States from Arizona to Washington has to get Bush's -=
-=20
or at least Cheney's -- attention."

There is almost no snowpack in most of the northwest, according to these=20
officials, so the usual rebuilding of water reserves necessary to generate=
=20
electricity will not occur. Add to that the fact Northwest dams are being r=
un=20
harder than usual to keep up with the maxed-out energy demands across the=
=20
west ,and you have the makings of a mid-summer economic disaster. "The=20
reservoir behind Grand Coulee dam (the country's largest) is dropping at a=
=20
foot a day since New Year's and there is no sign of that slowing," one=20
official told our sources.

Rabi,

You and Tanya  should go ahead with the course you have already registered 
for.
I have just mentioned it  FYI.

I don't see too many problems  with the  course Stinson

Vince,
Tanya and I are registered for the offsite (Productivity Point) Java Class 
(Feb12-16).   Before I go ahead and try to cancel the reservation, I need 
some guidance from you (and/or Tanya) in light of the following issues:

1.  Do you really want 15 people from the same group be unavailable at the 
same time?  

2.  Enron gets 30% discount from  the list price ($2125) of the Productivity 
Point Java class.  Hence cost difference is $500 per person and not $1100 as 
originally thought. 

3.  Contents of the in-house class can be be tailored to match the skill  
level of a more homegenous group.  

Plese advise.  Thanks,

Rabi

Stinson,

Makes perfect sense. Per head cost is much lower.
We shall have enough candidates.

Vince

Stinson Gibner

Vince,

Since a number of individuals in the group are interested in Java training,   
I checked to see what an internal course would cost.   We can have an 
internal class for up to 15 people for a fee of $15k.    Clayton Vernon also 
indicated that we might be able to share some of the cost with his group.   
It seems that anyone dealing with VAR or EOL is likely to need some Java 
skills, so I think it would be a good investment.

--Stinson

Stinson,
?
Thank you very much for considering us to  do your
Java training.? I just saw Venkat's  email to you, after
we spoke.? We would be glad to do the  Java course 
for you.
?
Attached with this email is our course  outline for 
Object-Oriented Programming in Java  course.
?
The Java course is 40 hours in  duration.? The course
cost is $15,000.? You can have a  maximum of 15 students
in this course.
?
Venkat is an excellent  teacher.?? Besides teaching at
Rice and UH, Venkat actively teaches Java  related courses
for leading companies like BMC Software,  BindView, Baker
Hughes, Schlumberger Geoquest,  etc.
?
Please feel free to reach me if you have  any further questions.

I look forward to hearing from  you.

This is good!

 Vice  Presidential  candidate  Sen. Joseph Lieberman recently
 asked  the question, "What will we tell our children if every
 vote is not counted?"

 Here is the response of one citizen:

 "As  a  former  teacher,  I  have  been  concerned  about Joe
 Lieberman's  question,  "What  will  we  tell  our children?"
 What  we  should, and must, tell our children is that if they
 fail  to  mark the right answer on an exam, or do not fill in
 the  entire test, they will not get credit for their answers.
 If they do it often enough and if they do not ask for help or
 read the directions properly, they will fail.

 We  should  tell  them  that  when they are older and move to
 Florida,  they  must  fully read their ballot and remove the
 entire chad and not keep an entire nation waiting because of
 their mistakes.

 We  must also tell them to read and read well, to play by the
 rules and expect a favorable outcome.

 Teaching them to make excuses for their mistakes has led to a
 society of victims unable to take responsibility.

Amen and Amen!

Al,

Thanks for the update. I hope that you and Mark 
will come up with a good plan of attack.

I can only regret that my workload does not allow me to participate

   Mark Lay:  I shared confidentially with Vince Kaminski my developing
   concept of a highly inefficient not-for-profit enterprise with
   dramatically increasing costs.  I believe that a for-profit economic

   ultimately lower the commodity thereby having a national, if not, global
   impact of health care costs.   Vince seems to also believe in the
   concepts potential.  The CEO of one of the biggest U.S. blood banks has

I can reserve 2 to 2:30 time slot  but there  is really not much that
I can tell you at this point.

towards the test of the package.  As soon as they will decide
to move ahead, we (Research) shall be involved, helping to evaluate the 
product. As I have  said, we are not the 
decision makers in this case.

Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through
license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?
If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message
on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with
the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our
power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May
1.)

I would like to apologize for the confusion regarding Anshuman.
We have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his
trip to Houston and there was a lot of confusion
regarding the terms (given that I was talking to Sandeep
every few days).

Currently, we expect Anshuman to come   to Houston for one month
to work on the DPC  project (at Jeff Shankman's request). The lawyers advised
me that we need an L1  visa  for him, irrespective of the duration
of  his stay.

I have detected a tendency to implement different

approaches to valuation in the past.

To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal

rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques

which, in turn, reflects,  the turf wars and the desire by the

originators to control the outcomes.

Vince

stevestock@pagenetips.com on 01/19/2001 06:53:14 PM

Vince,

I'd like an opportunity to talk to you about valuation.

I'm hearing confusing messages about the way that the UK IT team and the UK

traders get their Valuation code aparently signed off by Research, while

here... You provide it for our guys to wrap up.

We have now a situation where the UK team are using a home grown Valuation

piece called DOVE, where results differ from those of the equivalent USA

portcalc.

I need to break through the pride barriers and the "not built here"

syndrome, and try to do the right thing, but I don't beleive I can do that

without you guidance.

I'm scared that if we diverge too much we will never work globally on these

systems.

Molly,

Thanks for the update. Two points.

Please, let Neil McGregor know that many possible proposals were floated
with regard to Anshuman and there was some noise in the system.
We need L1 visa anyway and we decided to go ahead an arrange it.
I shall also write to him and explain the confusion.

Also, if I have the choice between upsetting Neil or Jeffs (Shankman and 
Skilling),
I shall choose Neil.

Vince

   

Vince:  Apparently Neil McGregor became upset when he received Margaret 
Daffin's email.    He is saying, however, that Anshuman will only be in 
Houston for one month, and you had mentioned six months when we spoke 
earlier.   It really doesn't make any difference since he will need to get an 
L1 visa under either circumstance, but I thought you might want to see his 
email.

Molly,

We want to hire this very bright young man as a part-time employee,
reporting to Mike Roberts. Mike will be contacting you regarding the details.

Vince

Gentlemen,

Thank you for your time and consideration yesterday.  I am excited about
working for Enron and gladly accept your offer.

To reiterate our consensus today, I will be working an average of 10 hours a
week, mostly early mornings from around 5 to 7.  Another option for me might
be to work Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from around 5 to 8 or 9.

Toni Graham was my contact in HR six months ago.  She is probably more
familiar with my previous file than anyone else.  If you have any questions
or concerns please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thank you,
Chris Pernoud

Dear Mr. Kaminski,
?
I was one of the participants of the SIAM Conference which was held last 
week-end, and I have very much enjoyed your presentation. At the end of the 
session, I was hoping to talk to you, but unfortunately you were already 
gone. You said that if we were interested, you could e-mail a copy of your 
talk. I would appreciate if you could send a copy to this e-mail address.
?
I am a mathematics Ph.D. student at Texas A&M University and I will be 
graduating this August. I am very much interested in working in the modeling 
of energy markets. Can you please tell me whom I should send my resume, and 
who I should contact in your company about a possible position in your 
research group.
?
Thank you for your time.

I have detected a tendency to implement different

To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal

rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques

which, in turn, reflects,  the turf wars and the desire by the

originators to control the outcomes.

Vince,

I'd like an opportunity to talk to you about valuation.

I'm hearing confusing messages about the way that the UK IT team and the UK

traders get their Valuation code aparently signed off by Research, while

here... You provide it for our guys to wrap up.

We have now a situation where the UK team are using a home grown Valuation

piece called DOVE, where results differ from those of the equivalent USA

portcalc.

I need to break through the pride barriers and the "not built here"

syndrome, and try to do the right thing, but I don't beleive I can do that

without you guidance.

I'm scared that if we diverge too much we will never work globally on these

systems.

Steve,

Sign-off from the Research Group is something that requires defining formal
rules going forward.

My concern over the last few years was that we were asked on many occasions
to sign - off on partial results of valuation, without the benefits of a full 
picture.
Sometimes, we were asked to sign-off on trade ideas, over which we have no
control long-term.

I shall talk to Rick Buy and David Port about setting up more formal rules
for the Research sign-off.

Vince

Steven Leppard
01/24/2001 03:42 AM
Hi Sharad

I note from our discussion earlier this morning that you've been asked to 
sign off a calculation from another group, which is something we're asked to 
do from time to time.

I take the view that we in Research can assess a computation in terms of what 
it achieves with respect to its requirements, what its shortfalls are, and 
therefore what the risks associated with using this method are.  We cannot 
provide an opinion on whether these risks are acceptable to Enron, which I 
feel falls firmly within RAC territory.

This then raises the question of can Research sign off anything for other 
groups after all?  To "sign off" means to accept something, which our opinion 
in itself cannot do.  It is most appropriate for us to provide a technical 
note outlining the methodology, risks and shortcomings of a method, leaving 
the formal "sign off" to those best placed to assess these risks for our 
company.  The alternative is for multiple groups each to have their own view 
on what is acceptable risk for the company.

Steve

Debbie,

This is an update on the continuing Winston saga. Tanya
identified the sections of the code that produce inefficiencies
but the rest is in the Winston's hands.

Steve Stock is very cooperative and takes a very rational, Enron-first
approach to the problem. Privately, my concern is that the code, based on 
Tanya's
report to me, leaves a lot to be desired. The code tends to be a very 
mechanical
implementation of the algorithm, developed without a series attempt to 
optimize it.

Let's keep paddling along.

Vince

	

Vince,

...just to keep you in the loop on the Tanya / Winston issue...

regards

Steve

Tanya,

I just checked in with the contractors here.....and it looks like it might be 
a good idea for you to spend about 30minutes with them to give you a guided 
tour of their documentation.

It's presented as a linked set of word documents and Visio drawing, with 
links to all the reletive parts as hyperlinks. It's pretty good and I imagine 
it will be very usefull to you, but probably requires a little introduction 
first.

Please feel free to come to my office whenever it is convenient. Even if I'm 
not available, the guys are just outside my office and I can easily stop 
whatever I'm doing to introduce you to the project manager.

regards

Steve

Steve,
- we spent about 5 fruitful hours with Winston last week.
- I pretty much understand the data flow when the code runs.
- I also got an idea where the time is spent during the execution of the code 
by questioning Winston.
I did not see any results of profiling the code. Winston's opinion is (as I 
understood) that he knows how much time is spent 
on different calculations and profiling is not easy to do, so we don't need 
to do it. 
- Based on above I suggested possible way to reduce the time credit model 
takes to run and we discussed it with Debbie, who was
going to arrange a meeting with Winston.
- It might be useful to look at the Documentation created by contractors, if 
you have it handy - send it to me, please.

Thank you,

Tanya.

Tanya,

how's it going with code-review from your perspective?

...did you manage to talk to our Documentation contractors?

...if not, would you me to arrange for them to bring you the documentation as 
it currently stands?

There will be a Trader's Roundtable meeting every Tuesday at 4:00PM in 
EB3321.  

First Message that was sent out:
As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 16 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

Steve,

Please, let  me know when you come back.
I have detected a tendency to implement different
approaches to valuation in the past.

To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal 
rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques
which, in turn, reflects,  the turf wars and the desire by the 
originators to control the outcomes.

Vince

stevestock@pagenetips.com on 01/19/2001 06:53:14 PM
Vince,

I'd like an opportunity to talk to you about valuation.

I'm hearing confusing messages about the way that the UK IT team and the UK 
traders get their Valuation code aparently signed off by Research, while 
here... You provide it for our guys to wrap up.

We have now a situation where the UK team are using a home grown Valuation 
piece called DOVE, where results differ from those of the equivalent USA 
portcalc.

I need to break through the pride barriers and the "not built here" syndrome, 
and try to do the right thing, but I don't beleive I can do that without you 
guidance.

I'm scared that if we diverge too much we will never work globally on these 
systems.

Steve

I am sending you an Excel spreadsheet with proposed

I have slightly exceeded the merit quota.
The equity increases address two issues: retention and
and an error in setting a salary at hiring (I tend to be too stingy).

Dear faculty

Bob Westbrook and the accounting group has asked me to put together a
continuing series of research workshops in accounting. My intention is to
invite four or five researchers from around the country to present
workshops on topics of interest each year. These are in addition to the
normal recruiting seminars that we will have. The researchers will be a
combination of senior and junior researchers. In addition to adding to our
own research culture, the seminars should help promote the Jones School in
the academic accounting community.

My intention is to invite people that are doing very interesting work that
will be of interest to a large portion of the faculty. Given the small size
of the accounting group, success of the seminars is dependent in part on
the participation of faculty from other disciplines.

Our first seminar will be on February 16  from 10:30-12:00 and will be
conducted by Elizabeth Demers, a Stanford PhD and presently an assistant
professor at Rochester.  Her paper is titled " A Rude Awakening: Internet
Shakeout in 2000" and co-authored with Baruch Lev ( a senior accounting
researcher at NYU).

The work should be of particular interest to faculty in Finance and those
interested in the valuation of internet companies and the value of
intellectual capital and non financial information. I expect that it will
be a very interesting seminar. Liz will arrive Thursday late afternoon and
be here all day on Friday. I invite any of you who would like to meet with
her or join us for a meal, to please let me know.

I will appreciate it if you could plan on attending at least some of our
seminars. I hope that the topics and presenters will be of interest.

Thanks for your support.

Vince,

This is my latest effort and I would appreciate your thoughts.  I know that
we haven't written together before so let me assure me that you will not
hurt my feelings by "slashing away" with a red pen.  I think that I have
put all the clay on the table for this piece of sculpture but it is still
pretty crude.  Help me "refine" the work to create something we can both be
very proud of.

By the way, I know you are extremely busy right now so don't feel pressured
to spend lots of time here.  Any guidance you can offer will be
appreciated.  I don't know what the editor's time schedule is but he asked
me to send him a draft on Monday.  You and I will still be able to edit the
manuscript but he will begin reading and editing it too.  I'll let you know
as soon as I have a final deadline.

Your friend,

John

p.s. Hope life is a bit calmer for you.  By the way, I'm reading an
interesting book entitled "The Four Agreements" by Miguel Ruiz that
documents the Toltec philosophy of life in the context of the dreams of
reality that we all create.  You might enjoy it.

Molly,

Thanks.
Let's wait for Sandeep: he comes back Wednesday.
Anshuman will work with him.

Once again, Margaret, we are in your debt.   Vince, let's get together some 
time next week and see where you would like us to go with this...

Molly

Margaret Daffin
01/19/2001 03:27 PM
Molly:  just to be sure that everyone understands, Anshuman cannot work in 
the US on a B1 visa - he can only come here for business meetings and 
training.

We will have to get him the L1 visa in order for him to work in the US.

Margaret

   

Thank you so much for the information, Vince.   I hope that you have a great 
weekend!

Molly

Vince J Kaminski
01/19/2001 02:39 PM
Molly,

I shall ask Sandeep to do it when he comes back from India next week.
I have just learned that Anshuman has B1 visa and he can start on a project 
as a person
delegated by Dhabol Power Company to Houston. To be absolutely above the line,
I would still arrange the L1 visa.

Vince

   

I agree that it makes sense to put the L1 in place.  There are several things 
we will need from you in order to start the visa process.   The first is a 
fairly detailed job description for Anshuman.  Secondly, we also need to know 
whether or not he will be in a managerial position here and/or managing a 
project.     If there is someone else in your group who can furnish this job 
description, just let me know and I will be happy to contact him/her.  

As for Sandeep, I have been told that he is a U.S. resident so there should 
be no problems with him.   Margaret Daffin will be contacting him to be 
absolutely sure.

Thanks,
Molly

Vince J Kaminski
01/19/2001 10:21 AM
Molly,

Let's get L1 for Anshuman, just in case. I am sure he will stay here for a 
while
once  he comes. It is quite obvious Jeff Shankman will have to keep him 
longer,
given the priority of the project.

I assume there are no problems with Sandeep.

Thanks.

Vince

   

Thank you for the update, Vince.  I have been working with Margaret Daffin 
with regard to Anshuman's visa status.   We will have to get an L1 visa in 
place before he can come to the United States, even in a temporary 
capacity.    Do you  want to move forward with that effort at this time, or 
is the possibility of him coming to the U.S. so remote that it wouldn't be 
worth the time and money right now?

Molly

Vince J Kaminski
01/19/2001 09:42 AM
Molly,

This is an update on Anshuman. Please, see below. It seems
that his transfer is not an issue for the time being.

We can put it on a back-burner till he gets here. 

Vince

P.S. The relevant section.

I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such 
a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to 
Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize that 
before I leave.  I will call you in the evening to just chat.

Sandeep Kohli@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

Vince,

Just wanted to let you know that I had a meeting with Wade Cline (COO, Enron 
India), Neil McGregor (President, DPC), and Mohan Gurunath (CFO, DPC) today.  
Though I had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your 
group, today it became official, and all of them supported the move.  I 
explained to them what we would be doing, and the results expected from the 
Henwood study.

DPC would like to pay the costs for the study, and that was mentioned.  There 
maybe some tax issues etc. that need to be cleared, and other related issues 
that I would like to discuss with you, so I will leave them till I get to 
Houston.

I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such 
a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to

I am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have.  Things here 
have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks.  Morale is quite down 
due to many lay-offs.

I am really looking forward to returning to Houston, and the family!!

Regards,

Norma,

It seems that there is a bug in the system. I made an error  mixing equity and
merit raises in one column. The system does not allow me to correct the 
mistake by
moving the entries from one column to another. I can enter the changes, but
after I save them the system  reverts to original  designations.

As a result, the columns contain mixed entries related to merit and equity 
raises.
The column totals are misleading.

I am taking a CSV version home to continue making adjustments.
I shall work at home Monday (281 367 5377).

Kim,  

After yestersday's meeting, I've come up with an idea which is applicable to 
the zone EF and
seems also to be applicable to the broader area. The model assumes that if 
there are positive spreads of energy
products between pairs of locations, we can always find the possibilities of 
swaptions. This assumption, as 
discussed with Jim and Sean, is a reasonable approximation. I suggest that 
the prototype be built up at this
model if you think that it is rational.  If you interested in the model, I 
will explain it to all of you. 

Best regards,

Vince:

I have come up for air since the holiday and all the machinations that have
befallen the California power markets.  Great for consultants and
independent generators and inbound FT owners but not perhaps so great for
others.  Lots of entropy in the system indeed!

I plan to be in Houston next week from Tuesday through Friday and would like
very much to get 1/2 hour of your time to kick off the demonstration project
I proposed just before Christmas if you are ready.  We are ready to provide
the top quality service that will be needed to give you and your gas guys
the concerted demonstration project you wanted.  I would prefer any time
Friday 1/26 or Wednesday 1/24 first thing in the morning if you have
flexibility.

We were able over the holiday to really make a lot of progress on finalizing
all of our fundamental modeling technologies--short and long run gas and
short and long run electricity.  I am really jacked up how our long run
models are predicting the amount of capacity that can profitably be absorbed
in ERCOT and where, the amount of capacity that can profitably be absosrbed
in California and the WSCC and where, and where gas price basis is likely to
go.  As you saw, our long run capacity addition technique is quite unique,
and I have not yet introduced the long run electric and gas models broadly
in the industry.  It is possible and realistic for Enron to get first mover
advantage (or perhaps more) based on the results of the demonstration
project we discussed.  Let's talk about that next week when we meet.

If you could confirm one of the two suggested times via email or phone at
650.218.3069 in the next day or two, that would be terrific.  I look forward
to seeing you again and to working together.

Also, I would like to get your advice regarding prospective investors in
MarketPoint.  I am starting to get serious inquiries from large companies
you know well who want to invest in MarketPoint as an equity paly, but I am
very reluctant to consider such investments by organizations other than
absolute, unequivocal industry leaders such as Enron.  I remember discussing
this briefly with you, but I would like to get your input with the benefit
of six more months thought if you would be willing when we meet.

Thanks, and all the best.

See below for more information on the Willis analytic product.  I will 
provide the brochure when it arrives and we can discuss scheduling the 
proposed meeting. 
Jim,

1. I can confirm that CHARM does express traditional exposures in a VAR
format.  One of the beauties of CHARM is that it expresses any quantifiable
exposure in a VAR format, i.e. financial, insurance, weather risks.  In
addition, it has the capability of incorporating correlations between risks
- to the extent that they can be quantified.

2.  To get the ball rolling, I will send you a broschure of CHARM this
week. I also suggest a conference call with Carl Groth of our NY office.
Carl knows CHARM well and my thought is that we can give you some more
ideas of this product in order for you to decide whether or not you would

I am a very good customer of your group.

Hi, Vince,

This is Li, writing from U. of Chicago.
I am in the second quarter here.
The study and social life is extremely busy at the school.
But I enjoy connecting the knowledge I learn everyday here
with the experience I had with Enron.

A schoolmate of mine, a Chicago Ph.D. candidate in finance,
is looking for an internship for the coming summer.
I recommend him to write to you to see if you are interested in
or if there is a need. If so, you can contact with him directly.
He is a really bright guy. If not, hope you don't mind that
I sell Enron at school so hard.

Again, thanks for all the help you gave me.
Have a good new year.

Li

P.S.: Cover letter below and resume attached.

Dear Dr. Vince Kaminski,

I am a Ph.D. student in Finance at the University of Chicago GSB who =
hopes to find a summer internship at Enron of 2001 (between June and =
September). I heard your group from my friend Li, who worked at Enron =
for 3 year. She spoke highly of you. If it's okay, I am primarily =
interested in Risk management.
At the University of Chicago, I will have completed all the Ph.D. =
courses in the area of finance by the end of the first year. As normally =
it takes two years to finish the required finance courses, I decided to =
take all the finance courses in the first year. In the fall quarter, I =
already took Empirical Asset Pricing and Theoretical Asset Pricing and =
did very well. In the winter quarter, I will be taking Corporate =
Finance, Continuous Time Finance and Behavioral Finance. I am exposed to =
all fields of finance. Prior to coming to Chicago, I received a Master's =
degree in Economics at Washington University in Saint Louis where I =
acquired skills in economic analysis. I also have a strong background in =
statistics and mathematics. This makes me believe that I have acquired =
the ability to do financial research.

Prior to coming to the United State, I was an outstanding graduate from =
Beijing University, China. I was the founder and President of Beijng =
Univeristy Society of Oceanology. I also organized a research jouney in =
the round-the-Bo-Sea Economic Region. These experience helped to hone my =
communication and interpersonal skills.

As illustrated above, my skills and expertise are ideally suited for =
financial research. My resume is enclosed. In the event that you think =
an interview is in need, my time is very flexible. Your assistance is =
appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

Vince, Berney asked me to send you a copy of our spread option models.  The 
first is a more detailed spread option model created by Jim Simpson 
(currently in the Chicago office), the second is a simplified version of 
Simpson's model that I put together for less complicated tolling structures.  
Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss.

Molly,

I shall ask Sandeep to do it when he comes back from India next week.
I have just learned that Anshuman has B1 visa and he can start on a project 
as a person
delegated by Dhabol Power Company to Houston. To be absolutely above the line,
I would still arrange the L1 visa.

Vince

   

I agree that it makes sense to put the L1 in place.  There are several things 
we will need from you in order to start the visa process.   The first is a 
fairly detailed job description for Anshuman.  Secondly, we also need to know 
whether or not he will be in a managerial position here and/or managing a 
project.     If there is someone else in your group who can furnish this job 
description, just let me know and I will be happy to contact him/her.  

As for Sandeep, I have been told that he is a U.S. resident so there should 
be no problems with him.   Margaret Daffin will be contacting him to be 
absolutely sure.

Thanks,
Molly

Vince J Kaminski
01/19/2001 10:21 AM
Molly,

Let's get L1 for Anshuman, just in case. I am sure he will stay here for a 
while
once  he comes. It is quite obvious Jeff Shankman will have to keep him 
longer,
given the priority of the project.

I assume there are no problems with Sandeep.

Thanks.

Vince

   

Thank you for the update, Vince.  I have been working with Margaret Daffin 
with regard to Anshuman's visa status.   We will have to get an L1 visa in 
place before he can come to the United States, even in a temporary 
capacity.    Do you  want to move forward with that effort at this time, or 
is the possibility of him coming to the U.S. so remote that it wouldn't be 
worth the time and money right now?

This is an update on Anshuman. Please, see below. It seems
that his transfer is not an issue for the time being.

We can put it on a back-burner till he gets here. 

Vince

P.S. The relevant section.

I also spoke about Anshuman, and there was resistance to his leaing for such 
a long time.  However, I have agreement from folks here to send him to 
Houston for a shorter stint on DPC budget.  I will try to finalize that 
before I leave.  I will call you in the evening to just chat.

Vince,

Just wanted to let you know that I had a meeting with Wade Cline (COO, Enron 
India), Neil McGregor (President, DPC), and Mohan Gurunath (CFO, DPC) today.  
Though I had already spoken to all of them earlier about my joining your 
group, today it became official, and all of them supported the move.  I 
explained to them what we would be doing, and the results expected from the 
Henwood study.

DPC would like to pay the costs for the study, and that was mentioned.  There 
maybe some tax issues etc. that need to be cleared, and other related issues 
that I would like to discuss with you, so I will leave them till I get to 
Houston.

I am very thankful to you for giving the opportunity you have.  Things here 
have deteriorated dramatically over the last few weeks.  Morale is quite down 
due to many lay-offs.

I am really looking forward to returning to Houston, and the family!!

Tracy,
Break it down into 8000 files of 1 kB, and send each one in a separate

Just kidding!
Try to send the whole thing.
If one of the servers refuses to accept it, then break it down into several
pieces.
I know for sure that I can take files as large as 2MB.

Dave Delaney called an hour ago. He needed a statistic from EOL that the EOL 
folks couldn't give him (it seems they had a database problem in 1999), and 
the grapevine had it we had the data. Tom Barkley was able to give him the 
data he needed for his presentation, within a matter of 10 minutes or so.

Please, take a look at the resume of Howard Haughton. He looks like an answer 
to your prayers.
It's the first attachment.

Vince

P.S. Jeff, the headhunter, can be reached at (949) 813 2241. Please, set up 
the interview,
if interested, through him.

Hi Vince and Molly.
Here attached is one candidate who is particularly interested in having his 
profile sent to Vince...he is going to be traveling to NY from the UK soon 
for 2 wks.
He specifically asked my partner at RobertWalters in the UK to investigate 
Enron through my new relationship with you guys. He would be Howard Haughton, 
attached below (CV).

The other 2 resumes are my students at the University of Michigan. Howard Lin 
received a 4.0/4.0 for his last term and will be willing to do whatever it 
takes to intern at Enron for June- Aug. I have his picture included as well. 
The second is Sung, they are friends. Howy will be done expected in May 2001 
and Sung in May 2002. They are my favorite interns and I expect they can be 
cultivated to the Enron culture with no real cost to you (a "test drive 
before committal. I have agreed to represent them and
shall take ownership, as they become graduate candidates upon their degree 
completion.

I hope these attachment can represent my value and commitment to quality of 
talent to Enron.

Thank you for your acceptance.
Best wishes for the weekend.
Jeff

Jeff,

Please, take a look at the resume I got from my friend.

Vince

P.S. what follows is a copy of his message to me:

Dear Vincent,

I very much would like to ask you for a career advice. I am looking for new
challenges and new professional opportunities. Possibly there would be such
opportunity around yourself  at Enron Corporation.

I trust that my strongest asset is my intellectual capital and ability to
look from new angles into complex issues. Beside of the experience of
working under Jacob Goldfield an Paul Jacobson at Goldman on the interest
rate swaps and proprietary desks, I was a part of research effort of John
Meriwether group at Salomon Brothers, I headed the European interest options
desk at DKBI in London and I have managed a small hedge fund in partnership
with Albert Friedberg.

 I hold Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT and I have studied under Nobel
Laureate in Economics, Bob Merton.

I very much would like to apply my knowledge of capital markets, trading and
research in the field of energy markets.

With my very best regards and personal wishes,

This is another student (this time from Chicago) I would be glad to take into 
the group
as an intern. The resume is attached at the bottom of this message.

Hi, Vince,

This is Li, writing from U. of Chicago.
I am in the second quarter here.
The study and social life is extremely busy at the school.
But I enjoy connecting the knowledge I learn everyday here
with the experience I had with Enron.

A schoolmate of mine, a Chicago Ph.D. candidate in finance,
is looking for an internship for the coming summer.
I recommend him to write to you to see if you are interested in
or if there is a need. If so, you can contact with him directly.
He is a really bright guy. If not, hope you don't mind that
I sell Enron at school so hard.

Again, thanks for all the help you gave me.
Have a good new year.

Li

P.S.: Cover letter below and resume attached.

At the University of Chicago, I will have completed all the Ph.D. =

all fields of finance. Prior to coming to Chicago, I received a Master's =

Will you check with Vince on the support schedule for me?  I need to get the 
support to the BUs in order to get them to agree on the 2001 billing.  If you 
have any questions, call me.  Thanx.

We spoke prior to the holiday and you were working on a list on support names 
and projects that Research is working on for various BUs.  Can you tell me 
how you are doing on that?  Sarah Brown, my manager, had a meeting with Corp 
and they are disputing the billing we are proposing to bill to them ($1.9M).  
Their argument is that they are going to bill ENA back anyway; therefore, 
they have agreed to take 40% of the amount we intented to bill them in 2001, 
which is approximately $760K.  If you have any questions, please call.  Thanx.

Kristin,

I shall be tied up with the Wharton group all day Friday.
I am forwarding the message to some members
of the Research Group. I hope some of them will be available.

Vince

P.S. To the Research Group. Can you, please, help Kristin?

   

Okay group it is Tuesday and we have heard from no volunteers.  We only need 
30 minutes of your time.  Is any one available on this Friday to interview?

Please Help!

Kristin

   
	
	

We have one last group of candidates coming in for final round interviews on 
Friday, January 19th. We need Interviewers for half a day (9:00 am to 11:15 
am). Please let me know if you can be available for the entire morning or 
what times you could be available:

9:00 am - 9:30
9:35 am - 10:05
10:10 am - 10:40

Christie:

As our Tiger Team prepares to head out to Houston, we wanted to give you
an idea of some people we hope to meet with on Friday. Ideally, we would
like to start out the day with a quick meeting with Vince Kaminski so
that we can clarify his goals for our project. Here is the list of
additional energy contacts we would like to meet, along with a few
specific questions and/or subject areas:

* EnronOnline Representative: We would like to know the history of
EnronOnline, where it is headed, what new industries are being targeted
and what criteria is used in identifying a target industry. We also
would like to talk about the overall vision of EnronOnline.
* Wholesale Energy Representative: What percentage of Enron's
wholesale energy trading is done online? What are existing platforms,
online or other, and has Enron's business shifted from one platform to
another over the past two years? The past year? What new electronic
platforms are emerging? Mobile platforms? What percentage of energy does
the average Enron customer buy through Enron?
* Energy Marketing Representative: How does Enron market itself,
online and across other platforms? What are competitors, such as ICE,
doing? What percentage of energy does the average Enron customer buy
through Enron?
* Energy Trader:  We are interested in seeing a demonstration of
EnronOnline and/or other electronic systems that traders regularly use
(initiate, process and complete trade). We need a trader's perspective
as to his or her's perceived advantages/disadvantages of Enron's
electronic trading platforms and systems over competitors. Does the
trader have any insights on applications of mobile or other emerging
technologies?
* Energy Information Technology Representative: What are all the
electronic platforms being used by Enron? What platforms are being
developed? How does Enron technology stack up to the competition? What
innovations, if any, have Enron competitors developed that may be worth
integrating?

We also have some business development and strategic questions, but we
are not sure who would best answer them. Specifically,  we would like to
know more about how Enron manages its energy relationships and handles
contracting with suppliers and wholesale energy buyers?

Please feel free to re-arrange these questions so that they fit the
appropriate people. If possible, we would greatly appreciate it if we
could have a list of whom we will be meeting with, as well as additional
contacts whom we can reach once we return to Philadelphia.

Thank you for your assistance. We look forward to seeing you Thursday
(and dining at Churrasco's).

Regards,

Enron Tiger Team #1

information about Enron.

     I have signed the letter and returned it to you, along with a couple of

Vince/Kim:

I am flying to Houston tonight and wondered if it would fit one or both of
your schedules to get together this coming Tuesday sometime for 1/2 hour or
so.  I really want to reinitiate the conversations MarketPoint was having
with John Goodpasture and you, and he said either or both of you were the
right people to continue after his responsibility shift.  John was quite
positive about the idea of Enron acquiring MarketPoint NARG through license,
and he implied that one or both of you would be carrying the ball in that
direction after he handed it to you.

Would this coming Tuesday morning at 930 am be a good time for you guys?  If
so, please give me an email shout at the above address or leave a message on
my voicemail at (650)218-3069.  I think you will be truly impressed with the
scope and progress we have been able to make with both the short run NARG
and the long run NARG in which you were interested (not to mention our power
model).  The progress is noticeable since you saw it.  Both long and short
term NARG are having quite an impact on a number of gas decisions at the
moment ranging from Venezuelan LNG, North American LNG import terminals and
term, gas basis calculations, trading support, power plant development,
gas-to-power price spreads in key markets, veracity of heat rate trades,
bank financings, storage field evaluation, and which new pipelines we can
expect to see enter and which are dogs.

I really hope we can fit it in and get our discussions moving in a mutually
productive direction again.  I think NARG can help you become even more
successful, and I look forward to working with you.

We have a new office address and new phone number as well.  (We move in May
1.)

Hi Kim,

I don't see any problem. For the time being, he can keep his desk on the 19th 
floor as
well ( and the same phone number). It will be helpful when he has to work 
closely with Krishna

At some point, as we hire more people and run out of space, we can move him

Hi Vince!  

I hope you and a nice Christmas and New Year!  It's nice to be back and in 
the full swing of the new year.  

I have a question for you.  I spoke with Krishna prior to him leaving for 
India about the possibility of moving Youyi up to our floor so that we can 
work closer with him.  Krishna thought that this would be a good idea.   It 
would be great to have Youyi with us soon so that he will be intimately 
involved with the whole approach of our prototype model.  Although Krishna 
will be back at the end of the month, would you mind if I speak with Youyi 
and begin the paperwork for moving him onto our floor?  I'm not sure if 
Krishna has mentioned this to Youyi yet.  I did not want to surprise anyone 
and wanted to run this by you or Krishna for final approval.  

Many thanks, Kim.

See you Saturday!

Absolutely. This is a critical situation.
Vince

Robert Johnston

updates on the California situation.  Hope that you are doing well and let us 
know if you require any additional information.

RJ
Robert Johnston
01/15/2001 09:10 PM
As talks continued toward the Tuesday deadline markets have been focused on 
for the California electricity crisis, state officials around Governor Gray 
Davis have
  toughened up their rhetoric on a couple of fronts even as they confirmed 
they would be in the market as early as Tuesday taking bids for energy to be 
paid by the
  State of California. One problem on that front is still how much producers 
want to charge the state for electricity. As we reported last week, Davis and 
his aides
  want to pay around $50 to $55 dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want 
about $75. Treasury Secretary Summers has suggested an auction as the best 
way to
  determine the price, but California officials are taking a less free market 
approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over long-term 
contracts.

Our sources in Washington, Sacramento, and California are increasingly of the 
view that Governor Davis is positioning his government to establish long-term 
power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the 
utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term.  This week's legislative 
activities
in Sacramento will create the vehicle to do so.   State credit backing 
purchases of power would obviate the need for super-priority borrowing to 
finance power 
purchases after utility bankruptcy.

1. Audit- Untangling Utility Relationships

California officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment 
front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that 
half of the $9 to $12 billion  the utilities say they owe is actually owed to 
themselves for power they bought from their corporate relations

This strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both 
the power-generating and power-distributing companies under a 
holding company umbrella. Of course, that means that some of the power PG&E 
and Southern California Edison bought at highly inflated prices 
was bought from themselves. 

  But it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations. Sources confirm that 
Davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part 
of any 
potential solution. He told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to 
use state credit to eliminate the "risky debt" premium that PG&E 
and SCE are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and 
that he is willing to extend the current 10% rate increase
 utility customers are paying far beyond the initial 90-day deadline. In 
return he is demanding that the companies prepare to "share the 
burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension."

2. Debt Restructuring- Guarantees, but No Direct State Money

 Davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $12 billion in back 
debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up
during a 90-day forbearance period (whether that period has been agreed to by 
all creditors is not something we are clear about right now). Davis' idea, as
he laid it out in the meeting, is to use the forbearance period to securitize 
the debts and sell them against the utilities' forward rate base or by 
establishing a
medium-term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees. 

 In both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without 
direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to
paydown their debt. One of the reasons Davis wants to stay close to the 
$50-$55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can 
pay
down this debt. There is a strong chance that Davis will agree to use state 
guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations, but he remains
opposed to using direct state money. This frustrates both Clinton 
administration and utility creditors, but Davis has not yet shown much 
flexibility.

3. Eminent Domain/Reregulation

  Perhaps most frustrating to the Washington DC free market crowd at Treasury 
and the White House was the continued comfort Davis and his group of political
  advisers have with "non-market" solutions to the energy crisis. Although 
the Governor's aides actually believe the weapon is more a "way to force 
eventual
  agreement, than an actual solution," the talk returns frequently to these 
non-market mechanisms. "We have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by 
the
  Tuesday deadline. If we make no progress. If this thing looks like it will 
turn into a genuine crisis, then we will use our powers of condemnation and 
we will re-take
  the plants and equipment and run them ourselves," a close political aide to 
Davis said. "We will absorb the plants, the transmission lines and the 
reserved parking
  places of the executives. The legislature would agree in a second."

Vince, pursuant to your discussion with Joe, I am enclosing my resume for 
your information.  I would appreciate the chance to discuss rotation 
opportunities within Enron, particularly how a research position would relate 
to future commercial opportunities.      

For your information, I am meeting with Maureen Raymond tomorrow.  I will 
call your assistant afterwards to set up a meeting.   

Thank you.

Vince,

I will not be able to attend the meeting. Here are some updates:

1) I left a message to George Posey, I will follow up tomorrow (Tuesday),
2) I will follow up on the Credit Reserve issue ASAP, I will find out what the
present state of the models are and come up with modification requirements
to accomodate asset related projects.
3) This week I will need to spend much of my time in meeting with the 
breakthrough
folks. They are at a stage where
our contribution is being defined and specifies ( curves, components, etc.). 
If you
would like to contact me urgently, please leave a phone message instead of 
e-mail--
I will be checking my phone messages more frequently.
4) We have a VAR meeting with RAC on EAM issues Wednesday at 1pm.
5) Other issues are covered in my project list.

Vince:  As you requested, I have obtained some information from Norma 
relating to the salary parameters of the Sr. Director position.   The minimum 
salary is $83,800, and the maximum is $168,000 (huge range, isn't it?).   
However, Norma did ask me to bring a couple of things to your attention:  the 
lowest salary of a VP in your group is currently $140,000, and the average 
director's salary in your group is $120,000.    Those numbers narrow the 
range considerably.   Of course, there is no equity issue since there is no 
other senior director in your group.

Hope this information helps,
Molly

I would like to invite you to a meeting with Jeff Shankman on Tuesday
January 16, 3:30 p.m.  at Jeff Shankman's office.

We are meeting to plan the agenda for the Tiger Team, a group of about 20 
Wharton School
students visiting Enron.  A Wharton  tiger team works through a semester on a 
special project, proposed by
a corporation. The team sponsored by Enron works on project regarding the 
impact of
electronic trading on the energy markets. The semester long project will  
result in a report that
will be submitted to Enron for review and evaluation. I hope that  you will 
find this report useful.

 We have invited our tiger team to visit Enron. The students will arrive on 
Thursday, 
January 18, and will spend Friday at Enron. I would appreciate if you could 
find 30 minutes
on Friday to talk to the students.

The meeting with Jeff on Tuesday  should not last longer than 10-15 minutes.

Vince

I hope you are well. Until today, I did not know there was another Kaminski 
at Enron. Perhaps you know him already but I found him in the Enron address 
book his first name is Jim.

I am enrolled in the above mandatory program and I have nominated you in the 
peer/colleague category,  to provide feedback on me. I do not know the nature 
of the questions you would be required to respond to but sometime soon you 
would receive an e-mail asking you for your input. 

I know your plate is full and life is already hectic but I thought I could 
nominate you for your input.  I should be grateful if you would take some 
time off your very hectic schedule and provide the feedback on me.

Very many thanks,

Vince - - In the last hour, one of my partners has raised an issue about our representation of another client engaged in a significant transaction with Enron, and whether my proposed representation of you would require the consent of that client.  We are trying to sort it out as we speak.  I am hopeful that the issue will be resolved satisfactorily in the next hour, and that I will be on an airplane this evening (albeit later than planned).  In the off chance that we are unable to resolve the issue today, however, and it becomes necessary to postpone my trip, let's hold off setting up a specific time to meet with Bob Williams.

I will call you later this afternoon, as soon as I have further information.

I have attached the final agenda for the EMF meeting next week.  All times remain the same.  The new agenda lists for each session a few speakers, who will make some comments to help stimulate the group's discussion.   The first session will focus upon key issues that we would like to learn more about.  The second session focuses more on what we have learned about gas supply and infrastructure, while the third session focuses more on gas markets and ties to electricity.    
I am looking forward to an interesting and productive meeting.

Ryan,

In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like
to reinforce one point I made. I feel strongly that I cannot support
the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor
related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.

I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot
guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements 
that you would expect from any professional.

Dear Mark and Vince
 
I know that it has been very trying for us all, but  I do believe that we have got there in the end! I have attached a copy of the  programme that I will send to the printers. Unless I hear from you  by tomorrow my time, I will ask the printer to proceed with the information  that I have.
 
We can discuss the exact specifics and logistics in  the near future. I will of course be in touch again and will send you both  copies of the brochure when it is printed. 
 
In the meantime, can I please have the following  information over the next few days (I know my demands are endless, but at least  they are no longer pressing!):
 
- a professional CV, around 70 to 100 words should  be fine
- your address
 
I thank you in advance for your co-operation and  look forward to working with you both on GARP 2002.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas

John,

I am not sure if I have already sent you this resume.
Please, take a  look at it. I met Claude a few years ago
and was greatly impressed by him. He may be a good candidate to
work with Andy Zipper.

Vince

 

Rakesh,

I have informed Ryan Siurek (cc Rick Buy) on Oct 4
that I cannot sign off on any analysis
done by our group without looking at full set of
legal documents related to the LJM
transactions. Those documents were not provided and therefore
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past.

I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support
the valuations based on verbal and
often conflicting information, without doing  full due
diligence.

Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but,
please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis
we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict between
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in my view,
mutually exclusive.

Vince

FYI

This is the latest version of your Raptor valuation memo that we have.  Is
there a more recent version with the changes we discussed (i.e. UBS shares

Rakesh,

I have informed Ryan Siurek (cc Rick Buy) on Oct 4
that I cannot sign off on any analysis
done by our group without looking at full set of
legal documents related to the LJM
transactions. Those documents were not provided and therefore
we cannot sign off on any analysis done in the past.

I have come to a conclusion that we cannot support
the valuations based on verbal and
often conflicting information, without doing  full due
diligence.

Feel free to provide the information to Kimberly but,
please, inform her I cannot support the quantitative analysis
we have done in the past. I am especially concerned about the conflict between
the existence of the restriction and the existence of a put that are, in my view,
mutually exclusive.

Vince

FYI

This is the latest version of your Raptor valuation memo that we have.  Is
there a more recent version with the changes we discussed (i.e. UBS shares
are not in a forward contract, 4 year restriction, etc.)?

Kimberly,

Here is the note.  Do let me know if I can assist further.

Zimin,

Yes, it wasn't easy. Thanks for stepping in on such a short notice.

Vince

Vince,

Our presentation at the SMS panel went very well. The audience asked quite a few questions.
Mac from U Penn invited me for lunch and dinner tomorrow to talk about more in details about real option valuation.

Enron was mentioned a few times in
Gary Hamel's speech in very positive way.

I heared Enron is under Sec investigation. I can imagine your
Monday meeting was not easy.

Zimin

Mike,

What would be the best starting date? Your call.
He can cover the Dec 25  shift.

Vince

Dear All,

Paul briefed me today that my last day withe Enron Australia will be the 14th Dec. Next step would be to determine my first day with Enron in Houston? 

My wife booked holiday accommodation until the 19th Dec. for a place up the coast (before today's decision). 

Could we please have a call to determine the date of my first day in Houston? 
Maybe in approx. 5 hours time (for the call)?

Regards,
Christian

Steve,

I will talk to Greg in 25 minutes about it. They sent a proposal.

Vince

Hi Vince

What's happening with The Prediction Co?  Is it still a live concern, or are Enron not following up?

Today's focus: Red Hat no longer sings "When I'm 64"

By Phil Hochmuth

Linux distributor Red Hat last week made two announcements that
should make proponents of 64-bit Linux servers happy: it
released Red Hat Linux 7.2 for both the Intel Itanium and
Compaq Alpha processors.

Although Red Hat was previously able to run on Alpha and
Itanium platforms, the software did not take full advantage of
their 64-bit processing power. But version 7.2 for 64-bit
computing includes the newest Linux kernel (2.4.9), with
features such as higher symmetrical multiprocessing scaling and
ext3 journaling file system.

The support for these features, Red Hat says, will allow the
operating system to take better advantage of the Alpha and
Itanium platforms, which can process much larger file sizes and
handle larger address spacing than 32-bit systems.

Red Hat Linux 7.2 includes other enhancements such as improved
USB support, network configuration and user management
applications, plus a firewall configuration program that can be
configured during server setup.

Itanium is the latest iteration of Intel's PC processor, and is
catching on with users who run high-end Web servers and
enterprise-level application. Prior to Itanium, the Alpha was
the big dog among the 64-bit processor platforms. Although
Compaq has said it will phase out its 64-bit Reduced
Instruction Set Computing processor over the next few years,
Alpha systems are still used widely in database and Web
transactions servers in industries such as finance, medical,
and supercomputing research.

Gwyn,

It's very thoughtful of you but you should go ahead
and continue the lessons.

Vince

Hi Vince,

Given the recent developments in Enron's financial outlook and likely need for expense control, I wanted to ask you if Enron would still agree to pay for my French lessons going forward.  My french tutor is possibly going to return to France to retire in the coming months, but I think I will probably continue with my lessons until the end of this year.  I have been thankful that Enron has financed these expenses in the past, but understand in tough times we all need to make sacrifices.

Thank you.

Gwyn

Remi,
 
FYI. I shall send you the summary of action items
later today.
 
Vince
 
 
I would love to talk to him.  Does he live in France.  Is it easier for him to work in London. If not I would be happy to do a phone interview.
 
Please advise

John, 

I am not sure if I have already sent you this resume. 
Please, take a  look at it. I met Claude a few years ago 
and was greatly impressed by him. He may be a good candidate to 
work with Andy Zipper. 

Vince 

<<Claude Philoche.doc>> 

Luigi,

No problem. We shall be glad to have you as an associate.
What about a lunch next week?

Vince

Hi Vincent:
 
Super Saturday is coming and I am so happy to move toward the end of the recruiting process.  During the interviews that I have had so far, I expressed my desire to have my first rotation in your group.  Last spring I really enjoyed the work environment and the people I met.  I like modeling and I think I can do well from the very beginning.  Let me know what you think about it.
 
On another note, Jason gave me two names for the Energy Club.  I will contact them shortly after finals next week.
 
Thanks in advance for your consideration.
 
I am looking forward to seeing you again.

Vince, 

I hope all is well with you considering ...

Our baby, Addison Sterling, was born on Saturday, January 12th at 12:31 PM.  She was fairly big - 8 lbs 14 ozs and she is 20 inches long.  I've attached a link to the hospital's webite that has her picture (she is much cuter in person, of course :)

We named her after Addison St which runs by Wrigley Field (Home of the Chicago Cubs) and the Pound Sterling.

Cami is doing well and we have returned home on Sunday night.

Where do we go? 8 may be few mins late.
Vince

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Chris,

I shall get a copy of the book on Monday and will get a copy of the paper  for
you.

Vince

Mr. Kaminski,

Your reference to Mr. Akerlof's article interested me. How could I obtain a copy so that I can read it in its entirety?

Thanks and Best Regards,

Chris Cramer

Jeff,

Congratulations and good luck.

It's comforting that there is somebody who
can recognize insanity when he sees it.

Sevil,

Yes. Plz subscribe.

Let me know if you see something interesting.

Vince

Vince,

Would we be interested in getting The Rand Journal of Economics for our library? As you know it is one of the leader journals in microeconomics with a focus on regulation, industrial organization etc.

Dear Vince,
Thank you for sparing some time to talk with me about the opportunities at
Enron.
As a Computational Finance student with a chemical engineering background, I
am very interested in pursuing my career with Enron as this will give me the
opportunity to employ the skills that I have developed during the course of
my education and experience. I am currently working on an external project
with Professor John O'Brien, on the Effect of Convexity on pricing
Eurodollar swaps and I am confident that this experience would help me in
understanding the effects of volatility on derivative prices, which is a
fundamental component in the energy markets. Also, I am currently doing a
project on assessing the intrinsic value of Enron and its business-operating
environment to augment my knowledge of Enron in particular and the energy
markets in general. My education, as well as my experiences have helped in
honing my quantitative, analytical and computing skills, and have given me a
significant insight into the global trading industry.

I am enclosing my resume along with this mail. As mentioned in our
conversation, I would like to pursue a career in Energy trading and
research.

Hoping to hear from you soon.
Best Regards
Prakash

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

Hello, I am producing this year's 'Real Options Training Course' on behalf
of the Risk Waters Group in NY.  I am very interested in hearing your
comments and suggestions regarding the issues surrounding real options, in
addition to hearing what type of research Enron has been doing with real
options (as well as a possible speaker position).  Thanks again, I look
forward to speaking with you.

Vince,

	As you have seen in the write-ups I have been sending you, we have
established the Energy Markets Institute here to provide a world class
recruitment, specialized training, and research resource for the energy
industry.  The clear challenge now is to deliver on this as expeditiously as
possible, and we need help and input from industry leaders. We have set up
an Energy Executive Committee to work with us on making this a valuable
resource for the industry. So far, Bruce Williamson (CEO, Duke Energy Global
Markets), Gerald McElvey (Upstrean Controller, ExxonMobil), Fran Keeth
(Exec. VP, Shell Oil), Donna Pedersen-McGinnis (VP, Dynegy), Bruce Sukaly
(Sr. VP, Cinergy), Bob Peebler (Retired, Halliburton) have agreed to be on
the committee.  The committee is being put together by Lane Sloan (Retired,
Shell Oil).

	Both Lane and I very much want to have your input. Enron is a
leading energy firm (and from my perspective, it is the future of the
industry). So we would like Enron to be represented, and I personally would
be delighted and gratified to have your advice and evaluation.  We plan to
organize subcommittees dealing with Education, Research, and Trading---so it
may just involve two meetings a year.  We are looking at November 14 (5-7
p.m.) for the first meeting of the committee.  Please let me know if you
would agree to be on the Committee.

	We are now in the process of recruiting top-name in energy-finance
for the Bauer chair (endowment $3 million).  I also want to discuss any
suggestion you may have on people we should be trying to recruit for this.

Best wishes,

Praveen

Hi everyone!

We are having the first Research Reunion!  Here are the specifics!

 

Remi, Dave:

First of all I want to thank you for your hospitality and to apologize
for a delay in responding to you. It was quite a tumultuous week
and the turbulence continues.

The outline of commitments with the information on what I have done to 
jumpstart the process.

1.	Review of the CEPEL model / simplified model. Chonawee
started the review process, with the help of our two native Portuguese speakers.
Less complicated/faster to run model will follow.

2.	SDDP. As you know Tom Halliburton is in Norway this week.
They put their grimy fingers on him first.
He will be back next week and will help you  to set up the SDDP runs.
He even volunteer to stay on the job for a few days longer to help
you with the project.

3.	Transmission modeling. Martin Lin will call Dave to jumpstart the process.

4.	Zimin will call David regarding swing option model, option pricing models
for non-standard distributions and truncated distributions.

5.	Cooperation with the SA University in the area of the weather research 
	Remains to be discussed with Jose and Mike.

David,

She was a student at Rice University who took my class. A very smart
person. Has this position been posted by  your group?

Vince

Dear Vince,

I was really disappointed when I did not hear from Lee Ferrell after he
interviewed me back in May. Since you were so nice and very helpful, I am
wondering if you could assist me once again in landing a job at ENRON.

I ended up accepting an offer from Chase and started working right after the
graduation. Unfortunately, the job does not provide much challenge to me any
longer. Also, I am really missing the energy field, the team environment and
all that. Most importantly, I would like to apply the knowledge I acquired
at Rice and continue learning new skills. Banking turned out to be not quite
what I expected.

Anyhow, I went to the Enron job site again and found an interesting
position. Would you be able to help me out one more time to get in contact
with the right people? I would really appreciate it.

Here is the description of this position (and my updated resume).
Thank you very much.

Sincerely,

Helen Demianenko.

Shijie,

My apologies for the delay. As you know we have hit some turbulence here at Enron
and I was quite busy.

The title of the talk:

Measurement of  Volatility in the Energy Markets:

1. Importance  of volatility in financial engineering
	a. option pricing
	b. risk management
	c. legacy software systems

2. Is volatility the right tool for energy markets?

3. The dynamics of energy prices in the US markets in recent years: a few stylized facts

4. Alternative theoretical tools to represent price dynamics: the importance 
   of dialogue between academics and practitioners

Also, can you give me some indication of the timing
of different meetings?

Vince

Vince,

As your upcoming visit to our school is on next Thursday, could you please
send me the title and abstract of your talk as soon as possible so
that I could make the seminar announcement to our faculty and students
soon.  Thanks.

The Asst's on the 32 nd floor really love the cake we have in our monthly

to working with them in the future...

I will pay for the cake  , I like for others to see the Research Group as

Hi Vince -
Its very sad to see what has happened.  I hope you are doing OK under the
circumstances.  I wanted also to let you know that I'm transitioning to an
advisory role at Opt4  since they are now in a more operational mode, rather
than developmental.  I've joined Charles River Associates in the Palo Alto
office. What are your plans for the future?  I would like to extend an
invitation to get to know us better, and perhaps to collaborate if our
interests coincide.  When do you get back from vacation?

Brian,

What about the weekend?
I am in Atlanta Thursday.

Vince

If you are in need of a companion for an alcohol infusion, I stand ready to oblige.

Shijie,

Thanks. This is my itinerary.

The flight arrives relatively early. Can we schedule
an early dinner (let's say 5:30 or 6:00 p.m)?

Vince

 

Vince,

Thanks for the title and outline of your seminar.  I understand that
you must be pretty tied up at this time.  As for your visit, I will
pick you up at the Atlanta airport.  I will meet you at the exit of
the escalator.  Please remind me of you airline and flight number.  I'll
have my cellphone with me (678-637-8303).  One of my colleagues and I will
take you to dinner in the evening.  Your schedule on Thurs. is as follows.

I'll pick you up at the hotel around 9:30.  We will have an informal
meeting with one of my students from 9:50 to 10:50.  She will present
to you some ideas that we have been looking at on bandwidth trading.  We
are expecting to get some comments and feedbacks from you.  Your seminar
will be from 11am to 12noon.  Dr. Bob Kertz (our QCF program
director) will take you to lunch after the talk.  After the lunch, I
arrange you to meet with our students from 2pm to 3pm.  The time slot 3pm
to 4pm is open.  We will arrange a cab to get you at around 4pm.

I look forward to your visit.

Thanks for your message. I appreciate your kind words
and your concern.

Vince 

Dear Vince,

We've been asked by our clients for our view on Enron's situation and
outlook. I feel a need to respond to these requests and have written the
attached one-pager.

I would like to offer you -- my primary contact at Enron -- an opportunity
to review and correct any factual errors. Interpretations, of course, remain
my responsibility.

I reiterate my long-standing admiration for the Company and all it has
contributed. I have had an opportunity to discuss the prospect with people
in policy positions and desire first of all to do no harm by misstatement
and second to be as helpful as I can be.

If you choose not to comment I will understand that as well, but would
appreciate some indication on your part. I will of course keep our
correspondence on this between us in any event. Thanks.

I got your fax.

Thanks for your kind words about Enron. Every business
hits turbulence from time to time but I am not losing
sleep over it.

I am a bit concerned about the last two paragraphs
and references to LTCM and MG. I am afraid they can be taken out
of context and misinterpreted.

Thanks

yes, that's happened to us before. The fax is on its way. I'll be going home
soon to go to one of my kid's events so we can talk or correspond by email
at your convenience. Bye..

Ed

The file comes across as winmail.dat   not as a .doc file
or a  .pdf file. It happens in the case of some
E-mail systems: the files get encoded and then they don't
get decoded correctly.

Thanks.

John,

Everything is fine. I am quite busy but as always I enjoy reading
your articles. Always learning something from you.

Vince

Dear Vince:

I trust everything is fine with you. Please disregard the message I
accidently sent to you. It was meant for the other Vince.

Best regards,

John H. Herbert

Yvan,

I shall find out who was trying to reach you.
It will help if your uncle knows all the details
(your cell number, etc.)

Vince

Hi, Vince
I hope everything is fine with you. I am following the news and issues about Enron. This has not in anyway change my resolve in working for the company. I am sure the Chairman will stir the company into the right direction. 
I mentioned to you that I was interviewed two weeks ago by Andy Lewis of the trading group. It was an excellent discussion focusing on similarities in the career path that I and Andy took. Andy reinforced what I read in the Trading Naural Gas book by Fletcher Sturm who happens to be his previous seatmate. More than anything else, it was a great conversation that lasted for one hour and fifteen minutes. He mentioned, however, that he initially found me overqualified. I assured him, nonetheless, that I am committed to the task at hand. 
The following day, my uncle received a call from someone at Enron who was looking for a number to call me at the university. I surmised this was the second trader who will talk to me as Andy mentioned previously. I left two voice messages at Andy's home and office number. I have yet to receive the second call.
I am very much interested in pursuing the application. I will write a separate e-mail to Todd Peikert of HR to check on the status of the program. Just wanted to let you know.
Sincerely,
Yvan

Mark,

FYI. Ed Krapels is well known in the industry and has 
many followers. He likes  Enron and has always had a good
relationship with us. Would you like to use his help
to present our agenda to the energy industry. 

Vince

Vince,

Thanks for your comments. I will adapt the memo to our clients to make it
more neutral.

I find myself in an interesting position -- you may recall meeting one of my
associates during one of our DC seminars that you attended. He is now
working for Larry Lindsay at the White House and I was with him on Friday.

He asked for my views on the situation and I demurred, saying I did not have
enough information to make an informed estimate of whether this might turn
into an energy equivalent of LTCM (the MG situation was quite different in
its structural aspects).

Anyway, I am trying to be helpful here... I realize your company can call DC
any time and present the situation but it may be useful to have someone like
me as a side channel.

If I can be useful in this channel let me know.

All the best.

Ed

Ed,

Thanks. I have forwarded your message to Mark Palmer, our
press spokesman. He has a full plate, as you might expect,
but I strongly suggested  that he should get in touch with you.

It was based on work needs, exceptional talent.

Vince,

What was the basis for his green card?  Was it family-based, or was it based on work needs?

FYI
Vince,  In general, such applications for green cards go through Margaret Daffin in HR.  She is going to check on the status and get back with us.  We then can determine how to proceed.  Michelle

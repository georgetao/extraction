2.  Please make Tana Jones the Legal Asst on all of the entities listed above. 

3.  FYI - The bolded entites' LLC agreements are being amended (originals will be hand delivered on Monday) to allow for Mgrs (in order to be Manager managed as opposed to Member managed).  Embedded in these amended LLC agmts are the appointments of three Mgrs - Derrick, Haedicke and Whalley.

4.  FYI - Entities which have an asterik(*) are qualified in foreign jurisdictions and may, according to statute, need to file amended Certificates of Authority to reflect that they are now Manager managed.

5.  Also, to be delivered on Monday with the amended agreements is a consent of mgrs electing a standard slate to most of the entities listed above.

Thanks for your help in this regard.

I think it would be a good idea if you would print these out when you get them and bring them in at some point so we can go over them.

Mark/Holly,

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Oops.  Sorry, I'll bring them by.

Thanks for the forms.  I also need for you to print out the review comments from everyone for me to review since I do not have supervisor access to them in the system.  Thanks.

Here are the forms for the paralegals.  I didn't have Marie on my list since she was with EBS reviewed her for the first half of the year.

Mark,

How does 3-4pm on Monday work for you ?  Jay Webb can meet at that time as well.  However, Brad Richter might need to push the time back a bit since he is arriving from Europe that day.

Thanks,

Please print these out for me and put them in the Commodity Logic file.

Mark -

Sorry for the delay on the CommodityLogic information.  We completed a few documents today and I wanted to make sure you had the final versions.  Also, FYI, Tom has a meeting with Greg on Monday to discuss the creation of a separate CommodityLogic entity.  He has invited me to attend.  Please let me know if you want to attend or have any issues or items you want addressed.

Below are the latest versions of the CL documents.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Good catch!  I was thinking that Thanksgiving was the 29th -- oops.  I'll get a revised quote.  Any ideas for who wants to go?  This particular boat has three cabins and heads.  If we have another person (Jim?) or couple (the Johns?) we would get along with for a week it would be fun and less expensive.  And if there are even more, we could get a larger boat with four cabins.  We just need to know sooner rather than later to get the boat reserved.

I'm game for a trip.  Any chance we could do it a week or a few days earlier
and take advantage of the Thanksgiving holiday since we are already off?

I'd appreciate your comments.  Can you distribute internally (limited

I was under the impression that no confirmations were sent by e-mail. All of our derivatives transactions are confirmed by fax and the vast majority of physical commodity transactions are as well.  There are a very few which are not confirmed at all but I don't know of any that involve e-mail.

Mark, this is the tagline to which I referred in my voicemail.  Jeff said that the non-EOL confirms go out by fax, so the tagline doesn't appear, but our EOL confirms go out by e-mail.  

Tony has been working on this problem for us.  I'll ask him to give you a call to let you know what the status is.  Thanks Jean.  df

Drew -- I was wondering if you could point me in the right direction.

I am working with Ranelle Paldino on an issue... This message (shown below) is at the bottom of each of our email messages sent outside Enron.  Craig Buehler sends Contract info via email.

Sorry for any confusion. You can use either mark.taylor or mark.e.taylor@enron.com for my e-mails.  mtaylor@enron.com actually belongs to a colleague named Mitch Taylor so I don't know how it got to williard.com -- or where all those messages you've been sending ended up!  All very confusing.

Mark -

Did you receive this?  I sent this the other day to mtaylor@enron.com but it
was opened by an mtaylor@williard.com??  I called your office to confirm
your e-mail address and was given mark.e.taylor@enron.com.  Is
mtaylor@enron.com wrong?  That's the address I've been using for some time

I hope this isn't too late.  If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow.

I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk.  I'm thinking of something to the effect of:

Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order.  For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active.

Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.  That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.

The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as:

'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.  The limit order system does not allow you to transact with Enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.'

If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.

Here are the quotes from the Moorings.  One is for a 464 which is about the size of boat we had last time but with 4 cabins and 2 heads (last time was 3 cabins, 3 heads which would be better for a smaller group but they're already booked).  The other is for a 505, a 50' boat with four main cabins, each with its own head, and a fifth smaller cabin in the forepeak.  If we have need for the fourth cabin, I'd be inclined to go with the larger boat.  I talked to Jim on Friday and he's thinking about it - wanted to check his calendar, etc.  Any idea how to get in touch with the Johns?  Other potential sailors to suggest?  Luck curtailing Jamie's guilt trip?

  

Jim and/or the Johns would be fine by us.

This is the current incarnation of project offline.  They are trying to find customers who would like us to set up and operate a version of EOL for them.  I think Anne has been the point person for them.  It is not related to the back office deal.

Mark -

Do you know anything about a "EnronOnline Private eMarketplace solution" that is being marketed?  Is this the same as the back office/off-line deals?

Mike Bridges sent me a document to review concering this matter and needs me to respond.

Thanks.

Mark

Marie -- I'm afraid I don't have anything on physical bandwidth at all.  It might make sense to check with the lawyers in EBS -- I would suggest you start with Cynthia Harkness and Robbi Rossi.

Hi Mark

Could you please advise on the due diligence that was done for Japan for physical bandwidth?  We are launching asian bandwidth, starting with a point to point Tokyo - LA.  Choon-Boon in SG would like assure himself that we have everything covered when we start trading.

Thanks very much for your help in advance.
Regards
Marie, PCG London

All EOL due diligence was performed under the direction of Mark Taylor (including any international due diligence) - he should know who has the information.

Just a shot, but are you aware of any due diligence done for EOL in Japan?  I don't have anything.  Thanks,  m

For EOL - I am not sure that I have it; when was it done? - I  have copied Marcus Nettleton and John Viverito in the Legal Dept in Houston in case they do.
For EBS - again, really not sure but Michelle Hicks in Houston may have something or at least may be able to help you find it.
Jane McBride

Hi Jane, 

I wonder if you would be able to forward the due diligence that was done on Japan re EOL and physical Bandwidth to me and the two cc in on the e-mail above.
Thank you!  (We are working on the singapore launch)
Marie, PCG london

Marie

I have copies of EOL due diligence for HK and Singapore (although this is very brief).  For Japan and Australia, this would have been done locally, so please contact David Minns (Australia) and Jane McBride (Japan)

In terms of full (i.e.offline) due diligence, this would have been carried out by the braodband team (James Vickerman) - and he should be able to deal with your questions concerning additional legal issues.

J

Hi both of you

In regard to the online due diligence that was done for the European EBS launch back in March/April - would you have any copies of documents for the following countries:

Japan
Australia
Hong Kong
Singapore

If so, could you please forward them to me?  Choon-Boon Heng out in Houston is interested in reading them for his new product type launch for Asian physical bandwidth coming up in the beginning of September.

If not, could you please advise whether there were any additional issues with online trading on top of off-line trading in regard to the above.  There will be point to points within these countries.

Thank you very much and have a lovely weekend!
Marie

1.  EnronOnline is not an exchange, it is a bilateral transaction system.  It differs from futures exchanges in many respects including the following:  (i)an Enron entity is a counterparty to every transaction concluded over the system; (ii) EnronOnline transactions are not cleared;  (iii) the transactions concluded on the system are forward contracts or derivatives, not futures; and (iv) access to EnronOnline is restricted to commercial entities, i.e. no retail transactions are concluded on EnronOnline.

3.  EnronOnline transactions are not cleared through any third party mechanism.  Enron evaluates the credit of its customers and determines how much credit exposure it is willing to take with respect to each of them. 

Mark: Could you (or someone in your group) help with questions 1 and 3?  Thanks so much.  Lisa

   The attached is a request that we received from the U.S. Trade Commission in connection with the pending 201 proceeding. We need to coordinate a response. Please review and I will coordinate a meeting to discuss.   Thanks,   Julia

as per phonecall...

Let's discuss
Greg

Dear Mr. Hermans:
The following are the questions I referred to in the the phone message of 
August 6.

1.  In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal 
Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures 
contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line 
exchanges in the trading of physical metal?

2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's 
brings to the steel industry?

3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the 
creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?

4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?

5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil, 
agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully 
traded on-line?

Any information you are able to supply would be greatly appreciated.

Yes.  Louise was concerned that Dynegy was already doing this to manipulate a Canadian index to which we contribute daily volumes/prices.

Mark--

Is this simply to prevent people from messing with what might amount to an index in the future by daisy-chaining themselves?

I hope this isn't too late.  If you need to reach me, I'm in the London office today and tomorrow.

I think the correct approach is to revise the functionality and add a line or two to the description of how limit orders work, an answer in the FAQ section, a line for the 'Failed Transaction' screen and a script for the help desk.  I'm thinking of something to the effect of:

Once a limit order has been placed by a counterparty, that counterparty will not be able to complete a transaction with Enron in that product on the other side of the market at the price specified in the limit order.  For example, if a counterparty enters a limit order to sell to Enron at price x, that counterparty may not buy from Enron at price x while the limit order is active.

Note that this needs to be done on a counterparty basis, not at the sub user level.  That needs to be clear from the language we use so I have avoided the chattier 'you' and used counterparty.

The 'Failed Transaction' screen could show the failure reason as:

'Your company has an active limit order in effect at the price at which you attempted to transact.  The limit order system does not allow you to transact with Enron on both sides of the market at the same price simultaneously.'

If you want to keep it short, the second sentence is optional as long as the necessary descriptive language appears somewhere on the web site.

Nothing on my calendar yet.  Andy Edison is setting it up and he knows to include you.

Thanks for your help!!  Any word on the conference call with outside antritrust counsel re: ICE?  

Best regards,
Lisa

1.  EnronOnline is not an exchange, it is a bilateral transaction system.  It differs from futures exchanges in many respects including the following:  (i)an Enron entity is a counterparty to every transaction concluded over the system; (ii) EnronOnline transactions are not cleared;  (iii) the transactions concluded on the system are forward contracts or derivatives, not futures; and (iv) access to EnronOnline is restricted to commercial entities, i.e. no retail transactions are concluded on EnronOnline.

3.  EnronOnline transactions are not cleared through any third party mechanism.  Enron evaluates the credit of its customers and determines how much credit exposure it is willing to take with respect to each of them. 

Mark: Could you (or someone in your group) help with questions 1 and 3?  Thanks so much.  Lisa

   The attached is a request that we received from the U.S. Trade Commission in connection with the pending 201 proceeding. We need to coordinate a response. Please review and I will coordinate a meeting to discuss.   Thanks,   Julia

as per phonecall...

Let's discuss
Greg

Dear Mr. Hermans:
The following are the questions I referred to in the the phone message of 
August 6.

1.  In what significant ways does Enron Online differ from the London Metal 
Exchange or the New York Mercantile Exchange in the trading of futures 
contracts (apart from the specific metals it trades) or from other on-line 
exchanges in the trading of physical metal?

2.  What are the most important benefits that a public exchange like Enron's 
brings to the steel industry?

3.  Does Enron have a trade clearing mechanism to guarantee the 
creditworthiness of suppliers and customers?

4.  Why have some on-line steel trading sites failed?

5.  Are there particular problems in trading steel on-line versus oil, 
agricultural products, or any of the other products that are successfully 
traded on-line?

Any information you are able to supply would be greatly appreciated.

        U.S. International Trade Commission

        202-205-3435 (phone) 

II made my pledge some time ago so am concerned to hear my name is on the list.  I'll try again.

I'm the EWS Legal United Way campaign coordinator this year, so I've been asked to contact those in our department who have not yet participated in the United Way process. I'm starting with those at the AGC (or higher) level.  If you are receiving this email, you are on the non-participant list as of 930 this am.

You can participate by going to https://hrglobal.enron.com, and use your global id (begins with a 9, not the "P" number). You can also email or call Eric Thode and tell him what you want to do, and he can handle it for you.  It is possible to participate (i.e., access the site) but not make a contribution, if that is your preference. It will at least help our sagging participation percentage.

I have to admit that I thought I had participated in the contribution process before today, but learned that my effort to participate had failed.  Therefore, you may have also attempted to submit your contribution, but you are showing up as a non-participant at this point.  You will know you're contribution has been registered when you receive a confirming email.  

Thanks,

Kay

I haven't sent out the language draft yet because of another concern I thought of as you were leaving:  the language as drafted doesn't allow us to give the names of these signers to potential third party posters.  Any thoughts?

GET RICH ON $6.00

We have all heard of the get rich quick, right? Well, I am taking a chance,
I do know one of the people and
they have received about $600 so far..  She also said that it is the
easiest money she has ever made. So, lets give it a try! You have lost
a lot more than this at the park..

PLEASE READ IN ITS ENTIRETY
$6.00 CAN GET YOU THOUSANDS IN JUST A FEW MONTHS!

This method works in a very short time. The cost is only $6.00!
This is the 16th day since I started receiving $ cash, and so
far I have received $5,845 (in $1 Bills)...so I guess this is really
working already! Give it a try! All I did was follow the
instructions in the letter that I received below, and sent out
some e-mail to people that responded to my ads.

Here is a testimony from one of the thousands that have
benefited from this get-rich-quick plan:

"I'm a retired attorney, and about a year ago a man came to me
with a letter. The letter he brought to me is the same letter before
you now. He asked me to verify that this letter was legal. I told
him that I would review it and get back to him. When I first read
the letter, I thought it was some off the wall idea to make money.
 A week later I met again with my client to discuss the issue. I told
him that the letter originally brought to me was not 100% legal.
I advised him to make a small change in the letter and it will
be all right. I was curious about the letter, so he told me how
it worked. I thought it was a long shot, so I decided against
participating.

Before my client left, I asked him to keep me updated as to his
results.

About two months later he called me to tell me that he had
received more than $800,000.00 in cash!! I didn't believe him so
he asked me to try the plan and see for myself."

"I thought about it for a few days and decided that there was
not much to lose. I followed the instructions exactly and mailed
out 200 letters. Sure enough the money started coming in! It
came slowly at first, but after three weeks I was getting more
than I could open in a day. After three months the money stopped
coming. I kept a precise record of my earnings and at the end it
totaled $868,439.00. I earn a good living as an attorney, but as
anyone in the legal profession will tell you, there is a lot of
stress that comes with the territory. I decided if things worked
out, I would retire from practice and play golf. This time I
sent out 500 letters. Well, three months later, I had totaled
$2,344,178.00."

"I met my old client for lunch to find out exactly how it works.
He told me that there were a few similar letters going around.
What made this one different is the fact that there were six
names on the letter, not three like most others. That fact alone
resulted in more returns. The other factor was the advice I gave
him in making sure the whole thing was perfectly legal, since no
one wants to risk doing anything illegal. I bet now you are
curious about what little changes I told him to make. Well if
you send a letter like this one out, to be legal, you must sell
something if you expect to receive a dollar. I told him that
anyone sending a dollar must receive something in RETURN. So
when you send a dollar to each of the six names on the list, you
must include a slip of paper saying, "Please add me to your
mailing list" and include your name, mailing address and e-mail
address.

This is the key to the program. The item you will receive for
your dollar sent, is THIS letter and the right to earn
thousands."

Follow the simple instructions EXACTLY, and in less than three
months you should receive MORE THAN $800,000.00 IN COLD HARD
CASH!

1) IMMEDIATELY send ONE DOLLAR [$1.00 US$] to each of the six
people listed below. THE SOONER YOU SEND THE "$1.00 LETTERS" THE
SOONER YOU CAN START GETTING A RETURN! Wrap the dollar (in order
to prevent thievery) in a note saying "PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR
MAILING LIST". Include YOUR NAME, MAILING ADDRESS AND E-MAIL
ADDRESS.

**REMEMBER, if you don't ask for the service, USE OF THIS
LETTER WILL BE ILLEGAL FOR YOU.

*****PLEASE make sure you have used the correct postage and
include a return address! This is VERY IMPORTANT!

2) Send an e-mail to each of the names above with "$1 SENT" in
the subject line. Write your name and mailing address. This is
important as it would inform them as to how many people had
joined the program under them.
Likewise, it will give them the estimate of how many one-dollar
bills they should receive.

3) REMOVE the NAME and ADDRESS NEXT to #1 at the TOP of the list
and move the rest of the names UP one position. Then place YOUR
name in the #6 spot.

This is best done by saving this to a file, then enter in your
information on line #6. Be careful when you type the addresses.
Don't forget to PROOFREAD them. Make SURE that the names and
addresses are correct. Also include your e-mail address.

4) When you have COMPLETED the above instructions, you have
several options on how you market the letter - through the
Postal Service, through E-mail to at least 200 people, IF YOU HAVE AN
FFA PAGE THAT WILL BE EASY, or through posting in "FREE CLASSIFIED
ADS" and "NEWSGROUPS" ON THE INTERNET, or through whatever
 way you deem is legal.

This letter has been proven perfectly legal for all of the above
as long as you follow the instructions, because you are
purchasing membership in our exclusive mailing list.
You can also use a Mass e-mail Network to mail it out in large
volumes for you. We highly recommend this one. They always e-
mail more than the amount you purchase, and their addresses are
always fresh. Posting Free Classified Ads on the Internet can
achieve good results. Simply go to a search engine, Yahoo, Hot
Bot, Lycos or any other, and type in Free Classified Ads. You
will get a list of over 190,000 sites for you to start post ads.
Use a catchy title such as FREE MONEY, and post your e-mail
address. When people inquire, simply send them a copy of this
letter by e-mail. The more you send out, the more YOU will make.
We strongly encourage you to mail this letter to family,
friends, and relatives as well.

THIS IS A SERVICE AND IS 100% LEGAL. (Refer to title 18, section
1302 & 1341 of the US Postal and Lottery Laws), or check it out
with the US Post Office @1-800-725-2161.

**Assume for example you get a 8% return rate.

1) When you mail out 200 letters, ONLY 16 people send you $1.00

2) Those 16 people mail out 200 letters, (3200 letters) and ONLY
256 people send you $1.00

3) Those 256 people mail out 200 letters, (51,200 letters) and
ONLY 4,096 people send you $1.00.

4) Those 4,096 people mail out 200 letters (819,200 letter) and
ONLY 65,536 people send you $1.00.

5) Those 69,536 people mail out 200 letters (13,107,200 letters)
and ONLY 1,048,576 people send you $1.00.

At the Next level your name-drops off the list.

Think about it. Look what you WILL have BEFORE your name-drops
off the list!

I know this looks and sounds unbelievable. Just try it, and you will be
happy that you did because you will receive proof when THOUSANDS of
ONE-DOLLAR BILLS start to pile up!

*** MAKE SURE you send **One US dollar** to each of the six names on
 the list (This is VERY IMPORTANT), with a note saying
"PLEASE ADD ME TO YOUR MAILING LIST".

P.S. You've read this far, so let me ask you one simple question,

WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO LOSE?..... $6.00 !!!

Even with a 1% return you will still get $100,000.00 in 90 DAYS!
What you can gain is an income, like the example in this letter.
You will have a very small expense, but you will reap HUGE
potential returns! What do you have to lose? I invite you to
JOIN our mailing list RIGHT NOW!

Thank you for your time. GOOD LUCK & BEST WISHES TO YOU!!!

This is a one time mailing. To be removed from our list, REPLY with "REMOVE" in the subject line.
(Please allow 24 to 48 hours for removal processing.)

Hi Mark,
I still haven't got this and it would be really useful to have especially at the moment to be able to do searches on some of the commodity definitions.

We're almost there on the new PA language, just a little tweaking left to do.  I'm doing reviews all day today so won't be able to get it to you until Monday.  I agree with your comment on the Pop - up language - probably something to the effect of "Not at this time."

Anything more on this.  I sent my comments on the pop up language back to you.

My firm has been ask to represent Citgo in the negotiation of an ISDA Master
Agreement with Enron.  Stuart Rains has forwarded to us the pdf files that you
sent to him.  Please provide us with the Schedule and Paragraph 13 in a format
that we can edit and black line or changes to.  We find that this practice helps
speed along the process and it allows us to keep our client updated as to the
progress of negotiations.  I look forward to working with you.

I have found a couple of other people who are interested in going, but tonight is Ted's last night in town before moving to Ft. Lauderdale so if you're feeling up to it maybe we could get together for a drink after the game.  Just let me know.

Hey Mark,
Sorry about the delayed answer.  We're in town this week and the game sounds
like fun.  My only problem is that my stomach is in knots and I'm not sure
if it'll be better this afternoon.  If you can give them away I'd say do
that, if not, can we touch base this afternoon???   By the way, do you still
have the sail boat??????

Mark,

We have recently completed our Gas Trading Audit.  From our audit, we

Hodge; however, since our action item pertains to both physical and
financial deals, I wanted to forward this item to you for your review.
(Item D in the high priority section)

(See attached file: Natural Gas Trading.ppt)

Upon review, please let me know if you have any questions and/or comments.

Dear Friend and Future Millionaire,
My wife received this e-mail and forwarded it to me to review. We've both
read completely through it and have been in contact with some of the
individuals listed below.
We think it's an excellent opportunity that is well worth the small
investment of time and money, and believe that you will, too! CRH

AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV:

Making over half million dollars every 4 to 5 months from your home for
an investment of only $25 U.S. Dollars expense one time
THANKS TO THE COMPUTER AGE AND THE INTERNET !

BE A MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR!!!
Before you say ''Bull'', please read the following. This is the letter you
have been hearing about on the news lately. Due to the popularity of
this letter on the Internet, a national weekly news program recently
devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below,
to see if it really can make people money. The show also investigated whether
or not the program was legal.
Their findings proved once and for all that there are ''absolutely NO Laws
prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can -follow the
simple instructions, they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $25
out of pocket cost''. DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT
THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED, IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER.
This is what one had to say: ''Thanks to this profitable opportunity. I
was approached many times before but each time I passed on it. I am
so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for
the minimal effort and money required.
To my astonishment, I received total $610,470.00 in 21 weeks,
with money still coming in."
Pam Hedland, Fort Lee, New Jersey

Here is another testimonial:

"This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it. But one day when I received this again
in the mail I decided to gamble my $25 on it. I followed the simple
instructions and walaa ...... 3 weeks later the money started to come in.
First month I only made $240.00 but the next 2 months after that I made
a total of $290,000.00. So far, in the past 8 months by re-entering the
program, I have made over $710,000.00 and I am playing it again. The
key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT
change anything.''

More testimonials later but first,

 Take this entire letter, with the modified list of names, and save it
on your computer. DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES.

Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data. To assist
you with marketing your business on the internet, the 5 reports you
purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which
includes how to send bulk e-mails legally, where to find thousands of free classified ads
and much more.

There are 2 Primary methods to get this venture going:
METHOD # 1: BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY THROUGH A COMPANY LIKE ASTRO LEADS (360-358-3471)

Let's say that you decide to start small, just to see how it goes, and we
will assume You and those involved send out only 5,000 e-mails each. Let's
also assume that the mailing receive only a 0.2% response (the response
could be much better but lets just say it is only 0.2%. Also many people
will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only 5,000 each).
Continuing with this example, you send out only 5,000 e-mails. With a 0.2%
response, that is only 10 orders for report # 1. Those 10 people responded
by sending out 5,000 e-mail each for a total of 50,000. Out of those
50,000 e-mails only 0.2% responded with orders. That's=100 people responded and
ordered Report # 2.

Those 100 people mail out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 500, 000
e-mails.
The 0.2% response to that is 1000 orders for Report # 3.

Those 1000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 5 million
e-mails sent out. The 0.2% response to that is 10,000 orders for Report # 4.

Those 10,000 people send out 5,000 e-mails each for a total of 50,000,000
(50 million) e-mails.

The 0.2% response to that is 100,000 orders for Report
# 5 THAT'S 100,000 ORDERS TIMES $5 EACH=$500,000.00 (half million).
Your total income in this example is: 1..... $50 + 2..... $500 + 3....
$5,000 + 4.... $50,000 + 5..... $500,000 ........ Grand Total=$555,550.00

NUMBERS DO NOT LIE. GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE
RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT, YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF
MONEY !
REMEMBER FRIEND, THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY 10 PEOPLE
ORDERING OUT OF 5,000 YOU MAILED TO.
Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even
one 4th of those people mailed 100,000e-mails each or more? There are over
150 million people on the Internet worldwide and counting. Believe me, many
people will do just that, and more!

METHOD # 2 : BY PLACING FREE ADS ON THE INTERNET
Advertising on the net is very inexpensive and there are hundreds
of FREE places to advertise. Placing a lot of free ads on the Internet
will easily get a larger response. We strongly suggest you start with Method
# 1 and add METHOD # 2 as you go along. For every $5 you receive, all you must
do is e-mail them the Report they ordered. That's it. Always provide same
day service on all orders.
This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out, with your name and
address on it, will be prompt because they can not advertise until they
receive the report.

============ MORE TESTIMONIALS ================
"My name is Mitchell. My wife, Jody and I live in Chicago. I am an
accountant with a major U.S. Corporation and I make pretty good money.
When I received this program I grumbled to Jody about receiving ''junk
mail''. I made fun of the whole thing, spouting my knowledge of the
population and percentages involved. I ''knew'' it wouldn't work. Jody
totally ignored my supposed intelligence and few days later she jumped in
with both feet. I made merciless fun of her, and was ready to lay the old
''I told you so'' on her when the thing didn't work. Well, the laugh was
on me! Within 3 weeks she had received 50 responses. Within the next 45 days
she had received total $ 147,200.00 ........... all cash! I was shocked. I
have joined Jody in her ''hobby''.
Mitchell Wolf M.D., Chicago, Illinois
======================================================
''Not being the gambling type, it took me several weeks to make up my
mind to participate in this plan. But conservative that I am, I decided
that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I
wouldn't get enough orders to at least get my money back''. '' I was
surprised when I found my medium size post office box crammed with
orders. I made $319,210.00 in the first 12 weeks. The nice thing about
this deal is that it does not matter where people live. There simply isn't
a better investment with a faster return and so big."
Dan Sondstrom, Alberta, Canada
=======================================================
''I had received this program before. I deleted it, but later I wondered
if I should have given it a try. Of course, I had no idea who to contact
to get another copy, so I had to wait until I was e-mailed again by someone
else.........11 months passed then it luckily came again...... I did not
delete this one! I made more than $490,000 on my first try and all the
money came within 22 weeks."
Susan De Suza, New York, N.Y.
=======================================================
''It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money with
little cost to you. I followed the simple instructions carefully and
within 10 days the money started to come in. My first month I made
$20,560.00 and by the end of third month my total cash count was
$362,840.00. Life is beautiful, Thanks to internet.".

We have had discussions involving Tom Moran in credit, but I don't know if they have done a formal review. The initiative with AA came through Sarah-joy Hunter in the businesss development group, through soem cross corporate initiatives. AA would not allow us to bid on business because we are not an 'A' rated company, but given some of the other issues they felt they would allow us to come in. Tom said they are BBB-, so I know he has done some preliminary work. I'll bounce it off him and get you an answer asap.

I'm in London today and tomorrow but plan to be in the office in Houston on Thursday.  Since it'll be my first day back after being out for over a week, it would probably be best to book some time to make sure you get me.  But if that doesn't work, try and stop by anyway.
I wanted to let you know that I am going to be in Houston next week for a derivatives course on Tuesday and Wednesday.  My flight doesn't leave until 1 pm on Thursday, so I thought I would come in and wander around the office Thursday morning before I leave.

FERTILIZERS

It's time to manage your price risk.

[Spread 1]
Managing Price Risk
For producers and consumers of ammonia and fertilizers, price volatility is an all-too-familiar cost of doing business. To compete effectively in your industry, you need a way to control the risk created by price volatility. Enron can help with financial price management tools that can smooth earnings, facilitate cash flow management, and bring greater certainty to financing, investment and acquisition decisions. 
 
Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Producers Improve their Business
Few industries are more competitive or volatile than ammonia or fertilizers. From the very unstable pricing found in the markets for raw materials to the ebb and flow of market demand for finished products, producers can face enormous challenges in maintaining profit margins and cash flows.
Now there's help. For many years, Enron has been helping producers like you neutralize the risk of price volatility both upstream and downstream, using financial price management tools we pioneered more than a decade ago for the energy industry. Because Enron is a major trader of many commodities around the world, we're intimately familiar with the risks you face and are uniquely positioned to help you mitigate them. 
Enron can also make it easier for you to trade the commodities you buy and sell, using EnronOnline, our Internet-based, global transaction system for commodities that allows you to view real-time prices and transact instantly online. EnronOnline posts bid and offer prices for over 1,500 global commodity products as well as complimentary weather, news and market information. In addition, it allows you to view full contractual terms and available volumes for products.
[Spread 2]
Finally, we can leverage, in your market, our position as the largest wholesaler of natural gas and electricity in North America. For example, we can structure cross-commodity transactions that link your electricity or natural gas bills to the price of the goods you produce. In this type of transaction, you would pay more for energy when your product prices are high when you can best afford it, and less when your product prices are low and your cash flows are constrained.

Helping Ammonia and Fertilizer Consumers Improve their Business

The ammonia and fertilizer markets that you depend upon are among the most volatile in the world. Yet your investors and lenders are demanding ever-greater stability in the growth of your company's revenues, earnings and cash-flow. For solutions to this apparent paradox, turn to Enron. As a leading provider of price management services across various industries, we can help you buy the commodities you need more efficiently, hedge the risks associated with their pricing, and, ultimately, lower your cost of capital. 
Take a few moments to review the alternatives listed here, then spend a few more moments with Enron. We'll review your risk exposure with you and suggest risk-reducing strategies for taking control of your commodity price exposure.

SWAPS

Swaps are the most widely used price risk management tool for a variety of reasons, the most common being, no upfront transaction cost. 
Swaps give companies the ability to effectively switch from one price structure to another - from floating price to fixed or vice versa. They are used most often to fix, or lock in, prices and margins between prices. In exchange for price protection, the ability to capitalize on some beneficial price movements is sacrificed.
The typical swap transaction involves the exchange of a fixed price for a variable price tied to an acceptable market index. Settlement is financial - i.e., cash changes hands; physical product does not. Each month during the life of the transaction, the difference between the two prices is calculated and payment is made to the appropriate party.
[Spread 4]

Swap: Producer example 

AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, is interested in managing the margin between natural gas feedstock and ammonia during the next six months. The company is concerned that market conditions could deteriorate more than expected and squeeze margins to the point of jeopardizing the annual profit plan. To eliminate this threat, AmmoniaKing enters into a swap with Enron that locks in the spread between natural gas and ammonia at $100/ton on 300,000 tons of ammonia, or 75 percent of monthly production. This margin virtually ensures that the ammonia unit will meet its financial target.
[chart 1]

DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:

?        AmmoniaKing continues to purchase natural gas from suppliers and sell ammonia to customers of its choice, at floating market prices.
?        On a monthly basis, AmmoniaKing and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the fixed spread of $100/ton and the prevailing floating price spread.
?        For example, if the floating spread is $95/ton in a given month, AmmoniaKing will receive $5/ton in a given month on 300,000 tons. However, if the floating spread is $105/ton AmmoniaKing will owe $5/ton to Enron.
?        AmmoniaKing has stabilized a portion of its operating margin with the swap, giving the company the ability to achieve a key performance target.
 
[Spread 5]

Swap: End-user example 

FertPro, a manufacturer of a variety of fertilizer products, is preparing its annual price catalog for many of its ammonia-based products. The company's customer base demands the ability to buy the products at the listed catalog price regardless of ammonia feedstock prices. This makes it impossible for FertPro to pass on feedstock price increases no matter what the magnitude. On the other hand, customers don't necessarily expect lower prices if ammonia feedstock prices should fall; they simply want a listed price they can count on. To service its customers while protecting its margins, FertPro enters into a one-year price swap. The swap effectively fixes the price of ammonia at $100/ton on a monthly volume of 10,000 tons, or 75 percent of anticipated monthly catalog sales.
[chart 2]

DURING THE LIFE OF THE SWAP:

?        FertPro continues to purchase ammonia from suppliers of its choice at floating market prices.
?        On a monthly basis, FertPro and Enron exchange payments equal to the difference between the swap fixed price of $100/ton and the floating price for ammonia.
?        For example, if the floating price for ammonia is $105 in a given month, FertPro will receive $5/ton on 10,000 tons. However, if the floating price is $95/ton FertPro will owe $5/ton to Enron.
?        The net effect of combining the swap cash flows with actual purchases of ammonia feedstock is a fixed price of $100/ton.
?        The swap enables FertPro to publish and stand behind its listed prices with full confidence that the margin on those sales is largely protected from fluctuating feedstock prices.
 
[Spread 6]

CAPS & FLOORS

Like Swaps, Caps and Floors provide price protection, but they have the added advantage of providing benefit from favorable price movements. They are commonly thought of as price "insurance," i.e., for a premium you are entitled to full price protection when prices move through a specified level. A price Cap protects against rising prices without sacrificing the advantage of falling prices. Floors are the opposite of Caps; they guard against falling prices while preserving upside price potential.
With a Cap or Floor, the full cost of the protection is predefined - it is equal to the premium paid for the Cap or Floor. There are no potential future costs related to price movements.
[Spread 7]

Cap: End-User example

CropFood, a manufacturer of urea, wants to develop business with a prospect that has difficulty passing on price increases, but is expected to pass on decreases without delay.
To distinguish itself from competitors, CropFood ensures the prospect that for the next 12 months, CropFood will never ask for a price increase above its very competitive product prices, no matter how high ammonia feedstock prices go. And to sweeten the deal, CropFood agrees to promptly pass on all feedstock price decreases as soon as they are announced, no questions asked.
The prospect likes CropFood's straightforward pricing policy and agrees to purchase 1,000 tons of urea per month. In order to honor its pricing promise without putting the company's margins at risk to rising prices, CropFood purchases a one-year price cap on ammonia at $120/ton for 12,000 tons per month. The cost of the cap is $2/ton.
[chart 3]

DURING THE LIFE OF THE CAP AGREEMENT:

?        CropFood continues to buy ammonia from its regular suppliers at market prices.
?        Enron receives a $2/ton premium from CropFood for the $120/ton price cap.
?        If the market price for ammonia goes above $120/ton in a given month, Enron will pay the difference to CropFood. If prices are less than $120/ton, CropFood enjoys the lower market prices for its feedstock.
?        The effective cost of ammonia paid by CropFood is the floating market price up to a maximum of $120/ton plus the $2/ton premium paid for the cap.
?        CropFood has, for a known cost of $2/ton captured new business by meeting the customer's price needs without putting the company at risk to ammonia prices in the process.
 
[Spread 8]

Floor: Producer example

AmmoniaKing, a producer of ammonia, anticipates a plant turnaround starting in three months time and lasting for two months. The company intends to build extra ammonia inventory of 50,000 tons over the next three months to meet sales obligations during the two-month period the plant is taken off-line. There is concern that prices could soften over the two-month turnaround period, squeezing the margin on the excess inventory to be sold during that time.
To protect against a sharp price reduction during the turnaround period, AmmoniaKing buys a two-month ammonia price floor today that becomes effective in three months time. The floor price is set at $145 and costs $3/ton. The total premium payable by AmmoniaKing is $150,000 (50,000 tons multiplied by $3/ton).
[chart 4]
 

EACH MONTH DURING THE LIFE OF THE PRICE FLOOR:

?        AmmoniaKing sells excess ammonia inventory to its customers at prevailing market (floating) prices.
?        Enron receives a $3/ton premium from AmmoniaKing for the $145/ton price floor.
?        If the floating price for ammonia is greater than the $145/ton floor price, there is no action under the floor contract. The effective price received by AmmoniaKing for its ammonia is the floating market price less the $3/ton premium.
?        If the floating price goes below the $145/ton floor price to $140/ton, for example, AmmoniaKing will receive the $5/ton difference from Enron. In this instance, AmmoniaKing effective price for ammonia is $142/ton - the $145/ton floor price less the $3/ton premium.
?        In summary, the price floor has established a minimum price of $145/ton with full upside potential at a known cost of $3/ton.

Here is one of the EOL - no-more-confirms amendments that the confirm desk is very anxious for us to get in place.  Brent, Mary and Francisco have each don one or two already so they may have some insights into how to massage the form.  The attached version has already been revised by the physical power and gas folks.

 

Here is the next no-more-confirms amendment.  I was hoping to wait until we had comments to the first set before working on these but the confirm desk is anxious that we move them forward.

Mark, 

Attached is the BP EOL amendment.

Stacy 

 

I seem to remember that you have had some experience dealing with the Texaco folks so maybe it makes sense for you to handle this one.

Mark, 
Attached is an EOL Amendment for the Texaco entities.  EPMI does not trade power with Texaco so Janet does not need to see this amendment.

Stacy 

 

FYI

Mark:
You probably would have caught this anyway, but it looks like BP Amoco's (your CP's) name has changed.
Janet  
See message below...Looks like BP changed their name to BP Corporation North America Inc.

Kim,

Can you inform Janet that BP has changed its name recently.  New name is BP Corporation North America, Inc.

Thanks,
Joe

Here's BP Amoco!!!  She's on fire today!!!!  Hope the other attorney's are too!
Mark and Stacy:
Because paragraph 2 of our form contemplates that there are annexes attached, if there end up being none after each group has had its input, I suggest that the last attorney reviewing the agreement delete that paragraph.  (Note that Power has no Annex to attach to BP's version.)  Thanks!

Just to let you guys know... I'm working like an animal here but at least I'm still employed.  Every now and then I kinda wish I'd been one of those laid off last week instead of the one who had to tell people they were no longer employed but I don't have enough to retire on any more so I guess I still need the job!  Hope you guys are doing well.  Any plans for New Years?

Sorry Joe, I haven't seen this one.  Have you tried Elizabeth?

Has our draft letter gone to the CFTC?  I assume it already has, but unfortunately it turns out Vicki's comments were not in the version of the letter that I forwarded to you.  I have taken a look at them and am not sure they are critical but thought I'd better get them to you in case we send a revised letter down the road.

	Yes, I spoke with Mark on last Thursday and the revisions are complete.  He will let me know today when the

I have another counterparty that may want to ring out some ATM Chicago

Anne's been working too hard.  She meant Financial masters.
Here is a draft of the Adoption Template for the Physical Masters.
The marked version is marked against Travis's previous draft of the Power agreement.
 
Here are revised templates for the adoption by ERMT of the Power and Gas Masters.  Note that adopted gas masters should provide for two-way payments.  
 
Please provide any comments to these templates to Steve as soon as possible, particularly with respect to the new paragraphs 3 and 4.

Anne, I just received your vmail -- sorry for the delay.  Attached is a

Please let me know if you would like us to participate in discussions or if
you would like to report back any changes that Enron requires.

Contact Stephen Douglas re: Bill Bradford deal.  Otherwise none.

Please provide by e-mail a reply to me by 2:00 p.m. Central Standard Time today with a list, to the best of your knowledge, of the following (if any), as it relates to the ENW group of companies:

"Each transaction or series of transactions from January 1, 1999 to the date hereof, and each currently proposed transaction, or series of transactions, that is of a value of $500,000 or more , to which Enron Corp. or any of its Subsidiaries (defined as being owned 50% or more, or controlled, directly or indirectly, by Enron Corp.) was or is a party, and in which an officer or officers of Enron or any of its Subsidiaries (officer being a VP or above) has a personal financial interest."

Sorry for the quick time fuse.

Regards, Alan

Thanks.

This has been a challenge for us in other deals - in a recent transaction
that Mary and I worked on, we had to limit the types of legal services to
be provided to ministerial/information gathering for fear of losing
privilege.  I need to think about this and talk to a couple people to see
if we can come up with a workable solution, so I'll get back to you on
this.

If Man is not holding margin in violation of the Customer Agreement, it doesn't seem to me like we should send the letter.

ENA received a letter 10/30/01 stating that Man would begin margining on a risk-weighted basis rather than using the NYMEX SPAN calculation.  This is prohibited under our futures agreement.  Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances).  Man has never claimed that the $25M was "additional margin".  ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.

ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.  A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year. 

I understand that John Arnold intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas.  However, this information changes frequently.

Joe Deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to Louise Kitchen.  Let me know if you need further information.

I have reviewed the attached draft with Anne, Travis and Marcus.  For purposes of maintaining consistency between the 3 disciplines, I would appreciate your using the attached for any further ISDA Adoption Agreements you may have.  Anne's suggested Item 7 to Scheule B should cut down your due diligence workload appreciably regaring the various places that Affiliate is used in the Master. 

The main change from the draft Anne sent out yesterday evening is that it "reinserts" the Schedule C with Credit information.

Please call with any question.

Hi Kayalyn - Linda asked me to forward this - I'm at my company's office in London.

Am unable to call NYC from London - all lines busy.  I received your fax and it looks fine.  I don't understand the last sentence of section 6.3 because of the cross reference to section 10.3.  Please check the cross reference to section 10.3.  Thanks.

I ma leaving for the evening but was hoping we might get together for a bit tomorrow some time to go over where things stand on Swapco and what needs to be done.  Can you leave a voice mail for me on 713-853-7459 letting me know what your schedule is like for tomorrow and when would work best for you?

Steve - in order to draft the contribution agreement for RMT to transfer
the ETP partnership interests to swapco, we will need to review the
partnership agreements (1) for required consents, etc. and (2) to schedule
the interests in the agreement.  Do you have copies of the appropriate
partnership agreements and, if not, do you know from whom we could get
them?  Thanks.

Add Christian Yoder and Carol St Clair to list.

So here's how it works.  The attached spreadsheet has three MASTER worksheets:

(i)  Energy  Operations 
(ii) IT
(iii) Support Services

All the rest of the worksheets are back up documentation for the rankings.

Please identify the people on the Masters who actually have contracts.

Thanks

Mark - we also need to make sure if we use an existing bank account that we
immediately discontinue any cash sweep upon its purchase by swapco - I
don't know if there was one for this account, but we just need to make
sure.

Under normal circumstances we would not need an Enron Corp. resolution and in fact the Corporate Secretary and Treasury offices can handle moving the money around so we do not propose to do an Enron Corp. Board action unless you folks think it is absolutely necessary.  The other resolutions we can get in place easily.

I think Notre Dame agreement contains restrictions on what we can do with capital stock of subsidiaries after it is signed -- does that mean we need to issue the Golden Share today?

I got your note and relayed it to Linda.  Our prayers are with you.

Thank you for relaying the message.
We are all riveted to the news as well.  From a window down the hall, I saw the second trade tower collapse.  It is truly horrible.  Many people have left the office, but those who live outside of Manhattan are stuck here.  I'm still here, waiting to hear the whereabouts of my husband who was en route to court in Brooklyn this morning, before walking home to the upper west side.
Be well.

Hi Kayalyn - Linda asked me to forward this - I'm at my company's office
in London.

Am unable to call NYC from London - all lines busy.  I received your fax
and it looks fine.  I don't understand the last sentence of section 6.3
because of the cross reference to section 10.3.  Please check the cross
reference to section 10.3.  Thanks.

Under normal circumstances the Enron Treasury group would invest cash on deposit in something like overnight commercial paper obligations or something like that.  Can we let them do that with ERMT's money?  Would we need a written authorization to ENE to do that (we don't usually do that for other subsidiaries)?

I'm not sure.  There was a comment by Sally Beck at the last meeting that she was trying to figure out which of her direct reports should be attending so maybe it has something to do with that.  I don't really know what changed though.

Mark, do you know  any of the details of the new reporting structure referred to below????
Due to recent changes in the reporting structure at ENW, changes were necessary to the structure of the ENW Weekly Executive Staff Meeting on Thursdays at noon.

The staff meeting will now be held bi-weekly, beginning November 15, in the ECS 04990 conference room.  You will continue to get a reminder on the Tuesday before the meeting.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

We have a few items to add in the Services Agmt. as services to be provided:

Risk assessment and control services including, without limitation, credit, underwriting and market risk analysis.

Risk management services including, without limitation, position and limit reporting and price curve validation.

Transaction confirmation, settlement, scheduling, dispatch and volume management.

Human resources support including, without limitation, payroll, compensation and benefits.

At the end of the current section 2.1(vi) please add "including, but not limited to, SAP."

Finally, we need to include Enron Corp. and Enron Net Works as parties providing services (e.g. Enron Corp. is where risk assessment is, Net Works has all of the IT).

Louise just wants global natural gas and power.  I think we should throw in "related products" just to be safe.

Attached hereto is the list of products for which Swapco will have an exclusive license to the EOL Software.

Can you take a quick look at this?

Mark,
I will call you re this doc.

Attached is both Corporate Account Agreement and final Supplement.

 <<gscap.pdf.pdf>>  

FYI

During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay 

One more thing we need to consider is office space.  Can I just add that in as a "service"?

Attached is a revised services agreement to reflect your comments - you
will note that I don't know the actual corporate name or form for Enron Net
Works, so that will need to confirmed.  Please let me know if you have any
further thoughts or comments on the attached.  Thanks.

Thanks  Stuart, I'll add it in.  Two other questions -- should the performance of the services be delayed until requested at a later date (there isn't much need for it today) and what do we do about the fees?

We can say the following:

Provision of office space, which may include office space in the current
principal offices of the Administrator or such other location in Houston,
Texas or other location as Adminstrator may occupy, and such other office
space as may be reasonably required by ERMT from time to time during the
term of this Agreement.

Let me know if you want me to add this or if you are going to do it on your
end - Thanks.

I hope all of your loved ones and friends are OK.  

I'm obviously not able to get back to Houston today as originally planned.  Continental has me booked on a flight on Sunday -- assuming they're back up to full schedule by then -- so I plan to be back in the office on Monday morning.  I will continue to work from the London office and you can reach me at 011-44-207-783-6468 at the office (but I can't get voicemail here) or on the cell phone 011-44-7881-512-535 (where I am able to check messages).  I will also be checking voicemail in Houston from time to time.

I know it's hard to think about work issues much less concentrate, but it seems to me we need to start thinking about market disruption issues right away.  The NYMEX is the obvious issue and we need to find out which counterparties have affected transactions (such as using average of the entire month of NYMEX prices) and then review the relevant documentation.  With any luck there won't be many.  We also need to be alert to other price sources that might fail to publish.

I'll be in touch.

Thanks - can you guys draft up the Schedule I on a cost-plus basis?

I added the sentence on the fees to say something like at the request of or
directed by ERMT.  I think this works, because we should only owe fees to
the extent of services provided that we request - in the event we don't
request any, we shouldn't owe anything.

As far as the fee structure, I would think it would need to be cost or
cost-plus.  Obviously, cost-plus looks better from an arms-length basis.

Mark.Taylor@enron.com on 11/06/2001 11:06:57 AM
Thanks  Stuart, I'll add it in.  Two other questions -- should the
performance of the services be delayed until requested at a later date
(there isn't much need for it today) and what do we do about the fees?

    -----Original Message-----
   We can say the following:

   Provision of office space, which may include office space in the current
   principal offices of the Administrator or such other location in
   Houston,
   Texas or other location as Adminstrator may occupy, and such other
   office
   space as may be reasonably required by ERMT from time to time during the
   term of this Agreement.

   Let me know if you want me to add this or if you are going to do it on
   your
   end - Thanks.

   One more thing we need to consider is office space.  Can I just add that
   in
   as a "service"?

       -----Original Message-----
      Attached is a revised services agreement to reflect your comments -
   you
      will note that I don't know the actual corporate name or form for
   Enron
      Net

You can confirm that it is not regulated and send a copy of cert. of incorp. which Deb Korkmas should have if Tana doesn't

Mark:  How do you want to respond?  Sara

Hi Sara
No one here seems to know anything about ERMT Corp.
Can you confirm it's not a regulated entity?  (Public Utility, etc.)
Can we get a copy of its Cert. of Incorporation (whatever you have in your
files is fine.)
Anything else you can tell me about the activity of the entity would also be
helpful.

Thanks.

Sibyl:

Did you want me to dupe the Enron Corp. documents, i.e., change
signature lines?
I have a copy of the Corporate Account Agreement (including the

Yes, we might as well get one.

Mark, it looks like we will need a separate Tax id number for ERMT LLC per Stuart.  Do you agree?  Please advise.  Thanks, Deb

Please check with Mark Taylor or the tax guys, but if at all possible we
would like to have a separate EIN for the LLC - don't know if you always
have the same EIN as parent in LLC, but in our instance, the LLC is now
98.04% owned by RMT, and 1.96% owned by ENA.  We need to keep this entity
separate from its parent entities to the extent possible.

Deb.Korkmas@enron.com on 11/08/2001 03:30:18 PM
The EIN for ERMT LLC will be 76-0539176 which is the same as its parent
company, Risk Management & Trading Corp.  Deb

Deb Korkmas
    -----Original Message-----
   Deb - do you know if we have obtained EIN numbers for both ERMT LLC and
   ERMT Corp.?  I assume since we got a bank account we have one for Corp.,
   but didn't know about LLC.  I also assume that the Canadian counsel have
   received the proper tax ID or other info for ERMT Canada Corp.  Also,
   fyi,
   we will be changing the names of the US entities today to "NETCO
   Holdings
   LLC" and "The New Energy Trading Company".  I will check with Mark
   Taylor
   on the Canadian name change.  Thanks.

I'm in London.  I had a 2 week vacation planned with Bill in Greece but he is unable to join me so I think we'll do that another time.  Are you in London?  Germany?  If so do you want company?  Call me at 020 7491 7282, suite 18 or 020 7881 500 471 or reply to this e-mail and Mark will get a message to me.  

I honestly have never heard of either of those companies so don't know how to get them signed.  I expect these are part of other efforts where I am not on the "need to know" list.  If you know another Enron lawyer involved in those efforts I suggest you try them.

Andy Stidd of Global Securitization Services is going to still serve as the
independent director of CGNN and as the independent manager of MCTJ LLC.  I
will have him prepare and execute a new Services and Indemnity Agreement.
Should I forward it to you for execution?

Net Works is not a marketing affiliate.  We can make changes if they want us to.

I am not aware of any changes, are you?

Are there changes to the managers for the above entity?  Current managers are Derrick, Haedicke and Whalley; with many business units removing Derrick and Whalley to comply with the marketing affiliate rule, I did not know if your entities would be subject to the same.

Thanks for the note -- not to worry about the music.  I didn't have the necessary plug-in to play it and it wouldn't have been too loud anyway.  Thanks for the thought.  It's been pretty rough but the merger announcement should calm things a bunch.  

Mark

Sorry about the music on the card I sent you from work.  I don't have
sound capability on my computer there and didn't know until I got home
that there even was music!   If you get this one first, I recommend you
turn off your sound before you look at that card.

Love, Mother

Thanks for your note.  I've been thinking about you guys a lot, too.  I haven't been back to NYC since I left on the QE2 on 9/4.  Every time I heard about the conditions downtown I assumed you would be living in the country.  Sorry to hear you had to spend so much time in a hotel.  I know what that can be like and it loses any appeal it ever had very quickly.  Also sorry to hear about Mrs. B.  I hope she is doing better.

It has been chaotic and very depressing here -- not that our acquisition deal went through but that we ever got in the position to need the deal to go through in the first place.  In fact, when they finally announced it, my primary feeling was one of relief.  Things had gotten very bad.  Next time we get together I can fill you in on all the details.  At least for now I am still employed and my prospects are pretty good under the circumstances.

It's nice you have Key West to get away to.  You'll have to tell me about the house that you have available but under the circumstances I doubt that I could get away often enough to justify taking on a lease.  It would be nice to get away from here now and then though.  I was supposed to go to Ft. Lauderdale (did you know Ted was living there now?) a few weeks ago to visit and go to the big boat show there.  That trip had to be cancelled in all the confusion around here.  I had hoped to be in New York today for a seminar (where I was actually scheduled to speak) but cancelled that also.  With luck things will start to get back to normal here soon.  I'm really feeling the need for a break (and 4 days in Cincinnati next week don't count) so maybe I can come visit some time in the next couple of months.

Tell Don I said Hi.

Mark

Mark,
You have been in mind for days, longer in fact.  Every time I read about
Enron I think of you, and life has been scattered so I have not been able to
write.

Since the news now seems to be that your company is being bought by another,
it must be chaotic for you.  Let me know how you are and what is happening.
No doubt you will survive the mess, but hope it is not taking too much out
of you.

We are slowly getting back to normal, and every trip out of NY it great as I
am very tired of police check points and ID's.  Our building is livable now
for about a month, but still behind a barricade.  My mother has been in and
out of hospital, and so that has kept me stressed.  I sold a house in KW in
late Sept, so came down then for the closing.  Hated going back to NY as we
were still living in a hotel then....

I am in KW now, much enjoying being able to work here but missing Don.  Back
to NY next week, then here again end of month.  Planning a new addition on
the house, which is trying.  The little house next door is coming up for
rent as of Dec 1, in case you are interested, and I have decided to only
rent it to a single guy...Maybe you need a little winter getaway??

All best,
Hal

I haven't had any complaints from the post office.  In fact, we used to have a mailbox outside the gate.  It was a heavy metal box that required a key to open on a post set in cement. It was stolen (box, post, cement and all!) about three years ago and the mail carrier said that a gate key (their key does not fit any of the doors, mine or yours) was the best answer.  When I gave him the key, he put it on a huge chain with lots of keys that he uses on his route.  Has there been a problem?

On the electrician, I am going to have some work done at some point soon but am waiting for the design people to finish and suggest a good electrician -- so nothing has happened yet.  I'll keep you posted.

Mark

Mark,

I spoke to the postmaster and she stated that the
mailbox needs to be placed either to the side of the
gate or outside of the gate.  She said that the main
office does not like the fact that the postmasters
have a key to a residence.  I don't know whether you
have had the opportunity to speak with them yet.  If
so, please disregard.

Secondly, were you planning on having an electrician
come do any work on your house?  If so, I would like
to see if he/she can put a light in the bathroom as
well as electrical outlets.

I'll be awaiting your response.  Thanks!

Veronica

Please give me a call about this - I'm not sure it makes sense to say that the index varies each day.

Mark,

After leaving your office yesterday I realized that Larry May also requested a change in the index language used for these Options/Straddles. He says that the current language does not accurately reflect how the index is calculated for Daily Options because it uses the word "average". Please see changes below which will apply to all the indexes used for these options/straddles. Let me know if this looks okay to you we would like to get these changes into the system as soon as possible.

Current:
The Index for a Determination Period shall be the average of the Daily Midpoint price published on each calendar day during such Determination Period under the heading "Daily Price Survey" in the Louisiana -Onshore South - Henry Hub section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next succeeding Business Day. The Strike Price for a Determination Period shall be the South Louisiana - Henry Hub Index price in the "Market Center Spot-Gas Prices" section located in the first issue of Inside Ferc's Gas Market Report published during such Determination Period.

Proposed:
The Index shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on each calendar day during such Determination Period under the heading "Daily Price Survey" in the Louisiana -Onshore South - Henry Hub section of Gas Daily, or if a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price used shall be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next succeeding Business Day. The Strike Price for a Determination Period shall be the South Louisiana - Henry Hub Index price in the "Market Center Spot-Gas Prices" section located in the first issue of Inside Ferc's Gas Market Report published during such Determination Period.

Thanks for your note.  I am stranded in London and won't be able to get back until they start international flights again and I can get a seat.  Looks like that means Sunday afternoon at the earliest so please light a candle for me, too on Friday night.

Sorry about that.  I have been a bit preoccupied.  I put them in the car so I would remember to take care of it and took them with me this weekend so I could stop at the post office.  It turns out the neighborhood office is closed on Saturdays and of course they were all closed on Monday.  You should have them tomorrow.  

I just went to order the pictures we had taken at the photographer's in
August.  They wouldn't let me order without the proofs.  They said there
are more numbers on the back of the proofs than we have.  Do you still
have the proofs?  I hope so, because they haven't come in the mail yet.
We would really appreciate it if you could send them as soon as possible.
 It takes four weeks to get the finished pictures after they are ordered
and we want to put some wallet sized copies in Christmas cards.  I hope
things have calmed down for you some at work.  I really hate to bother
you with this.

Love, Mother

Here are the documents we discussed.

Mark,

Could you please review the Disclosure Consent and Waiver Acknowledgement attached regarding release of our counterparties transaction data to CommodityLogic and let us know your comments.

I will also forward the Data Services Agreement between EnronOnline and CommodityLogic.  I am aware that you were on Mark Greenberg's distribution list of October 30, but we want to make sure we have your comments to this agreement as well.

Thank you. 

Lisa

Erica -

Here is the consent document.  Please let me know Brad's pulse.  Thanks.

Mark

 

#2

Mark,

As referenced in my previous email today, please also review this document and provide me with your comments.

Thank you.

Lisa

Lisa -

Attached is a Data Services Agreement between EOL and CommodityLogic.  This agreement is intended to lay out the terms under which EOL will be providing the on-line transaction data to CommodityLogic for subsequent delivery to Enron customers.  I have not completed some of the technical aspects of the Schedules, but, rather, have left them to be determined by the appropriate EOL/CommodityLogic personnel.  I have also left the pricing blank as it was my understanding that this was being determined by Brad and Tom Gros.  This agreement is intended to go along with the waiver and consent document I previously provided.

Please look over the attached at your convenience and let me know your thoughts.  Please feel free to forward this to Savita or Brad as you deem applicable.

Thanks.

Mark

 

I think you guys should still go since the biggest chunk is already paid for - just be very careful to try and minimize expenses.

Mark, I really would like to attend this.....I'm already signed up, have reservations, and flight booked....it's showing up on my American Express...............please advise in light of current situation.....should I consult MEH or has this come up with anyone else

A couple of other ideas of things we might ask for (in addition to pulling this without comment from anywhere it is posted and committing to decline any representation against us in these matters):

1.  How many (who?) have responded to this?  Shouldn't we have the opportunity to clear the conflict?
2.  Commit to not give advice on any similar matter without inquiring as to the party on the other side (i.e. no "no-names" advice on these issues).

Thanks for that, Tim.  I am stranded here in London and this morning on my way into the office had the pleasure of my cab driver noticing that I am an American and taking a minute to point out exactly what this commentator has said: that we are under appreciated the world round, that the Marshall Plan was a remarkable departure from the accepted norms concerning how conquered nations should be treated and wondering what other nation, if it had the kind of military and economic might available to us, could have resisted, as we have, using it to totally dominate its neighbors if not the world.

In my view an assignment is the common legal method for accomplishing a sal=
e and purchase of a derivative transaction.  If they want to use sale termi=
nology that is fine but the assignment language should also be there.=20

Do you have a problem with the recharacterization as a purchase?

Brent,

Please review the attached suggested changes to the assignment agreement.  =
I have made changes to only one of the agreements, but I assume that any ch=
anges designated below will be made to both agreements.  Broadly speaking, =
my changes are designed to accomplish the following:

1.=09We want to characterize the Chricicahua LLCs as "Purchasers" to the ex=
tent possible and not an assignor.  Much of the redefined terms seek to acc=
omplish that objective.
2.=09The stated intent of Chircahua is to "invest" in the Transactions.  Th=
is language tries to bolster our argument that Chiricahua is wanting to inv=
est in the weather derivatives market but in so doing it is not acting as a=
 market maker with customers in these instruments.

I have no changes to the Master Agreement and expect that we want to minimi=
ze any changes to the extent possible.  I am happy, however, that we are tr=
ying to execute separate masters and not simply amend ENA's existing master=
.

Bret Wells
I was informed by Steve Douglas this morning that for tax reasons we need t=
o assign a number of weather transactions ENA entered into with XL Trading =
Partners Ltd. from ENA to Chiricahua III LLC and Chiricahua V LLC.  These t=
wo entities are ultimately wholly owned subsidiaries of ENA.  It is intende=
d that these entities will also enter into a few weather transactions direc=
tly with XL Trading Partners Ltd.  All of these transactions must have a te=
rm that ends no later than midnight December 31 2001. My understanding is t=
hat some time after these transactions are assigned or entered into the Chi=
ricahua entities will be liquidated sometime during the month of December a=
nd the weather transactions will be transferred to the parent entity which =
will subsequently be liquidated and moved to its parent and so on until the=
 transactions end up at ENA.  I would ask Bret or Steve to clarify the proc=
ess to the extent that I have left anything out or misstated the proposal i=
n broad terms.  If anyone needs a detailed explanation of the process pleas=
e call Bret at ext. 54390.

I would ask that everyone review the attached documentation in light of the=
 proposal above to give their views from a credit, Dynegy merger agreement,=
 legal, operational, commercial, corporate governance, and guarantor perspe=
ctive.

I am proposing the following draft documents for the assignment of the ENA =
trades to Chiricahua III and V entities. =20

 << File: ChiricahauIIIAssignment11-19-01.doc >>=20

I am proposing the following blacklined draft master agreements to be enter=
ed into between Chiricahua III and V and XL Trading Partners Inc.  These ar=
e based on the executed ENA/XL Trading master.  Please note that Chiricahua=
 and XL Trading would be providing parent guaranties in the form previously=
 agreed upon by ENA and XL Trading.  Deb, please note the documents to be d=
elivered section for the Chiricahua entities.  Will we need some new resolu=
tions passed?

I am attaching final drafts of the confirmations that were entered into bet=
ween the parties.  The first six will be assigned to Chiricahua III and the=
 second six will be assigned to Chiricahua V.  Rebecca, please note that I =
will need copies of the executed confirmations for these transactions or th=
e document that we sent to XL Trading if they have not yet signed the docum=
ent by tomorrow midday if at all possible so I can attach them as exhibits.

Chiricahua III

Chiricahua V

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments on the documentati=
on.  If you have any comments or questions relating to the tax purpose or p=
rocess of this series of transactions please call Bret Well at ext. 54390.

Regards,
Brent

There have been some ongoing disputes with AEP I think we should look into before cooperating fully.  I'll check with Elizabeth Sager and get back to you.

Hi Brad,

The VASCC has an id to EOL for the purpose of using the information to set rates. They had approached us through EES to ontain the ID and it was cleared by legal and Presto.

Savita

Mark-

Read the email from AEP below.  Please let us know if this is something we are comfortable doing, or at the very least something that we are required to do.

Hi Jay,

I think we are going to need to provide this information.

Savita

Savita,

Kelly Pierce with American Electric Power called this morning requesting historical data.  I asked customer to email his request to EOL and I would forward onto the appropriate group for approval. Could you please review customers request.  If EOL can provide him with this information his deadline is Monday, Dec 3rd.

Thanks, Kathy

Attention:  Kathy Moore

Kathy, thanks for your help.

The historical trading information we are looking for are for the Off-peak
monthly/bimonthly/quarterly and/or annual contracts for the 12 months of
December 2001 through November 2002 for the trading locations of Into
Cinergy and PJM West.

We need the trading information for these contracts for the 10 trading days
of October 8, 16, and 24 and November 1, 9, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

We would appreciate all of the information you have archived on these
contracts for these trading days, including, as available, bids and asks
(at closing, and if available, throughout the day), transactions and
volumes, and the day's volume-weighted prices.

As we discussed, the reason for this request is that American Electric
Power received an Order from the Virginia State Corporation Commission
(VASCC) to use EnronOnline market prices along with others for the
determination of competitive transition charges (wires charges) for VA
retail customers.

By this e-mail, AEP is also seeking approval to disclose the market prices
provided by EnronOnline to the VASCC, and other parties as necessary, as a
part of this filing.  This filing is due at the VASCC this coming Monday,
December 3rd.

Please contact me if you have any questions or require further information.
Thanks again for your help.

I called the Moorings about a Miami charter over New Year's and they said they are shutting down the entire location as of 11/30!  When I asked about any other locations that might still have boats left, she said they have a one week minimum for all charters at that time.  Sorry.

I'm fine.  I left you a voice mail this morning on your cell phone to let you know I'm OK and stranded in London.  Not a bad place to get stranded I suppose.  Linda and Amanda are here, too.  I'm working from the office here while they have fun on the town.  Actually, they seem to be spending a lot of time at the hotel watching the news, and I can't say that I totally blame them -- it seems almost disloyal to go out and have fun.  They were going to a play this afternoon and got tickets for us to see Mama Mia (the musical based on ABBA) for tomorrow night.  I was originally scheduled to fly back yesterday (Wednesday) and have been rebooked on a flight Sunday afternoon.  The hotel finally told me this morning that we can keep our rooms until then.  I hope the flights are running by then.

Kitty is being taken care of but I feel really bad having her be alone all this time.  Jim Avant was stranded in Austin for a day -- they had to take a taxi back to Houston the next day -- and Jamie said they would go over that afternoon.  

If you need to reach me, you can try the office number 011-44-207-783-6468, my UK cell phone number 011-44-778-351-2535 or the hotel number 011-44-207-491-7282.  It's kind of hard to get through some times since the lines to the US are often busy.

Hope you are doing ok through all this.  I'm just sort of numb.

Mark

Please e-mail me to let me know that everything is okay.

I think there is a real possibility here.  It would be extremely challenging commercially.

How do we convince customers to participate?
Two distinct areas:  (i) Existing portfolio of business and (ii) New business.

New business is easier in one sense since everything is at the money, who would say no to a AAA credit?  Still requires significant amendment to existing trading documentation and where existing trades are present, separating them out as not netting with new trades.

Existing business is easy for counterparties who are already in the money -- they will want the improved credit.  But how do we convince the out of the money side of the equation to participate?  This seem to me to be the biggest hurdle.

Issues:

Requires consent of customers and significant amendment of existing contracts.
	Adequate incentive for customers currently out of the money to participate?
	Might make more sense where no current positions exist.
	
Contract hurdles:

	Need to allow for termination by defaulting party so Enron (VMAC) will be able to control termination on default.
	Need the consent of counterparty to assign contract to VMAC.
	May require changing permitted credit support from counterparties (letters of credit probably don't work).

If we are attempting to put an existing book of business into the structure, an initial chunk of money will have to be given to VMAC to secure the existing out of the money side of the portfolio - how much is it and do we have that money?

It's not clear how the proposal allows for credit lines to and from counterparties.  That is, if we have given an aggregate $200 million credit line to out of the money counterparties and have only been given an aggregate $100 million credit line to in the money counterparties, will VMAC be satisfied with the mismatch.  Will we continue to control the amount of credit we give to customers?  If we go to 100% collateral requirements for all participating transactions, this is solved since there can't be a mismatch.  (Will customers agree to 100% collateral requirements - i.e. no credit lines?)

Once the supported/participating portfolio is out of the money, Enron will have to post collateral to VMAC.  If we fail, VMAC can default all participating/supported contracts.  

When all of the contracts are terminated with Enron as the defaulting party, the payments to and from counterparties are calculated on their side of the market.  Presumably VMAC will require some cushion to cover this.

Louise and John:

Here is a general description of the transaction we are negotiating with VMAC (Virtual Markets Assurance Corporation)-FSA (Financial Securities Assurance). FSA is an AAA rated insurance company large enough to provide us with a credible deal.  

Here are the deal highlights:

FSA would wrap Enron's credit exposure as follows:

1) In case of default FSA would liquidate the contracts sleeved to them by Enron and use the proceeds of in the money transactions to pay for out of the money transactions.

2) In case Enron is out of the money in the portfolio of trades sleeved to VMAC. FSA would pay the counterparties with the 100% collateral previously posted by Enron and managed on a day to day basis.

FSA has mentioned the possibility of extending a line of credit to Enron based on its net collateral position (~$1.3 billion as of today) and the net mark to market position (~ $1.4 billion to date). Haircuts on the line of credit would have to be negotiated and might be significant.

FSA-VMAC would receive as compensation the fee structure described under terms and conditions. Under the current structure the only risk FSA- VMAC is exposed to is the risk of simultaneous default by Enron and another counterparty and the operational risk of marking to market the positions and liquidating the contracts. 

Please find enclosed the following:

1) Transaction structure : 	Describes the payment logic in case of default
2) Terms and conditions :	Describes the terms and conditions under negotiation for the contract
3) Collateral Haircuts : 		Describes the collateral haircuts on the securities posted to FSA to guarantee our net mark to market position (if out of the money)
4) FSA snapshot
5) FSA rating: 			AAA qualification of FSA by Moody's

Please feel free to contact me or Brad Richter to clarify any doubts with respect to this,

Yes, assuming I get home before the office closes.

I am feeling good as well.  I will move up a few spots this week.

I called the 'Stone. They said they are short staffed and may not be able to
put it inside the apartment today. So if its not in there when you get home,
can you pick it up from the office?

I have decided I am going home for Thanksgiving.  I want to be there for my mom and family.

I go over the b-plan everyday of my life.  I will try to get John to go through 50+ pages and the preso.

Mike, 
I need you and John to go over the bplan and preso today. 
Thanks.

It looks like I'll be able to get back on Sunday.  I was originally schedul=
ed to fly back yesterday (Wednesday) but of course all the flights were can=
celled yesterday and today.  With luck they'll be back up to full schedules=
 by Sunday when I have a reservation.  I'll let you know if that changes. =
=20

It's interesting to hear what your reactions were since they very closely p=
arallel my own.  I heard as I was coming back into the office after lunch o=
n Tuesday and there was a small group standing around a computer screen wat=
ching an internet news feed.  My first reaction was that it had to be some =
kind of elaborate internet hoax and I still have a sense of disbelief.  I d=
read my next trip to New York when I will have to see the skyline with my o=
wn eyes.  Linda and Amanda are also stranded here and they tend to spend a =
lot of time watching the news.  After the first hour or so I just couldn't =
bear to watch and preferred to check in now and then for updates.  But then=
 what else was there to do except sit and be stunned.  Even today it's stil=
l hard to concentrate on much of anything.  I guess in a sense I'm lucky th=
at I have work matters to keep me busy.  Unfortunately, some are directly r=
elated to the tragedy.  There's no doubt the world changed on Tuesday and t=
his will always be with us in some way.

All sorts of odd thoughts keep coming to mind.  I have wondered several tim=
es if Dad remembers when he and I went into one of the towers (it must have=
 been when they were quite new) and tried to get to the top to see the view=
.  We were told there was no public observation area so we just took an ele=
vator up as far as we could get and got out on a floor that was still under=
 construction and went over to the windows to marvel at the view.  Remember=
 the view from my apartment in New York?  And I was on the QE2 the last tim=
e it will ever go past those buildings (forgive the bad grammar but you kno=
w what I mean).

We're going to try and have as good a time as possible here.  I'm working d=
uring the days and joining Linda and Amanda for dinner in the evening.  Tom=
orrow we're going to see a West End musical.  Saturday we'll probably go to=
 a couple of museums.  Hope you are keeping well.

Love, Mark

Thank you for your e-mail and phone call!  We received both and were
really sorry not to be here when you called.  I guess we were both at
work.  When we were watching this tragedy on TV Tuesday, we couldn't
remember exactly when you were coming home, so called your office.  Holly
called us back to say that you were due back Wednesday.  That was a
relief because we knew you weren't in the air on Tuesday.  It just dawned
on me this morning that your e-mail was from you usual address so you
could probably receive mail in London at that address as well as send.

Tim called about 10:45 Tuesday morning to say that they weren't allowing
anyone to leave his base so he was stuck there for awhile but Sharon was
OK and going home.  Either his information was erroneous or the base was
opened not long thereafter because he was also allowed to leave and both
were home by early afternoon.  I was concerned about how long it would
take Sharon to drive home because 20 years ago when I was driving home
during a storm and all the government offices were closing, it was a zoo.
 It turned out that Sharon drove right along the river and up Rock Creek
Park with hardly any traffic since the streets between hers along the
river and the rest of the city were already closed so no streets were
emptying into hers.

Tim Bunce was in the air on his way to California.  They brought his
flight down in Dallas and he was planning to drive home from Dallas.
Someone at my office told me yesterday that her brother was stuck in
Houston and was driving back to Cincinnati!

Nick's sixth grade class in Wyoming was told about the situation. I don't
know if they let them watch the TV.  Janet was oblivious--out doing
errands--so there was noone at home.  However, Ivan stopped by the house
for some reason just when Nick called home.  Nick was concerned about you
and Tim because he couldn't remember where you live.  That really touched
me, that he would think of you and that the school let him call home.  I
called them when Tim called to let us know they were all home safely and
that you were in London.

At the time this was happening we had no idea where would be struck next.
 You have probably heard that the FBI now says that the flight that went
into the Pentagon was originally going to hit the White House and that
the flight that went down over PA undoubtedly was bound for a more
populated target.    We were watching when the towers collapsed and found
it surreal--unbelievable.  We watched for some time after that but
finally we couldn't stand it.  We just had to turn off the TV and do
something else.  That seemed almost dishonorable though--to look outside
on a beautiful sunny, peaceful day here.  We were having a primary
election for mayor in the city so we went to vote because that was
something positive we could accomplish.  During the rest of the day we
checked the status of the situation regularly, but didn't watch for a
prolonged time.  It was impossible to concentrate on much of anything.

Now I feel that we need to return to normal activities as much as
possible to keep our little part of the country running as usual.  The
terrorists will have done even more damage if we don't.

I imagine Enron has people marooned all over the world.  At least you
have an Enron office where you are.  I should think that would be better
than being stuck somewhere in Canada, wondering if you should drive home.
 I hope they are providing you some space where you can accomplish
something.  I imagine you are keeping the phone lines busy to Houston
these days.  I just read in the Wall Street Journal this morning that the
Y2K plans are paying off for some companies who had alternate plans for
communication difficulties and even "bunkers" or alternate offices in
place that they are now using.

This will surely be a test of our president and his government.  I hope
they are up to it.

Please let us know when you finally get home.

Love, Mother

Adam,

A few things. 
 
	- Mainly next week this floor will not be in high spirits.  The layoffs will be next week.  EGM and EIM will be hit  	  hard 
	- John asked about bonuses (also, mentioned he had 3 job offers).  George said should have an idea within a few weeks

Paul,

Can we get a breakdown of how much Enron gives to soccer and what does it pay for?  

A proposal has been brought forward regarding next season:
Do we want to have 3 refs at the game (ie, a referee and 2 linesmen)?
The cost would increase from $20 a game to $60ish a game.

Some teams have suggested that this is not necessary as this is in fact a recreational league.  I tend to agree.

Let me know your thoughts, and I will pass them on to the league.

Not much said about our group, except he has a direct line to Walley and has spoken with Dynegy.  He feels like they are excited to get us and that they mentioned "that they are good at being number 2."  He also mentioned a few companies have asked if the coal group was for sale as a whole.  He listened but told them no thanks.  Sounds like a few small changes in our group but nothing drastic.  George did say we have working capital (we didn't for 2 days).  Not sure if that means coal or coal and emissions.

Didn't specify what groups will be hit the hardest, he only said EGM and EIM. 

Oh, by the way my job offers are pouring as well.  To many to count!!!!!  It is hard to do work with all the head hunters calling him every hour.  Oh wait, just kidding!   

Makes sense. I'm sure he does. I've got 3 my self and there is a larger need for experienced coal traders. What groups will be hit hardest and did he provide any specifics about our group?

I think he looked at the preso and maybe 25% of the b-plan.  We did not talk about it, yet.  He said it looked good, but he got bored so he stopped reading.  He may be waiting for you to come back in town to discuss.  I told him you would be back Monday.  That is the latest.    

You two go over the bplan?

I understand.  I am not the one holding you up.  I printed out both documents for him to read.  John doesn't take commands from me.  I will make any revisions he has made on his printed copies tomorrow.

I want the next rev done before Monday so I can go from there.

I just spoke with Tom Hartman of San Joaquin Power.  He wants up to 20 HGA NOx ERCS.  I told him I would have to check.  He wants to move quickly.  His number is 832-496-0123.  I know we do not have any, but I wanted to see if an arb was possible before we tell him we do not have any.

I'll email him again. 
 Trevor Woods

I understand.  I am not the one holding you up.  I printed out both documents for him to read.  John doesn't take commands from me.  I will make any revisions he has made on his printed copies tomorrow.

I want the next rev done before Monday so I can go from there. 
 Trevor Woods

I think he looked at the preso and maybe 25% of the b-plan.  We did not talk about it, yet.  He said it looked good, but he got bored so he stopped reading.  He may be waiting for you to come back in town to discuss.  I told him you would be back Monday.  That is the latest.

I didn't want to talk price with him.  He saw our ERCs (that we just sold for $15,000) on website and called Kevin's line.  I was told to pick up the phone.  I told him somebody would call him back.  Either you or I would if you didn't want to call him.  He wanted to move fast, and he mentioned he used brokers in the past.  

If none are out, I think we should call and tell him.    

Who is that and how do you know him?  I haven't seen any come on since we sold some. What was his bid?

I put it in my original message below.  It is 832-496-0123.  Tom Hartman with San Joaquin Power. I imagine a natural.  Are you going to call him today?

Is he a broker or a natural?  I've heard about the company through cantor. He's not going anywhere.  Everyone says they want to move fast then the jack around. You got his number?

I just got back from the greenhouse gas meeting.  The meeting was good. But you will be retired before that program is worth anything as far as a good trading program is concerned. 

John, said he talked with you on the phone about the b-plan.  I added a table of contents, and if John gives me anything to add I will.

John, I got a six hour drive tomorrow, so I was thinking of taking a half day, so I can spend a little more time with my mom.

Any objections?

Who says that John Massey is not a nice guy?  

You might as well take the whole day off - Not much going on around here - enjoy some time with your mother - 

John, I got a six hour drive tomorrow, so I was thinking of taking a half day, so I can spend a little more time with my mom.

Your emissions analyst

From what I have heard, this looks pretty good.  But I wonder if paragraph 1(c) is correct.  Is this what was agreed or should this refer to any spread transaction including a NYMEX, COMEX or Platt's price and another price (whether one of those 3 or not)?  And finally, I don't understand the penultimate paragraph at all but since you guys are closer to the discussions it may make sense to you.  Can you guys confirm this with the traders and report our comments and/or agreement to ISDA?

Thanks!  Mark

I am doing her thing on Saturday in the middle of nowhere Texas.  Kind of a compromise.  My thing Thursday.   

John told me to take off as early as I want tomorrow for the drive.  So I think I shall.  I called my boy at San Joaquin.  

  

Atta boy. Probably a good choice. Your girl okay with it?  GHG is a snoozer. Go ahead and call your boy. Tell him we're checking on some things.

Duke University football practice was delayed for two hours yesterday in the midst of what was an anthrax scare. One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to look down and notice a unknown white powdery substance on the practice field. Third-year Blue Devils head coach Carl Franks immediately suspended practice while the FBI was called in to investigate. After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the white substance unknown to the players was the goal line. Practice was resumed when FBI special agents decided that the Blue Devils, winless in their last 22 games, would not be likely to encounter the substance ever, ever again.

Kelly,

I am going to use my Auburn ticket this weekend.  I am also trying to find one for Kerry and an ID.  Any tickets?  Also, people may be calling you to sell a ticket for $10.  I e-mailed them off of Universitytools.com.    Last time I used Mindy's ID which may work again.

Did anybody use my Ark ticket?

Mike

 

Trevor, the only change I made was in 1.6.   I put my changes in red.  This is almost exact wording from the TNRCC website.  Everything else concerning the transfer looked good.

While this statement makes reference to energy, it seems to me it might also apply to metals transactions.  I don't know if we have affected transactions or not.  If so, you may care about this.  My impression is that the Houston commodities traders will be signing off on this, possibly with minor comments, as early as this morning.  If you guys want to make comments (maybe have metals excluded if our traders disagree with the approach), please let Sara Shackleton or Barbara Gray know as soon as possible.

I put your $500 check on your bed.  Nice ZERO points this week.  Do you not want the $630?  I only pulled a 5.  Really hurts me.  But mathematical I still have a chance.

Yes, assuming I get home before the office closes.

I am feeling good as well.  I will move up a few spots this week.

I called the 'Stone. They said they are short staffed and may not be able to
put it inside the apartment today. So if its not in there when you get home,
can you pick it up from the office?

Mary or Lisa,

How does the agreement with EEA work?  Do we pay there a specified amount each month or do they charge per hour?  Please advise.

Thanks,
Mike

Trevor,

This e-mail is attempting to answer the request made by you and Scott a few weeks ago. 

Attached are my projected balance for 2004 NOx SIP CALL.  It is based on numbers from EEA (environment consultants), EPA website, NOx SIP Call model, and new generation database.  The confidence level for overall balance is not that high.  The OTR states only need to reduce 15% from 2001 to 2003 to be in compliance.  They have some SCRs already built and the plans for the other SCRs needed.  The non-OTR states are far more dirty than the OTR states.  The big question mark is the cost of technology that will be available for the 2004 states.  I believe that there will be a demand for allowances.  I believe the NOx SIP Call market to be a short at this point.  People think it is worse than it really is.

Also, I can make a price forecast.  The confidence level would be low on the price forecast.  What else do you want here?  

 

Mike Taylor

FYI . . .

Below is written by our environmental consultant EEA

>>
Based on the preliminary emissions data for 2001 just 
released, the allowance surplus for this year is 23,189 tons 
bringing the total bank at the end of the year to 83,778 tons.  This 
would mean a flow control value of 0.26 or a discount factor of 0.63 
for 2002.  The exact flow control/discount values cannot be 
calculated right now because they will depend on how many 
banked allowances are used for compliance this year and also on 
the implementation of the Maryland consent decree which the state 
and EPA probably wont figure out until next year.  But we are 
pretty much in that range.

I am leading the league in fantasy.  No worries.

Yeah, 3-2 most probably.  One of his lines was a little out of wack.  Maybe 4-1 if you got that bet off.  

Derek, said his computer at home would not pull it up.

yeah, i found it, it was buried in-between too much junk mail. Any word on
how Dr. Bob did this week? 

Raj,

Things are tough.  People are thinking tomorrow is the day for a lot of layoffs for non-core groups.  

40% chance we merge with Dynegy is what some people are saying.  Bankruptcy is our other option.

The working environment is not good. The firm needs to lay off people now, as opposed to dragging it out.     

I think the good groups will be sold off to the highest bidders, or competitors just buy up all our talented people when the company under.

Any news about your job offer?  Are you looking again?

Mike
 

Hey Mike!

Hope you had a great thanksgiving weekend. I used it to check out NYC!

Anyway, what's your take on the future of the firm? And how are the
employees reacting so far? It's difficult to recall a weekday when the
WSJ does not carry an
Enron-related article. And now it seems the merger is doubtful.

Rajneesh

Ok, let me know if you got an extra ticket.

no your arkansas ticket went to waste. i am hoping mom and michelle will come to this game.  mom can probably use nick's ticket and kerry may be able to use amanda's ticket and id if she doesn't go.  i will know for sure by like wed.  i don't know if mom will even come or not.  anyway i will buy one if someone calls me for you. 

love

 Kelly

I think Sara Shackleton was the last Enron lawyer to have worked on this.

I was just speaking with Jan Aspuru - Director of their Fuel Services Division - and he tells me that they have not been able to get their ISDA completed with Enron and therefore have been doing all their swaps business with MS and Goldman. He said they have a 10 year coal purchase agreement and buy natural gas from us, but the ISDA had gotten bogged down between legal teams. I don't know what the legal issue is and neither did he, but his attorneys told him that whatever language we wanted in (which our attys said was minor) his attys felt was a major change - plus neither MS nor Goldman required the same language. Since they don't need the change for them, they see no reason to agree to it with us.

Since I'm not familiar with your group, could you tell me who is handling this so Jan and I can understand the issue a little better? Thanks,

Since this is for someone in the Governor's office, I have no objection.  I think we need to be careful when regulators who might have an interest in regulating the system are asking.

Please see below.  Any thoughts on regulatory or legal implications?

Let me know when you get a chance.

Thanks,

Guest ID's are usually valid for two weeks. We can go longer than two weeks. How long do you want him to have access for? Finally it is probably a good idea for mark Taylor to know that a regulator is asking for access to EnronOnline. He may want to suggest an appropriate period of time for the access.

Lisa Lees is in charge of customer access but I usually authorise anything more than 2 weeks.

Take a look at the following request.  How long are guest ID's usually good for?  I'm not in favor of giving him access forever, but can we go longer than 2 weeks?  Last question: who in your group is in charge of things like this so I don't have to bother you with it?

Thanks,
Brad

I hope you are enjoying your new job!  Sounds like a great opportunity.    I need to ask you for a favor.  We are working with the Wyoming Govenor and the Wyoming Business Council to develop positive relations between Enron and the State of Wyoming.  Paul Kauffman is trying to get the Govenor to support his ideas regarding the RTO in the West and we are working with them to manage some of their price risk on their royalties as well as support our development efforts in the state.

One thing that would help us in our relations is to help the Govenor's staff understand Enron's market making capabilities.  In order to do this I would like to get a member of his staff access to EOL.  He would need read only access, but I would not want him to be turned off after 2 weeks.  If you can help me with this I would really appreciate it.

His name is Shawn Taylor, and his e-mail address is staylo2@state.wy.us

If someone can call me I will help orchestrate his registration.

My number is 303-575-6473.

Thanks 

Mark

I am stranded in London - there are worse places these days - but hope to get back tomorrow (Sunday).  Glad you are well.

I hope you are not stranded somewhere. We are  fine.

I made it back to Houston last night.  Incredible security at the airport in London -- it was a mob scene.  In addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carry-ons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate.  I saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage -- I couldn't really hear what it was all about.  We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course but it sure is good to be home.  

So good it was London. I was worried because like me you travel so much. I
can't tell you how many phone calls I have had this past week. Not everyone
is familiar with NYC geography of course and knowing I travel, were
concerned. This is all just so horrible. Talk to you when you get back.

After a two and a half hour delay -- mostly caused by the extra security -- we finally got off the ground yesterday and I am now back in Houston.  I talked to Amanda after I checked in and she said you were on the train to the airport.  Did you have any trouble?

I made it back to Houston last night.  Incredible security at the airport in London -- it was a mob scene.  In addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carry-ons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate.  I saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage -- I couldn't really hear what it was all about.  We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course while I was in London but it sure is good to be home.   

I'm surprised that under the circumstances American won't just do it.  Linda and I both had to reschedule our flights and did it directly with the airline (Continental for me and Virgin for Linda).  Of course, in our cases the original flights were cancelled.  I don't have the Cunard reservations number here and haven't been able to access the web site this afternoon.  I will get it for you when I get home.  The fax number for the guest relations department is (305)463-3030.

In a sense I felt safer in London than here.  Once we got off the QE2 we weren't doing anything that would have made us attractive targets and I don't anticipate attacks against individual Americans overseas -- at least not outside of Muslim countries.  While there was an increase in police presence around town, we didn't hear of any actual threats to Americans while we were in London.  Airport security has been better there than here for a long time and now has been beefed up even further.  The Europeans just have more recent experience at dealing with terrorists than we do.  The sword rattling doesn't bother me too much.  I've been overseas during some tense international times before and as long as you're in a friendly country it shouldn't be an issue.  On the other hand, it REALLY feels good to be home and I can sure understand your wanting to have her with you.

From her point of view, I think that while the Brits were all being very sympathetic and supportive, the tragedy just isn't as immediate there and so the impact on Amanda has been somewhat less than if we had been home.  Given that, I think she doesn't want to waste this opportunity to do something fun in Europe while she has the chance and is already over there.  For me I have to say it was hard to have any fun after Tuesday noon, although I tried to put a good face on it.  I don't know when that will improve since I'm still pretty depressed.  It's probably even worse for you since you were so much closer to things than I am.  The lawyer in me sees two sides: (a) a trip to Paris is just the thing to take your mind off of events and (b) why waste a week of vacation and travel hassles when you aren't going to have a good time no matter where you go.

Feel free to give me a call if you want to chat.

Good luck!

Mark

Mark -- I am trying to reschedule Amanda's return ticket.  I understand from
American that I have to do it through Cunard.  Do you have a contact over
there?  If not I'll just do the 800 number thing.

I want her to come home.  We will take a stateside vacation over the next
week and not linger over there.  What is your opinion?  Did you feel unsafe
there?  There is a lot of sword rattling going on right now.

Bill

Sounds like a plan to me.  Make sure they've given her an actual seat assignment or she may show up at the airport and get bumped.

You might try these:

In Sedona:
  Enchantment Resort (I recommend hiking!, jeep tours, spa)

In Scottsdale/Phoenix:
  Four Seasons Resort Scottsdale at Troon North (haven't been but it gets good reviews)
  The Phoenician (huge rooms, great spa, mother-of-pearl lined swimming pool)
  The Boulders (also highly rated)

At the Canyon
  El Tovar Hotel (reportedly the nicest hotel in the park, not necessarily up to Hayman standards but might work for a night)

In Tucson (pretty far from the Grand Canyon):
  The Lodge at Ventanna Canyon

Thanks for your thoughts Mark.  I may call you as well.  I think we have it
worked out.  I was able to change the return flight to tomorrow.  I am
working on putting together a quick trip out West as a consolation for
Amanda.  She always wanted to see Grand Canyon.  I know that pales in
comparison to a Paris cafe but it will have to do for now.  I am generally
dismissive of the risks of travelling but this event has affected me deeply.
And I think you are right that Amanda hasn't felt that yet.  I would love to
ignore it or downplay it but I can't.

Do you know of any spa/resort type places in the Southwest that would meet
the Hayman standard?  (I know you know what I mean by the Hayman standard).

Thanks again, Bill.

Looks good to me.  One remaining concern is that section (d) may not provide much protection.  According to the power trading lawyers who have worked with the FERC in the past, they never provide protection for what we would consider confidential commercial information even when they have the authority to do so.  If we want that kind of protection, it should be mandated, not made possible by regulatory action.  I'm not necessarily recommending a change, I just don't want anyone to be taking any comfort from section (d).

This is the language that I referred to in my email.  I have sent this to Brad and Greg as well.  I have been working with Brad to refine the language in a way that gives them the least amount of heartburn.

Let me know what you think.

Lisa

Linda  - Here is the draft changes to the Bingaman electricity bill for your discussion with Louise.  They draw from Ken Raisler's comments and Lisa's review.  Houston would prefer to have the language deleted, which John reports is highley unlikely.  John also reports that the changes should be simple and clean - we think these meet that criterea.

Thanks for making my morning.  I'm still grinning at the image of your bags going back and forth across the Atlantic.

I saw the emergency command center on TV the other night and it looked just like that huge room where we stood in line and checked in for the ship.  I think that's why they can't dock in ny.

Has Amanda made it back yet?

Andrea found the bags. They are still on the QE2 going back and forth across the ocean.  The QE2 can't come to ny. It is going to dock in boston on sept 28. They are going to ups our two bags to us from boston.

What about Noble?  Has he moved into his new place in midtown yet?

Amanda came back yesterday.  Bill didn't want to fly to Europe and Amanda was able to get on a flight back.  They are going to take a little vacation here in the U.S.

Skadden was amazingly lucky.  We have so many people it seems impossible that we didn't have anyone in the blast.  A messenger who works for a messenger service was delivering a package for us and he is unaccounted for.  And in the case of family members, so far only one associate has reported a missing brother.   It is so amazing how lucky we were.

I have a paralegal who lives in the blast area - Claudia Hong - but she came to work early that day.  She can't get in her apartment so I am looking for temporary housing for her.  She is on Oscar's couch ( you met Oscar at the party) right now.  But I have to find something better.  Let me know if you know anyone in Manhattan who has an empty apt for a week or two.

Keep in touch

Example 1

Party A calculates that it is in the money $100 (which results in a "Loss" to Party A from the termination)
Party B calculates that it is out of the money $98 (which results in a "Gain" to Party B from the termination)
There are no Unpaid Amounts

The Payment Amount is 50 percent of ($100 + $98) = $99
Since the Payment Amount is positive Party B (the Party with the net Gain) pays $99 to Party A (the party with the net Loss)

Example 2

Same as example 1 except Party A owes $150 in Unpaid Amounts to Party B and Party B owes Party A $12 in Unpaid Amounts

The Payment Amount is (a) 50 percent of ($100 + $98) plus (b) $12 minus (c) $150 = negative $39
Since the Payment Amount is negative Party A (the party with the net Loss) pays $39 to Party B (the party with the net Gain)

Let me know if you need any further explanation.

While I think the law actually works that way, we have avoided putting it in writing so far.  The way the web site works, the decision to accept or reject the offer happens almost instantaneously so the question is almost meaningless.  The time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they don't see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out.  I guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer?  The website doesn't provide a mechanism for that.  If we say it has to be in writing and delivered to the relevant trader, in practice it might not be an issue.

Mark:  We met briefly about 2 months ago when I interviewed here.  I just joined Wayne in the coal group and am working on a Master Coal Purchase and Sale Agreement.  The counterparty has suggested some language (highlighted below) which sounds o.k. to me.  However, Wayne suggested I run it by you to see if it worked with the way the website actually operates.  Please advise.

Thanks,

Such website is not, and shall not be construed as, an offer to buy or sell by ENA.  ENA may accept or reject Counterparty's offer at its sole discretion and Counterparty may withdraw offer at any time prior to acceptance at its sole discretion.  A Transaction shall be deemed executed at the time that ENA first signifies its acceptance of Counterparty's offer, accessible on such website.  ENA may also send a written confirmation memorializing the Special Terms and Conditions of a Transaction, but in the event of any conflict, the terms of the written confirmation shall prevail.

Mark, 
May I have your permission to proceed with ordering a new desktop hard drive for Samantha Boyd?   Please see supporting documentation below.  Thank you.

Keegan

Keegan:

If Samantha's machine has cratered, yes, it's okay with me to order her a new machine.  Please get with Jason Sherman regarding the standard desktop model to be ordered.  Thanks.

Good morning Janette,

I need to order Samantha a new desktop hard drive.  With your permission, and Mark Taylor's permission, what model do you suggest I order?  Please advise.  Thanks!

Keegan

Keegan,

Samantha's hard drive crashed today, I'm having hardware look at it, but you might want to speak with Janette about ordering Samantha a new machine, she has an older compaq desktop that has had several major hardware failures over the last 6 months. Hardware can replace the hard drive but in order to save in time and productivity, a new machine might need to be considered. Let me know.

After more than three decades of living in Ohio, I know how to be an
Ohioan.  While I was learning,
written guidelines would have been helpful. So I've written some to
assist others.

1.  Know the state casserole.  The state casserole consists of canned
green beans, Campbell's cream of
mushroom soup and dried onions. You can safely  take this casserole to
any social event and know that
you will be accepted.   In fact, Neil Armstrong almost took this
casserole to the moon in case
he encountered alien life there.  NASA nixed the plan out of concern
that the casserole would
overburden the Apollo rocket at liftoff.

2.  Get used to food festivals.  The Ohio General Assembly, in an effort
to  grow bigger offensive
linemen, passed legislation years ago requiring every  incorporated
community to have at least one
festival per year dedicated to  a  high-fat food.  Thus, Sugarcreek
honors Swiss cheese, Bucyrus  has a
bratwurst celebration and Gahanna, seeking an edge over other towns, has
recently introduced the
Triglyceride and Low-density Lipoprotein Festival.   It is your duty as
an Ohioan to attend these
festivals and at least buy an elephant ear.

3.  Know the geography.  Of Florida, I mean.  I've run into Ohioans who
couldn't tell you where Toledo
is but they know the exact distance from Fort Myers to Bonita Springs.
That's because all Ohioans go
to Florida in the winter.  Or plan to when they retire.  Or are related
to retired Ohioans who have a
place in Sarasota.  We consider Florida to be the Lower Peninsula of
Ohio.

4.  If you can't afford to spend the winter in Florida, use the state
excuse, which is that you stay here
because you like the change of seasons.  You'll  be lying, but that's
OK.  We've all done it.

5.  Speaking of Ohio weather, wear layers or die.  The thing to remember
about Ohio seasons is that
they can occur at anytime.  We have springlike days in January and
wintry weekends in October. April
is capable  of providing a sampling of all four seasons in a single
24-hour period. For these reasons,
Ohio is the Layering Capital of the World. Even layering, however, can
pose danger.  Golfers have been
known to dress for hypothermia  and end up dead of heat stroke because
they couldn't strip off their
layers of plaid fast enough on a changeable spring morning.

6.  Don's take Ohio place names literally.  Upper Sandusky is below
regular Sandusky.  Circleville is
square.  East Liverpool has no counterpart to the west.  Also, if a town
has the same name as a foreign
capital.....Lima or Berlin, for example......you must not pronounce it
that way lest you come under
suspicion as a spy.  Hence, it's not LEE-ma as in Peru, but LYE-ma as in
bean, and it's BER~lin, not
BerLIN, like in Germany.

7.  Become mulch literate.  Ohioans love mulch and appreciate its subtle
differences.  Learn the
difference between hardwood, cypress and pine bark at  a minimum.
Researchers think the state
affinity for mulch derives from its relatively flat terrain.  People
have a subconscious need for
topography,  and when it can't be supplied naturally, they are more
likely to make little mulch hillocks
in their front yards.

8.  In order to talk sports with obsessive fans in Ohio, you have to be
knowledgeable on three
levels-professional, college and high school. The truly expert Ohio
sports fan knows not only the name
of the hotshot quarterback at Abercrombie and Fitch High School, but
also what colleges he's
interested in, how much he bench-presses, who he took to the prom and
what he got on his biology quiz
last week.

9.  Remember that Ohioans are never the first to embrace trends. When we
do embrace them, we do so
with a Midwestern pragmatism. For example, if you see an Ohioan with a
nose ring, there's a good
chance he's had it undercoated  to guard against rust.

10.  The best way to sell something in Ohio is to attach the term
"Amish" to  it.  The product need not
be genuinely Amish.  This would explain the existence of Amish moo shu
pork.

I hope you found this guide to be useful.  If it offends you, please let
me know and I will bring green
bean casserole to your home to make amends.

The first one looks ok to me as long as someone has checked the accuracy of the reference to Gas Daily.

I have trouble with the second one.  This really looks like a basis swap so I think we need to start with basis swap language.  Can you call me on this one?

Please see the 2 new Gas Daily indexes requested by Pete Keavey. He is considering replacing the existing HeHub products with this new electronic trading index.  Let us know if the language looks OK.

Hi Mark,

Attached is a Service Level Agreement for our deal with Global View Software.  Forthcoming will be two attachments - one that gives EOL contact names and numbers and one that outlines the hardware in detail.  I assume that neither will have any bearing on the SLA.  We would like to see it turned around in a week or so if at all possible.  Global View actually has the hardware and we are in the middle of some user acceptance testing.  Please give me a call if any questions.

Thanks for your note.  Just so you have the whole picture -- our analysis f=
rom a US law perspective is that there is a tension between wanting the tra=
nsactions on the system to be enforceable and wanting out of the mistake tr=
ades.  The offline unwind is by far the best approach when the mistake is n=
ot blatant since it assumes the binding nature of the original trade.  We h=
ave been handling these by using a written termination rather than a revers=
e trade.  This is universally the approach we have taken when our traders h=
ave agreed to let a customer out of a trade the customer claims was done by=
 mistake on their part.  This happens often enough that we have given the c=
onfirm desk a termination agreement form to use as needed (Tana can get you=
 a copy if you want it).  But when the counterparty refuses to let us out o=
f a trade that is a mistake on our part, our only hope is that the mistake =
is so blatant that we can claim mutual mistake.  Under US law when there is=
 mutual mistake the contract is actually never formed.  In that case, the o=
riginal trade is not enforceable and there is nothing to unwind.  One alter=
native we have used is to simply remove the transaction from the customer's=
 "completed transactions" section as if it had never happened.  As far as I=
 know, we have only had to do this once or twice.

Mark

We do have mistakes from time to time, as you suspected.  In almost all cas=
es, the respective traders agree to cancel these by entering into a back to=
 back offline trade.  None has been of sufficiemt gravity to be brought to =

Is P&G approved to trade derivatives online?

fyi

I have run the reports again this morning and we do not have any deals with Proctor & Gamble that were concluded online.

Arfan

I have run some report queries and it appears that although they have read the ETA and have about 10 users they have never traded online.  I will run the report again tomorrow morning when it is quieter on the system to be doubly sure.

Thanks

If you have ever traded cash-settled commodity or weather derivatives with this entity, please would you let me know

Thanks

Create Limit Order 
Clicking Submit in the Create Limit Order panel creates an order that will remain in the EnronOnline system until the order is either filled at your specified price or expires after a specified time limit. If, during that time, the price you entered falls between the Enron's  Bid and Offer posted on EnronOnline, then EnronOnline [m1] will change [m2] its price to show a new market with a tighter spread that reflects your limit order the price at which you are willing to trade with us*.

You can cancel an existing limit order at any time before it is filled by highlighting the order in the Today's Orders screen and clicking Cancel.

*Multiple limit orders for the same price will be prioritized by the time of submission. Only limit orders that are between EnronOnline's Bid and Offer prices will create a new EnronOnline market on the Quotes screen.

  [m1]EnronOnline itself isn't trading so we need to be careful not to give that impression.
  [m2]This is the key! - we are changing our price, not showing their price.

If you want to plug me in to your call with Fred to describe the enhanced limit order system, just let me know.

Fred, I am following up with you on this matter with you for two reasons:

1.	Generally, I would like to know your status of your memo outlining the scope of the regulatory requirements for our trading business, if any; and

2.	Specifically, and more urgently, but somewhat related to this matter, we have a specific issue which relates to a new product we are offering on Enron OnLine and potential regulatory implications for Enron OnLine and our arrangement with NGX, whereby Alberta fixed price natural gas transactions completed on Enron OnLine are included with NGX to establish the Alberta Gas Price Index.

Would you kindly give me a call at your earliest convenience?  As I say, I would like to get an update on the matter generally, but more urgently, we would like your advice in connection with this new specific product offering.

PNM is incorrect.  The price is 4.86.

Tell them that the location of the gas is west texas pool and that we NEVER 
sell gas in the west texas pool based on a san juan gas daily price.  Once 
you tell them that they will realize that they are wrong.

Friday was so perfect.  It snowed huge snow flakes.  Accumulation was just 
about 1/4 inch. The temperature was about 35 degrees and it wasn't windy-so 
it was just a great day to walk the streets and take in all the snow.  It 
just felt like Christmas.  We took a  carriage ride around Central Park and 
they dropped us off at Tavern on the Green for lunch.  Met one of my contacts 
at Prebon for lunch and he  paid for it. .  Good  thing because we were 
drinking mimosas at $10.00 a pop.  We saw two great plays-Aida and the Lion 
King.  Excellent. Actually, Aida may be the best broadway play I have ever 
seen.  The music was awesome.  Lion King had great special effects with all 
of the costumes. The people were dressed like animals and it was really 
cool.    Prebon got us tickets for that too-first row-center section-mezz. 
level.  In other words-perfect seats.  On Saturday, we mostly shopped during 
the day.  Deb bought herself a new David Yurman diamond ring  and red leathe 
coat. You can't believe the people that were shopping.  We went to FAO 
Schwartz early-9:00 a.m.-and at 3:00 the line was clear around the building 
to get in.  The large department stores were like that too-hoards of people.  
You could hardly walk down 5th avenue, it was so crowded.  I have never seen 
so many mink coats in my life.  Everyone had one on.  The hotel we stayed at 
was excellent.  It didn't have the view you did.  Nothing will ever match 
that.  But all three of us stayed in one room and the room was huge and 
nicely decorated.  All three of us were able to get ready in a span of one 
hour.  We ate at some good restaurants too.  The first night was this small 
Italian restaurant.  Very authentic.  They took good care of us.  The second 
night was Thai-food was excellent.  The third day was French.  YUM YUM.  We 
got out of town just in time.  We really lucked out.  I would go back agai n 
if the right opportunity came up.

I only buy  pool gas-Can you make it available at the appropriate pool.

Just a little heads up. It is going to be so cold in Omaha next week.  Will 
probably hit around Tuesday.  Expect highs below zero.for about a week.. 
Better get your chores done this week because you are not going to want to go 
outside next week..  Haven't seen it this cold since 1983.. Will encompass 
the entire country.  Gas prices going through the roof.

I received the gift yesterday.  It will look lovely with my leather coat at 
the theater-thanks

So you bought me a new winter coat for New York-Thanks-I ned it.  The card is 
adorable-how did you do it.  I love it.

Lucky you.  I think you should convince her that her house is too small for 
her and the kids.

TOO COOL

Just talk to   Mike on figures-why do you need them

NICE

no-they did not and Tori will be on vaction next Friday and Monday-would like 
it done by Wed.-Nov 29-Thanks

what type of flexiblity would we hav on teh Terrell plant gas?  Can we switch 
it daily or do we have to committ to either El Paso or  PGE at the start of 
the month?

Looking forward to meeting you in a couple of weeks.

Frank-we need to know if you have made any  arrangements for Mom Tholt's 
funeral.  Barb, Mike and Bob are flying nto Washington DC Dulles on Tuesday 
to tour the city.  Joe and I are flying in on Thursday at noon.  Everyone is 
leaving on Sunday. Bob and Us are leaving early Sunday morning.  So we will 
be driving back on Saturday night.  We are planning to stay together and rent 
cars together. Aunt Mary Agnes has offered to make hotel reservations for 
those days people who will be staying in DC.  Either Barb or Mike will make 
reservations for Pennsylvania.  We need to know if you would like us to 
include you in our reservations or if you plan on just meeting us there.  
There is only going to be  Mass on Saturday for Mom Tholt at 11:30 followed 
by lunch at Aunt Jean's.

Aunt Mary Agnes is suppose to be sending us money in the mail for plane 
reservations.  Please let us know as soon as possible,

Congratulations, I can tell you are very excited about this.  Speaking of 
digging, on Thursday, they had a crew in our neighborhood digging to lay 
fiber-optic cable,  they hit a sewer line and then the gas line and blew up 2 
houses.  I walked over there yesterday,  one house is completely gone, the 
house next door is only half there and the houses across the street are all 
boarded up because they blew the windows out of it.  Such excitement.  Thank 
God no one was killed.

Per our phone converstion,  during the last couple of days I have been 
floating the US Gas West products and sorting by deal type.  However, I am 
getting products that are not west products .  For example, under "deal 
type-west basis", the following non-west products are appearing:  GD/D

Did you get your house plans approved?

Do you know when you are flying into Pennsylvania.  It sounds like Barb, 
Cindy and Mike, might be going in on Monday or Tuesday to tour Washington 
DC.  Are you going to stay with relatives in PA or in a hotel.

no problem

we did not get it. Send it to the new email  jtholt @houston.rr.com

Thanks for the info-I will send him a card.

Thanks for the info on Lloyd's wife-I'll be sure to send him a card.  I'll 
see what's going on over Christmas-maybe Saturday we can have lunch.  Do you 
think Nebraska is going to be up for this week's game.  I bet it killed you 
not to be able to watch the game last week.

wearing nice slacks and a sweater.  I told Ed we would meet him about 8:00 
before the 8:30 meeting to make sure everything is working properly.  He is 
supplying the computer.  I was told that he only needed a high speed internet 
connection.  I also faxed him the info that is on Enron Online concerning 
what is needed regarding computer equipment.    I will give you more details 
on Monday regarding my flight and the address of the hotel.  Your assistent 
is out today so I don't know if she booked you on my flight or not.  I went 
through Travel Agency and  had them hold a reservation but not to ticket 
you..  Your secretary told me you do not like to use them so I left it in her 
hands.  

Looked on Continental for prices on our flights.  Continental direct flight 
to Paris in April is about $880.  Same flight in March is $550.00

Thanks for the information.  Joe got a chuckle  last night when I told him 
that you tried his ketchup trick.

What do you think about this strategy?  Maybe we should have Deb call Marion 
and review the list of hotels where Enron has a corporate rate and ask her 
opinion regarding which ones she would recommend.  Maybe -at that point she 
would volunteer her flat?

RE: New York City
Looks like we leave Houston at 1:15 and get to New York at 5:52. We leave New 
York at 3:00 and arrive Houston at 5:49.  The phone number at the Barbizon 
Hotel is 212-838-5700.  Enron has a corporate rate there.  Suppose to be 
$222.00 Deb- if you want to try to get your own room-be sure to ask for the 
Enron Corp rate.

RE:  Europe.  There are several hotels in London which are listed as giving 
Enron corporate rates -prices range from $69 to 215.  The Ritz is $180.  I 
show no discounts for hotels in Paris.

They tell me that having a high speed internet connection is essential for 
enron online (SDN-T).  That's the only latest info I have.

Can you tell me how Mom Tholt is doing?  Is she out of the hospital?  Is she 
going to Montana to stay with Mike and Judy?

we just got the animated cards-is that what you mean?

I received your memo-sounds like all we need is a high speed internet 
connection and that is it.

Ed  called me on the equipment.  I asked him if he could provide the 
computer.  I downloaded some inofrmation on EOL regarding technical questions 
which provides some of the requirements for EOL and sent them to him. Let me 
know if there is anything else he needs to provide.  I have talked to Julia's 
secretary and plane and hotel reservations have been reserved for Julie.

resent the fax-let me know if you get all the pages

I am coming in on a United Flight 7954 that leaves LA at 3:15 and arrives San 
Diego at 4:04.  Staying at theHyatt Islandia in Mission Bay.  Look forward to 
seeing you even if it is for a short time.  I'm leaving for Vail tomorrow 
afternoon-so if you have any questions I'll get back to you on Monday.

Just sent you some info over the fax-I willlet you know if we need anything 
else.

I think that Dave may have is facts wrong.  Joe talked to GRADY  yesterday 
and they have sold their house in Conroe and are buying a brand new one on 
Lake Conroe.  Some new Dream House.  Glad you are going to Vail- I'm on the 
flight that leaves at 11.45 on Wednesay.

This works-I will work on getting our equipment needs for you.

This date works for me so I will assume that Julie will be going.  I will 
work on flight  arrangements for Julie and I unless you think you might be 
going.  I need your help in determing what equipment needs we need.  Call me 
at 35539 or respond to this memo.
Jane: 

It looks like the Oct 31st works for most people here that would have a stake 
in this proposal.? I have set-up a meeting starting at 8:30 to 11:30 am.? Let 
me know if that works for you or if we need to adjust.? Also let's discuss 
any equipment needs you might need such as a data line for access to Internet 
and any audio video equipment so I can have it arranged.?? Hotels in the area 
are: The Biltmore, The Westin Bonaventure and The Intercontinental Hotel all 
within one block of our building.? I believe at the Biltmore we have a 
special rate if you mention that its for SoCalGas.

I'll be telecommuting tomorrow so you can reach me at my cell phone at (213) 
248-4053. 

Thanks very much 

Ed 

I f we get out of here early, I may run to Foley's.  I will leave you a voice 
mail or an e-mail to let you know.So be sure to check.  I was just messing 
withyou on the Evita.  I am going out to lunch with a customer today so I'm 
not going to be extremely hungery.  Maybe we just go to PF Chang's and I can 
have a lettuce wrap.

My broker called me this morning and asked me how I was doing and I told him  
again that I was coming to New York and he said no problem with getting 
tickets to Avita and the Lion King.  Easter next year is Sunday April 15.

Come by anytime after 10:00 on any day..  I will be on vacation on Thurs and 
Friday though.

let me know if I can do anything to help

Nat gas is at a discount with Enron stock at 83 and what's your stock price.  
Did I tell you the company is going to give us more stock options at the 
start of the year.  Oh-and we get free bus passes.  So not only do they 
provide me with free lunch every day-oh-did I  forget to mention that 
too.-but they pay for my transportation to work.

It works.  Frank told me that you were trying to get in touch with me .  I 
tried to send you something but it didn't work.  Did you meet your Uncle Joe 
last night .  He'll talk your ear off so watch out.  Let me know what's 
happening out there.

Forgot to tell you that Joe and I went to see the Jim Rome show when he was 
in Houston a couple of weeks ago .  It was pretty good.  Too bad you'll never 
see him in Omaha.  Guess what else?  We got a memo today that Enron is giving 
all of its employees a home  computer and will subsidize their internet 
connection.  Gift is part of their commitment to techonology.  Does your 
company do this with your telephones?

Are you going to Las Vegas today to see you mom or are you waiting to see if 
she gets better?  Can't get a hold of Barb on the cell phone.

Art Festival is week-end of Oct 14 and 15.  We're in.

I don't do tagg but I'll give to the appropriate person

can you do this-I don't how

My broker called and we are definitely in for Tina Turner.  He is waiting 
unitl the last week to give me the tickets so we get premo seats.  Have fun 
this week-end.

I switched deal number 341242 to a sale and deal number 341270 as a buy

I had a thought.  I wonder how far away Nancy Gardiner is from Vail because 
maybe we could go se her on Saturday or maybe we just want to take it easy in 
Vai and just relax.  Any thoughts.

Do not want to go to Vegas-been there too much already this year.  I am going 
to have a message in Co.  Good job on the fare-that's cheaper than mine.  If 
you want to stay at the RIOin Las Vegas-Southwest Gas has a cheap corporate 
rate that you can get-it's off the strip but it's nice. Every room is a 
sweat.  Just call and ask for it.

Sounds like a fun week-end.Hotel is  Vail Marriott Mountain Resort and Spa.  
I'll try to get an address and directions for you.Do you want a message, 
facial or both.

Tickets are free.   I don't think we'll need binoculars-seats are on floor.  
Enjoyed helping you over the week-end-that's what friends are for-at least 
where we came from.  The flowers you sent me are beautiful .. All of my 
favorites-gerber daisies and liliies.  You didn't  to do that with all of the 
furniture you gave me.  By the way-are your legs killing you.  My calves hurt 
like hell-think it's from going up and down the stairs barefoot on Saturday.  
I think your decorator was a little disappointed in all of the progress we 
made.-he probably thought you would want to hire help.  Can't believe he 
didn't say anything about all of the beautiful glas syou have.  Hey-we may 
want to thin about putting one of your big mirrors in your purple/black 
bedroom next to the TV hutch-nearthat corner instead of in the purple/green 
room.

Got the tickets today for Faith Hill-mark your calendar for Oct 13-starts at 
8:00   Tina Turner is Sunda7-Oct. 29

that works

Need to narrow down timing of their notification-sounds like they can call us 
one day prior to noms due-that's too late to try to manage financially.

are you talking actual flows or what wAS NOMINATED

This was an EOL deal and EOL only trades in increments of 5000 so Zarin is 
not correct per our records.

I will let Joe know that you received his care package.  He will be very 
happy.  When I get my pictures developed, I'll send you any good ones that 
may have turned out.  It's O.K. to give Julie my e-mail address.  I would 
love to communicate with her.   Take care.

i switched the price on that deal and on 341270-they were reversed

Do we need to carify the max daily quantity on which the demand charge is 
assessed  reflects usage and not nominations.  Just don't want to be in a 
position where we must do make-up and have to nom more than 20000.

This is O.K as long as we get a daily estimate of usage around 8:30 C.T. and 
access to actuals within two business days.

Norm was somewhat prophetic when he kept talking about the "big hole in his 
pipe" that was going to occur if we went to rankings-little did he know-can't 
blame this one on rankings

You're not going to believe this.  I talked to Amoco and they confirmed that 
I did the deal with them but they said thawe should just pay Agave Energy 
because tit's a complicated internal deal.  So we are both right..  I only 
wished Amoco would have told me ahead of time.  Bottom line- pay Agave Energy 
and not Amoco

I am getting your critical notices but when I click on it, I can't get access 
to what it says.  Is this a problem on your side or on my side.

this is a joke

Looks good to me.  Thanks.

She likes white wines like white burgundy--I don't know any of the exact

Another idea she would really like is a gift certificate to the Taste of

Janie,

 I have been talking with EES and they have confirmed their volumes for their 
purchases from ENA (I believe that it is Zarin who comfirmed their volumes on 
their side).  I need you to confirm and verify our volumes and to change them 
(or contact who can change them) if needed.  I am trying to get EES to pay us 
for these transactions and they will not if they do not agree.  The amount 
that we are talking about is over $10 mil.  Could you please look at this so 
that I can get this resolved today?  The following shows what we are out:

Please let me know what you find out.  Thanks...

I do not track volumes but I will forward this to our scheduling group-Patti 
Sullivan

We are trying to think of something nice to send to Patti to show her our 
appreciation for her hard work.  I was thinking of a gift basket from SPECS 
with some nice wine.  Can you tell me what kind of wine she likes or suggest 
another alternative for a gift that she may enjoy.  Thanks.

I trade the west desk

no-I wanted my machine to make a sound every time someone traded on EOL but 
instead it's hooked up to my keyboard so that when I type the keyboard makes 
sounds instead.

Please add me to the critical notices for Transwestern and El Paso 
Pipeline(s) as soon as possible.  If you have any questions , please call me 
at 35539.

The sound card does not work on my eol machine-it works on the keyboard 
supporting eol which is opposite of what I want.  I want the screen to ding 
every time someone trades on eol.  I don't want to listen to my self type in 
deals on the keyboard.  My Enron computer system works fine right now.  If 
you could handle getting the eol problem fixed I would appreciate it.

Southwest Gas currently views Enron Online but is afraid to transact physical 
volumes on it because they are afraid the payment terms on Enron Online are 
different than non-EOL trades.  They stated that they reveiwed the EOL 
contract and that it does not address payment.  I told them that the payment 
terms do not differ but they are asking for something in writing.  Can you 
send them something.

How come it doesn't work on my eol machine?

We did two deals that day we bought 4.70 and sold them 4.67-same volume

this afternoon-any time

yes we are going

My husband and his friends want me to inquire more about your fishing lodge 
and prices.  A bunch of them turn 50 next year and are thinking of going on a 
fishing trip.  Can you give me any more information on prices and 
availiablity for next year.  Please advise what is included in the price and 
where we  need to fly into.  If you have any brochures, canyou send them to 
me at Jane Tholt, 7502 Highland Farms Rd., Houston, TX 77095  .  Hope you 
have a great day and it was great seeing you.

they are precious-he is a cutie for being only a couple of weeks old-thanks 
for sending me these

If it is not too late I would like to put on hold my request to add Barrett 
Resources to the EOL Product for El Paso Blanco Average. I made the request 
yesterday so hopefully I am not toolate. Upon discussing the product with 
Barrett, I do not think this would be a good idea to add them at the present 
time.  I willkeep you advised.  Thank you for your patience.

The pictures came through the second time.  Hey-did you get my gift basket.

Please add Barreet Resources as an eligible party to trade the product US Gas 
Physical-non-Texas Points-Restricted for El Paso Physical Blanco  l Average.  
Please advise if you have any questions.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this filing.  TW 
plans on filing this with FERC around the end of August. 

Thanks,

TK
	
	

Here is the revised bullet sheet along with the draft agreement.

Joe and I would love to attend the bowling party.  We would like to have 
prawns for dinner.  We are arriving on Friday at 1:30 so we shouldn't have a 
problem being there.

Does Joe need to being his suit for Saturday night?

pictures never came thru-please try again

Ok to book for me and my husband, Joseph.  I was issued a new corporate 
American Express card.  Same number with expiration date of  3/03.  If you 
need any more info, please advise.   Otherwise, I will assume you will book 
the two tickets.  Thank you.

San Diego is correct we sold them  24000 mmbtu of gas at 4.67

 - Proposals Matrix.doc

Below is a summary of the discussions last week regarding the complaint 
against El Paso for oversubscribing the Socal Topock Point.

The meeting started out by summarizing the dollar impact of the Border cuts 
to Amoco and Burlington of $3 million dollars and the additional fuel costs  
of $15 million that they have incurred when the mainline fuel was reduced and 
the gathering fuel was increased.  Accordingly, producers are seeking a 
minimum of $17  million in compensation in some form or  another.

The biggest concern is that a total of 1.2 bcf/day is being nominated at the 
Socal Topock which can only deliver 540000 mmbtu/day.   Socal Gas stated that 
this problem should go away when there system becomes unbundled (referred to 
as Gatekeeper)..  The proceeding is currently pending CPUC approval and could 
be implemented as early as October 1, 2001.  When the Gatekeeper is 
implemented  , only 540000 mmbtu/day will be accepted at the Socal Topock 
border and must match up with the intra-state transport.  

SoCal Gas suggested taking the 1.2 bcf/day of nominations at the Topock 
delivery point and divide it up based on the original intent of the 
capapcity-  400 to Mohave; 540 to Socal Topock;  and 180 to PGE Topock.  They 
also stated they would accept less than 540 at Topock but  needed a minimum 
of 300 to meet core needs.  However, they wanted some type of compensation if 
their volume was reduced.   They also agreed to live with the status quo 
until the Gatekeeper was implemented.  This would result in firm rights being 
established at Socal Topock based on downstream rights.

Williams owns Block 3 capacity and is willing to look at a CD reduction or a 
reduced take requirement or use of alternate points with a rate adjustment.

After much discussion,  El Paso came back with the following counter proposal:

Recommended interim solution until Socal Gatekeeper implemented.  Does not 
relate to receipt point rights.

1)  Block 1 Capacity will always be alternate to Socal Topock (198000);

2)Block II Capacity can not be sold at PGE Topock (614000)

3) Amoco and OneOk each have a contract 45000/d which can go to Topock or 
Ehrenberg.  It is recommended that they
 give up their Ehrenberg right and keep Topock right and Socal will give up 
like amount at Topock as well as shift an additional  70000 mmbtu/day from 
Topock to Ehrenberg resulting in approx. 115000 being shifted  to Ehrenberg.

4) Rights fro expansion shippers would be carved up as follows:

   Socal Topock   PGE/Mohave Topock
Texaco   40    135
Burlington  26    74
Aero   5    15
Borax   7    12
LADWP  0    36
SWGas   0    20

5) Socal Topock would now be divided as follows:

Expansion Shippers  78000 
Socal Gas           425000
BLK 3                               348000 (25-Amoco;20-Oneok;99-Williams;189 
El Paso Merchant;15-Wlliams)
Total 851000
540 divided by 841 would result in 37 percent cuts or 63 percent thruput.

The producers were not happy with having to live with 37 percent cuts and 
felt that any transport sold after their Sept 28 complaint should be cut off 
the top which would be El Paso merchant services Blk 3.

Separate meetings were then held amongst the Topock shippers to duscuss El 
Paso's counter -proposal.  

Producer group came back and told El Paso that they want the 63 percent 
thruput increased.  Will accept CD reduction, rate design change or other 
forms of compensation.   For  the recommended volumes moved to Mohave/Pge 
Topock, they would consider a 30 percent reduction in CD demand as well as 
converting that path to a 100 volumetric rate.  In other words, if the 
producers used the delivery point, they would pay max rate.  If they did not, 
they would not pay anything.

Block 3 shippers would agree to reduce deliveries to Socal Topock if their 
deals were converted to an agreed upon load factor-maybe 70 percent.  For 
volumes shifted to non-Socal Points , they also want a 100 percent volumetric 
rate.

Bottom-line is  how much dollars is El Paso willing to pay to resolve this 
case.  Each party is requested to submit a proposal to El Paso and they will 
study  its entirety.  No follow-up meeting was scheduled.

Another topic that was also being discussed at the meeting was the perceived 
gaming on the system by the full-requirements customers-ie nominating more 
gas than they need in anticipation of cuts.  It is thought that if this could 
be controlled there may be more certainty in the san juan regarding flows.  
El Paso recommended the following :  Limit noms on Cycle 1 from San Juan 
based on previous day's  total nom from all basins.   No limits on Cycle 
2-4.  This caused some concerns because of week-end load swings 
andfluctuatingpower-plant loads.  However, eoc's were willing to establish a 
technical committee to work on a formula if theSocal Topock point gets 
resolved.

Regarding pooling, El Paso is proposing to add 8 additional pools in the 
keystone and 3 additonal pools in the san juan and 1 additional pool in the 
bondad.  This process is in its early stages of conflict.  Most people (Duke, 
Southern, Williams, Coral)  are not on board with this.  I will keep you 
advised of development.  Please advise if you have any questions.

Jane, any chance you or Randy or Tori could go to this meeting?  Norm has 
called it for this Friday, presumably to discuss some of the points you 
raised in your discussion with him (according to the voice mail he left me).  
It will be in El Paso, starting at 1:00 pm MT.

Unfortunately, I don't think I can make it, and I've left Norm a voice mail 
message to that effect.  However, I'm not too optimistic about it getting 
rescheduled for next week.  I'm losing 2-1/2 days going to Las Vegas for the 
settlement conference as it is, and I will have to get my Order 637 comments 
finalized by Friday afternoon in order to get them filed next Monday.  We 
have some big problems with segmentation proposals (or lack thereof) for 
Columbia and CNG, as well as some issues on several of the other pipelines 
that filed.

Below are (1) a notice and agenda for a meeting July 14 in El Paso, (2) a
list of the invitees, (3) a draft of the goals that was sent out after the
last meeting and (4) a list of the receipt points grouped into the 18
pooling areas that we will be discussing.  Thank you to everyone who has
taken the time to discuss the 18 pool alternative (orginally the 16 pool
alternative).

If you have any questions regarding arrangements in El Paso, please contact
Ms. Susan Johnson at 915-496-2239.

Have a safe trip and I will see you Friday.

Norm

What am I suppose to do?  I don't trade barrels of crude and is the dispute 
regarding the price of crude on certain days or what?  I think this is an old 
del that Fred Lagrasta did.

Why are you sending this to me?  

Since I do not track actual volume flows , you probably can contact Morgan at 
ext 36406.  She handles border flows.

When are we going to lunch in your new car?

I just received the shirts this morning.  They are perfect.  It's a pleasure 
doing business with you.

that is amazing

I don't think I do but thanks anyway.

It's not looking good to come visit you this summer.  Deb is moving into her 
new house sometime during th end of July and then she promised to take her 
nieces and nephews on vacation sometime this summer.  I think we are going to 
try for next spring or summer to come visit you if the offer is still open..  
Sorry- I'm sure you are disappointed.  However, if something changes, we will 
let you know.

See attached letter and spread sheets relating to the June 12 ADR
Conference.

Us girls have talked about visiting you but just couldn't agree on a date.  
Joe and I just got back from a vacation in Banff, Canada with Jackie and 
Dannie.  We had a wonderful time.  We did some major hiking there.  It was so 
relaxing.  We had no t.v. or phone for a week.  We're going to Montana over 
Labor Day week-end for Joe's niece's wedding.  Can't believe Joe and I are 
taking 2 vacatins this year.  Regarding logistically getting to your ranch, 
is it possible to fly into Colorado Springs or do we need to fly into 
Denver?  We would love to come visit you if we can agree on a date because I 
love to hike.

Dear Janie:

Your User ID number is ENR01 and your password is password.

Becky-  If Burlington and Amoco have the right to turn back east end 
transport-ENA would like to be included in that group regarding turning back 
our Havasou transport.

Sorry , I have not given you feedback earlier but I've been on vacation.  
Randy continues to do an excellent job.  He anticipates questions and usually 
has the answers.  He is a very dedicated employee and continues to expand on 
his knowledge base.  He has helped the traders trade the permian and waha 
points on a daily basis and such commercial experience has proven to be very 
valuable regarding looking for alternatives to move gas.  The only area for 
improvement that I might suggest would be to challenge others or state his 
opinion if he has a different opinion from others rather than not say 
anything or go along with the status quo.  He tends to want to be 
nonconfrontational which is not a bad thing but this is a tough environment 
and he could get run over if he does not state his opinion.

As promised during today's meeting, attached is a file containing some data
on the quantity of gas physically flowing out of each of the receipt basins
for the period 1998 through June 8, 2000.  The data was taken from the VISA
system (note the index numbers on the spreadsheet) and is presented
graphically and as tabular values.

The flow west on the southern system is shown as the sum of west flow
through Pecos River and Waha stations less the east flow from Cornudas.
This represents the net volume flowing west from Cornudas Station into the
combined low and high pressure southern systems.  It eliminates the volumes
moved east to Waha for delivery into the Texas intrastate pipelines at Waha.

frott recline is really a foot recline and thanks for keeping me up to date 
with the happenings in your life.

Been pretty busy these last couple of weeks.

Couple of weeks ago I had to go to Los Angeles on short notice.  Accordingly, 
paid full price and got in first class.  It must have been a new plane 
because the first class section was huge.  I sat in a chair that was like a 
lazy boy chair-it had a fott recline and everything.  Also had my own pop up 
TV and could watch  my choice of 4 movies.  It was truly awesome.  Can't 
believe what  a small world it is. Went to lobby to get somebreakfast and 
Patrick Brown was there-ended up having breakfast with him and some ohter 
Sempra folks.Then I had to go to Vegas a couple of weeks ago.  Stayed at the 
new Alladin Hotel.  They upgraded me to a suite.  Another great experience.  
Bathroom was huge.  Big marble shower and  a  big tub that overlooked the 
skyline.  Bedroom area and sitting area were nice too.  Shame I was only 
there one night.

Last week was Gas Fair.  Lots of lunches and dinners. There are a lot of new 
restaurants downtown that we tried out.  Yum-yum. The weather was perfect.  
.  Cheri and I went to the spa and had a relaxing afternoon on the last day.  
She looks great.  She said you saw her picture of Matthew. He's a cutie.  
Parks was a t dinner one night-he hasn't changed-still nice as ever.  Had a 
lot of fun with Frank Fields too- he hasn't changed a bit .David Livingston 
was there.  He works for Cinergy but is doing east coast stuff-thank God.  
Our retail group  just hired Joe Deschamps and Chris Shireman-remember them?  
I bet Joe won't be there by the end of the year-I think he just wanted 
someone to pay for his way back to Houston.  Just found out that Bob Shiring 
went to work for Pan Canadian doing east coast stuff.

Joe's brother was in town this week-end from Montana.  He picked him up in 
San Antonio so we had them all week-end .  Went down to Kemah to watch the 
boats- we went there with Griff that one time.  Boy has it changed.  Tons 
more stuff to do -especially for the kids.

I'm just sick over my tax bill this year.  I exercised a ton of my 
options-and boy am I paying for it.  I was planning on  maybe paying $25000  
but I am having to pay $47000.  Will probably be that way next year too.  
Just sucks that the government takes so much.  I know I'm probably not 
getting much sympathy from you but I can try.

Can't believe there was another shooting in your area last week.  Bet you are 
glad your kids are almost out of school.  Can't understand how these kids 
have access to all of these guns.  It's scary.

Deb and I had lunch with Julia.   She's gone from Enron now.  She did not 
give us any more details about her marriage other than she got married out of 
town and in am place that made it difficult to track marriage l icense.  Her 
family still does not know she is married.  She is being really strange about 
this whole thing. She qwon't acknowledge to anyone that she is married.  I've 
given up on her.  She is almost as strange as you at times.  Luckily I have 
not given up on you .

Going to Grand Cayman Islands on Thursday-plan on feeding the stingrays on 
Friday-will tell you all about it.

Tell me why you are too busy to fill me in on what is happenign in your life.

I thought your hair was naturally blonde

I di d not do any deals with Roger for that time frame.  You need to find out 
who he talked to.

he's got your blonde hair

The price in deal manager is correct at minus $1.00
Sound like their is a problem with sitara if it is not calaculating the price 
correctly

Are you in agreement with the demand fee PG&E is charging us.  See e mail 
below from Client Services.

	
	

Tenaska is billing us for demand fees on PG&E because we didn't take all the 
gas that we were suppose to.  The amount is $50,382.00.  They have sent me a 
spreadsheet.  If you need me to fax it, please let me know.  

Can you also retouch the deal?  The $1 differential is not being calculated 
into the price.

Thanks,
Shielah

I want to penalize them for the volumes they are not taking on the trigger 
deal.  I know they are not going to pay but I still want to bill them 
anyway.  So- is the SW gas contract a one-way contract.  we are bound by 
their terms but they are not.

Looks good. Please book this.  Thank you.

DO NOT PAY PENALTY

why can't we use their contract to bill penalties

Thank you-that was sweet.

Thank you for the inof town guests in .vitation but I have out 

look at sitara 588471;588452;588605;596991

don't we have a gisb sontract with them that this would fall under

not sure how to handle- can you do for me

aol adress at home is jtholt1122@aol.com.  We are going to buy a camera-I'll 
let you know when we get it.  Joe is going to deliver some of Grady's cars to 
his new house.  I told him to take pictures for us.

eb3209c

I'm assuming you are referring to the penalty invoice at the California 
Border.  That was a 30 day firm deal.  There is no GIC associated with that 
deal.  

I also want to bill them for penalties for non-performance at PGE Topock on 
February 1.

DO NOT PAY

both deals were done at gda

Misplaced the cover sheet but they basically said that the baseload deal fell 
under an interruptilbe contract and was not subject ot damanges.  Laurie 
Ellis has a copy.

This is an old deal that was done in Fred Lagrosta'group-think it is a btu 
swap

GICS are negotiated

Cindy needed the money to pay for her new fully furnished house in the 
Woodlands.  not to mention the 55 acres she just bought across the road from 
her house in Aspen.  I only need enough to pay off my measley mortgage,  I 
have cashed in on most of my options though.  

are you set up on aol instant messenger.  I got my new computer at home from 
Enron and I use that to talk back and forth with some of my freinds..  If you 
are set up  let me know., You and Joe could  talk on it all night long.

Need to know if what they say is true on there protest to invoice.  Do we 
only have an interruptible contract with them.

whichever one is active-scana energy-too many choices to pick 
from-counterparty list needs to be cleaned up.  Go ahead and change it.

Do we have a gisb contract with them

I received the fax.  Can you send them a firm contract because we I don't 
think we are going to do business with them unless they sign it

Fax Number is 7136463239.  What do you mean by protesting-Are they not 
paying. are they paying some but not all.

Happy Valentine's Day to you as well.

You think it's nice now-wait until the next big storm moves in  next week.  
Socal storage at 18 bcf.  Curtailments will probably happen. 90% rule in 
effect. Palo Verde went down.  San Onfre down for a long time. 

changed it to Inside Ferc

LITTLE CHILLY IN SAN DIEGO.   SOCAL STORAGE AT 24 BCF-CURRENT WITHDRAWAL RATE 
IS 1 BCF DAY.  SUPPOSE TO REMAIN COLD FOR THE REMAINDER OF MONTH.   WORSE 
YET-A NUCLEAR PLANT WAS SUPPOSE TO COME BACK BUT THEY HAD A FIRE AT SAN 
ONOFRE-OUT FOR AWHILE.  BETTER BUY YOURSELF SOME BLANKETS.   

thank you for your efforts regarding this matter

I wanted to share with you the growth in gas demand for electric generation 
over the past cuple of years in California.  Maybe I can make a believer out 
of you.

Also just wanted to thank you for being so honest with me the other day.  I 
know it was difficult and I am sorry that  I never made it easy on you to 
express your true thoughts.  Maybe I just chose to ignore them for my own 
selfish reasons.  

I want the penalty billed and let them challenge it.

I got the pictures.  He is precious.  I can see why you are so happy and want 
to stay home with him.

Gas daily plus $.15-make sure legal approves

This is not going to get resolved.  They disagree with our view and are not 
going to pay on scheduled volumes.  However, we are not going back off our 
view and will continue to bill based on scheduled volumes.

yes -if that's what the contract says

this was a regular 30 day deal.

I'm not sure what contract this falls under. Our contract says that if buyer  
does not schedule then buyer will pay  replacement price differential plus 
$.15.  Rpalcement price differnetial would be gas daily which was around 
16.80 on that day.  

Sale is based on IF

triggers are based upon scheduled volume-they are not going to agree-I know

price on the 7th was 9.55
I don't understand the trigger question.  We need to get the back-up on the 
penalty.  Patti needs to give you info regarding a penalty we wanto tocharge 
them for February.  Please get with her ondetails.

No equipment was installed.  It is under my desk waiting for arms to be 
installed above my other monitor.  What is the status of getting these arms

Call me when you can make room for me in your schedule.

I am still waiting for this to be instaled. What's the hold-up?

someone call him at 512-370-8225.

yes-we received our allocation  last week.

Thank you.  They look really cool.  

We have not turned the capacity back and I think it's a good idea if we can 
get a ruling
.

I'm comng to town on Sat urday night  Feb 3 (Sat) and  leaving Feb 5th 
(mon).  I have to leave San Diego on Monday afternoon to meet with Socal that 
night.  I have to come in on the week-end because air-fares are horrible 
without  a Saturday night stay and I'd rather stay the week-end in San 
Diego.  If you have any time on Sunday or can meet me on Monday  for 
breakfast or lunch let me know.  I haven't finalized anything with Larry yet 
but I plan on meeting him for breakfast or lunch on Monday but I want to 
check with you  first.

Did you see pacific ga sna delectric ' stock today?

Thank you for advising me of this issue.  When you get back-up , please 
forward to Patti Sullivan.  We are going to work on charging them some 
penalties for a differnet month to help offset this.

I currently trade on the west desk gas desk and would like to get access to 
the westpower.enron.com website.  Phillip Allen thought that maybe you could 
help me.  Please advise.  Thank you.

Deb and I were thinking that if we can't finalize our Europe trip by the end 
of this week-we probably need to postpone it because the clock is ticking. .  
Can you give us any feedback on your discussions with  American Express or 
Mark Frevert..  Thinking about you.

Where did you sleep l ast night.  By theway, Brad does not want the couch.

Hi Honey,

    With the Ors, have a full itenery planed, miss you. Day one is
complete, No injuries

Phone Number is 713-345-4154.  What number should I try to call you at if we have trouble connencting?

I can call in.  

Oops.  I have a class Thursday afternoon.  Leslie will not be here, but I will remind her in case she's available by phone.  Could you conference her in if she is?

Looks good.  Aslo we ar still on for our meeting on Thursday at 2:30.  Is Leslie coming?

Attached is a draft of our rehearing request on the order FERC issued in RM01-9 requiring sellers of gas into California to file information on their sales, transport, and purchases.  The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply.  We also request that the reports, if they must be submitted, be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days.
Please provide any comments or suggestions you may have on this draft to either myself (713-853-5840) or Leslie (505-623-6778) by COB Wednesday (8/22).

can you give me an idea of the locations for the gas- I was only trading blanco at the time. The 4.70 price looks like it's at a different location

Jane:
I received an invoice from Cook Inlet for July for three deals on EPNG that we do not have in the system.  My contact faxed me their confirmations and I have located two of the deals in Path Manager, but I cannot find the third.  The two that I can find are EOL deals on 7/31 that have not been pathed.  They are deal numbers 952730 and 952205.  The third deal was for 5,000/day from 7/28 - 7/30 at $4.70.  They show a trade date of 7/27.  I don't see this deal in the system at all.  My contact says that all of these deals were offset deals that should have been sold back to Cook Inlet.  He thinks that we billed him for part of the gas, but we have not paid for any of it.  Did we buy this gas from Cook Inlet?  Should it all be sold back to Cook Inlet?  I would appreciate any help you can give me.

Thanks,

We aslo want to add the California delivery points as receipts points with a potential interruptible back-haul rate to the EOC delivery points.

Here is what came out of the west meeting today, at least as much as I can remember, and Janie has it all in her head anyway.

I will analyze the re-recall issue, so I need Becky and Steph to get me all the orders and contracts, etc.

We will argue for rationalization of the El Paso system, which entails turning back capacity before construction

We will file in the EP negotiated agreement case with Trachtabel to support indicated shippers (can I see what indicated shippers filed?).

6 pools, no linear pooling, etc.

anything else?

Becky, if I could I would like to meet with you and Janie Monday night at the hotel to discuss our strategy.  thanks.

Good morning. My name is Nancy Turner, and I have recently joined Kristin Walsh's competitive analysis group where I follow gas industry issues. 

As you may recall, earlier this summer we informed you that El Paso's line 1110 had been brought down for repair, pigging and OPS review.  Our sources at El Paso and OPS have indicated to us this week that line 1110 is expected to come back online on September 1st.  We understand that the throughput on the entire system at that time should be at least 920 Mmcf/d (same as before it went offline). However, there is a strong possibility that OPS may grant the system permission to return to it's full capacity at 1.1 Bcf/d on September 1st.

We are trying to obtain more information on the capacity issue and hope to have this confirmed early next week.  We will keep you posted, but if you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at X 51623 or Kristin at X 39510.

I was thinking that may be we should ask El Paso to furnish aver. daily volumes that were scheduled as receipts into El Paso' system from the proposed 20 pools from Jan 1- Aug 31 of this year to get an indication of whether there is any gas behind these pools.  What do you think?

let's ask for it by month.  In talking to Socal Gas, they suggested that we ask the question and explain why we are asking so that the FERC  staff understnads why.  Should we ask the question and then say that this information is needed to determine if actual supplies exist behind the proposed pools since the allocations are being made based on design capapcity and not actual gas.

We'll send them a request for this information as well as the information on what supplies on their system are split-connected.

They should be able to track by each of the meter numbers of the individual points that make up the pools . I think they are going to make upsome excuse not top provide data because it's going t oshow that gas was not received into their system.

I wonder if they can answer the question, if the nominations were made at the existing pools, do they have the info to break those noms down so that they can separate them into the proposed pools?

CHANGED PRICE ON 3/8 TO 16.00

Why is it taking almost 2 years to  verify this price.   I do not have my records back that far.  

I am forwarding this e mail to Janie Tholt.  Remember that they are busy with bid week and you may not get an answer on this issue from the Trader until next week.  I will be out of the office until 9/18 so please follow-up with the Trader.

JANIE - when you have an opportunity please verify the price on deal 126428 for Client Services.

Elizabeth, this is a sell to Southwest Gas for 11/99.  In reconciling their account, SWG paid this deal at El Paso Non Bondad GDP and we show the deal at El Paso Permian Basin GDP.  Can you check on this for me?  Thanks.

looks good-thank you.  Feel free to add any others you think might be helpful.  Should we ask  , absent periods of maintenance,how many times contraints exsited within these pools upstream of Cornudas and Window Rocks.

Leslie:	Is this in good enough legal form, since it is an informal request?

Janie:	I tried to make the questions very specific.  Does this still say what you want to know?

Dear Mr. Collins:

RE:	Docket No. RP00-336-000

1.	Please specify the receipt points that are associated with each of the twenty pools that El Paso proposes to use for allocation of receipt point rights in this proceeding.
2.	For each of the specified receipt points, please provide on a monthly basis the average daily volume of gas that was scheduled for receipt into El Paso's system for each month from January 1, 2001 through August 31, 2001.
3.	For each of the specified receipt points that is not an interstate pipeline interconnection, please indicate whether, to the best of El Paso's knowledge, gas from supply sources upstream of the receipt point can be transported on any other pipeline, i.e., whether or not they are split-connected.

Please provide the requested information electronically in Excel spreadsheet format to the undersigned, with a copy to Jane Tholt (jane.m.tholt@enron.com <mailto:jane.m.tholt@enron.com>).

Becky call me on this.  I want them to know that we are willing to turn back the capapcity and put in the numbers and they can share the numbers.  We just don't want them to name Enron.
Bill:	This is to advise you that, contrary to our discussion yesterday, ENA does not want to disclose its desire to turn back our firm capacity on El Paso's system at this time.

she does origination on the desk

thanks but who is she 

Ok -good .  Thanks

They are going to send out an e-mail to all parties requesting that anyone who wants to turn back capacity should so advise them and at that time select whether or not their identity should be disclosed.  The confidentiality of identity was the subject of our discussion yesterday, not whether or not we wanted to do it.

Whats your dads phone number.  I want to see if he will golf with Stan
and I on Friday morning.

i HEA RYOU LOUD AND CLEAR.

Janie,

I regret that when you called yesterday you didn't feel that anyone outside of me knew what was going with your portfolio.  Let me reassure you that there are several that are part of the team that immerse themselves in the accounts that we manage.  Unfortunately, insurance products are held at the insurance company.  We have submitted the proper paperwork to change the broker dealer.  That has been done.  Now we're waiting for First Union to network the annuities into your account so we can see them daily.  We at anytime can call Venture and get values and allocations.  We also have your profile on a spreadsheet where we track your Venture piece, 401k, Accounts with us etc...
Let me give you the result of the Annuities;

2106218    Current market -$6,718.00  Grip value 12,617.  Currently in Cash

2016219  Current market - 52,187.00  Grip value
100,880.85.  Currently in Cash.

2235338  Current market- 204,005  Grip value
222,923.  Currently in cash.

2235337  Current market- 137,391  Grip value
160,636.  Currently in cash.

2235339  Current Market- 40,101  Grip value
44,584.  Currently in cash.

2235336  Current Market- 15,586.  Grip value
17,700.  Currently in Aim All CAP.

The grip value is the guaranteed value through annuitization.  You have a guaranteed growth rate of 6% on an annual basis, with a step up election if the market value has performed greater than 6%.  The markets were great in 98 and 99 with the first annuities that we made an invest in.  We stepped up the market performance and that is why the grip value is at the levels listed.  We are in the final stages of the annuities being networked into your accounts.  One has already shown up on the account.  The other 5 should follow through shortly.  I'll track it daily and keep you posted.  The important thing for you to know is the the positions are in cash, except Josephs (I spoke to him last night, he sure sounds like a fun guy) annuity.  Hope that this helps.

EES did but I am not sure if they still do.  Talk to Chris Shireman with EES.

I don't know the answer to this... do either of you?  Pls advise. 

BT 

Would you know, or do you know who would know, whether ENA serves any end use customers off of Southwest Gas's system in Nevada?  We have a case before the Nevada PUC where SW Gas is trying to force transportation customers who return to sales service to sign up for a minimum term of 5 years and then to give one year's notice before they can return to transportation.  Some customers went back to sales because of delivery and pricing problems last winter, so it became an issue (although most of those customers only had to sign up for 1 year of sales).

Who are you talking to at Socal.  The deal was for July imbalance which was traded at the end of August.  Maybe they are confused.  Tell them to talk to Steve Baird.

The imbalance trade for July 2001 is deal #1020741 and is to Southern California Gas Company for 320,000 mmbtu.  So. Cal. is saying they are only aware of a trade for August for 320,000 which matched deal #1019969 that is on the spreadsheet.  Did these 2 deals get put in correctly?

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo James
Marlo,

These are the imbalance trades for the month of July.  Thanks.

I will tell Steve to contact her as well. Thank you.

Colleen Rakiewicz is the contact that the settlements group deals with.  I will pass Steve's name on.

Matt Smith  is now responsible for Socal imbalance trading-

I have pathed this deal in Path Manager and balanced.  There is still 43,559 then leftover unaccounted for on the trades, correct?

Marlo,

The buy back tkt for EES has been put in for a volume of 276,441 for the July imbalance. The deal #  is 1038688. Please let me know if there are any problems with July.

Hi, everyone. Sorry for the delay in responding to all the messages and
emails regarding the meetings sponsored by SRP. There were a few people who
were in Phoenix before the WTC disaster and we did meet on Wednesday to do
some brainstorming. This email is an attempt to share the discussions with
those of you who were not here.

The parties who met were SRP, APS, PD, SWG, SoCal and the ACC. Joel Greene,
Barbara Jost, Kelly Daly and Dave Huard were here as legal counsel and Greg
Lander was here as a consultant. There are no new proposals on the table. W=
e
did discuss ways to get to a point where we might be able to talk settlemen=
t
and whether or not parties might be willing to turn back capacity. No
surprise that we keep coming back to "what do you use to allocate the
existing capacity". Greg is going to run some numbers for the EOC based on
different starting scenarios using the assumption that CD capacity will be
made available at some level. He will also be looking at the impact of
seasonalizing the EOC loads.

SRP will reschedule the meetings (or arrange a conference call) to discuss
settlement once we have Greg's analysis. I wouldn't expect anything before
the end of September unless it is a conference call.

Thanks to everyone for letting me know your status during the week. It was =
a
relief to know everyone was safe somewhere.

Just talk to   Mike on figures-why do you need them

Ann Bike and Elizabeth Hernandez were suppose to handle the booking of this deal.  It is a real deal.  ENA is paying a 5 cent demand charge on 310000 for the opton to park gas in March and take out in August/.  Please contact Ann Bike for the sitara dealnumber.

Jane, Cal Hub has invoiced ENA $15,500.00 for August 2001.  However, I do not show anything in our system.  Do you know if this is valid and if so, do you know the Sitara number?  Thanks.

same story from someone else who was there at the same time. 
I am writting this to let you all know.  I will not give my American hard 
earned dollars to someone/anyone who would celebrate any American loss of 
life.   I would kindly request that all of you let friends and family know 
what went on at this restaurant.  When I first heard this it seemed so hard 
to believe, that anyone living and especially owning a business and 
benefiting from America would feel this way.   My best friend knows this 
woman well, this is not an internet hoax.   When I first heard the story I 
didn't know what to do, but as it is Sunday morning and I am picturing his 
restarant packed with Americans and him taking in all those dollars I have 
suddenly become inspired.   Not to mention when I first heard of this it

Not sure how often you eat at IHOP but I think we will find other places to
eat based on this story.

Since you're my neighbor, thought you might want to read this.

Further to our conversation yesterday, Phillip has asked that we meet today to update him on the general and specific efforts related to regulatory concerns on El Paso pipeline.  

Pls be prepared to discuss the major items we had identified last session and what our position and repsonse is planned to be.

If there are any questions give me a call.

This is a copy of our discussion  today.  Hopefullly, it will be a starting point for you
 

Attached are the key issues surrounding the El Paso case and ENA's position on each issue..  We currently are drafting comments based on our position which will be due at the FERC on October 14.  Such comments will support an immediate request by EPNG for turnback of capacity.  

 

Please review, and if okay with you, we can circulate to larger audience.  Becky, what date would this be due?

 

The phone in the conference room will only allow 2 people to conference in.l.  Accordingly, that means that Jeff and Leslie have priority to such lines since they are out of town..  Anyone interested in attending the meeting can come to EB 3267.  The phone number is 713-345-4154.

Janie--I think your bi-weekly conference call/meeting is tomorrow at 2:30.  Can you email us the call in # and room?  Thanks

Attached is a summary of the key issues on El Paso which we will be discussing tomorrow at our meeting.  Our comments to the FERC are due on October 14 so we will be providing Leslie with more feedback  for inclusion.---Original Message-----

I sometimes talk to Bill Bolch regarding glow issues or discounts.
See below.  Once you have a complete table, would you please distribute it to the whole group? Thanks.

I assume you are going to be the lead in the coordinating?

In consideration of the sensitivities regarding this asset and ENA's efforts to manage this risk. I believe we need to formalize and coordinate any external communication with El Paso.

Please advise by name who your lead contact is or would be and what the general purpose of the conversations is concerning.  If you do not have a primary contact or do not talk directly to the pipeline, pls advise. 

thanks, BT

Energy Commission Approves
Metcalf Power Plant in San Jose

Sacramento - By a 5 to 0 vote, the California Energy Commission today gave the Metcalf Energy Center final approval for construction and operation. The natural gas-fired, combined-cycle power plant project, proposed by Calpine Corporation and Bechtel Enterprises, Inc., is expected to cost approximately $400 million and create 25 permanent jobs.
The 600-megawatt power plant is approved for a 20-acre site located in San Jose at the southern base of Tulare Hill in northern Coyote Valley. The plant's electrical output will supply the needs of 600,000 homes.
Calpine and Bechtel Enterprises are scheduled to begin construction on the project this October with commercial operation expected to serve the summer load of 2003. This merchant plant will sell power in California's electricity market.
On June 18, 2001, the Energy Commission's Metcalf Energy Center Committee, comprised of Energy Commissioner Robert Laurie, Presiding Member, and Commission Chairman William J. Keese, Second Member, recommended the power plant for full-Commission approval. The Presiding Member's Proposed Decision and its August 24, 2001, Revised Presiding Member's Proposed Decision on the Metcalf Power Plant may be accessed on the Commission's web site at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/metcalf

The Committee's approval of the Metcalf Energy Center license came after a rigorous, two and a half year-long review process in which the Commission actively sought public input on the proposal. More than 50 public workshops, hearings and conferences were held on the project in which members of the public, 18 formal "intervenors," other governmental agencies, and community groups participated in the Energy Commission's review process.
In its 480-page Revised Presiding Member's Proposed Decision, the Committee reviewed all aspects of the proposal, including environmental impacts, public health and safety, air quality, hazardous materials, and engineering alternatives. Based on evidence presented at formal hearing, the Committee recommended the project for certification under the Warren-Alquist Act and the California Environmental Quality Act.
In its vote to license the Metcalf project, the Energy Commission exercised its override authority, an important part of the State's statutory scheme for ensuring against power shortages in locations where power is needed for reliability. The Commissioners agreed with the staff that the need for the project and benefits it will bring to the San Jose area outweigh its lack of compliance with local ordinances.
The Energy Commission exercises its override authority cautiously, preferring in most cases to work with local agencies to achieve consensus with local jurisdictions; 1981 was the only other time the Commission exercised its override authority. In that case, the issue was a transmission line from the Geysers 16 project that the County of Sonoma contended violated its general plan. The Energy Commission's override was upheld in subsequent court action.
The power plants permitted by the Energy Commission since 1999 will boost California's power supply by 10,982 megawatts by summer 2003. Nine simple-cycle power plants licensed this year will add 683 megawatts to the grid by year's end.
The Commission's web site provides complete information about the review of California power plant proposals at:

Energy Commission Clock Starts
On Two New Power Plant Proposals

Sacramento - Two new power plant applications started the California Energy Commission approval process with unanimous votes today. Commissioners deemed the applications data adequate for the Magnolia Power Project in Burbank and the Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility in North San Jose.
The 4-to-0 Commission vote finding the Magnolia Power Project data adequate means that the staff has enough information to begin the six-month licensing review. A unanimous vote also began the four-month licensing process for the Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility.
Simple-cycle power plants that can be on-line by December 31, 2002 can be licensed under the four-month - fast track - process. The six-month process is for thermal power plants that will not cause significant adverse impacts to public health, the environment or transmission system. In both cases, projects must comply with local, state and federal laws, ordinances, regulations and standards, including the California Environmental Quality Act.
The Magnolia Power Project is a proposal from the Southern California Public Power Authority. The 250-megawatt, natural gas, combined-cycle electrical generating facility would be located at the site of the existing City of Burbank power plant. The city would operate the new plant that is intended to supply power as well to Anaheim, Colton, Glendale and Pasadena.

Magnolia is expected to cost $200 to $250 million. A workforce of approximately 320 craft and professional personnel is planned to build the facility. The proposed construction schedule would take 23 months, putting the plant on-line by the summer of 2004.
The Committee that will oversee the Magnolia Power Project review is comprised of Energy Commissioner Robert A. Laurie as Presiding Member and Commissioner Arthur H. Rosenfeld, Ph.D., Associate Member.
For more information on the project, check the California Energy Commission web site at:

www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/magnolia

The Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility is proposed by Calpine c* Power. The plant, planned for 15 acres in North San Jose at Highway 237 and Zanker Road, would produce 180 megawatts using four gas-fired, simple-cycle turbines. The project's key goals are providing a reliable source of electricity to the proposed U.S. Dataport facility scheduled for construction on an adjacent site and putting power on the grid to support South Bay energy needs.
Los Esteros is expected to cost $250 million. A crew of 287 will build the plant if licensed. Construction and testing are projected to be complete by summer 2002.
The Committee named this morning to oversee the review process for the Los Esteros Critical Energy Facility consists of Energy Commission Chair William J. Keese as Presiding Member and Commissioner Michal (spelled correctly) C. Moore, Ph.D., Associate Member. More information on Los Esteros is located on the Energy Commission web site at:
www.energy.ca.gov/sitingcases/losesteros

Public participation is a very important part of the Energy Commission approval process. To find out how you can get involved, call Roberta Mendonca, the Commission's Public Adviser, at (916) 654-4489, toll free at (800) 822-6228, or by e-mail at:pao@energy.state.ca.us

Energy Commission Report Projects
Improved Natural Gas Supplies For the State

Sacramento -While current natural gas prices in California have dropped to approximately half of 2000's average price, the specter remains of last December, when tight supplies caused prices to spike to 25 times their present rates. Now, as winter approaches, industry watchers wonder if the State has enough of the clean-burning fuel for the upcoming heating season, even as new gas-fired electricity generators come on line.

The Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report , adopted today by a 4-to-0 vote of the California Energy Commission, gives a qualified "yes" to the question of adequate supplies this winter. It identifies sufficient storage as a critical factor, and notes that utilities have substantially increased natural gas storage, largely because conservation and efficiency have dampened summer electricity demand.

Nearly 85 percent of the natural gas used by Californians comes by pipeline from gas fields located outside the State. Since California typically uses more natural gas in the winter than interstate pipelines can provide, additional supplies must be set aside in summer months to help balance supply and demand. For this reason, the report recommends that the Energy Commission continuously assess storage levels and monitor infrastructure improvements throughout the year.

The newly adopted report points out that California's natural gas supply system was designed years ago to provide enough gas for winter's peak heating demand. An increasing reliance on natural gas for generating electricity, however, has strained the system and revised old patterns of consumption.

"This report helps Californians understand what we have to do to assure that we have a reliable and reasonably priced electricity and natural gas system in the future," said Energy Commissioner Michal (spelling correct) Moore, Presiding Member of the Electricity and Natural Gas Committee that developed the document.

To help resolve possible supply problems, the document analyzes not only natural gas storage requirements but the interstate pipelines that bring the fuel from distant gas fields to the California border. These pipelines can deliver slightly more natural gas than intra-state gas pipelines ? those within our State's borders ? can receive. As a result, there are bottlenecks in getting some supplies to gas consumers that the report says must be improved.

Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) and Southern California Gas Company (SoCal Gas) are improving and expanding their intra-state pipeline systems to help eliminate these constraints. According to the report, planned expansions of the interstate pipeline network should increase natural gas delivery to the State beginning next year, and additional improvements to the natural gas system should help prevent higher-than-normal prices that plagued California last winter.

Natural gas supplies in North America appear to be sufficient to meet demand in California and the rest of the United States for the next 50 years. The report recommends that the Energy Commission continue to monitor drilling rig activity and production levels for the long-term outlook. It also suggests that the Energy Commission, along with the Public Utilities Commission, should find ways to encourage and increase the in-state supply of natural gas.

The just adopted Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues Report can be found on the Energy Commission's Web Site at:

I was talking to one of my customers yesterday, and they said that Southern California Gas Co. recently made a filing to revive unbundling of their system.  Can you tell me if that is true .  Also can you tell me what the status is regarding Socal Gas purchasing natural gas for the  needs of SDGE's customers.  My customers tell me that is probably going to happen as well.

FYI.  This should be interesting.

Best,
Jeff

Today, October 9, 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed an
application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).

In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the
northern California natural gas industry, beginning 
January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order
(Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a "Gas Accord II"
application.

If you have any problems opening these documents, please contact me at (415)
973-8677.

Janie -- I assume you already knew about this, but just in case.....

Attached is a draft of Richardson Energy's comments on the technical conference in El Paso's Docket No. RP00-336. The comments must be filed on Monday  October 15, 2001.

 As discussed at the conference, Richardson's comments focus on opposition to El Paso's proposal to split its 6 existing pooling points into 20 points. From past discussions, we hope and anticipate that your company or client will be taking a similar position. In that regard, we are circulating these draft comments to facilitate the presentation of common positions by similarly situated parties. We hope this draft will be of help to you in preparing your comments.

Thank you.

Come by anytime after 10:00 on any day..  I will be on vacation on Thurs and Friday though.

I am traveling on Wednesday so I willnot be able to attend the meeting

Hello everyone.  I've contacted you all because Regulatory Affairs (Becky and I) are attempting to stop sending you so much paper.  Our goal is to still keep you all informed but in a more effective, efficient, and timely manner.  This is where Livelink comes in.  Livelink is a web-based tool that you all will be able to enter from the Govt.Affairs homepage.  In Livelink, there will be the filings, maps, rate increases, etc. that we usually send you via interoffice mail.  In addition, the files from the file room will eventually be added.

Livelink is only going to be as successful as what's put into it.  This is where you and your group comes into play.  Becky and I don't want to put "junk" into it.  We want what's relevant to you and your team.  Of course, this is all relative.  What's important to one person and/or group is not going to be high priority to another. 

We will have a meeting Wednesday, the 17th to meet and discuss what's in livelink and look to you all for your valuable input on what you would like to see that's relevant to your team.  Please reply to the invite and/or send comments.

Thanks,

Melinda

Hey Jane.  Thanks for responding.  If you can think of anything you would like to see discussed or you have someone on your desk that can attend, that would be great.  I haven't heard from Stephanie yet, but she's on your desk, isn't she?

I felt really bad when I left early on Friday because I forgot to wish you good luck and give you a hug. I hope you will be very happy in your new endeavors.  You made the right decision.  I am sure you will be very happy in your new career.  I hope to read about you in some of my women's magazines.

I am planning to attend the meeting and will send you a copy of the hand-outs. I am sorry I will not get an opportunity to meet you.

Hi Jane:

I'd planned to attend SoCal's meeting on Thursday, but it now appears I may have a conflict.  Do you plan on attending?  If so, could you gather up an additional set of anything they hand out for me?  Given the controversy around SoCal's "windows," it will be interesting to see how this works out.

Best,
Jeff

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.

OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

I made a few changes.  Please use this version.  Janie, if you are satisfied as it is, please run it by Mike, Barry and Stephanie.  I didn't realize it was due tomorrow until this afternoon (I was operating under the assumption that it was due 10/25 - don't know why!).  I'm not sure we can file it electronically, so it may have to be e-mailed to the D.C. office.  If so, we would need the final copy by 2:00.

Thanks.

Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

I have not done any deals with Sierra Pacific but will pass on to Steve South.

Hi Jane,

According to my contact at Sierra Pacific/Nevada Power, the deals you're doing with them should be with Nevada Power , not Sierra Pacific.  For Sept, the deal #s I see are 737918, 796406,and 1043833.  Is there any reason why we can't change the counterparty name in Sitara to Nevada Power?

Thanks

Do you have a problem doing this?  We would just change the description  at  Socal KRS to inlcude this point.
Janie

As we discussed, we would like you to consider adding the OXY point for Elk
Hills deliveries into SOCAL at the Gosford intertie to the "NGI Socal/PG&E
KRS" physical point. If you look on SOCAL's System Operations report our
deliveries are listed as "Elk Hills - Gosford Intertie". Our flows on this
pipeline typically range from 80MM to 165MM/day.

Our gas from  this point interconnects with the PG&E Kern River station gas
that then is delivered through Wheeler Ridge into SOCAL.

Separately we would also be very interested in an SOCAL In state Production
point on Enron OnLine.

What is the term of the deal and we need to address different weekend volumes

It is summer again and the gas pricing in place between Harbor and Enron no longer represents the market value of the product.  In talking to the gas desk, the new pricing we propose to be effective on June 1 will be:

Demand Charge of $.25/MMBtu times 16,000 MMBtu/d
Commodity Charge of Gas Daily Mid times usage.

I believe this pricing represents the bid in the market for service provided.  I will call you to discuss this important issue. 

Thanks for your help.

I f there is nothing new to discuss we can cancel but I would like to know what is on the Commisssion's Agenda for next when you get it.  Thanks.  Also, the next time Leslies come to town, maybe we can all go to lunch.

Janie - are you planning to have the West Desk Regulatory Meeting tomorrow at 2:30?  I don't have anything of substance to talk about, unless FERC puts the El Paso proceedings on the agenda for next week.

What a cutie

Here is a picture that my dad took of Matthew while we were trying to get
him into his costume tonight.  Nevermind how bad I look....Hopefully we will
have some good ones of him with his head piece on too when I get the other
pix developed!  This is all I have for now...He had so much fun!

Thanks Janie!!!!  Are you just loving the fact that you had sold all of your
stock or what?!!!!

What a cutie

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

if it doesn't work out next week -we can do it another time as well

Leslie will be here next week (Tues & Wed).  She'll probably be getting in too late for lunch on Tuesday.  If you're here on Wednesday, I'll check and see if she would be available.  She usually gets scheduled up pretty heavy when she's here, but I haven't checked on her schedule for Wednesday.  I know she and I have a lot to go through.

I f there is nothing new to discuss we can cancel but I would like to know what is on the Commisssion's Agenda for next when you get it.  Thanks.  Also, the next time Leslies come to town, maybe we can all go to lunch.

Janie - are you planning to have the West Desk Regulatory Meeting tomorrow at 2:30?  I don't have anything of substance to talk about, unless FERC puts the El Paso proceedings on the agenda for next week.

Thought you would get a kick out of the fact that Christie Nickels(spelling?) came down today to attend our regulatory meeting.  I told her that things were hot and heavy for the last 4 weeks and have slowed down so we cancelled the meeting.  I felt like saying g Where the hell hav eyou been?

ok with me.  Thanks

Just talked to Leslie - she can do lunch on Wednesday, so go ahead and put it on your calendar.  Let's say 11:30, if that's okay with you.  

Believe it or not, I have booked my trip to London and Paris.  I am coming out there around October 4 with my freind Deb and her freind Christie.  We are staying at Mark Frevert's flat.  Hopefully, we can get together for lunch or dinner during that time.  I'll get back to you in a couple of months wonce I know more about our plans.  

Just a reminder that I asked for your comments back to me today.  Thanks
Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

Julia and Dave are out.  Neil is in.  I e-mailed Rock in Arizona but I do not expect him to come.

Friends of Deb!!!!!!
 
Bill Allison has arranged a fabulous SURPRISE SURPRISE SURPRISE birthday party for Deb MacDonald.  Hopefully, Steve or janie or Bill have already contacted you, but in the overabundance of making sure Deb's surrounded by all her favorite people, here are the details:
 
IT'S  A  SURPRISE PARTY!!!!!!
 
FRIDAY,  NOVEMBER 9TH  [her REAL birthday...!!!!!!!!!!]
7 p.m.  [don't be late!!]
Vallone's Restaurant
2811 Kirby Drive [713-526-2811]
 
                                        It's a special numbered birthday, but we'll let her share exactly how 'special'..
                                        in any case, presents,both serious and fun, will add to the evening, so bring 
                                        something you think she'll enjoy!!
 
REMEMBER...IT'S A SURPRISE!!!!!!
 
 
 
Bill would also like to include Julia White and Dave Schafer, Sherry Rutheford, Rock and Jetta, and Deb's California friend Deborah Ortman and her husband Ed.  I left Deborah and Ed a message and will likely hear back from them tonight.  I will also try to track down Sherrie.
 
Janie, have you connected with Julia/Dave  or Rock/Jetta? Please let me know if you want me to call them.
 
Also, I know Janie, Steve and I have confirmed.  Neal/guest, Maria/Larry and Leslie/Bob, are you guys all in??
 
This is going to be an especially wonderful event for our most 'specially wonderful and dearest friend....can't wait!!!
 
Please let me hear from everyone.
 
Thanks!!

Thank you for your comments.

I agree with your invitation list.  This is Deb's closest circle of friends and she would not want it to be any bigger.  I'm glad you included Maggie and Nora becasue I was thinking about them today as well.  

O.K.....I talked to both Steve and Melissa; Melissa talked to Deborah Ortman (she cannot make it); I received an Email from Maria (she'll very likely NOT make it);  I found out Sherrie is at Cynergy in Cincinnati, so I'll give that one more try.

So, the "final" list for Friday is:

Deb and Bill
Melissa and Steve
Janie and husband (so sorry I cannot remember his name, Janie)
Neal
Nora and Maggie
Christie and Ed.

Bill, do you want to call Vallones and change the count to "11"?  Let me know if you want me to do it.

By the way, Melissa completely agrees that the group we have coming, along with those invited but unable to attend, is THE list Deb would want included, so no need to expand the invitation list. Janie, agree?

I'll let you know if I reach Sherrie.

Best!

--Christie.

Hi!!   I left 2 messages for Deborah Ortman and her husband Ed Scott, but no word yet.  I think I have her eMail at my house--I'll get it during lunch and try her that way.     I have not heard from Maria, but I'm sure I will today.  Leslie wrote she's unlikely to be able to pull it together to be here. I have not been able to find a number for Sherrie Rutherford but am still trying.  Right now, it looks like:

	Deb and Bill
	Steve and Melissa
	Janie and husband
	Neil (no guest)
	Christie and Ed.

I think the original list of guests is her list of closest friends that she would enjoy sharing the night with.  This may sound odd, but I think she would really enjoy having the Maggie and Nora, Steve and Melissa's girls there--they are very very close and spend much weeekend time together..and they are a little older (13 and 14 i think)--I just mentioned it to Steve and he a said that would be great--I'll call Melissa.

Other than her family, (and though maybe a nice thought, may be too much of a surprise for her, and pretty extreme for us to pull together at the last minute), I think, with the addition of the girls, it will be a wonderful group of 11...and likely those who cannot attend will send a note or call, so evryone she'd want there, will be there, in one way or another.

I think a photographer would be great, for maybe an hour or so.

What do you and Janie think?

..Christie.

janie  called this am---Julia and Dave can't make it--Neal wanted to knw the guy  attttire---i'm wearing blazer and tie--kind of fits Vallone's i think---did you  hear from the CA people?  janie doesn't think Rock will come----should we  expand the invitee list ??  i just don't know many of her pals ??  do  you think we need a photographer or is that overkill ??/   respectfully---

My husband's name is Joe.

I am reading an article in NGI that talks about how California Regulator's are scheduled to approve some form of unbundling on Socal's system.  Please provide details of this as soon as it happens.  Thank you.

Thank you.  Just let me know if it changes.

No new details to report.  Same settlement to unbundle socal that's been before the commission for about a year.  On the commission's agenda to consider, but as has been the case for over year, they've delayed any movement--at least one commissioner doesn't like competition and has the discretion to continue to ask that it be delayed.  Some hold the view that there's a push to try to get it moved, but best guess is 50-50 at this point.  Substantively, though, same thing that's been before them for a very long time, i.e., emulate PG&E's gas accord (more or less) on socal.

Best,
Jeff

you may want to call Keith Holst to get an update for the winter prices-they have really fallen in the last couple of days

Comments are due by 6/11 on the FERC order proposing to reimpose price caps on short term capacity releases into the CA markets.  This is in response to the complaints filed by SDG&E and LADWP to deal with the high gas prices in CA and both parties requested this relief.  The attached first draft is the ENA/EES response to the FERC request for comments.  Please review and return comments, etc. to me and Becky so we can coordinate the changes.  And please forward to anyone I may have left out who should have been included above.

I don't rally have an opionion-your call-just let me know what you want me to do

Janie,

On second thought, this may be a little more complicated.  So Cal wants to treat these trades as if they are a separate entity and they also do not want to include them with our monthly netout.  If this is going to happen on a go forward basis, maybe we need to get legal documentation from So Cal allowing us to setup two separate Global counterparties.  What do you think?

Thanks
Laurie

Janie, 

Can you send me an email (just something short) with the deal numbers of any future trades you make with Gwoon Tom?  Unfortunately, when you put a note in Sitara's special handling instructions, I don't get any kind of notification.  As long as I know the deals ahead of time, I can make sure they appear on separate invoices.  They also go to different internal mail locations and contacts so I have to correct that as well.

This willnot happen very often.

Do you anticipate making these trades often?  If it will not be that frequent, just a notification (from you or Anne is fine) will do.  If they will be ongoing, it will probably be easier to have two separate entities set up.  My concern is the fact that they want to exclude this piece from our netting agreement.  Are you OK with that?

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN
Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the "prolific" supply basins of the central Rockies
and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by
filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.
The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds
of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application
(CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it
asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction
by the following April.
Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open
season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins
- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline
would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of
affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as
"a liquid point of supply," Williams asserted that "presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced
transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure."
Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams
Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America
and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., "thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central
Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid."
To "further enhance its supply options," the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the
mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding
out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to
be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo.
Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co.
(75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc.
(15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10
years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional
two years, said the application.
"Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and
active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers," said the application, adding that
Williams was "confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."
With the addition of compression, the project could "facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to
accommodate future market growth," the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued,
pointing to "stagnant to declining supply" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with "projected demand
increases." As in many areas of the country, "much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to
installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation," it said. The 11,439 Mw of "active winter
generating capacity" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to
more than double by 2004, said Williams.
The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline
Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS
would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2.
Under the negotiated deals reached with the four "anchor" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a
combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the
Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for
Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under
the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

Please provide us with a copy of the filing and maps.  Neutral intervention will be fine,

Neutral intervention is fine.

Kern River recently filed an application to construct the new Kramer Junction Delivery Point in San Bernardino County, CA as an alternative to the Wheeler Ridge Delivery Point.  Maximum design capacity is approx. 500 MMcf/d into the new Adelantro Lateral, planned by SoCal Gas, and existing and prospective expansion shippers have already contracted for approx. 328 MMcf/d of firm capacity.  SoCal Gas will reimburse Kern River for the cost of construction plus associated income taxes.  Kern River asks for approval within 30 days (by the end of November).

Any issues for ENA on this project that would require more than a plain intervention?   Are we one of the shippers?

Sounds good to me as long as I have my own bathroon at the hotel in Paris.  Why does the description for the double include a shower.?  Does that mean that single rooms only have a bath tub?

Bonjour mes amies!!!!!!!!!!

The hotel where I am making our reservations for in Paris can be found at the following web site: www.france-hotel-guide.com/h75006stgermaindespres2.htm      As you can see, the rates for singles are really cheap by Paris standards, and include breakfast.  Leonard and I  stayed here twice before--it's in a great location.

 As I've done Normandy once before and have  good information, and as I've done Paris and London several times, if you guys want, I'll prepare a suggested itinery ,with associated costs, for the portion of the trip from London to Normandy to Paris;  then we can all look at it before making final plans.  Sound O.K.??

J'espere que vous avez un jour fantastique!!!  [I hope you have a great day!!]

Nous pouvons avoir dejeuner quelque jours avant pour parler le francais, d'accord??  [We can have some lunches or dinners to begin practicing French before our trip, O.K.?]

xoxo, Mme. Christie.

Volumes are not improving.  Very diffficult to trade and balance in west..  Huge arbs between ICE and Enron ONLINE because people willnot trade with us.  Many times 10-15 cents differential between ice and enron.  This sucks.  Otherwise,  hope you have a nice day. .

Made changes to 1102017 and 1111318.  Deal no 1133558 is ki8lled so not sure what needs to be checked .
Disregard last week's messages.  No changes were made.

I have received some deals that are being questioned by the c/p however:
1102017	c/p claims deal is for 8000 (rather than 5000) MMBTU for 10/31
1111318	c/p claims price is $2.47 (rather than $2.475) for 10/25
1133558	c/p claims price of $2.84 is incorrect

Please advise what changes you would like for me to make for deal validation.

Thanks

Price changed from 2.475 - 2.47 per your request.

Can we imbalance trade this gas.  What happens when the cogen burns the gas without telling us like they have been doing.  Which desk keeps the 15000 demand charge?
Janie/Mike:

As you know, EPMI has been buying gas from the West Gas Desk for Harbor Cogen.  We dispatch this plant and buy their electricity.  Over the winter the Gas Desk was selling them (us) gas at Gas Daily Mid-Point plus $.05/MMBtu, based on consumption.  Since they have not operated that much there is not much money at stake.  With higher summer usage and the greater volatility at the border, however, this price is no longer fair for the Gas Desk.  

So, a couple weeks ago, I proposed a price increase to Harbor that would have them paying Gas Daily Mid-Point plus $.15/MMBtu still based on consumption.  They have been calling around and have an alternative deal, I think with Amoco that would have them paying Gas Daily Mid Point plus $.10/MMBtu based on scheduled volumes, not consumption.  We have to decide this week if we want to keep selling them gas or let them go to Amoco.

I hate to give up business, but it seems like we should unless we get a fair price.

Attached is a summary of a new structure that I think would retain the deal.  It changes the volume from scheduled versus consumption, and has them paying index plus $.10/MMBtu.  Schedules would be due by 8:30 and the volumes could not change over weekends.  I would suggest that it is better to keep this deal if I can get them to agree to the attached structure.  Please look it over and see what you think.  I will call later today to discuss.

Salt River Project, in an effort to bring resolution to the mainline and
receipt point allocation issues pending in the above-captioned proceedings,
is filing today (and serving hard copies of) the attached "Motion of SRP fo=
r
Adoption of Strawman Alternative to March 28, 2000 Proposal of El Paso
Natural Gas Company".  Unlike any other proposal before it, it seeks to
weave into one workable solution, the concerns raised by shippers in their
initial and reply comments filed in the Order 637 proceeding, as well as
address the 3 complaints.  It is a share-the-pain proposal among CD -
Converted FR - and El Paso.  Under it, FR shippers would convert to CDs at
levels reflecting actual usage over the past 5 years, weighted to the
present. It assures each westward flowing firm shipper, based on the curren=
t
physical mainline capacity (including L. 2000), 93.1%(winter) and 94.2%
(summer) of their contractual entitlement.  On a daily basis, all westward
FT shippers are assured of receiving approximately 60% of their 93.1 and
94.2% allocation from the San Juan.  FT-2 shippers would continue to be
served off the top.  This Strawman adopts the in-line pooling methodology
set forth in SoCal Gas' initial comments.  It includes North and South
system segmentation rights, and narrowly defined demand charge credits for
unprovided capacity as long as there is a shortfall.  Provision is made to
encourage turn-back of capacity and to have capacity under expired contract=
s
dedicated by El Paso to meeting the approximately 7% shortfall. Provision i=
s
also made to treat each primary delivery point as a receipt point, and to
give priority to Alternate Receipt- to- Primary Delivery point in the
systemwide scheduling process, all intended to encourage a strong
supplemental market to meet peak seasonal needs.

This Strawman Alternative is not filed as an offer of settlement, but as a
basis for a merits decision, eliminating the need for lengthy evidentiary
hearings, and providing certainty and flexibility to the system once
implemented.  Alternatively, we have left it to the Commission to decide
whether other procedures should be adopted.  Because it is a motion, it may
be responded to within 15 days of filing.  SRP strongly urges each shipper
and state commission to contact SRP for answers to any questions before
taking a position in response to the motion.  Any shipper that has question=
s
but does not seek answers, but merely sticks to their litigation position
will only be delaying resolution. This proposal is a viable
compromise...everyone gains and everyone loses something.  That is why it
works.  We look forward to hearing from you and reading your constructive
comments.  Joel Greene

I repriced the deals  and changed them in sitara

Ms Tholt,

There are two price discrepancies with the October 2001, EPNG sales to MGI Supply Ltd. First, deal number 1077216 has a rate of $1.705 on day 10/04. MGI claims the rate should be $1.80. Secondly, deal number 1093983 has a rate of $1.785 for day 10/10. MGI claims the rate should be $ 1.775. Sitara shows Jane Tholt as the trader for deal # 1077216. Can you please research and advise?

Thanks

Jane please advise on the below deal. Thanks.
SPR
Sean, deal 1093464 is a sell to Southwest Gas for Oct-01 production.  On day 24, they show the price should be a fixed price of $2.64 (see email below).  However, we show 100% of ELPASO.SJNONBOND.GDP.  Can you please check on this for me and let me know your results?

Thanks
Laurie

Laurie, I have one problem on your invoice.  Package # Q91 (your ref 134 on 10/24 I show as a flat price of @$2.64.  I have checked here and our guys say $2.64.  Can you check your end.  No other problems.  Nancy

Does the gas desk keep the demand charge?  Also, we need to discuss-if you forget tocall.   If you forget to call, the price between the gas and power desk needs to be negotiated. Probably not a big deal in the summer but is a huge del in the winter with daily balancing.   Also, the gas desk will not be responsible for any imbalance penalties if you forget tocall.  If you forget tocall in the winter under daily balancing,  your desk will be charged my cost.   Otherwise, I think it's a go. 
Answering your 3 questions:

1.  You can imbalance trade 100% of it.  They are in your pool.

2.  Under the current structure, when we do not order gas, we buy it at that day's Gas Daily even if we forget to call.  This is bad for you guys.  Under the new structure, you only provide gas if we call.  

3.  The structure we have now gives us the option to elect prior to the month for a demand charge or as a variable adder against Gas Daily.  Would it work better to have a $.10 demand charge?  That might be workable.

I need to fish or cut bait on this deal by the end of this week as I will be on vacation next week and we will need to remove them from our SoCal pool if we do not want this deal.  So, let me know if the e new structure works for you given the answer to these questions.  Call me with any more questions.

Thanks

C

 

Can we imbalance trade this gas.  What happens when the cogen burns the gas without telling us like they have been doing.  Which desk keeps the 15000 demand charge?
Janie/Mike:

As you know, EPMI has been buying gas from the West Gas Desk for Harbor Cogen.  We dispatch this plant and buy their electricity.  Over the winter the Gas Desk was selling them (us) gas at Gas Daily Mid-Point plus $.05/MMBtu, based on consumption.  Since they have not operated that much there is not much money at stake.  With higher summer usage and the greater volatility at the border, however, this price is no longer fair for the Gas Desk.  

So, a couple weeks ago, I proposed a price increase to Harbor that would have them paying Gas Daily Mid-Point plus $.15/MMBtu still based on consumption.  They have been calling around and have an alternative deal, I think with Amoco that would have them paying Gas Daily Mid Point plus $.10/MMBtu based on scheduled volumes, not consumption.  We have to decide this week if we want to keep selling them gas or let them go to Amoco.

I hate to give up business, but it seems like we should unless we get a fair price.

Attached is a summary of a new structure that I think would retain the deal.  It changes the volume from scheduled versus consumption, and has them paying index plus $.10/MMBtu.  Schedules would be due by 8:30 and the volumes could not change over weekends.  I would suggest that it is better to keep this deal if I can get them to agree to the attached structure.  Please look it over and see what you think.  I will call later today to discuss.

Chris

 << File: gasdeal.doc >> 

yes

   Do you want the package insured

So you better bet George that Joe will not go back to work for Grady-easy money for you
Also, think about goingto Palm Springs next year for golf vacation

   Do you want the package insured

yes for once

therefore we are correct?

I guess I was out that day and another trader did the deal and input the wrong price-so go ahead and honor their price
Jane, can you please call Mark Anderson at SWG on this price issue?  They won't budge.

Thanks
Laurie

I checked with Mark Anderson again and he says the deal was not made with Jane.  It was made with Steve South and he insisted that it be the fixed price deal of $2.64.  If Jane does not agree have her call Mark Anderson.  Nancy
  

Nancy, can you have your trader call our trader Jane Tholt?  She says our price is correct - I guess they need to work this one out.

Thanks

I checked with trader and Jane Tholt says that we are correct! Price is Index not fixed price!

I have no issues with these comments

Attached are comments which ENA proposes to file in response to FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking establishing the right for releasing shippers to recall released capacity from the replacement shipper for nomination at each of the first three GISB prescribed nomination deadlines.  The comments support the NOPR except that we say the FERC should make it absolutely clear that the intraday recall right must be part of a specific and express agreement between the releasing and replacement shipper, and that FERC should schedule a workshop after issuing the order so that operational concerns, such as accounting and gas tracking issues, can be worked out.

Comments must be filed by Monday, so please let me know if you have any concerns or suggestions by noon CST on Friday, 11/16.  Thanks.

 << File: Intraday Recall Draft 1.doc >> 

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Hello.  I just wanted to tell some of my favorite people (to work with) that after today, Thursday, November 15th, I will no longer be part of the Regulatory Affairs Team.  I'm moving on to a different part of Enron, EES.  In fact, I officially start November 16th.

 I really enjoyed working with/and for you guys.  I've learned quite a bit from you all and I wanted to say Thanks.

Sincerely,

Melinda

I missed half of it but it was pretty good.  Ben found out thatDFelicity cheated on him

possibly-in my old age

a little fiesty this morning??

It was really good.  Next wek you can watch Jennfer Lopez-I bet you can watch her bits and pieces.

bits and pieces - you?

Did you watch Michael Jackson yesterday?

um yeh - - me too,  can i fit in your suitcase??

My resume is finished and the job offers are pooring in

no overlap in EES - have you written yours, or are you just going to retire...

ha ha

you should be working on your resume

actually forced myself to read last night - trying to get smart

They have some cute guy lawyers this year-but I bet you probably watch that manly Monday night Football.

bits and pieces - never really got into Ally

i assume you did..

Did you watch Ally last night?

such a tough life

I saw the tv advertisement last night for Temptation Island for Thursday.  I think it may conflict with Will and Grace.  Could be a tough night.

it looks to be on Thursdays at 8

http://www.fox.com/temptation2/home.htm

I was looking in the TV guide and did not see where it is on this week let me know if they changed the date and time.

um.....no....sorry - i guess he is why you are watching?

aren't there good looking boys on the island?

Have you seen Ben on Felicity?

i don't understand how you put Felicity on the same level at TI2...

I am a desperate person for entertainment-what can I say.

that is horrible - i am embarrassed for you...

it's on the sasme night as Felicity

that's no fun

I'm not sure I'm going to watch it.  None of the people really interest me

We had a great time.  Let me know when you are not too busy to have lunch with the little people.  You are the one that always cancels-remember?

Are we not buddies anymore??????????  Both Tom M. and Mcgowan talked about having lunch 
with you..................did I fall out of grace?

I told Jeannie that we should not ask Joannie over  for Christmas.  She knows it is family tradition that we all get together.  Make her ask if she is interested.  No one else waits for an invitation.  Tired of her sorry excuses.  Some day she is going to need us and she is going to be sorry.
I ordered the pies for our big Thanksgiving day feast at Jeanies.  Wish
you could be there.  Dad is bringing the beer, he said one  12 pack
would do, I told him to bring a case, just in case someone wants more
that one can. I know that Joan is not coming to dinner.  Should we
invite her to Christmas or wait for her to call.    If you ever talk to
her, you may want to mention that her father is still alive and lives in
the same house that she was raised in.  I hope she comes for Christmas.
If she doesn't, I doubt that I will ever invite to anything again.  But
that is that fucking Links "better that everybody else"attitude.   I
might just turn that sideways and stick it up his German ass.  Hey our
stock is going up, how bout yours?

All the gas stocks getting hammered.  Natural gas is bursting at the seams.  Your bill should go way down

Cajun Chef-can only get it here.  Too bad.

You mean the stuff you buy or the gas that comes out of my butt after I make chili.  Speaking of chili, what does Joe put in his to spice it up.

Did you watch the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show last week

i thought felicity was supposed to be a good girl??

I missed half of it but it was pretty good.  Ben found out thatDFelicity cheated on him

how was felicity??

probably

you would be so bored

Lucky for me that retirement is also an option

so - are you going to sign on with reliant or eprime or cinergy or who??

possibly-in my old age

a little fiesty this morning??

It was really good.  Next wek you can watch Jennfer Lopez-I bet you can watch her bits and pieces.

bits and pieces - you?

Did you watch Michael Jackson yesterday?

um yeh - - me too,  can i fit in your suitcase??

My resume is finished and the job offers are pooring in

no overlap in EES - have you written yours, or are you just going to retire...

ha ha

you should be working on your resume

actually forced myself to read last night - trying to get smart

They have some cute guy lawyers this year-but I bet you probably watch that manly Monday night Football.

bits and pieces - never really got into Ally

i assume you did..

Did you watch Ally last night?

such a tough life

I saw the tv advertisement last night for Temptation Island for Thursday.  I think it may conflict with Will and Grace.  Could be a tough night.

it looks to be on Thursdays at 8

Have you seen Ben on Felicity?

I am a desperate person for entertainment-what can I say.

that is horrible - i am embarrassed for you...

Stephanie-could you please add Aeco basis (Canadian Product) to my product list.  I currently do not have access to this product.  Thank You!

the transmission went out in my car on Friday.

I like to make my own chili.  I load it up with beans, Sue uses pork and
beans(it's O.K.), but I like the beans mom used to use.    I was told I needed
to put a little more kick into my chili, so I figured that I would ask the
best-JOE.

Hey, for Christmas, I will provide the Ham and all the beer,wine,pop,liquor,
pie,chips , nuts and bread. I will have Amy make some barbacued weiners. I will
need you to make double baked potatoes. I will have Jean bring the polish
sausage and corn/greenbeans.  I may get some sourerkraut and dumplins from
Stoysich also.  I will tell dad that he can pay for the ham.
I will have Joey bring a relish trey  and some lasagne.( I thought it was
pretty good)
Do we need anything else? We are all off on that day, so we can start the party
as early as 3P.M. or earlier if you think, my guess is that you will be at the
casino that morning. Please advise.

ok- you make the baked beans and I will make the macaroni salad for XMas Day amd the double potatoes for Xmas eve.  you will make the baked beans
That's a good idea, everybody likes salad and it would go good with sandwiches.
We could also make some bakes beans.  It would be like a barbacue/.  Ham
,polish sausage, macaroni salad and baked beans.  That wouild really make for
an interesting afternoon.  That will make sure Mrs. Alberg stays upstairs.

We are leaving late on Xmas day- I can't stay longer because that is our critical time at work.  We come in on Saturday afternoon.  I bought Dad some black suede slip on shoes for Xmas-you know the new style-

I think Enron might be going down.  Stock is way down agai n today.  They have a 670 mill note due Nov 27.  Looking for collateral.

Those are nice shoes, I was looking at a pair myself.  He will be happy with
anything.  I am going to get him some Verizon prepaid minute cards for his cell
phone for the rest of the year, they expire every 2 months now.     For
Christmas he just wants to get together with his family, drink beer, eat good
food, gamble, tell stories, play pool and watch everybody have a good time.
Just the simple things make him happy.  I am going to invite Pat and Judy over
for Christmas for a drink.  I will be taking dad over to Pats for a beer I'm
sure during Christmas eve.  If dad has time.

Jane, on deal 763736 for May 01 sales to Southwest Gas, we have a pricing discrepancy.  Our system reflects SJ Bondad GDP but SWG is going to pay us based on SJ Non-Bondad GDP.  Can you please confirm which price is correct and make the change in Sitara if necessary?

I wil l probably be calling you next week-the desk wants me to become more involved in regulatory updates so I will seek your assistance with this matter.

We are going to create a link on your intranet site that will give you regular regulatory updates, but this will take us a few weeks.  But let me know whatever you need.  Are you going to the El Paso meeting next week in DC?

Dear Western Region:

The most significant change to the western region organization will be Keith Holst's role as Director of West Fundamentals.  Keith will manage this unit from the west desk, while using the services of Enron's centralized fundamentals group, headed by Chris Gaskill.  Our western region Fundamentals group will be responsible for delivering the most complete and market sensitive data to the trading desk.  We will all share in Keith's efforts to make our fundamental analysis the standard for all trading units within the company.

West Origination, led by Barry Tycholiz, will play a larger role in our term trading efforts going forward.  They will be joining our desk for fundamental forecasting meetings and discussions.  Our goal is to capture a majority of the term risk management efforts of our customer base.  We must succeed in capturing a majority of our customers' business to increase our share of lower risk earnings.  This contribution, along with our wholesale trading, will help our desk beat earnings expectations consistently.     

The West trading organization is structured to maximize profitability by sub-region.  The emphasis for the trading group will be to increase profitability and market information from each trader's sub-region.   We will be evaluated on how we organize and build the business and profitability in our respective trading areas.  This structure, however, does not preclude west traders from trading positions throughout the Western region and the North American gas market.  The West trading organization will be successful by creating accountability for trading responsibilities.
  
Please review the attached outline for the new trading structure.  We will be meeting as a group to discuss the changes soon.  The implementation of this structure will rely on our back office to set up the new books for each trader.  

Sincerely,

Michael D. Grigsby
West Gas Trading

Enjoy "Hole-in-One" boy!
The Rules of Bedroom Golf:
  1.. Each player shall furnish his own equipment for play, normally one
club and two balls.

  2.. Play on course must be approved by the owner of the hole.

  3.. Unlike outdoor golf, the object is to get the club in the hole and
keep the balls out.

  4.. For most effective play, the club should have a firm shaft. Course
owners are permitted to check shaft stiffness before play begins.

  5.. Course owners reserve the right to restrict club length to avoid
damage to the hole.

  6.. Object of the game is to take as many strokes as necessary until the
owner is satisfied play is complete. Failure to do so may result in being
denied permission to play again.

  7.. It is considered bad form to begin playing the hole immediately upon
arrival. Experienced players will normally take time to admire the entire
course, paying special attention to well formed mounds and bunkers.

  8.. Players are cautioned not to mention other courses they have played or
are currently playing to the owner of the course being played. Upset owners
have been known to damage a players equipment for this reason.

  9.. Players are encouraged to have proper rain gear, just in case.

  10.. Players should not assume that the course is in shape to play at all
times. Players may be embarrassed if they find the course temporarily under
repair. Players are advised to be extremely tactful in this situation. More
advanced players will find alternate means of play when this is the case.

  11.. Players should assume their match has been properly scheduled
particularly when playing a new course for the 1st time. Previous players
have been known to become irate if they discover someone else is playing
what they considered a private course.

  12.. The owner of the course is responsible for the pruning of any bushes,
which may reduce the visibility of the hole.

  13.. Players are strongly advised to get the owners permission before
attempting to play the backside.

  14.. Slow play is encouraged, however, players should be prepared to
proceed at a quicker pace at the owners request.

  15.. It is considered an outstanding performance, time permitting, to play
the same hole several times in one match.

At he El Paso technical conference , one of the FERC staff guys said that full requirements is dead.  There is an awfull lot of pressure being put on El Paso at the meeting to path their system.  The full requirements customers have to submit to El Paso 4 different load profiles-Becky has the details.  It sounds , though, that full requirements may be addressed in the proceeding. However, that does not mean that any transport will open up to Arizona. The conference call was a nonevent.  I guess we are trying to find out how Socal calculates its WACOG.  So we want to put pressure on them to get details.  We want to put pressure on all of the state commisiions to allow LDC to hedge and not be punished for it.

I was on vacation last week, and I just saw an email that you had a meeting/call on CA issues. Anything I need to know about?

Also, FYI, I am testifying thur. before the AZ Corp. Commission on Southwest Gas's miserable excuse for an open access transportation program.  One big problem is their full requirements contract and our inability to get firm primary rights to the AZ delivery points.  Are there any sensitivities on these issues from your side that I should know about?

Youare doing a good job keeping us up to date.  Thank you.

Thought you'd be interested in hearing that FERC is setting a hearing on the recent negotiated rate deals that TW did with Sempra, Richardson Products, Reliant, BP, and Astra to look into why those shippers entered into negotiated rate deals based on index prices that went as high as $28/dth when the recourse rate was 38 cents and why TW had capacity available for those deals when it didn't have any recourse capacity available.  This was a discussion item at the meeting today, and Commissioner Wood noted that some of these shippers were the same ones who may be having to refund their "overcharges" for electricity.

FERC also approved the rulemaking order on reporting requirements for California markets.  Apparently, the reporting requirement will be effective for 6 months, with probable extensions through 9/30/02, which is the term of the mitigation order for the electric market.  

Will forward a copy of the orders when we get them.

At the technical conference held July 18-19, 2001, EPNG committed to sendin=
g
you election forms in order for us to prepare four studies.  Attached is a
letter, instructions, and the form.  Please be sure to return the forms no
later than close of business, Monday, July 30 via e-mail to
robert.tomlinson@elpaso.com.

The above distribution list is not complete, as some customers were not
represented at the technical conference.  We are contacting those customers
in order to obtain e-mail addresses and we will send them a similar e-mail
tomorrow.

Mike Grigsby agrees that we should join complaint

I would recommend that when we intervene in RP01-484, the Joint Complaint against El Paso, that we side with the complainants against continuation of the FR contracts.  The gist of the complaint is that the full requirements contracts (East of California customers) on El Paso are creating capacity problems, as the loads these contracts serve keep growing, and cutting into El Paso's ability to serve the California customers.  My real problem is EES's inability to get firm primary rights into Arizona markets, which cost us millions in imbalance charges earlier this year.  Any thoughts?  Becky, has it been noticed yet?

don't forget-they could ask for any CD turnback as well to minimize expansion requirements
We will turn back BLK 2 if given chance

Yes, it has been noticed.  Comments are due August 2.  The other complaint, RP01-486, by the Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona shippers has also been noticed and comments are due August 6.

I agree that we should intervene and support discontinuation of the FR contracts.  I would like to see us also support some proposed solution(s).  I think there is some merit to the Salt River Project "conceptual" solution -- up to the point where they call for continuing the current system seemingly until El Paso expands their system sufficiently to handle everybody's needs forever.  Some entitlement for FR shippers that recognizes the seasonal nature of their loads, which is how the system operates anyway, would be a reasonable solution.  Also, El Paso needs to at least make a nominal contribution to the solution by agreeing to some expansions to the general system.

Becky- I don't thin we should rely on displacement to serve the needs of the full requirements because i t may cause me to flow gas that may be uneconomical

Looks good. Please book this.  Thank you.

 I made a minor correction

If there is anything you may need from the cash desk that could be of assistnace, please let me know and I will ty to help.  Looks like accounting is going to have to give you most of the info for compliance.

      

Attached are three documents (cover memo, draft settlement proposal,
settlement procedures timeline) comprising SRP's formal proposal to resolve
five pending dockets, RP99-507 (Indicated Shippers' Complaint), RP00-336
(Order No. 637 Allocation and Pooling Issues only), RP99-139 (ONEOK
Complaint), RP01-484 (Indicated Shippers/California Complaint), and RP01-48=
6
(Texas, New Mexico and Arizona Shippers' Complaint). We appreciate the
suggestions received to date and believe that while an uncontested
settlement may be unlikely, a sufficient nucleus is forming around the
elements of this proposal that will lead to the filing of an Offer of
Settlement and ultimate FERC approval as in the public interest.  We
encourage your active participation in this process.

Note that while Advisory Staff present at the July 18 Technical Conference
is aware conceptually that SRP will be distributing a settlement proposal,
this proposal has not been distributed to the Advisory Staff.  This proposa=
l
has been sent to Rick Miles, Director, Dispute Resolution Services, for
informational purposes only at this time.

look at sitara 588471;588452;588605;596991

I show 2.525 but since this is a buy and would be in our favor-go ahead and honor thier price

	
We have a price discrepancy for 7/14/2001 - 7/16/2001.  Sitara shows $2.525 and the customer is saying the price s/b $2.52.  Please verify and get back with me as soon as you can.

Customer is correct. I changed the deal in sitara.  

Price in Sitara is $2.835 and customer is saying price should be $3.835.  Please advise.

Kern River has filed for a certificate to build and operate a delivery lateral pipeline to serve the High Desert Power Project (Constellation Energy Group) generating plant near Victorville, CA.  It would be 31.6 miles of 24" pipe with a design capacity of 282,000 Dth/d, and the fuel supplier for the plant (Victorville-Gas, LLC) has signed a binding precedent agreement for the full 282,000 Dth for a primary term of 21 years, with evergreen, at a negotiated rate.  The initial recourse rate is proposed to be $0.0583/dth.  Commercial operation of the plant is scheduled for 7/1/03.  Interestingly, the notice states that the plant will initially require up to 141,000 dth/d to operate.  The rest of the capacity is to accommodate another plant at the site.

Do we need to intervene in this proceeding?  Any comments?  This is not a rush, but would like to know by Aug. 14th.

Becky-we can just intervene as an interested party-no ax to grind

How has Enron managed to achieve such success while other energy firms have
struggled to deal with the changing market landscape?

Global Change Associates is pleased to announce the publication of a new
corporate profile entitled, "Enron 2001: An Inside View".  This objective
study takes an insider's look at Enron, specifically, how the firm operates
and the keys to its success. Much of the information provided comes from
first hand accounts and covers areas such as:

?	The firm's structure and operations
?	The recruitment and training of new employees
?	How Enron empowers and compensates its employees
?	The keys to structuring Enron type "risk free" transactions
?	How to negotiate with Enron
?	Why Enron occasionally forgives counterparty obligations
?	Is the Enron model right for your organization?

Enron 2001: An Inside View is a unique publication. It provides valuable
insight into the firm's operations and analyzes its successes and failures.
For those firms dealing directly with Enron, or thinking about adopting some
of Enron's business practices, it is an invaluable, must have tool.

They are selling gas from Montebello.  

They have been given authority by the PUC to begin taking steps to sell from the remaining two (Alsio and La Goleta), but the PUC left some issues (principally around ratemaking) open, and have not given them the authority to actually begin selling the gas.  SoCal would like to start selling around Oct. 1, so they're expecting (hoping for) a decision in early September.  However, the state-run consumer group (ORA) and TURN have asked the Commission to require SoCal to retain two-thirds of the gas and sell it to the core at book value--unclear where the Commission will come out on that.

If there's anything else, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Mike really enjoyed the meeting  yesterday.  Thank you both for attending.  We are scheduled to have that same meeting every two weeks.  I hope that one or both of  you can attend via conference call or in person.. I will try to remember to call you on the day of the meeting   to see if you want to attend or to advise you of any change in plans.  Thanks again .

no- the more the merrier.   Just need to get her phonenumber so we can hook her up..   By the way I talked on the QT to the Socal Gas trader and told him that I could not fathom that they would even consider 143 receipts points.  He said Rob Davis is clueless and currently is on a power trip.  They are going to meet with him next week to make sure that he understands that he works for them and not the other way around.  

Leslie and I work closely with Donna Fulton in our D.C. office.  I was talking to her yesterday evening after the meeting and told her how much we got out of it.  I think it would be very helpful to us all if she also participated by phone as often as she is able and she is willing to do so.  Would you have any problem with that?

Breaking News : posted Aug 15, 11:27 AM
PG&E Suspends Open Season for 1.2 Bcf/d of Pipe Capacity 
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) has announced that it has suspended its open season for additional intrastate pipeline capacity that was scheduled to close Aug. 30. The California utility said it made the decision not to go forward with the open season at this time while conducting a corporate wide review related to its ongoing bankruptcy proceedings. 
PG&E emphasized that the open season was being deferred, not canceled, and that shippers would have a minimum of 30 days to prepare bids for service when it resumed. 
"I don't want to say that we were premature in beginning the open season," said PG&E spokeswoman Christy Dennis, who noted that the company simply "has pulled back for the moment" due to the "huge reorganization process" related to the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Shippers shouldn't view this as a "huge red flag" on the project. 
Dennis could not cite a specific date when the open season would resume, but she said "it should be reinstituted within the next few months." Shippers will be notified then, she noted. 
The utility first announced the open season in late May, saying that it planned to offer more than 1.2 Bcf/d of backbone capacity on the Redwood, Baja and Silverado paths on which gas from Malin, OR; Topock, AZ, and California in-state gas production is delivered to PG&E's local transmission system and other pipelines. Included in the open season was an anticipated 200 MMcf/d expansion of the Redwood path from Malin. 
The open season initially was to have closed on July 31, but PG&E extended it until Aug. 30. The utility, which currently transports more than 3 Bcf/d of gas in central and northern California, projected that the additional in-state pipeline capacity would be in service by Jan. 1, 2003, but the open season suspension could very well push back the date. 

II think you should just call her and tell her that you are an interested party in the proceeding and would like to attend.  Shw willnot have aproblem/
Janie, thanks for forwarding.  After reading the list, it looks like she may
have intentionally left us off the list.  She probably thinks of us as part
of Pacific Gas & Electric, and may not realize we do not share views on this
subject.  I do see that she has Frank Lindh on the list.  Do you think you
should ask her if it is OK for you to include me?  Let me know what you
think.

State building natural gas reserve
Officials refuse to reveal details of the contracts
Bernadette Tansey, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Staff Writers
Thursday, August 16, 2001
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle

URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/08/16/MN209239.DTL>

California has quietly started buying natural gas in response to the energy crisis, forming a gas supply operation that could become one of the largest in the state.

But in a repeat of the state's tactics when it lined up $43 billion in electricity contracts, officials won't say how much they have spent so far -- or how much they plan to buy in the future.

The state is already supplying gas for one power plant this month in an attempt to keep generating costs in check, and it has signed a small contract for gas storage space, state officials said. But they refused to provide The Chronicle with records of any of the purchases.

Releasing additional details -- such as the price officials paid -- would jeopardize the state's goal of keeping electricity costs down by delivering cheaper fuel to natural gas-fueled power plants that serve California, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the state Department of Water Resources.

If private energy traders knew what the state planned to buy, Hart said, they could rush in, scoop up the supplies and demand substantially higher prices to resell them to the state, he said.

Details of the state's gas deals will be made public as much as six months after they're signed, when they no longer give traders any advantage, he said.

That stance has raised an outcry among Republicans and consumer advocates, who criticized the Davis administration earlier this year for delaying disclosure of state power contracts that locked in a huge percentage of California's power needs for more than a decade.

"If there were a competitive bidding process, then, yes, the price should be secret while it's pending," said Marcel Hawiger, a natural gas analyst for the consumer group The Utility Reform Network. "But in a situation like it is now where they're just negotiating backroom deals, we think they should be disclosing everything right away."

Critics of the Davis administration who think the state already got rooked on the power contracts are equally leery about the state's foray into the natural gas market.

'A DISASTER'

"The governor's secrecy and lack of oversight has been a disaster for the people of California over the last six months," said Republican gubernatorial candidate and current Secretary of State Bill Jones. "These are the same novices who signed those energy contracts."

Hart said the gas operation would reinforce the state's long-term power buying effort that he credits with taming the out-of-control electricity market in California. His department was pressed into service as an emergency electricity buyer in January after skyrocketing power prices drove state utilities deeply into debt.

The state's new natural gas endeavor is intended as an insurance policy to make sure power plants under long-term contracts with the state don't hike their prices by claiming steep costs for fuel, a justification used by many generators during the height of the energy crisis last winter.

Under terms of some of the state electricity contracts, if the power plants don't make low-cost deals for gas, the state can step in and deliver the fuel itself.

The plan is to stand ready to provide fuel to generators throughout the state by lining up natural gas supplies, setting up to ship gas through pipelines within the state, and arranging for temporary storage space so any state gas surplus can be saved instead of being sold at a loss, Hart said. If the state were to step in as supplier for all the contracts that give it that option, the government would become one of the largest gas purchasers in the state, he said.

Hart's agency signed a four-year, $2 million contract in May with a Livermore gas consulting firm, Interstate Gas Services. The firm was authorized in July to make short-term gas deals with four suppliers in Texas and one in California.

STRATEGY QUESTIONED
Whether the state will be a successful player in the natural gas market is already being questioned by TURN and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. They say the state is reading the future gas market incorrectly by predicting prices close to double what experienced utility gas managers say the state will see by late 2002.

Bill Marcus, a TURN energy consultant, said the state's high forecasts alone could lead to unnecessary rate increases. Ron Low, a PG&E spokesman, said state gas cost overestimates would add $300 million to consumers' bills statewide through 2002; about $140 million would be paid by PG&E customers.

Hart scoffed at PG&E's claims.

"For them to say the price of gas is going to stay the same is ridiculous," Hart said. Gas prices have dropped this summer because of the cool weather and conservation efforts, he said. But things could change rapidly when demand peaks in the future. "You're going to see prices go up again."

Mark Allen Bernstein, an analyst with RAND, said the state might be doing the right thing if it buys natural gas when prices are low in the spring and fall and socks it away in storage basins to release when demand spikes in the summer and winter.

"We need to make sure there is sufficient storage to weather demand and price fluctuations," he said.

The state has lined up a small contract with the Wild Goose storage basin in Butte County and is supplying gas to an Alliance power plant as it starts operations this month, water department officials said. It has also locked in gas supplies at a set price for Dynegy plants in Southern California. The state has still not decided whether to contract for space on the interstate pipelines that bring gas to California from out-of-state producing basins, Hart said.

Hart said critics of the state's electricity contracts who said the deals all should have locked in a fixed price had already been proved wrong. By allowing some of the contract prices to float up or down with the price of gas,

Hart said, the state has been able to take advantage of a steep drop in gas prices this spring.

"We got totally hammered by the media for those (variable) contracts," Hart said. "My God, we're saving billions of dollars."

Hey Janie,

     Don't worry, I have everything figured out.  Everyone is coming
over in shifts.
Barney wanted the two to three in the morning shift.  I think he'll be

after a few non stop days of drinking.  If I hurt him bad enough maybe
he'll stop
the habbit.  I tried calling him on his mobil but it says it is no
longer in service.  I used
281-826-5246.  If he has a new number, E-mail it back to me.
     I was just thinking, I better call your Dad to see what shift he
wants.

Looks good.  Aslo we ar still on for our meeting on Thursday at 2:30.  Is Leslie coming?

Attached is a draft of our rehearing request on the order FERC issued in RM01-9 requiring sellers of gas into California to file information on their sales, transport, and purchases.  The rehearing request restates our arguments in response to the NOPR  that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are not appropriate to address a temporary problem and are beyond the scope of the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act and (2) the commission significantly underestimated the burden of the reporting requirements as well as the responding parties' ability to comply.  We also request that the reports, if they must be submitted, be due 45 days after the end of the month instead of the required 30 days.
Please provide any comments or suggestions you may have on this draft to either myself (713-853-5840) or Leslie (505-623-6778) by COB Wednesday (8/22).

( BW)(TX-INDUSTRIAL-INFO-RES) Pebble Bed Modular Reactor Design Pushes
Renewed Interest in Worldwide Nuclear Power Generation, in an Advisory
by Industrialinfo.com

    Business/Energy Editors

	   HOUSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Jan. 30, 2002--The following is an
advisory by Industrialinfo.com (Industrial Information Resources, Inc;
Houston): The rehabilitation of nuclear power generation plants, which
could represent part of the answer to world's power generation needs
over the next 30 years, has taken a few steps forward in the
consciousness of governments and industry in the past six months.
However, nuclear power still has a way to go among environmental
groups and those involved with post-Chernobyl public health concerns.
	   The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) from Eskom in South Africa
continues to claim the attention of both the large power hungry
regions and the capital conscious development areas to which the
modular and smaller output plant could be both affordable and
appropriate.
	   Stakeholders in the project include the U.S. company Exelon with
12.5%, Eskom with 30%, British Nuclear Fuels with 22.5%, Industrial
Development Corporation of SA with 25%, and Black empowerment at 10%.
Currently, Exelon is negotiating for the possible purchase of 40 PBMRs
at a price of around $6 billion (USD). Early in 2001 the company
requested the U.S. National Regulatory Commission to start laying the
groundwork for PBMR licensing.
	   Exelon would like to see the $300 million demonstration unit,
which is planned by Eskom in South Africa as a proven model, to show
that all technical matters have been resolved and that safety,
efficiency and viability are proven enough for U.S. regulatory
agencies to proceed forward with licensing. The plant is to be built
alongside the existing nuclear power station at Koeberg in the Cape
Province of South Africa with work commencing in 2003. If approved,
Exelon may then start concurrent construction of U.S. sites to bring
PBMR-generated power to market at the earliest possible date and at
the best price. Specifications and claims by Eskom, who purchased the
technology after a 21-year development and proving period in Germany,
present the PBMR as small, safe, clean, cost efficient, inexpensive
and adaptable.
	   The PBMR uses multiple coated uranium particles encased in
graphite to form a fuel sphere (60mm in diameter). The PBMR design
makes use of helium as the coolant and energy transfer medium to a
closed cycle gas turbine and generator. The design differences between
the PBMR and Pressurized Water Reactors result in the PBMR being a
safe and economical power plant.
	   The annual world market for power generation is estimated at $70
billion. The PBMR, if it comes through its regulatory trials, would be
in a position to capture a tasty slice of this power action. With 10%
of the shareholding in the PBMR project reserved for new black
empowerment shareholders, 10 plant export orders a year could
contribute nearly $1 billion a year to South Africa's Gross Domestic
Product and another $1 billion in export income. An estimated 57,000
direct and indirect jobs would be created. These figures would double
and triple for 20 or 30 orders annually. If the demo plant achieves
its targets, Eskom will place an order for 10 modules, with the Exelon
order hopefully kicking in immediately for a possible date for the
first U.S. plant in 2007.
	   Eskom will sell PBMR's as a manufactured item with no rights
given. Eighty percent of the costs will be made up of the manufactured
reactor and 20% site construction related. The aim is for 40% of the
sourcing to come from South Africa. Taxpayers money (approximately $50
million so far) is being spent by the South African authorities in
giving all due diligence to the studies and to public feedback on the
project before the "go" decision is given. With this right and proper
concern and the considerable market presence of Eskom and Exelon the
130MW modules will no doubt play a crucial role in the future of
nuclear power generation.
	   The project managers are indicating growing confidence in their
ability to bring the product to market and have recently made a
significant move. A contract has been placed (in mid-January 2002)
with the U.S. company Stone & Webster and South African construction
company Murray & Roberts and black empowerment contractor Proman
Management Services to provide consulting services to the PBMR project
in engineering, procurement, construction management and project
management. Following this development, the PBMR management at Eskom
have gone on record to state that with the multi-national and
multi-disciplinary support now providing leverage, the approval
hurdles for the pilot project should be cleared by the end of 2002
given the crucial general diligence and environmental clearance by the
government.

12:24 16Aug2001 RSF-Canada blisters under "year with too much summer"

    By Kanina Holmes
    WINNIPEG, Manitoba, Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canadians, sometimes divided by regional differences, economic disparities or linguistic snits, find themselves united this summer by an uncomfortable phenomenon -- a national drought.
    From Atlantic to Pacific, from the Arctic to the U.S. border, most of the world's second-largest country has been sweating through weeks of blistering heat that experts say could end up being the worst drought in decades.
    "In many ways, this drought is the same tune that's being played right across the country. It's a different look, different season and different impact, but nevertheless, everybody has a water shortage problem in many parts of the country," said David Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada.
    Whether it's fires raging in the forests of British Columbia and Quebec, barren Prairie plains or harsh restrictions on water usage in Ontario, many will remember the summer of 2001.
    "It'll be memorable for the wrong reasons I think. Too much excess and not enough normal," said Phillips.
    In parts of British Columbia, water management officials say the tinderbox conditions are largely the result of last winter's record low snowfall in the mountains.
    "We've had normal summer in terms of rain. But we knew back in March with the low snowpack that if we had a normal summer we were going to be in trouble," said Jim Mattison, Water Management Director for B.C's Bureau of Sustainable Resources.
    But the devastation is most apparent in Canada's breadbasket, the Prairies. Many farmers, especially in southern Alberta and Saskatchewan, have already written off their crops.
    "I've been here since '63. I have never in my life, ever, seen anything like this," Norman Stienwand, a farmer in Castor, Alberta, told Reuters.
    "IT'S BEYOND YOUR IMAGINATION"
    "There's no water. The grasshoppers are so bad. It's beyond your imagination," said Stienwand who farms 1,080 hectares (2,700 acres) of grains and oilseeds and also raises beef cattle.
    It has been so sweltering in his region, located about 160 km (100 miles) west of the Saskatchewan border, that some of Stienwand's farm machinery caught fire this week as he tried to bale a meager barley crop into hay for his livestock.
    "It's just going to destroy a lot of farmers. They're just not going to come out of it," he said.
    In June, the Alberta government declared a drought disaster to trigger emergency aid to livestock farmers struggling to feed and water their herds, and, as many of the withered and patchy crops are harvested, many analysts are already anticipating sharp reductions in yields and quality.
    Last week, the Canadian Wheat Board, the marketer of western Canada's wheat, durum and barley crops, forecast a 10 to 15 percent decline in exports.
    In Ontario, Canada's most populous province, prime agricultural areas have received only about 15 percent of the precipitation they would normally see.
    "You wouldn't be able to fill a sardine can with the rain they've got since the twenty-second of June," said Phillips.
    The drought has created ideal conditions for billions of Asian aphids to infest Ontario's soybean crop.
    "I drive by and actually now I just shut my eyes and pretend I don't see it. It's just really, really, really dry," said Debbie Yuck, a farmer who lives near Ottawa and who has watched her corn whither and yellow over the past few weeks.
    "When they come on (the radio) every morning and say it's a beautiful sunny day, great to be at the cottage, I think a beautiful day would a good downpour for about 16 hours," said Yuck.
    Canada's largest city, Toronto, has experienced a record number of days with health alerts because of the heat and smog, with temperatures soaring as high as 37 C (99 F). Some Ontario residents now face fines for watering their yards.
    An Ontario woman was recently charged for dropping incendiary material near a forest after she threw her lit cigarette butt on a road in front of a police officer.
    "THE YEAR WITH TOO MUCH SUMMER"
    "I wish I could come up with a word that would describe the misery and the hardship that urban and rural folk are feeling," said Phillips, a senior climatologist with Environment Canada who tracks national weather patters.
    "I would describe it maybe as the year with too much summer."
    The hot, dry spell could be a blow to the national economy. By the time the final bill is tallied for lost crops, aiding farmers, battling forest fires and generating more electricity, it could run into the billions.
    Quebec's multibillion-dollar agricultural sector, which accounts for some 16 percent of the Canadian industry's revenues and produces 38 percent of the country's milk, has also been hard hit since early July.
    In southern Quebec, where it has not rained for five weeks despite bouts of high heat and humidity, vegetable farmers have been working around the clock to save sun-ravaged crops.
    "The farmers are on the edge of burn-out, they can barely stand up," said David St-Cyr, a spokesman for Quebec's powerful Agricultural Union.
    The Atlantic provinces have also been caught in the oppressive heat, the result of massive high pressure systems in the United States that, for weeks, have blocked the circulation of other weather patterns trying to make their way north.
    Clouds of red dust follow behind potato producers working the parched fields on Prince Edward Island, growers who may lose 25 percent of their crop. Blueberries in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick have shriveled to look like raisins.
    "I think there are a majority of Canadians, probably, who can hardly wait for the winter. And I never thought I'd ever hear that," said Phillips.

Brookhaven Energy Project Permit Application Ruled Complete by
New York State Regulators

(London - 17 August 2001) International Power plc, one of the world's
leading independent power producers, today announces that the New York State
Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment has accepted as
complete its application to build the Brookhaven Energy Project on Long
Island. The Siting Board's decision marks the beginning of the State's
formal review process, and is a key regulatory milestone for the 580-
megawatt natural gas fired electric generating facility. The ruling kicks-
off a yearlong review process that will involve public hearings.

International Power submitted the application for their proposed energy
facility with the Siting Board, as required under Article X of the State of
New York Public Service Law, on June 25, 2001. This application, which the
State ruled as meeting the minimum requirements for compliance, addresses
all of the pertinent environmental and siting issues of the project,
including its design, location, fuel use, and air and water quality.

"The New York Siting Board's ruling puts us a step closer to providing Long
Island with a clean and affordable new source of electric power," said Peter
Giller, International Power's Chief Executive Officer. "We are planning to
begin construction of Brookhaven in the third quarter of next year and
expect to have the plant in service by the end of 2004," he added.

Notes to Editors-

The Brookhaven Energy project is proposed for development on 28 acres of
industrially zoned land just south of the Long Island Expressway at exit 66
and along the southeast corner of Sills Road in the Town of Brookhaven. When
completed, the plant will provide enough energy to power over half a million
homes. The project will also result in additional significant benefits to
the region, including job creation and substantial tax benefits.

International Power plc is one of the world's leading independent electric
generating companies with over 8,850 MW (net) in operation, 2,350 MW (net)
under construction and approximately 8,000 MW (net) in advanced development.
Among the countries where International Power has operating facilities are
Australia, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Czech Republic,
Portugal, Turkey, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Thailand. International Power was
created from the demerger of National Power, and its shares began trading
independently on the London Stock Exchange and as ADRs on the New York Stock
Exchange on 2 October 2000. The ticker symbol on both stock exchanges
is "IPR".

13:39 20Aug2001 RSF-ANALYSIS-Brazil energy diet slims utilities' accounts

    By Andrei Khalip
    RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil, Aug 20 (Reuters) - The latest corporate results by Brazilian power utilities provided only a glimpse of the impact of energy rationing that started in June, but enough for analysts to say the sector is probably the most hard-hit by Brazil's economic woes.
    Coupled with a sharp depreciation of the real currency, which has lost about one-fourth of its dollar value so far this year, and an overall economic slowdown, power rationing should hammer energy companies further in coming months.
    "Although the currency's depreciation was the main culprit of poor results in the second quarter and first half, power rationing has already shown its face," said Oswaldo Telles, power sector analyst with BBV Securities.
    "And it will get worse for power utilities this quarter."
    The government was forced to resort to tough power rationing in June, ordering Brazilians to knock 20 percent off their usual power consumption, in order to avert crippling blackouts amid an acute power shortage.
    Brazil is dependent on hydroelectric plants for over 90 percent of its electricity. Two years of drought and full use of power stations' capacity to feed a growing economy dried up reservoir levels and triggered the worst energy crisis in at least 30 years in Latin America's largest country.
    Rationing, due to last at least until November, means lower sales and revenues for power firms, while their costs and dollar-denominated debt get inflated by the real's losses.
    "It's only the beginning of rationing, but it gives us an idea of how power utilities, distributors in particular, will be affected," said Eduardo de la Pena of Banco Santander. "I think we can say that they are suffering the most."
    Out of electricity sector stocks, most analysts only have a buy recommendation for Copel <CPLE3.SA> of southern Parana state, where there is no energy shortage and no rationing.
    GOVERNMENT HELP SOUGHT
    Among the big losers in the past six months were Sao Paulo's Cesp <CESP4.SA> utility whose losses rose sharply and   Eletropaulo <ELPL4.SA>, controlled by US-based AES Corp. <AES.N>, which posted a net loss after a year-ago profit.
    Rio de Janeiro's power distributor Light <LIGH3.SA> last week posted its biggest half-year loss ever of 431 million reais ($172 million) and Light officials said the company should suffer big losses this year with revenues falling at least 10 percent due to the rationing program.
    The main problem for companies is that the government fixes electricity prices in Brazil -- even though most distributors had long been privatized -- and allows the adjustments to compensate for higher costs only once a year.
    "This year, their costs grew so violently that when the adjustments came it was about time to adjust tariffs again," said Telles. "But they just have to wait till next year.
    Analysts said the only bright spot may be that the government will allow companies to start adjusting tariffs twice in one year. There are rumors of such a change although analysts recognize such an unpopular measure would be difficult in the run-up to presidential elections next year.
   In an ironic twist, power distributors are now spending money on lawyers to defend in court the government's order for power switchoffs for quota-busters -- the measure that effectively slashes their revenues.
    In the meantime, the companies are banking on an obscure contractual clause, known as Annex V, that should compensate them for lost revenue due to rationing. Some have even booked that gain in the latest results, although the government has so far not confirmed that it will pay.
    "Annex V is the biggest question for power firms. If there is no compensation, they are screwed," said another analyst.

14:54 20Aug2001 RSF-Quebecers should have own citizenship - report

    By Marianne White
    QUEBEC CITY, Aug. 20 (Reuters) - In order to reaffirm the "precarious" status of French in North America, Quebecers should have their own citizenship, a provincial task force studying the status of the French language reported on Monday.
    But Quebecers would not get a new passport or be asked to choose between Quebec or Canadian citizenship, the report added.
    The goal is to make everyone, including new immigrants, English-speaking residents and native peoples, feel that they are part of Quebec, a French-speaking island in an English-dominated North America.
    "We want to do that in a way in which people know that linguistic policy is a fundamental characteristic of this society," said the chairman of the task force, Gerald Larose, a trade unionist who favors Quebec's separation from Canada.
    "As far as language is concerned, living in Quebec is not like living in Canada," Larose added.
    The Quebec government reacted with caution to the recommendation of Quebec citizenship, saying on Monday that it shared the ideals that underlie the recommendation.
    "We do need to have a welcoming ritual for immigrants in order to send a clear message," said Diane Lemieux, minister responsible for the French language, adding that the government would undertake an update of its language policy.
    The language task force, which crisscrossed the predominantly French-speaking province, which is three times the size of France, over the past 12 months, unveiled 149 recommendations on Monday.
    It urged the Quebec government to ask for full control over immigration to ensure new arrivals will learn French, a recommendation that is not likely to please the federal government which controls immigration in conjunction with provincial governments.
    The report also recommends a provincial exam for all new teachers to test their fluency in French, and says that if they fail they should not be hired. It also proposes increasing teaching hours for French, delaying the introduction of English teaching in schools by several years, and protecting the rights of Quebecers to work in French.
    About 82 percent of Quebec's six million people describe French is their mother tongue. French has been Quebec's official language since 1974 and by law must dominate commercial signs, although other languages may also appear. Quebec has 1.4 million people whose first language is not French.
    Language can be an emotional and divisive issue in Quebec, which has held two referendums on separating from Canada. In the last one, in 1995, Quebecers voted to remain in Canada only by a razor-thin margin.
    English and French have been Canada's two official languages since 1969, with both languages spoken widely throughout the nation's history

Can you provide a budget proposal by close of business Friday 18 May 2001
and follow up with fixed price proposal by Friday 25 May 2001.

Andy. Oops!  missed an n in Enron, trust you  receive this okay.
Alan Armour

Andy. We have received an RFQ for the subject  Plant. As mentioned to Alice
this morning it would not be possible to come up  with firm numbers for the
system by Friday. Do you need firm proposal or budget  pricing?
Further, Water Control Associates (WCA) would offer  an alternate side
stream system to that specified.
It would not make sense to supply tanks piping etc  from US sources for a
project in Italy. What  Water Control Associates could do is create the
design and specify the equipment  required to be primarily sourced in
Europe. For a cooling tower project in Chile  for Kvaerner (Vancouver) we
did just that, where some equipment bought by  Kvaerner came from USA and
other materials locally in Chile. WCA have a system  operating in Turkey.

Rika, 
I have had a request and I also think it is a good idea to put the regional gas price for the following regions.

PJM - Transco Zone 6 Non New York
NY - Transco Zone 6 New York
NEPOOL - Algonquin

The heat rates would then be calculated off the appropriate regional gas price.

Thanks

Dear Market Participants,

The NYISO is pleased to inform you about the following
enhancements to the MIS, OASIS and BAS that will be
implemented on May 29, 2001.

* Changes will be made to the Market Information System (MIS) to
make in-hour curtailment prioritization of transactions more
consistent with the BME scheduling process. Specific changes will
be made to:
- the NERC / ranked ordering,
- the addition of message for ICAP recall,
- the exclusion of Federal contracts from ICAP transactions
  recalled, and
- the inclusion of exports from LBMP reference bus as ICAP
  transactions.

* Also, for a transaction with an external source, the decremental
dollar will no longer be calculated. Please see Technical Bulletin
#61 for more information regarding transaction curtailments.

http://www.nyiso.com/services/documents/techbulletins/index.html

* Changes will also be made to the MIS to remove the $20,000 bias
from day ahead external transactions.

* New data will be posted to the NYISO OASIS web site to enhance
the presentation of real time data. The elements being added to
the web site include zonal real time (5 minute) load values and
zonal forecast load values. Consistent with a resolution passed by
the Business Issues Committee (BIC), zones J & K will be combined.

* The Shared Activation of Reserves (SAR) package on the real time
system will be enhanced to accommodate support for Hydro Quebec
(HQ) wheel-through transactions.

* The NYISO Day-ahead Price Responsive Load Program will be
implemented in both the MIS and the Billing and Accounting (BAS)
systems. The Day-ahead Price Responsive Load program offers
NYISO Customers the ability to supply a bid to the MIS indicating
the cost at which it will reduce its demand by a specified number
of MWs. The program will make use of the existing bidding and
scheduling web pages and upload / download templates.  However,
you must register for this program. Contact your Customer
Relations representative for details. Documents containing
instructions with more details will be issued soon.

* Other changes to the Billing & Accounting system (BAS) will
incorporate changes to the Daily Advisory Statements that will
provide additional columns of information on the Power Suppliers
section of the advisory. Also, new CSV reports will be provided
that give more detailed load information and static sub-zone
definition. More information will be provided soon about a
software tool to filter this new data.  It will be provided for
Market Participants whose automated data retrieval systems are not
prepared to receive the revised Daily Advisory statement.

Change #'s:
SWHE-4WQLHZ; KKIR-4WQLHE; VLEE-4WQQGL; RDEY-4WTLS6; DCUK-4WRGYU

If you notice any NYISO systems behave other than intended after
the scheduled implementation date, please let us know immediately.

It will be helpful if you refer to this notice if you communicate with
us about these changes.

Thank you,
Customer Relations
phone: 518-356-6060

Tomorrow is the CSS Training program for PJM.  CSS will now be a part of the EED tool not used to schedule transactions from and to PJM neighbors.

It is an online training session.  Please let me know if you can't attend.

Date : 6/5
Time : 2:00 PM
It will be in conference room 3125b

Aaron,
The house we live in is about 1700 Sq foot.. older home that needed some fixing up.  At the time I thought we paid too much, however prices in the neighborhood skyrocketed just after we bought the home.  The Houston Texans (a very original name) have developed the new stadium and have torn down some of the seedier hotels in the area in their wake.  Also, they have totally redone South Main Blvd creating a nice thoroughfare. The area is experincing a lot of renovation which is adding value to the neighborhood!  However, home values go up and down just like the stock market.  Most important thing is that we like the home and are very comfortable there.

When we had the house remodeled it was a nightmare, I think the guy was an alcoholic and he did a half ass job.  I prefer to do it myself, I like the way it looks when I do it and it is whole lot cheaper.  One day the contractor almost died in the house... he lost his tooth and proceeded to take a bunch of Advil to ease the pain; however he did this on an empty stomach.  He had to be rushed to the hospital and was there for a week!  He ended up returning and finishing the job?!?!  Anyways, I have to say that it was a good learning experience and next time I will have a better idea on how to get things done.  It was hard to organize and quality assure the job since I had just started a demanding job here at Enron.  All in all, I think France or US you run into the same types of problems with contractors.  

Talking about wild flowers and plants.. the same is true for Costa Rica.   Plants that only grow indoors with great care in Houston grow like weeds in Costa Rica.  I recommend that on your places to go list.

Merry Christmas, Feliz Natal, and Feliz Navidad
Later

Cher Paul:

That sounds like a nice marriage.  When we got married it was nothing
extraordinary, just a small and informal marriage celebration.

Yeah, I know Braeswood and Buffalo.  I'm sure you paid a pretty penny for
the neighbourhood -- it's a nice area.  We've done horrendous amounts of
work to our apartment.  We are doing something like a loft with it and we
had to gut it by removing most of the walls and floors, etc.  Soon we will
be putting in a mezzanine floor (it's a trendy thing here).  We had two huge
bins full of debris in front of our home for about a week!  Artisans in
France don't like working very much and when they decide to work they do
just enough of it to get by so customers are very unsatisfied when they are
finished.  Inevitably, the customer must always bargain the price down at
the end because more artisans must be hired to come in and finish all that
which was not done.  It's a hell of a mess but to be fair the same problems
exist in the States it's just that I've never owned a home before.  In the
end I decided it's much easier and faster to do it yourself and bypass the
contractor all together.  Plus you can do a much better job yourself!

Yes, I need to go to Rio.  I've been to Hawaii and to date it is the most
beautiful place I have ever seen.  Waikiki has exotic flowers -- that cost
$15 a piece anywhere else -- growing on the sidewalks like any ordinary
flower!!!

BTW, I was thoroughly impressed with Yosemite.  I've been trying to plan a
vacation back there ever since we left.

Kudos,
Aaron

Well Aaron,
It is great to hear that you are doing well.

Yes, Raquel and I ( the same gal I was dating at Genesis) ended up tying
the knot in late April in Rio.  We got married in small church on the
Lagoa, quite a beautiful place to get married.  Above the church sat the
giant statue of Christ the Redeemer looking down on us.  My parents, family
and friends attended and I know what you mean by fish out of the water!

We bought a house over off of Buffalo and Braeswood.   I too have learned a
lot about fixing up homes, it is something that I have actually begun to
enjoy.  The house is great except for the mortgage that we owe to the bank.
We are now considering paying it off, however I am not sure for how much
longer we will live there. Therefore, not sure if we really want to pay it
off.

As far as children go, we are still waiting for the right time.  I imagine
we will have one in a year or so... right now we are enjoying taking
vacations on a whim.  Went to Rio in early Sept and got stuck there for
week and 1/2 due to the terrorist attacks.  Not such a bad place to be
stuck.  I definitely would encourage you to take a trip there.  It is
different from most great cities in the world.  For example Paris, Rome,
London, NYC are all famous for the great buildings, etc... however, Rio is
one of the most naturally beautiful places you will ever see (as far as a
city settings go).  The huge majestic tropical mountains merging with the
white sand beaches and blue sea.  It is the cidade maravillosa!!!

Take care and have a great Christmas.

Paul

   Hi Paul:

   How have you been?  How is Enron treating you?, well I hope?

   Yeah, we moved to Lyon at the beginning of 2000.  When looking at a map
   of
   our solar system, Lyon is practically in the center of France.  We're
   more
   or less located at the foot of the French Alps.  At about a million
   people,
   Lyon is smaller than Houston.

   Because of the Internet Boom, my Internet investments appreciated enough
   to
   buy us an apartment in an old neighbourhood located in the center of the
   city.  We've been renovating it ever since.  I've learned a hell of a
   lot
   about working on homes!

   Before David Underwood got fired he told me that you got married and
   bought
   a house in or near Linkwood (off Stella Link).  I imagine you married
   that
   young Brazilian lady that you were dating while at Genesis?
   F?licitations!
   Have you been to Brazil?  I'd like to see it one day if ever the
   opportunity
   presents itself.  Since you're hitched now, I guess you are obligated to
   have children soon. :)

   So yes, since the 22nd of September I've been the proud father of a baby
   girl -- Camille.  She's a real angel and quite a character too (read
   rascal).  I hope Enron allows you to receive e-mail attachments that are
   not
   work related because I've attached a photo of her that is as recent as
   tonight.  She's got brown eyes like her mommy.

   I heard you went to NYC.  How did you like it?  I love NYC and I was
   just
   there one week ago!  No matter how many times I go there I will never
   run
   out of things to do.  This last time I saw an exhibit on Brazil at the
   Guggenheim.  There are still a number of museums and neighbourhoods that
   I've not seen so I know I will return.  Actually, I ponder the idea of
   getting a small apartment there so that we can go and soak up a little
   American culture for six months at a time (NYC is only six hours from
   Paris).  Since Camille is American, I think this would be good for her.
   Of
   course the problem is the price of an apartment.  It's bloody expensive,
   mate.  (Stress BLOODY)  I asked one agency and they told me $450,000 for
   a
   studio apartment in a nice area on Manhattan (I don't know how accurate
   this
   off-the-cuff quote was).  That's a little too much for me unless I get a
   mortgage which I horror the idea of owing any bank money.  Perhaps
   something
   cheaper can be found in a crack neighbourhood.  You know, the ones with
   ugly
   whores hanging around every small street intersection.  Then there's
   Harlem,
   maybe I can get a pad next to Clinton's.

   June 10th, 2000, we got married for a second time.  The marriage was in
   France and all my in-laws attended as well as my mother and aunt too.
   They
   (my mother and aunt) were a little shocked to say the least.  They speak
   no
   French and were like fish out of water (to say the least).  But you
   didn't
   hear this from me.

   I've tons of little day-to-day stories that are worth a laugh but this
   e-mail covers all the big stuff that's been happening.

   Best Regards,
   Aaron

Attached FYI is the weekly update prepared by the NYISO. In addition, sever=
al noteworthy actions were taken at Wednesday's Management Committee meetin=
g:
ICAP: Culminating an 18-month effort that I have been chairing, the MC gave=
 final approval to two fundamental changes to NY's ICAP market, that, if ap=
proved by FERC, would go into effect on Nov.1, 2001, with the start of the =
winter capability period. The first changes the nature of determining the p=
roduct to be bought and sold from one based on tests results (ICAP) to one =
that includes, as an element, a unit's forced outage rate (referred to as u=
nforced capacity or UCAP). The design adopted by NY is very similar to the =
accreditation system that has been used in PJM for many years.  It will rew=
ard units that are more available than the average unit in the state, and i=
ncent the below average units to improve their availability. The second maj=
or change adopted moves NY to a monthly procurement requirement for loads. =
The current requirement is six months at a time. The change should facilita=
te customer switching under retail access programs and avoid the experience=
 just witnessed in upstate NY for this summer capability period, where 1400=
 MW of load were deficient and got stuck paying a huge deficiency price for=
 the entire six month period. Under the revised program, load could cover t=
heir positions month by month. This latter change was approved by the MC ov=
er the objections of the PSC and certain utilities, who continued to argue =
that any change to the current ICAP rules may damage NY's reliability.=20
Penalty and Public Disclosure Provisions: In a surprise vote, the PSC-led e=
ffort to get the MC to approve additions to the ISO's Market Mitigation Pla=
n that would add penalty and public disclosure provisions for parties whose=
 bids are mitigated by the ISO was defeated when only 55% voted for the mea=
sure. (A 58% vote is required for passage.) An earlier version of the propo=
sal had been passed by the MC but had been rejected by the ISO Board becaus=
e it applied only to suppliers and not to all market participants found to =
engage in behavior detrimental to the market. The PSC-led effort to respond=
 to the Board's concerns apparently caused enough supporters of the origina=
l version to change their vote this time around. Whether this effort is res=
urrected again (by the PSC/utilities or the Board itself) may hinge on what=
 FERC decides with respect to the circuit breaker proposal pending before F=
ERC. The ISO Board has made clear it wants something in effect this summer =
to help it  manage price spikes.
Unbundling of Schedule 1 Charges: Efforts to finalize the unbundling of the=
 ISO's fixed schedule 1 charges (nearly $100 million a year) were sent back=
 to a working group for further work. However, the direction to be taken fo=
r some issues appears clear.=20
TCCs: We succeeded in convincing the group that no costs should be assigned=
 to existing TCCs, and that if costs are to be assigned to this market, the=
y should be allocated on the basis of the relative price paid for the TCCs =
compared to the annual auction revenues, rather than on the basis of number=
 of TCCs purchased.
Exports and Wheelthroughs: We succeeded in getting a separate category crea=
ted for these transactions that will result in $/MWH costs that are much le=
ss than what is currently charged. Conversely, there is now likely to be a =
small charge on imports into NY; however, since all generation will be hit =
with this charge, it should be reflected in everyone's bids equally and sim=
ply passed on to the loads through the market clearing price.
The exact amount of these various charges will depend on resolution of a nu=
mber of issues including whether the TOs should be assessed a portion of th=
e ISO's overhead right off the top.

Paul,

During testing of the NYISO Deal Upload I noticed that there are many hourly deals in Enpower for the same NYISO Transaction ID.

Please tell your guys that if this is going to work there can only be ONE deal in Enpower for EACH NY trans id.

__

The testing is almost complete - as it stands now the upload can be used for NE-PHYS deals (I have updated 6/1-6/18), but until we resolved
The problem mentioned above it can NOT be used for HRLY-NE deals.

There are still some enhancements needed for error/warning processing and reporting and researching.

Thanks,

Rebecca

I think the not sharing the room is the part that I should be worrried about... would not want to be in a confined space with you taking YAMS!

Paul,

I spoke with David Lawrence.  He did indicate that there would be slide presentations available prior to the meeting with which conference-call participants could use to keep up but acknowledged that attendance would probably be more effective.  I'd suggest talking with Dana about the prospect of attending.

Tom--let me know what you'd prefer & if Dana wants Paul to attend we can make arrangements together (as long as I don't have to share a room with Paul).

Jeff

Folks,

We should have a couple of people take part in this training.  Dana/Paul, do you have anyone taking part?  

Jeff, would you talk to the contact person listed below and find out if you think it is worth sending someone or if we can get enough benefit by participating via teleconference?

Thanks,

I appreciate the great work!  Like we said, come over around 2:30 and we can go over the procedures.

I researched all the errors and they were deal entry problems on the scheduler or trader's side, not program errors.

I think is looks good and can be moved into production.

We will have to watch it closely for a while and the might be some small changes or enhancements, but overall I think it is done.

I will get together with the schedulers and traders sometime today to show them what to do.

Thanks for all your hard work.

Lloyd, Stephen, 

 

Below is a piece that we're sending out to all the testers in our PowerSurge beta group.  Hope you get some value out of it.

                                                                                                                                                            

 

The FTR market is fast emerging among traders in the PJM market as a reliable means of hedging the transmission risk associated with power deals.  Some players have even found opportunities for speculative trading in these markets.  Whether you're a veteran player in the FTR market, or are just beginning to consider how participating in the market could help your trading, PowerSurge's FTR module provides you with the information and tools you need to answer your questions about the FTR market.

 

1.  How are my FTRs doing?

If you're already participating in the FTR market, this tool will give you a daily display of how your FTRs are doing.  By tracking the day ahead LMPs and FTR market clearing prices PowerSurge can tell you whether or not your FTR option is in the money.  Similarly, you can use the FTR tool to find out how your competitor's FTRs are doing. Go to the PowerSurge FTR Module:

<http://www.friedwire.com/common/jsp/login/login.jsp?loginto=POWERSURGE&gotohref=/pjm/transmission/pjmftr.jsp>

2.  What is this FTR worth?

PowerSurge's FTR module can also help you determine what to pay for an FTR.  By compiling all of the historical pricing information on FTRs, PowerSurge allows you to see how the market has valued these FTRs in the past, as well as how they have actually performed.  This is an easy way to find undervalued FTRs for speculative trading, or simply determine what to bid on an FTR, whether it be in the auction or in the bilateral market.  This pricing information in combination with the physical power information (current and historical congestion, and scheduled transmission outages) contained in FriedWire's Traffic Report, provides traders and schedulers with a wealth of information for valuing FTRs.  Go to the Traffic Report:

<http://www.friedwire.com/common/jsp/login/login.jsp?loginto=TRAFFICREPORT&gotohref=/trafficreport/frontpage/fwwelcome.jsp>

Who's Got What?

PowerSurge's FTR module summarizes FTR information by Source, Sink, Path, and Owner.  The FTR owner summaries allow you to keep track of every FTR in your own company's current portfolio as well as keep tabs on what your competitors' holdings are.

While trading on EOL or moving physical power you should not have a position larger than 100 MW.  If you find yourself at these positions while trading EOL you should then widen your market so that you do not take on a larger position.  If you have any questions please let me know.  

I would recommend that you put EOL product properties on manage stack... then you will be able to widen your market easily when your position reaches the 100 MW limit.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Gary,

We spoke last week about opportunities that your company currently has open.  Currently, I am making markets on Enron Online for the PJM cash and term off peak market.  In addition, I still manage the Northeast Physical book for the Northeast (PJM, NYISO, and NEPOOL) and manage the Northeast real time trading desk.  I also have participated in the PJM FTR and NYISO TCC market in my tenure here at Enron.  
The opportunities that I would most be interested are those located here in the Houston area.  My second choice would then be those positions located in Florida.  I look forward to talking to you soon.

Hey bundalicious!

How are you doing?  We only have one more day to go before the holiday.  I can't wait to spend the week with you!

I wanted to get you dad's email address.

Love ME

David,

Diana Allen and the IT team are currently working on resovling the bad Zone P day ahead and real time data.  Diana told me that it was pulling the PJM data.  

As far as the shift notes go:
I talked to Rob Benson about the shift notes and he said that they have improved greatly.  The PJM summary page is pretty accurate (usually w/in 50 cents of the actual number).  The link for the spreadsheet is:  http://eastpower.test.corp.enron.com/portal/summary/pjmsummary.aspx  .. you might have been using an old version.  

I will continue to manage the Northeast physical book.  It allows me to effectively hedge my long or short position in the off peak market. 

Paul.

While writing the e-mail Diana said that she fixed the Zone P problem.

Paul,
I have been doing some analysis and have found a few problems that should be looked at.

1.  The number Mother data is pulling for Zone P is wrong.  The pointer for the data can be found on the SQL worksheet the expression is:
	  avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'DAYAHEAD', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_DA,
and	  avg(decode(prc.power_reference_period_cd,'HOURLY', decode(pl.location_name,'PJM',price_amt))) PJM_RT,

I have looked at the PJM and NY prices and am unable to figure out where the number is coming from.

2.  The other 24hr desk evidently has been told that the PJM night shift is to prep the PJM and Nepool portions of the shift notes.  That is fine with me.  I wrote a macro to pull, format and print the Nepool information.  The PJM information is not available on the website.  The East power portal has something.  I think it does some kind of Op Sum pull at some unknown interval.  The problem is the information is not accurate.  

Rob Bensen's frustration with this bad information is the main reason the other 24hr desk doesn't want any part of the reporting.

2.a All data points are different than the one hour averages calculated in edata.  This makes me doubt that opsum is the source, as edata also pulls from opsum.

2.b When all interfaces and hubs are printing the same, the prices shown differ in the same hour on the website.  I have no idea where this information is coming from but it is not right.  If the correct data can be found there is an application that pulls from the database at "M:\Electric\24hour\PJM AVE\PJMSummary.exe".  If they could fix this app I would care less about the web site.  If they do not want to fix the app I can write a macro to pull the same data from the mother data template.  I don't really care how I get the data, I just need to get yesterday's PJM for the shift note.

In other news, if you are trading some of the regular products, are you following the DA-RT physical moves?  If we do man the 24hr desk (even if Bryce is the day guy) we could cover the DA-RT physical.  Having it part of the 24hr desk would seem to make sense because the evening load and more up to date weather forecasts could be used when entering the NY side in the early morning.

I only mention this if you are finding yourself too busy trading PJM to spend the same amount of time on the analysis.  It is certainly easier to do uninterrupted analysis on the back shift.  Just a thought.

Thanks,
David

Peterman,
DP&L called.. they are having trouble checking out a deal from October 5th.  They sounded all twisted off so I told them that you would call them Monday.. 

The guys name is Dave Antonides @ 937-331-4576

Brain,
I need to you to purchase Oasis for me for Friday, Sat, Sun, and Monday.  I am unable to do it because it must be done the day b4... so tomorrow (Thurs) I will need to buy Fri Oasis.. Friday you will be able to buy Oasis for Sat, Sun and Monday.  The ramp is set and you will need to see what gets accepted on the NY side to make sure the ramp matches the volumes accepted in NY.

--- The PJM ID # is N78958 << this is the PJM schedule where the ramp and Oasis needs to be purchased.
--- The NY ID # is 5039123 << this is NY schedule that is flowing.

--- PJM will ask you if NY IS # 5043451 is flowing? The answer is no.

Give me a call so I can walk you through it the first time

What is the amount?

Paul:

The estimated trans loss charges for August have been entered (NE Hourly # 700778.3 @ ; NE Phys # 700783.3).  They're unusually high due to the increase in deal volumes as well as inflated prices due to extreme heat (08/06 thru 08/10 in particuar).  If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to come by and discuss with me or Rebecca.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.

We need to work through this.. some of this amount needs to go to the New York short term trader.. I am going to look into and will need a breakdown from you day by for these days(8/6 thru 8/10).

I am sure I do not understand the basis for the information but two reports seem to contradict.  

The PJM 180 day forecast predicts 4000MW offline today.
<http://eastpower.dev.corp.enron.com/portal/basic_page.aspx?mod=8&title=PJM%20Generation%20Outages&url=/Cooper/PJMOutage.asp>

The PJM outage report predicts 1908 MW offline.  
<http://eastpower.dev.corp.enron.com/portal/basic_page.aspx?mod=8&url=http://eastpower.dev.corp.enron.com/scripts/outage.dll?REGION=MAAC>

Do we have a feel for which of these is more reliable?    
Li, Jiewen; Symms, Mark
Thanks,
David Ingram

Hoon,
I just looked at the Bernhardt website and I didn't see the style we want, but
they had on the catalog at the Noel store.

the style is CATALINA - two love seats and a wage (the middle part) and it comes
w/ 4 pillows
the fabric is FLAIR - on the sofa the code is 7063-010
                 - on two pillows the code is 7143-032
                 - on two pillows the code is 7132-002

Noel's price - $5228 with delivery included

I would like two or three more pillows, depending  on the additional cost.

Let me know what Louis Shanks and the other place  says about it!

Love
me

Susan,
Please let me know if this gets approved? furthermore, I would like to see the Tariff to see if the changes will affect our business.

Thanks
Paul

 
On September 4, 2001, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) filed revisions to amend Attachment F of the NYISO Market Administration and Control Area Services Tariff to extend the duration of its currently effective $1,000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO-administered markets; and amend Attachment Q to the NYISO's Open Access Transmission Tariff and Attachment E of the ISO Services Tariff to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities.  

If you need further information please let me know.

She is still checking, funny you asked because I just talked with her.
I miss you and can't wait to look at furniture with you this afternoon

     Have thei called you with the new price???

Urban legend .. Osama was fighting for the US then I think.  Interesting

you believe this????

  Subject: Do you remember this?  Ollie made the headlines in
  1987 and was laughed at by the News Media.

 IT WAS 1987!

 At a lecture the other day they played an old video of Lt.
 Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during the
 Reagan administration.

 There was Ollie in front of God and country getting the third degree.
 But what he said was stunning!!
 He was being drilled by some senator; "Did you not recently spend close
 to $60,000 for home security system?"

 Ollie replied, "Yes I did sir." The senator continued, trying to get a
 laugh out of the audience," Isn't this just a little excessive?" "No
 sir," continued Ollie.

 "No? And why not?" the senator asked.

 "Because the lives of my family and I were threatened sir."

 "Threatened? By whom?" the senator questioned.

 "'By a terrorist, sir." Ollie answered.

 "Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?"

 "His name is Osama bin Laden sir." Ollie replied.

 At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but
 couldn't pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A
 couple of people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.

 "Why are you so afraid of this man?" the senator asked.

 "Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know
 of," Ollie answered.

 "And what do you recommend we do about him?" asked the senator.
 "Well sir, if it were up to me, I would recommend that an
 assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of
 the earth."

 The senator disagreed with this approach and that was all that
 was shown of the clip.

 If anyone is interested, the Senator turned out to be none
 other than Al Gore.

Thanks you for help? Do you know where I might be able to get a quote on the Flair Collection??

Paul

Hi Paul,
I'm so sorry, I thought your phone number was on this message but now that I
looked at it further it's not on here.

I was just notified by management that we don't have the Flair collection.
We have regular Bernhardt but not this one.

My apology for the inconvenience this might cause.

As you know, the U.S. government is investigating hundreds, if not thousands, of relatives, acquaintances and associates of the individuals who may have been involved in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.  We believe that the media will soon be reporting that one of the many individuals being questioned is an Enron employee in Houston.  It is appropriate for us to withhold judgment and to continue to cooperate fully with federal authorities.  Because this is a matter in the hands of the federal authorities, we cannot provide additional information at this time.   However, we will keep you informed, to the greatest extent possible. 

Please keep in mind that thousands of people who may or may not have any information about the terrorist attacks are being questioned as part of this investigation.  We continue to have every reason to believe that our employees and facilities are safe.  If you have concerns, please call Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804.  If you receive any media or external inquiries about this matter, please call Public Relations at (713) 853-5670.

At Enron, diversity is one of our strengths, and we respect and embrace all people of all faiths and beliefs.  Please continue to keep our employees who have been impacted by this tragedy in your thoughts and prayers.

How about 2 of these chairs

Kim, we would like to extend a formal offer to Reagan J. Mathews who is currently working for Enron Broadband.  Please forward the formal documentation to Reagan so that the transfer to East Power can take place.

Cows and World Order

 A CHRISTIAN: You have two cows. You keep one and give
 one to your neighbor.

 A REPUBLICAN: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none.
 So what?

 A DEMOCRAT: You have two cows. Your neighbor has none.
 You feel guilty for being successful. You vote people
 into office who tax your cows, forcing you to sell one
 to raise money to pay the tax. The people you voted for
 then take the tax money and buy a cow and give it to
 your neighbor. You feel righteous.

 A SOCIALIST: You have two cows. The government takes one
 and gives it to your neighbor.

 A COMMUNIST: You have two cows. The government seizes
 both and provides you with milk.

 A FASCIST: You have two cows. The government seizes both
 and sells you the milk. You join the underground and
 start a campaign of sabotage.

 DEMOCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The
 government taxes you to the point you have to sell both
 to support a man in a foreign country who has only one
 cow, which was a gift from your government.

 CAPITALISM, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. You sell
 one, buy a bull, and build a herd of cows.

 BUREAUCRACY, AMERICAN STYLE: You have two cows. The
 government takes them both, shoots one, milks the other,
 pays you for the milk, then pours the milk down the
 drain.

 AN AMERICAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You sell
 one, and force the other to produce the milk of four
 cows. You are surprised when the cow drops dead.

 A FRENCH CORPORATION: You have two cows. You go on
 strike because you want three cows.

 A JAPANESE CORPORATION: You have two cows. You redesign
 them so they are one-tenth the size of an ordinary cow
 and produce twenty times the milk.

 A GERMAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You re-engineer
 them so they live for 100 years, eat once a month, and
 milk themselves.

 AN ITALIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows, but you don't
 know where they are. You break for lunch.

 A RUSSIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You count them
 and learn you have five cows. You count them again and
 learn you have 42 cows. You count them again and learn
 you have 12 cows. You stop counting cows and open
 another bottle of vodka.

 A MEXICAN CORPORATION: You think you have two cows, but
 you don't know what a cow looks like. You take a nap.

 A SWISS CORPORATION: You have 5000 cows, none of which
 belongs to you. You charge for storing them for others.

 A BRAZILIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You enter
 into a partnership with an American corporation. Soon
 you have 1000 cows and the American corporation declares
 bankruptcy.

 AN INDIAN CORPORATION: You have two cows. You worship
 them.

Dave,

I have signed up for Virtual Bidding course in Albany for October 16.  I was wondering if would be worthwhile to attend to course since you and Frank are coming to Houston the next week.  Basically, do you think that you can give us the same information that the course would while you are here?  Please let me know.

Dave, 
Willis Philip and I are scheduled to arrive in Albany around 2:45 PM on Oct. 15.  That should give us time to meet you there by 4 pm, however, if we should be delayed I will give you a call.  I appreciate you taking time to show us around your facilities.  

Furthermore, we can all meet together when you come on the 22nd.  That should enable us to cover all the issues without redundancy.  I will talk to with Juan to firm up the exact meeting hours so that we can have an agenda for the day. 

Paul

Paul,

As we discussed in our recent phone call, my recommendation is to attend
the course, because the level of detail will be far greater than we in the
Customer Relations department can provide. I have tentatively reserved a
conference room at the Power Control Center for 4 pm, on Oct. 15th if you
are able to make it. I've also invited  F. Francis to join us. Please let
me know if you will be able to meet at 4pm, or some later time.

Also, I spoke with Juan Padron this morning and firmed-up our plans for
Frank and I to visit you in Houston on the 10/22. We will plan to be in
Houston for whatever hours are convenient to meet with you and Juan on that
day. I suggested to Juan that if there are any issues that you would like
us to address during the visit, just let us know ahead of time so that we
may prepare.

Thanks,

Casey,
I reconciled my P&L and I am off from your final P&L number for the month.

I am showing a Profit of ~ $596,000 ? however I flowed approx 68,000 MW which would incur a charge of ($136,000).  Therefore my final P&L number should be ~ $460,000.

Your final showed $341,000.

Please give me a call.

Folks,

Who is planning on attending the virtual bidding seminar in NY?

Tom.

AStorey@nyiso.com writes to the NYISO_TECH_EXCHANGE Discussion List:

NYISO opens its Virtual Marketplace on November 1. Whether you've
registered to participate in it, are considering doing so, or are
interested in its potential impact on the existing markets, you'll want to
attend one of the two upcoming seminars scheduled for October 16 and 29.

The programs will cover:
     NYISO bidding fundamentals - a short overview for those new to the
NYISO marketplace
     Virtual Transaction basics
     Virtual Transaction entry
     Virtual Transaction charges
     Billing
     Credit requirements
     Illustrations and examples
     Market Monitoring functions involving Virtual Transactions

Each one-day program will be intensive and practical. It will address your
virtual bidding options and the impact these bids will have on prices in
both the day-ahead and real-time markets. It will give you a good picture
as to how this market works and how your participation may be advantageous
to you.

The day-ahead and real-time markets will change as a result of this new
option. Therefore, this course will be extremely valuable, not only to
those bidding virtual transactions, but also to everyone bidding load or
supply in the existing energy markets.

The course will be run on the following dates as indicated:
     October 16     Albany Marriott, 189 Wolf Road, Albany, New York
     October 29     Desmond Hotel, 660 Albany-Shaker Road, Albany, New York

Course Registration will begin at 8:00 am and the course will start at 8:30
am. Wrap-up each day will be by 4:00 pm.

Register for the seminar through our web site at:

I do not think it was a price revision, hence I would like to see all the deals from the last half of the month.  I think some deals might have entered into the system incorrectly.  I will contact Warrick to see what deals he shows in the system.

Paul

Paul,

We have already finalized Sept. P&L....our deadline was 5 p.m. yesterday.  Therefore, any changes from what was issued yesterday will simply come back to you in a flash adjustment at the end of this month or the following month.  Its possible that price revisions occurred which were not picked up by the download in Enpower.

Thanks.
Casey 

Casey,
I reconciled my P&L and I am off from your final P&L number for the month.

I am showing a Profit of ~ $596,000 ? however I flowed approx 68,000 MW which would incur a charge of ($136,000).  Therefore my final P&L number should be ~ $460,000.

Your final showed $341,000.

Please give me a call.

Paul
x3-0403

Dave,
Paul and I have met and put together a list of proposed items we would like you elaborate on when you come to visit on Oct-22:

1.  How Day-Ahead, Real-Time, and Hour-Ahead markets are cleared.  Procedures for Price Revision.  The different components involved in SCVC & BME models and how they work.
2.  The procedure and rules on how Generators bid in their capacity.
3.  Fundamental Impact on NYCA due to the Sep 11 catastrophe.
4.  Overview of the proposed NorthEast RTO and NYISO's feeling about where the whole process is headed.
5.  Impacts on NY with Ontario's restructuring and impacts with HQ transfers to NY.
6.  How Transmission Charges are calculated when transacting with neighboring regions.
7.  Review the different components involved with the calculation of the MSC and MAC, and their respective adjustments.
8.  Impacts on UCAP due to "New Calculation" of ICAP accounting for EFOR for In-City and ROS
9.  Procedures followed with Load Curtailment and Demand Response Programs.

Please call us should you have any question regarding any of the topics listed above.  We will gladly elaborate on what we would like to discuss.  

Looking forward to meeting you.

I think these are the sunglasses that I am going to order.  They are the same ones I had last time except the frame is black instead of brown.  

Thought this was interesting

I understand there was a problem on my desk this week with a market that was
posted and executed on by one of our traders. I was not in the office and a
decision was made for the trade to stand.

I apologize if there was a lack of professionalism at this end. We do a lot of
business with Enron and  I am interested in keeping a working business
relationship.

Please include me in any discrepancies with our real-time traders and their
accounts: pplhourly(1-8).

A small deal,as I see it you owe us a jab...and I won't be asking for any
favors any time soon.

Just as an FYI for you both- you will receive your tuition reimbursement on your 1/31/01 check.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

Thanks,

Anne,

Irma did give me the forms last week.  Both Peter and Paul will see their tuition on 1/31/02 check

Veronica,

I gave those to Irma just before we left for Christmas.  They did not have your stamp on them, as Ben had not turned them into you yet.  Irma said, however, that they could still be processed.

we turned in those forms you found lurking in Ben's desk, didn't we?  i think so.

Jeanie,

We currently do not have tuition for both Paul and Peter.  I did not notice that they are in the Ass/Ana grp.  You might want to check w/ Terry Bosien as her team had this process separate from us at one point.

Paul Thomas and Peter Makkai submitted tuition re-imbursement forms to Kim Melodick prior to bankruptcy approx Nov. 15.  I can not track down the actual paperwork and wanted to make sure that this was being processed.  Please confirm.

Virtual Bidding Questions

1)	How is uplift allocated when there is thunderstorm alert in NYC?  Is the uplift allocated to those short going into the real time
 in Zone J/K only or is it allocated statewide?
2)	When is uplift allocated statewide as opposed to superzone?
3)	Are credit amounts going to be adjusted and when?  Right now they are using the delta @ Zone K x 14 days of exposure.

Thanks Tom

Paul,

Attached is a spreadsheet with the deals for HRLY NE for 10-15 thru 10-19.  It appears that most of the deals are financial deals done at R1E (Westhub), R1C (NY West), and R1B (Nepool).  These deals all have financial true-ups that come through in the financial liquidations line on your P&L.  I have tried to break the liquidations values down deal by deal.  When looking at the deals, please note that the liquidation amounts are the opposite value that they appear on the spreadsheet.  For instance, looking in the highlighted yellow column, the value should be the opposite value shown.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks

Do we do any business on Chandeleur?  They have filed to expand their system 
by about 40,000 Mcf/d and to interconnect with Destin Pipeline at the 
Pascagoula Chevron refinery.  Apparently there was an open season.

Please let me know within the next couple of days whether we should intervene 
or not.  I have never had any inquiries or expressions of interest in 
Chandeleur, so I will assume not unless I hear from you otherwise. 

As reported previously in the trade press, Petal Gas Storage has decided to 
build its own pipeline to connect its storage facility in Forrest Co., MS to 
interconnections with Southern Natural, Destin, and Transco in Clarke and 
Jasper Cos., MS.  We have received FERC's notice of the application (Docket 
No. CP01-69), and will be filing an intervention before the February 20 
deadline.  Southern Company Services has contracted for the full 700,000 
Mcf/day of capacity for a term of 20 years.  The project calls for about 59 
miles of 36-inch pipeline and a 9,000 HP compressor station at a cost of 
about $94,343,700.

As part of its application, Petal also submitted pro forma tariff provisions 
and rates for firm and interruptible transportation services and asked for 
authority to charge negotiated rates.  Petal also requested approval of 
certain deviations from the pro forma transportation agreement for the 
contract with Southern, apparently to allow Southern to act as agent for its 
affiliated operating electric utilities to apportion capacity among them.

Please advise if you have any issues with Petal that should be made a part of 
our intervention.  The certificate application is 635 pages, not including 
another 778 pages for the environmental reports, so I'm not going to request 
a copy unless someone indicates a desire to review it.

FYI.  At the last technical conference, National Fuel agreed to provide two 
hours notice on intra-day recalls, up from their one-hour proposal.  We will 
track their filing to make sure they don't file something else.

David Reitz of National Fuel indicated that the pipeline is back to its 
position before the last technical conference with regard to keeping the TBF 
fee a part of the imbalance resolution process as opposed to making it a 
separate service.  As a fall back position, National Fuel will seek guidance 
from FERC as to whether it should be made into a new service.  To make PA OCA 
happy, David Reitz indicated that any future proposal will incorporate the 
50-50 sharing that is in the current proposal.

National Fuel plans to make a revised pro forma tariff filing in mid-January 
and inform FERC that this filing resulted from the collaborative effort of 
parties to the proceeding.  The filing will have reservation of rights 
language that preserves National Fuel's right to file something completely 
different when it files to place the revised tariff sheets into effect.  
Prior to making the filing, National Fuel will circulate the explanatory 
transmittal letter and pro forma tariff sheets, and will flag any changes 
made to the pro forma tariff sheets.  This pre-filing circulation should 
occur some time during the first two weeks in January.

Nothing was said about the intra-day recall provisions.

>>> <Rebecca.W.Cantrell@enron.com> 12/18/00 03:39PM >>>

Yes, please.  I have another meeting, so I probably won't be able to dial
in.  What are the directions, just in case?

Let me know if they try to make any changes in the intraday recall
provisions.

Thanks.

Do you want us to participate in the telephone conference tomorrowat 10:00
Eastern time?  I haven't seen any revised tariff sheets, so I'm not quite
sure what will be discussed besides National Fuel's decision not to make
the TBF service a separate service.

	
	

Please review.

Hi Judy,

I spoke with Chris Germany yesterday and he said that you were going to take 
care of fixing the Oglethorpe deal.  An unhappy Doug Jones from Oglethorpe 
called me yesterday.  He is wanting to get the corrected invoice ASAP so he 
can have the wire to us before year end.  If he doesn't get the invoice 
today, he will not pay us until after the first of the year.  

Please let me know when to expect the changes to come across so I can forcast 
the cash receipt in our system for treasury and also let Doug know when the 
invoice will be faxed over to him.

Thanks to everyone involved for all of your help.  Merry Christmas!

Could you please send the service agreement into Koch for the Ormet 
transaction.  This memo that I wrote to Scott details the rates that we have 
negotiated with Koch.  Koch has to post our deal for five days, so could you 
please try to send it out today if at all possible.  I am also sending you 
the draft letter agreement that Koch sent to us which we will also need to 
execute.  We will also need to put an IT agreement in place with Koch.  They 
have offered the same discounted rates on an IT basis for any volumes above 
the 15,000/d of FT.

Also, could you please arrange to put in place an IT agreement on Cypress for 
delivery to Ormet Aluminum's Burnside,LA

Thanks for your help.

Craig
Craig Breslau
11/16/2000 04:37 PM
Scott:

Ormet's Burnside,LA Aluminum refinery is dually connected to Koch and Cypress.
The transport rates that  Koch has quoted for FT to Ormet are as follows:

From Bridgeline/Paradis or LRC/ Paradis .03 demand charge

from Venice     .05 demand charge

from the Mobile Bay pooling point on Koch .045 demand charge
(if we buy upstream of the pooling point then we would also pay a .0246 
gathering fee on Mobile Bay)

In addition we will be charged .0022 ACA from any of these receipt points.

The fuel rate is 1.6%.  This will be passed on to Ormet.

Koch has agreed that any volumes in excess of the 15/d of FT will be at the 
same discounted rate, but will flow on an IT basis.  If this IT is cut, we 
still must use best efforts to transport from other receipt points on Koch or 
on Cypress.  Ormet pays all additional transport costs.
Additionally, we have a price re-opener if Koch changes from monthly 
balancing at any point during the contract term.
I am working with Koch to get secondary delivery points on Koch in the event 
that the desk wants to take the gas elsewhere (i.e. if Ormet doesn't need the 
gas or if you choose to deliver off of Cypress).  If you have any preferences 
for alternate delivery points, please let me know.

As I mentioned, we  have already quoted NYMEX + .055 as the all-in delivered 
price to Ormet.

Ormet would like to come to agreement on this transaction today (his wife is 
due any day so he will be out of the office starting tomorrow).  They are one 
hour ahead of us so your comments are greatly appreciated.

Thank you for all of your help on this deal.

FYI.   (DTI is obviously what they are calling Dominion these days.)

We have learned the following from a talkative DTI rep:

DTI intends to  modify its existing 637 proposals.  Apparently, in light of 
customer opposition, DTI intends to withdraw its proposal to shorten the 
imbalance make-up period from 20 days to 72 hours and will instead develop a 
new rate schedule for electric generators, who it claims are the entities 
that drove DTI's need to shorten the make-up period in the first instance.

Here is the message I received from my technical folks. (below in red).
As you can see a lot of work is involved.  Let me know how much you would
plan to nominate at this point, etc.    And can they committ to a certain,
volume, etc.   Also,  have they talked to HPL about taking gas at this
point.

After visiting the site (M&R 71886/76886), I found the following work that
would need to be done before custody transfer measurement could be
performed :
 (The site has two 12" meter runs with valve switching (bidirectional flow)
and run switching - and has not flow gas in over 10 years)

1. All valves will need to be inspected & overhauled
     A. Run switching valve - major overhaul (needs to be sent off for this
work)
     B. Control valves - inspected & overhauled (needs to be sent off for
this work)
     C. Small regulators overhauled
2. Both meter tubes pulled and inspected
     A. Sr. fitting needs to be overhauled
     B. Tubes will need to be honed (needs to be sent off to have fitting
overhauled and tubes honed)
3. All transmitter need to be replaced
     A. Differential - 2
     B. Temperature - 2 (1 additional from original setup)
     C. Pressure - 4
     D. Direct mount manifolds - 2
     E. UPS system
4. RTU boards need to be furnished
     A. Mother board
     B. STI REM
     C. Main terminal board
     D. Serial IO LEM
     E. Analog Output board
5. New batteries ( 4 @ $ 160)
6. Two sets of orifice plates (In .50" increments through Beta range)

It would take at least 1.5 months to re-work the station controls and
associated valves, meter runs, and EGM.  If you need more information
please let me know.

For June 2000, please schedule the volumes on the FT contract .5618 to the 
FTR .6942 as follows:

FT   Z1 surplus 879 to FTR  Z3 shortage
FT   Z2 surplus 45,206 to FTR Z3 shortage
FT   Z3 surplus 2,333 to FTR Z3 shortage

Do you know anyone who would like or need detailed maps from the Final 
Environmental Impact Statement for Gulfstream?  I typically don't keep 
environmental information for projects because it takes up so much room and 
nobody ever asks for it.  However, this does have facility location maps of 
the project and various alternatives.  The full system is broken down into 
121 topographic maps, so it's very detailed.  This may not be the final 
routing, but it will be pretty close.

First come, first served.  I only have one volume.

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

I heard the good news!!!! I am so excited for you.  Merry Christmas and keep in touch.
Judy

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Mark your calendar-- 
	the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is moving to a new administrator!

In preparation, here are a few things you need to remember.

For All Savings Plan participants, Friday, October 19 at 3:00pm CST will be the last day to:
?	Request a loan or a loan payoff so that funds can be allocated or distributed in time.
?	Request a withdrawal (In-service or Hardship).

For SDA Participants, Friday, October 19 at 3:00pm CST will be your last day to:
?	Make trades in your Schwab SDA brokerage account so that we can move your holdings in-kind. 
?	Re-invest any Schwab mutual funds into your choice of funds  - the default will be your money market fund.

Other transactions, such as Contribution Rate Changes and Investment Fund Transfers, will continue until 3:00pm CST on October 26.  

EnronBenefits... keeping pace with your lifestyle.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Brad, further to our conversation of yesterday morning, please find attached 
Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent 
assignment of PGT capacity. 

The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we 
will begin working on this immediately.

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms 
as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). 
ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the 
Spark Spread proposal.
Contact name @ Trans Canada and ANG is Kay Coad Ph: 403-267-2480.  
  
I trust the information as provided above is consistent with our previous 
discussions.  Please contact me once you have had a chance to review. 

Regards,

BT

Did you hear anything from the Appraisal Co? 

Insurance:  The contact for my insurance is Stacey Spears @ Farmers Ins.  
713-592-8800.  If you can hold off contacting him until tommorrow I will then 
decide if i am using them for sure.  

Thanks. BT 

thank you.  BT 

Stephanie, I  believe that I will have a spot on 32 for right now so assume I 
am ok.  Where are you moving to on the 8th. 

BT 

I have the putter at home.. I will throw in my trunk tommorrow... and we can 
meet at lunch if you would like. I will not leave town without getting this 
to you somehow. 

TIC 

Mark, Stephanie further to our conversations please find a summary list which 
I will need some help on.  As part of our business plan for 2001 Phillip and 
myself will make a presentation to Delainey et al regarding the West 
Initiatives.  This is going to happen by Dec. 8.  

As you guys know our group in total is going to be made up of a few key areas.

Producer Services 
Transportation
Origination/ Middle Marketing
Trading

Can you put together in draft form a business plan for next year that 
outlines some key items. Once we have a first pass at this, we can 
incorporate into the overall package and decide how this fits in with our new 
group. 
 
The key subject items should include:  

SM/MW/BT 1> Market Overview - supply demand fundamentals in your area. 
SM/MW/BT 2> Strategies and opportunities for 2001 ( What new initiatives will 
we implement ?)
SM/MW/BT 3> New products and structures for your area
SM/MW/BT 4> Issues in 2000 ( what didn't work ?)
BT  5> Organization Issues / people /transition etc. 

If you could start thinking about these in greater detail, we can then go 
through and incorporate into the west orig. objectives. 

Call me to discuss, but we should start to discuss detail early next week.  

BT 

Thanks,  BT 

You are correct that the PRC is in Houston.... Is there a flight later than 
that.?  

Sorry I could not pick you up.... Any format that works for you... This will 
end up in a power point slide presentation so I have been told. 

thanks, BT 

I am almost out of days, but on Dec. 8 ( friday) they are throwing a small 
party ??? for me at the Garage from 3-6 pm that I would love for you guys to 
come to...I hope that would work for you. 

TIC 

We will have to use that one as a back up plan.... 

	
	

How does this work?

Julie  :-)

For your information. please find attached the spreadsheet that I sent to 
Calpine for their consideration. 

Action: 

Peter is going to review the assignment doc's and with Steve raise the proper 
legal document that protects ECC/ENA's interests.  At this time, Peter and I 
are of the opinion that a new agreement may be all we need but we will 
discuss on Monday.

Julie/ Stephanie/Eric....we need to discuss the numbers again. The real 
producer unwind costs may be really ugly, which basically means that our 
numbers may be too low to Calpine.. even with the counter offer, the front 
end economics are pulling a lot of value out of the deal. 

Assuming numbers can be agreed too by everyone, we are positioning ourselves 
for a package out to the producers for early next week. 

Stephanie.. one of our customers has asked for California fundamentals... 
overview... do we have anything available.  

Talk to everyone on Monday.  

BT 

Fran... I have received the L1 visa package and will use documents to Enter 
the US on Friday morning. 

I have also received the bridge loan documents and have signed these forms 
and sent them back to as of right now via inter office mail..... you should 
have by tommorrow ( Weds).  Can you please sign as required.

I think that is about it other than I need to make arrangements for a cheque 
to be in my hands for friday morning.  At this time, I still do not know 
where to have this sent.  

Thanks. BT 

Fran and Tricia... this note is to confirm that I will be an employee of ENA 
effective Dec. 1/ 00.  Fran, are you looking after payroll issues or is it 
going to be Jeannie Sloan

Thanks. BT

Fran.... Kerri Rigsby from Associates will be contacting you regarding the 
Bridge Loan.  She needs a letter on file verifying that I will have these 
funds. 

We still need to decide where we are going to put this money. For right now, 
we should plan on me signing the promisary note by fax, and then have a 
cheque sent up to me in Canada so that I can consolidate with the rest of the 
funds required for closing. 

Thanks. BT 

Did I send this to you already ?

Brad, further to our conversation of yesterday morning, please find attached 
Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent 
assignment of PGT capacity. 

The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we 
will begin working on this immediately.

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms 
as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). 
ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the 
Spark Spread proposal.
Contact name @ Trans Canada and ANG is Kay Coad Ph: 403-267-2480.  
  
I trust the information as provided above is consistent with our previous 
discussions.  Please contact me once you have had a chance to review. 

Regards,

BT

Can you print out these resumes for me.

Barry,

As promised, here are some of the current redeployment candidates that have a marketing/structuring/trading background for consideration concerning your West Origination opening.  I believe that you have seen Jim Lowe before and expressed some limited interest in him.  The other candidates are most likely new to you.

Let me know if you would like to pursue any of these redeployed employees.

     

Also, I spoke with Mark McConnell today, and he mentioned that he had accepted the offer to join the Transwestern group of ETS.  He primary motivation for selection of this option was his desire to work with asset deals.  As we know, given EWS "asset light" approach to deal making, this option would be difficult to fulfill within the West Origination group.  However, he mentioned that he was very impressed with your group, and short of the asset piece maintained a high interest in your open position.

Regards,
Todd Peikert

Don't we need to have our meeting first?. . The four of us should still meet asap and agree on paper with PG&E and present this to them. 

BT 

They never made it up here Tuesday.  I spoke to Ray Tuesday and we said we would reschedule after a few days.  I'll call today and maybe we'll set up a video conference.

Did you guys get together to discuss paper status etc... 

BT 

Interesting.... and probably true... I was watching the news last night and it is unbelievable how much scrutiny all of these assets are going to get in the next little while,  the reality is that everything could be a terrorist target... Nukes, water, tall buildings, stadiums,electrical generation assets, fuel depo's, crop dusters...
 
Pls keep us posted.. the implication here is that expansion projects like TransWestern could receive pressure on their ability to expand as the generation equation gets stirred up.
 
  

I was just talking to counsel in Phoenix who informed me that a number of planned merchant generators in Arizona were in danger of being killed by the Arizona Corporation Commission.  There are apparently concerns with interconnecting these plants where existing plants already are located, and reliability and terrorist-threat possibilities that they raise.  I don't know if this matters to you but in case it does, just wanted you to know. 

Sonya, can you please contact Frank Vickers ( VP East Orig). He was looking at my screen and was interested in getting it. 

Also, can you provide for him a report on what systems his group currently has and whether or not there is an opportunity to reduce some of his costs by using the system that you set me up with.

No need to reply, pls contact Frank. 

BT 

ozzie.... ??? he doesn't golf... remind dave of that... that's just like throwing money away for ozzie.... ( you can tell oz I said that).

BT 

No problem, I know you're busy.....Great !!!!! So far it's you, Dave and Oxley.   Waiting to hear from Colwell/Pagan.

Kay

Sorry I couldn't pick you up on the call... I would love to play. 

BT 

Hi Barry,

Dave wanted me to invite you to play golf with him on Sunday, September 30th 7:40 am.  I have also invited Wes Colwell and David Oxley.

Thanks,

Kay

I saw it come through... good deal. Keep up the good work.

Penny,

Pursuant to our phone conversation yesterday, I am forwarding you the terms under which we assign BP Amoco capacity on El Paso Natural Gas pipeline.  Please review the terms and call me with any questions.  The next step will be to discuss volumes and mark to market value.

Thank you,

Jessica, are we scheduled to have our video conference today..Is the room available.

BT 

Jacy called me the other day and said you guys met... He is a really good guy.. they have three young kids... 

For right now, the best thing that we can do is try to find a nasdaq related fund and possibly by half of that and the balance in some sort of term bond fund. I have not set you the documents back as of yet. 

BT 

     Hey Barry, how's things going down there. Must be a bit crazy for you 
     Americans about now. By the way, I met your bud Jaycee at a meeting a 
     couple of weeks ago. Seems like a nice guy. I never had a chance to 
     visit with him much, we didn't stick around after the meeting. Maybe 
     next time.
     Was just following up on that stuff I sent. You may have some concerns 
     about now on the suggested funds. Email me if you do.
     
     Rob

I condensed the two charts into one on the "Santa Clara Load/Supply Profile" page.  Is it too busy?

Also, I have included two pages (10&11) on the forward value of the EPNG capacity.  Which do you like better?  Regardless of which one we use, we do need to talk about the appropriate SJ/Perm split and physical premiums (if any).

I'll call in the morning.

 

Tyrell

Eva, I was talking to Jean the other day and she has advised me that you will be working in the Producer One group.  I would like to talk to you about some of the things you worked on this year as they relate to storage development etc... 

Can you contact me early next week to get together for 1/2 hour.

Thanks in advance.

I thought you guys might like this one.....  I am trying hard to defend ourselves... but they might be right..

Mark, do you have any customers that we could invite as a guest to this event. I would be more than happy to host.

I have tickets for the Sunday race.... Oct.7.

Let's discuss on Monday. BT 

Paul, can you please advise as to who you are directing these packages to and the status of their interest. 

BT 

Gerry, I talked to both storey and Lucci late friday... here is the latest.  You had indicated your customer wanted a monthly related price... is that off of Ventura or Harper or both.   

Paul Lucci ( Denver office) will contact you today or Tues., to generate a bid for the Ventura and Harper gas. I talked to storey on Friday and he will work up a firm bid for your customers.   He thinks pricing will be near a Ventura Monthly Index + $ .04. ( that's with no orig to Canada).  That is also with no ancillary deals behind this structure and that is what Lucci is trying to pull together. Paul, can you please investigate nom procedures, potential dry run structure ( Oct. 01) and verify what the structure looks like as the upstream diversions take place.( incl. default positions ).    

At a minimum let's buy the gas and sell it base load to storey.... then ENA - Denver will try to back fill some gas into the deal on a Interruptible basis.

Call if you guys want to discuss. 

regard,  BT 

 

Todd, I have gone through all of these resumes and will not pursue a next step at this time.

The latest candidate that appears to be on the most interest to me is Robert Ayres and I will have my secretary set up a meeting with him this week. 

Thanks, BT

 Any news this fine monday morning...

BT 

Louise, please review and if you require more verbage I can add a lot more than this... I believe this captures the basic scope but if you think otherwise, let me know.

BT 

 

thanks. BT 

Barry,

Here is a list and the status of the customers I'm dealing with concerning the El Paso Transportation;

Texaco-I have sent the presentation to my rep (Mike Duval) he is trying to arrange a telephone conversation with the appropriate parties within Texaco
Devon-I have sent the presentation to Devon and have had discussions on the subject.  They seem to be somewhat interested but will be slow to move.  They have committed all their San Juan production until April 2002.
Amoco- Talked to my rep who referred me on to the San Juan trader, these two are not very interested, however Dave Fuller has a contact at Amoco who seems to like the theory.
Reliant-I have had multiple conversations with these guys they are not very interested in this capacity.

I will continue to work with Dave on Amoco, as well as Devon and Texaco.  As new information develops I will pass it on.

Paul

 

Paul, can you please advise as to who you are directing these packages to and the status of their interest. 

BT 

For the most part the term of the back to back was 23 years.....with step up volumes.

BT 

Just a quick question  - 23 years for PGT?

Louise, please review and if you require more verbage I can add a lot more than this... I believe this captures the basic scope but if you think otherwise, let me know.

I just received a letter on some options being granted ( a total of 1400)... at $ 35.00 strike. 

What is this for? 

Are you going to this event this weekend.

BT 

The letter had your name on it.

and yes I have a cool rep.

BT 

because you have a cool hr rep.

Actually, I believe compensation did not properly grant your options at year end and this  grant is to make up for that error.  VPs are handled by executive comp so I don't review or send out that info.  Let me know if you need more info and I'll give you a direct contact.

I just received a letter on some options being granted ( a total of 1400)... at $ 35.00 strike.

I have not ever been to a race... always wanted to go.... I think we have invited a couple of customers.Should be fun.!!!

BT 

Have not thought about it.  Sounds like you may be going,........ you gearhead.  Have you been to one of these things ?

Frank

Are you going to this event this weekend.

BT 

Jessica, pls contact Robert Ayres @ 713-661-4551 and schedule him for a 1 hour meeting here at the office. 

His e-mail is rayres99@hotmail.com.

Sometime in the afternoon is preferred on tues or weds of this week.

Did you expense for my car rental.... on my last expense report.. it was for the one way rental from Denver to Houston. I found a reciept in my desk... and wasn't sure if it was a duplicate or not.

BT 

Eric, did Suncor every get any drilling completed in the Rockies...? 

Yes, I will ask someone from Denver office to create package... Gas Management, Market Intelligence.. gas flows.. etc.

BT 

Timely note, and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here.
They are getting ready to drill CBM this fall. I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.
Can I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.
Timing is next few days.  I'd like to get this to them by sometime Friday if possible (not the end of the world if it's early next week). 
Thanks.

Eric, did Suncor every get any drilling completed in the Rockies...? 

Yes I am available... pls include me once time is booked. 

BT 

As we are all aware ENA structuring is applying a Cost of Funds to all transactions that have a '"cost of funds" implication.  The issue that has surfaced is that the COF is only applicable to originated transactions and not to deals done at the desk level.  This has primary concerns for the mid-market effort.  Due to the noise that was occurring around this topic Joe Deffner suggested that we all get together with him to discuss.  He is available 10/3/01 before 11:00.  Are you interested and available at 9:30 am (today) to participate ?

Frank

Mara, pls put together a summary report of the planned generation sites along Kern Pipeline and the proposed start dates. I need it for a discussion with Sierra Pacific today.

BT 

please roll, my Q3 origination structure for JM Huber from Q3 to q4. $ 500,000 k.  I have nothing else to add at this time.

BT 

 We will be updating and making format changes to the 4Q 01 and 1Q 02 Hotlist tomorrow. Would you please forward to me any additions/deletions/changes you would like to make.  What we currently have listed are as follows (all are 4Q 01):
  
   Michigan Gas Utilities  -  $5 MM (already proposed to be changed to $2 MM)
   Peoples Energy  -  $2 MM
   PSEG  - $2 MM
   Philadelphia Gas Works -  $1MM
   Texas General Land Office -  $500k
   Southern Company  -   value TBD

  Any questions or comments, give me a call x37665

pls print off.

Barry,  Attached are the drafts we discussed yesterday.  Please give me a call to discuss.

  

Kim, Russel Diamond is going to provide to you a complete overview of deals, power and gas, and MTM positions, plus contractual status. You should get a copy of the master documents. ( this will include credit covenants).

Also, can I have a summary of LADWP, how they operate, how they are paid.... Russel will have this to you by tommorow. Pls have the consolidated package for me prior to my departure at 1:30 to Las Vegas.

BT 

Mark, I have not read these documents but Gerald and I did discuss scope... let's start to go through this with actual details.

BT 

Barry,  Attached are the drafts we discussed yesterday.  Please give me a call to discuss.

  

I sent this document back by fax.  BT 

Barry, please excuse me if you have already received this message.  Our
email system was disrupted with a virus last week and it seems as if many
people did not receive the emails I sent on Wednesday.

Yes that does sound a lot like your structure....I fill address from here... BT 

One of the guys here recieved a call from a guy at EES looking for contacts at gas utilities in the Northwest.  They are hoping to sell them some sort of deal where they provide the utility structured products and the utility pushes them through to the endusers... isn't that my Cascade deal?  Let's discuss Monday, it sounds like something we need to nip in the bud.

call me when you get in please. I have a couple of questions on this. 

BT 

Please find the attached LOI.  See if it meets with your understanding of the deal.  The document is non-binding but will serve as a framework for the actual agreements.  I will send you draft versions of the other documents on Monday.

Have a great weekend!

Louise, my marketer out of the Portland office had word that a EES marketer ( George Dickinson ) was looking to contact a Utility in the Northwest.... the reason that EES was looking to do this was to work with the utility on gas structures that perhaps the utility could market to some of their customers and EES would help them create or structure ..

This marketing effort is at the core of what ENA - Wholesale Gas is trying to promote and any third part mix into this effort does not help. 

Regardless as to where we are at in our marketing efforts and success to date in these efforts.... Utility business is a ENA customer and I consider them a primary wholesale customer.

I have not discussed this is anyone at EES but in my discussions with my peers was led to believe that this issues was tabled with you already and my comments would support your conversations with EES on our behalf.

Pls advise if you need to discuss or require anything from me.

regards,

Patrick, sorry for the short notice to try to catch up with you in L.A. this week.  As mentioned, I am responsible for the Gas Marketing efforts in the West. For a variety of reasons we have been slow in contacting you but I know that from a Trading perspective you have a strong relationship with our staff and were probably getting covered on most items you were needing. 

My groups interests are around transportation, risk management, Strategic Assets, storage etc... .items that we believe are more of a term fit that real time position management issue.  

We spend a lot of time on fundamentals, research, hedging strategies, load forecasting etc.

You had mentioned being in town in early November and if your schedule allows I would welcome the chance to get together.

Please contact me as you know your calendar and in the interim.... if I end up in the city prior to the end of the month, I may try to contact you then.

Thanks in advance.

As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Regards,
Ken Lay

I have talked to Sierra Pacific and they have some storage... I will advise.

I think fuller was doing some leg work also.

Do you think there are any displacement issues that they may be forced to adhere to that would no allow them to shift flows?

Also, are you able to replicate the delivery point off of JP to make this happen? 

BT 

Tych,

Just wondering if you guys have talked to any storage guys in the PNW about storage deals for this Nov to next summer ect. The market is essentially saying that JP storage is worthless for this winter (Nov-Dec) and I don't think that should be the case. I think there is free money on the table for someone like Puget or Avista to roll their scheduled storage withdrawls to next summer. Let me know if you have any thoughts.

Chris

I should no longer be on this circulation. Can you please have me removed.

Dave, the fundy's report is saying that both Kaiser plants are closed, the one in Mead and the other is in Tacoma... are they not buying gas from us on a monthly basis and if so, is this for process? 

BT  

That may be a better date for me anyways... pls put me down. 

BT 

Due to the temporary closing of The Whispering Pines course for a tourney, the outing will have to be rescheduled from Saturday, Oct 20 to Saturday, Oct 27 @ 10 AM.  Please RSVP (once again!) to me.

Kim, I will attend. Jessica, pls add to my calender. BT 

Mastio and Company is a firm that specializes in Quality Surveys and Customer Satisfaction Surveys.  They have been compared to the JD Powers of the energy industry.  The surveys are very focused on those things that you would want to know about your customer's buying/selling practices including Electronic Trading Systems and how industry providers rank out.  I am not sure if this is a tool that we want to purchase but it is something that we should review.  To that end, a representative form Mastio will be in to provide a demonstration of the system at 10:30 Tuesday October 16.  Please notify Kim Bates if you are interested in attending.

Frank

Kim, please monitor this.  I need to let Mastio know if we want to do this by tomorrow (please remind me).  Would like to get 32c2 if possible.

Jeff, I was talking to Mike Etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the CFO Ted Craver. I understand that you guys were dealing with John Fielder.  
 
For sure we want to know what they are up to.  I think like all deals in California we are going to run into issues with credit, and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty. ( is it edison), or DWR? 
 
It is VERY important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan. 
 
Do you know the CFO ? 
 
regards, BT 

FYI.  Edison's filing for approval to hedge power up to $250MM.  If you'd like to get in front of Edison's CFO on this. Let me know.
 
Best,
Jeff

John, If possible I would like to talk to you regarding two deals this morning.

1.  JM Huber - hedging deal / prudency issues required to protect some risks in 2002.
2. El Paso Transport assignment discussions and plan.

I can be there any time.... need 10 minutes. 

BT 

As you guys know the 2003 PGT expansion plans are supposed to be 230,000/day. The landscape of the shippers list is ever changing... Rumors of PPL pulling out 85,000/day to Malin and Stanfield is unconfirmed ( we are trying to validate)... and potentially Avista pulling out as they have been downgraded... they hold 35,000/day in 2003. Combined this is almost half of the planned expansion. 

Although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately I believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together. As you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211,000 / day is made up 2 shippers Calpine 35,000/day and Newport Gen 175,000/day and this expansion has it's own issues.  

As we know more about shippers moving around I will pass on... pls do same.

BT 

Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

BT 

 

pls copy

I made a few small changes

  

Eric, pls ensure that this meeting comes with a defined plan from legal for discussions related to capacity release ( purchase or sale ) at full tolls, discount or premium. In addition to this and most importantly what is ENA's legal position on the disclosure of commercial terms that accompany and structured transportation agreement. I.E. if we buy gas at a market based rate and assign capacity to the customer ( at full tolls ) are we going to be required to post the commercial terms to the street.

BT 

Perhaps Gerald could attend also. 

BT 

Mark,  Attached are the latest.  I smoothed out some of your changes and added a section in the TA to address assignment of the gathering agreement.  Please review.

  

Assuming that our bid's stay in the range discussed previously, what are we going to do? 

I am not going to hard trade the buyers at this point until we know for sure Suncor is there.. 

So, can you pls advise. 

I would suggest we get Suncor to give you a "Stand Still" for the rest of this week which includes a firm number ( or better ) that they will sell capacity for. By the way, this number needs to be close to zero as there is not much left over.

Current economics.... approx $400,000 Bid on the table, plus ENA holds option Apr 02 - oct 02 to put capacity to buyer.  Under this structre Suncor keeps capacity until Apr. 02. There are no liquids conversations being conducted at this time and pending structure may not be.

None of the financial markets support premium payments ( for any term ). 

Give me a call. 

BT 

Yes, I had also heard that Calpine/NPG have passed on the early start date...I think PGT will show this to the market.... no change regarding the 02 issues as of yet. 

BT 

We heard today that both Calpine and Newport have passed on the volume made available by PGT for Nov 01 (40,000/d).....  Any news as to what they are thinking for Nov 02?????
As you guys know the 2003 PGT expansion plans are supposed to be 230,000/day. The landscape of the shippers list is ever changing... Rumors of PPL pulling out 85,000/day to Malin and Stanfield is unconfirmed ( we are trying to validate)... and potentially Avista pulling out as they have been downgraded... they hold 35,000/day in 2003.

As we know more about shippers moving around I will pass on... pls do same.

Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the Capacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would still make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement.

   

Latest doc's.  pls review and comment on wording applicable to regulatory indicator that triggers events.

Ty and Phil, can you please advise as to the status and provide me copies of all documents related to payment # 1 and # 2 regarding the kern shippers. 

What I really want to do is tie out paper work, signatures and ensure that we are tight on all fronts. Pls advise ( by co. name ) the status of all pending documents and a plan to get signatures as required. 

BT 

Thanks, I have taken a quick look at this and will think about other applications.  I will follow up soon.

Barry,

Attached is the East Region Industrials spreadsheet I've worked up.  Please let me know if can help you with anything for the West.

Thanks,

absolutely. 

Casually let Kim know that Phillip Allen no longer is in charge of the west.  No big deal, I just heard her tell the SMUD guys that Phillip runs the desk, etc.

Grigs

Jessica, it appears that we pay a monthly fee of $ 89.99 / mth plus monthly optional charges and all long distance and local charges.  I would like to discuss the details of a bill. What is this base fee, are there other plans available? Are we getting any value in using cingular ( especially this plan). How many minutes are we getting what are the  long distance and roaming rates? 

In aggregate, my monthly cell phone bill for my group looks to be around $1,400 - $ 2,000/mth for 7 people total and this is a little high. 

Also, pls verify who has cell phones in Denver and what the monthly bills look like for this office.

Thanks, BT 

Pls coordinate a vacation schedule planner for me for all of the staff from now until the end of the year ( including Jan ).  Pls include Denver

BT. 

Attached are redlines of the latest.

  

Can I get all this printed out please.

pls advise group that we will be meeting today and advise the video staff to ensure it is up and running. 

BT 

It has been reserved for every other Monday on a go forward basis?.so yes it is available today.

Jessica

Jessica, are we scheduled to have our video conference today..Is the room available.

BT 

I just sat down this a.m. and have been either in a meeting or working on a deal.  I should be able to get back to you in the next hour or so.

BT 

Attached are the latest documents.  The Transaction Agreement was split into two separate agreements.  

  
  

Ted, it's that time of year... I would like to meet with a few good a/a's to try and place in my group for year end. Any comments on the process or path I should take on getting this done.

BT 

you know, can't trust those lawyers..... BT 

Its good to see Ray gets the same treatment from his own lawyer.

Spoke to Ray Welch.
They were supposed to meet with their lawyer yesterday - the lawyer never showed up.
They'll try to get their comments together in the next few days.
He mentioned that they were meeting internally on your transport swap structure Barry.

Lorelie, attached is a Price Distribution table that is set up as a template for SPPC Power load as it relates to market prices  and load.  As you can see, this distribution protects your rate base against a rising price environment and partially floats with market prices as they move down.  The distribution ( fixed price vs floating ) may move up a percent or two in relation to the outright price desk that we face today ( relative to the historical numbers) but those iterations can be made as required.

Pls review and we can discuss at your convenience.

Also, as discussed, I am looking for ways to enhance our ability to transact with you on gas structures but in light of the overall credit positions that may be difficult.  With that being said however, I do believe that we can stream some structures to the physical contracts in gas and ensure that from the physical point of view ENA and SPPC are both protected and I would like to pursue this with you. One area that I would like to start with to have SPPC sell ENA physical gas ( 30,000/40,000/day) against a physical gas daily related price.  Once I have accumulated a payables position, we inherently create a secured line without having to change any of the contracts/paper currently in place.  I am also sure this will require further discussions and look forward to catching up with you soonest.

regards, 

Barry Tycholiz 

 

Louise, further to our conversation of yesterday... here is a list ( in order of priority) that I have reviewed with the Denver office.  In all cases, if Fred's group is able to make a case that the CFO truly is the financial contact, then we are prepared to leave as is.... otherwise as per Mark's note, I would like to clarify the marketing role regarding all Rockies and San Juan producers ( both physical and paper ) and transfer the primary responsibilities back to the Denver office as we had always planned.

Pls review and advise if you need anything further. 

BT 

 

The following customers are currently covered by Fred Lagrasta's middle market desk primarily for derivative transactions.  In all cases except for Hallwood, ENA Denver has a relationship with these customers that primarily covers their physical business, we would like to expand that business to cover their Derivative business as well.  The list is based on priority.  We would be willing to cover them for their West Gas business only.  Fred could continue to cover their East, Central and Oil/Liquids business. 

Xcel Energy (PSCo) and affiliate e Prime.
Devon Energy
Cross Timbers
Hallwood Energy
Forest Oil
Prima
Patina Oil and Gas
Westport 

please keep me posted on progress.... and if there is any way that I can help... photo sessions and baby kissing are my Forte !!!! 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their "angle" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this "retail" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

303-575-6473

Please include in this annoucement that the West continues to be managed by me and Mike Grigsby.

Thanks, BT 

Barry, the re-org announcement is being drafted to indicate that the West and Texas are not affected.  In that announcement is it you and Mike or you and Phillip or you, Mike and Phillip that are leading the West ?

Frank

What is the latest actuals that I have for month to date.  West Gas orig and West Gas Denver orig.

BT 

Faith, pls advise as to soft targets budget vs actuals year to date for West Gas Origination.

BT 

Jaime, further to our conversations earlier. I look forward to our proposed meeting and will coordinate efforts with Stephanie Miller to prepare for ENA's discussion items.  I have decided for at least the next week or so to defer my travel plans ( I am not the best flyer at the best of times ).. As such, we should work towards the end of the month as a timeline for us to come down. 

We can nail down specific dates soonest.

Talk to you today I hope.

Please circulate to west gas Orig group.

Thanks. BT 

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

Where were you flying to?  

I turned 39 yesterday... that sucks....

Kim has worked one 8 hour shift in a year... not exactly pounding the hours and the way the stock is going she might need to put together a few more shifts than that.

How much longer for school for you? ... I know you will do fine!!

All in all things are going pretty good, work is OK, pretty busy myself.  

What have you guys been up to? Traveling sure sucks now...  How is Bryn?  

Are there anymore Canadian E&P Co.'s left... it seems like they have all been bought up by U.S. Kids?.. how is the House? 

I noticed Anandarko... wrote down $ 464 MM because of their Canadian assets... could that be the Berkley indigestion? 

I better run.. come and visit me soon.. but let's talk sooner.

best regards,

BT 

Barry,

Was flying through your fair city last night and thought I should say hi...
Its been a long time.

I hear that Kim's working now... Anything else new?

BT - Yes, we are selling them gas monthly, they still operate a Rolling Mill which requires some gas to function.  I have been talking to them about their plans to reopen pot lines but they tell me the price of aluminum does not justify reopening at this time.  DF

Dave, the fundy's report is saying that both Kaiser plants are closed, the one in Mead and the other is in Tacoma... are they not buying gas from us on a monthly basis and if so, is this for process? 

BT  

Are you still in Houston today? ( Tues AM) .. if so, let's grab a minute to talk about Puget... If not, pls call me when you have a moment. 

Thanks, BT 

I was going to add a footnote to this note but thought I didn't need to as I know for a fact ( by individual ) that we do not have any issues in West Gas Orig.  This note was for your information only to reflect the increased level of expectations that Mike holds his trading organization to and I support this completely.

Your work hours are not in question... nor are those of Denver, and Houston based origination. However I will reiterate that we need to get back to basics and stay focused and I will promote that message given every opportunity. 

BT 

I plan to continue my normal schedule of working 6am to 4pm which coincides with noramal Houston hours, covers spot gas trading, covers spot power trading and overlaps with most of my customers hours in the west.  When necessary I will come in early or stay late.  Please let me know if there are any issues there. 
Please circulate to west gas Orig group.

Thanks. BT 

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

pls print out each report please.

BT 

Barry, attached are the soft targets and the origination detail for West Gas.  Please let me know if you have any questions or revisions.

     

Hi Carol,
Can you send this to Barry?

Faith, pls advise as to soft targets budget vs actuals year to date for West Gas Origination.

BT 

just give me a call and we can set up a time. 

BT 

Barry,

I will have September actuals ready on Wednesday.  Let me know if you want to meet then to discuss.

Also, Louise has reviewed the headcount plan submitted for 2002 and asked that we reduce the West Origination count by one.  The attached file shows what was initially submitted.  If you will let me know what position to eliminate, I will make the necessary adjustments.

 << File: West Total Orig Income Stmt.xls >> 

Thanks,
Laynie

As always, thanks... BT 

Hi Barry,

Mark, attached is a file regarding what the payment structures could look like. The plug is the total PV $'s that we will put towards the equation... other than that it is simply a demand charge calculation.

Pls coordinate and let me know. 

BT 

 

There is a cool screeen saver here that I want to save.

Mark, Good Morning.  

Any updates on Crestone structure ( re-price of deal), also, Paul discussed the Northern Border deal with potentially the producers underpinning... pls keep me posted on status.

BT 

Didn't you trade uranium at one time. 

BT 

That was pretty funny.... he is doing research on NW utilities, however that is not their mandate to market to them... so I say, then why are you doing research... he say's ... " I'm not... who said I was"... it was about that time I started to laugh... oh well.  

I'm glad I'm in the west - I know who to call about gas deals?you and ader!

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Can you find the gas daily article from Yesterday ( related to DWR purchse practices ) and e-mail or fax to jeff please.

Thanks, BT 

Could you forward the gas daily article?  Thanks.

Jeff

Jeff, Gas Daily has an article on DWR activities for purchasing gas.... do you know Pete Garris and is he the guy we want to get together with... or is Balwin's co. going to carry the ball. I remain unclear as to who actually is doing the gas buying..

Further to our conversation of last week... let's meet with these guys soonest. 

BT 

Don't forget to drop the software box back to me.. I need to install my printer.  	Also, the roadrunner e-mail address seems to have disappeared off of my mainframe.. do you now why and do I have to re-install or talk to roadrunner. 

Thanks, BT 

Louise, I presume that this note was for Thurs A.M. Is it still scheduled.

BT 

We recognize that we are experiencing a difficult time at Enron now and you are all interfacing with our customers every day.  We are therefore holding a  short meeting at 9:00am tomorrow morning to answer questions from you and your groups.  

Tammie to advise on the room.  Please invite all of your groups.

Louise

I need to get paid out for this years efforts first... if that isn't forthcoming.. then I can start tommorrow.  otherwise Q1/02. 

BT 

David, it's time we set up our own shop - You, me, and tic for starters. I'll be responsible for getting us a balance sheet. Any interest boys?

had to buy a little more at 16.50 today to get my weighted average down...
yikes.

cheers
A lonely buyer

Dave,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

Chris

Ozzie and I are going to the Front porch after work... 5:00 PM..  I thought I would invite you, I know we could all use a couple.  

I will buy. 

BT 

Jeff, Just looking at teeing my a schedule.. any feedback from either/ both. 

BT 

Make sure Fuller pays up..... I know he has some money hidden somewhere.... thanks. BT 

I am sure you already know this - you owe me for babysitting fees!

BT 

Barry,

We would like to set a time when Dave Kistler is back in town to discuss our list of companies that we would like to pursue along with your guidance.  Dave will be in town Nov 6th-7th, therefore, I would greatly appreciate you taking the time to meet with us for 30min-1hour. Please advise on your availability.

Thanks so much for you time last week and we look forward to working with you in the future. 

Jenn McClain

yes but can you spell...

Yeah, I know the buisness VERY well.

Didn't you trade uranium at one time. 

BT 

I am not waiting for the stock... just cash now.  Don't know if I will get enough of that either.  

I don't mind working for a few more years.. just don't want it to be 20 more.

I don't think I will be in Denver that early.... What's going on?

Calgary, Who knows????? 

Stock meltdown is a long story... perhaps a bit more rumor than fact but that doesn't matter much at this moment.. we are in preservation mode right now.... but I believe things will be fine. All in all we have had the best year ever, the street just hated the way we set up some of our off balance sheet vehicles because they created conflict of interest...time will tell who is correct.

Better run, let's talk soon.

BT 

I was in Mexico City... for school

What has happened to your stock price.... you will have to work for many
more years.  

What is the hedging loss about that I saw reported? 

When are you coming to cowtown and have time for a quick visit? 

Bryn and I are in Denver Nov 2-5.  Any chance you happen to be there then? A
 

Where were you flying to?  

I turned 39 yesterday... that sucks....

Kim has worked one 8 hour shift in a year... not exactly pounding the
hours and the way the stock is going she might need to put together a
few more shifts than that.

How much longer for school for you? ... I know you will do fine!!

All in all things are going pretty good, work is OK, pretty busy myself.

What have you guys been up to? Traveling sure sucks now...  How is Bryn?

Are there anymore Canadian E&P Co.'s left... it seems like they have all
been bought up by U.S. Kids?.. how is the House? 

I noticed Anandarko... wrote down $ 464 MM because of their Canadian
assets... could that be the Berkley indigestion? 

I better run.. come and visit me soon.. but let's talk sooner.

best regards,

BT 

Barry,

Was flying through your fair city last night and thought I should say
hi...
Its been a long time.

I hear that Kim's working now... Anything else new?

School's great... life pretty busy though

Is there an action item with regards to the preparation of agreements? 

If so, I would like Dave Fuller in Portland to work on the creation of the appropriate gas contracts and the discussions with Puget.  

Please advise. BT 
Barry,
Sorry for not getting back to you. The Power MTM positions are approx $570,000 and all related to physical positions with a total Net Power  position of approx $1.2MM. I have been working with Beverly Ikeda of Puget on the issues and so far so good. Puget is going to deliver a $10MM  Letter of Credit to cover the financial positions. From our conversations, her traders do not anticipate hedging any further and really only need access to short term EOL business. In addition, she and I discussed the needs of bilateral contracts with margining rights to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future. 

Thanks,
-D

Darren, did you check this already.... are there any power MTM positions with Puget Energy that would be in addition to the Gas MTM that you put on my desk. ( $ 50 MM)

Thanks. BT 

Mike, have the QF's been paid for the power they were selling to the utilities.  I have not heard much about that and was wondering if these payments were all part of the Bond issue.? Are the QF's generating power today? 

BT 

Lorelie, I had sent to you last week a amending doc regarding a one month extension that the customer was looking for in order to exercise the option on some of that small volume.  They have contacted us and I beleive they will be exercising and would like to get the paperwork back in order to get this process moving. 

Can you please have document signed and returned to me soonest.

Thanks, BT

Milly, Peter Keohane, Eric Ledain, Derek Davies,

Thanks. BT 

thanks mike. BT 

There may be a handful of small QFs which have not returned but I would say the a majority of the QFs are back on line and are being paid for what they generate on a go forward basis.  Right now the SCE QFs are negotiating with SCE on 2 major points:  when will they be paid for the outstanding receivables (est. at $1.3 B for SCE and about $1.0 B for PG&E)  and when will the 5 yr fixed price SRAC of 5.37 cents/kw apply for those that have selected this option.  Right now SCE appears to be indicating that they will be paying the receivable sometime around June/July of 2002 and that the 5.37 price would apply at that time or as much as 4 months after that.  The logic is that they are trying to indicate that the MOU, if it had been passed, would not have applied at least until that time.

M
Mike, have the QF's been paid for the power they were selling to the utilities.  I have not heard much about that and was wondering if these payments were all part of the Bond issue.? Are the QF's generating power today? 

BT 

what about a contract position.... 3 months or something. I was talking to Steve South.. I know steve would like to pick his brain for a while. 

BT 

I am never big on utility guys.  This guy seems to be very focused on Sumas compared to U.S. supplies.  I think he is a want to be trader who got out of hand at a utility.

Mark, I have reviewed resume and although Kevin may have very good trading credentials for this area I am of the opinion that he is a trader and am unclear as to his actual customer contact knowledge... I am sure he knows who they are, not sure if they know who he is other than short dated structures.

BT 

Here it is.

Chad,  hope trading is going well.  Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas
basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
model...

Thanks, Kevin

has there been a big run up in the pricing on this metal. 

BT 

Yeah, I know the buisness VERY well.

Didn't you trade uranium at one time. 

BT 

Mark, I have reviewed this file and believe it is accurate up to the end of Q3.. Can you please review for your guys and advise if there is any variance.. I am not worried about 10 or 20,000 either way because I don't think we will manage down to that level anyways. 

BT 

Barry,

Attached is a revised origination schedule for 3rd quarter and supporting detail.

Please provide any revisions by Wednesday, October 31.  I will consolidate the originations for all teams and submit to Louise.

Thank you for meeting with us this week. Speaking on behalf of Enron U.S. I know there was some very good clarification, information and hopefully action required by all the parties.

I look forward to working through some transportation/supply structures and will contact you next week to discuss.

I have also met with our legal team to discuss the commercial and legal issues related to the GISB ( under 30 day firm agreement ) and need to discuss the details with you to see if we can get the proper paper completed. I have also raised a draft Master Firm agreement ( to handle term structures) and will begin to review this for early next week also. 

Thanks in advance, 

Barry Tycholiz

Same.... 

Barry it looks reasonable to me.  I sure would like to add something sizable to the totals for Q4.

But I'm a pig that way!

Mark, I was talking to Jay on Friday and he was telling about Kerr McGee shutting down their operations. Is there any play here for you guys.? 

BT 

Let's try to get together today. 

BT 

Morris... if ENA were to sell options to a third party and receive the option premium up front... for example $ 10MM $'s.... would that be considered taxable income?

We would also be buying the option from another party or hedging this structure and this cash would be used to offset future liabilities related to the deal.

BT  

Mark, pls encourage everyone to talk to their customers today and let's let the street know we are as busy as always and that the overall issues are behind us. I have no new info regarding this matter but believe that the proper vehicles are in place to maintain liquidity.  

I am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues.  Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc. If any customers say this, then let me know.

Pls keep me posted. 

BT 

I am out of town tues, weds.. pls schedule for some time on thurs. 

BT 

Barry - I'm not in the office today (logging in from home) but will be in tomorrow.  I'm free all day so let me know what time is best for you.

Let's try to get together today. 

BT 

Eric, can you have someone fax to me a copy of the TCPL Cochrane shrink agreement and also the PC ( empress ) shrink agreement.  SPPC has asked me to help her figure out the deal she has and I need to refresh on paper issues. Don't know if there is a deal here or not? 

Thanks, BT 

I am track you down on more details or your ability to get them... stay tuned. Thanks, and please disregard spell check comments. 

evn I mak misstackes ounce and a wile!! 

BT - Pardon my spelling.... I like to think its more of a typing issue, however.  

Regarding uranium:

Prices for oxide (mined material) are up from a low of $7.10 last December to a new high this month of $9.20 (still low by historical standards).  Perhaps more important though, fuel cycle components (conversion & enrichment) are very strong.  Conversion at $5.00 up from $2.20, enrichment at $105.00 up from $80.00.  These fuel cycle components are required to turn ore into fuel. - DF

PS - Spell check shows no mispelling here.

has there been a big run up in the pricing on this metal. 

BT 

Yeah, I know the buisness VERY well.

Didn't you trade uranium at one time. 

BT 

Jeff, received your message for a Tues AM meeting in Sacramento... I can make that. Also, I will try to see SMUD while I am there and plan on seeing PG& E back in the city. Any word from SOCALED.  

Give me a call this a.m. and we can figure out travel plans.

BT 

Mark, let's discuss letter to BP prior to it going out this a.m.

BT 

Faizal,.... did you ever get a refresh of numbers from us for gas supply on the new IPP you were working on?

If you have time, give me a call and you can update me on things you are looking for.

regards,

BT

 713-853-1587

Can you get me a map / printout to get to this location and also to SMUD 6301 S Stree, Sacremento.

BT 

3310 El Camino (Sacramento).  Suite 120.

Jeff, I will arrive late evening tonight. I have a car and will talk to you enroute to Sacremento.  I am staying and meeting with SMUD at 11:30 - 1:00 and then probably meeting with PG&E on tues at 3:30.  I will either leave for Houston tues night or weds a.m. pending any possible meeting with SocalEd in L.A.  If we cannot meet with them this week, then I may reconsider that trip for next week. 

Thanks, BT 

Just sent you yahoo map/directions on how to get to DWR.

Jaime, thanks for setting up last weeks meetings... I thought the time together was well spent and there is some action items required on all parties.

We will follow up directly with Pemex on some contractual issues and potential transport deals.

Did you get anywhere with regards to your regulatory matters? 

Is there any specific action required by west gas at this time, if so, pls contact me to coordinate? 

regards,

BT 

We need to figure out how much short term and long term obligations Pemex believes they will have in the next 1 - 5,10 years.  The more obligation they have at the border, the better off we are..

What they used to deliver upstream of the border, we can replace for them synthetically. 

Pls update and let's discuss in next couple of days.  

BT 

Jessica, pls schedule Chris for Thurs. BT 

Good morning Barry:

I am attaching a copy of my updated resume.  I am looking forward to meeting with you to discuss any possible opportunities that you may have in your group.  I began the Analyst Program in July and have been working in Generation Investments under Carl Tricoli.  The experience has been tremendous thus far.  We discovered last week that our group is being restructured and I am forced to look for re-deployment.  Thank you for time and consideration.  

 

Chris Czuppon

Dave, I have discussed the schedule related to orig track and until further notice, we will suspend interviews and discussions.  Louise does expect that this program will continue but agrees that at this time, priorities lie elsewhere! 

Pls contact me if there are any questions, otherwise can you coordinate with Karen Buckley ( et al ).  Let's re-visit program in mid-december.

regards,

Barry Tycholiz 

Bill, as part of our conference call this a.m.... please have Debbie identify the top 20 companies that we have out of the money positions to and that we would want to assign in the money deals to. Included in this list we must know the contractual terms of these counter parties including, company name, collateral threshold limits, collateral posted, type of contract ( gas or power ...etc.) Physical or financial. Master Netting... 

In addition to this, we must determine if we can cross pollinate agreements... I.E... a gas agreement is used to offset a power position or vice versa.

Lot's of questions but to start, let's get your list of " Co's who are seeking collateral from us today" and fill in some of these blanks. 

Thanks, BT 

Jeff, I believe that your total loss payable equates to $55.00. John and I netted out  so you can pay me directly.

Thanks, BT

Barry,

How are you? Just want to say hi. It must be a very hectic week and
stressful. With the talents of people at Enron such as yourself being the
major asset of the company, the industry recognizes that fact. I am sure
that you will do well. In the mean time, hold tight, pray, and have faith. 

Keep in touch.

I know john is there but I was not contacted and at this time am planning to stay home .... If that changes I will drop you a line.

6th floor.....don't know agenda..s/b interesting....

Mark's address at home is mawhitt@aol.com

BT 

Jay, do we have copy's of all the executed documents... and if so, where are you going to put them. 
Also, did we change the counterparty names in the system and put in offsetting transactions with SOCAL etc.... and new positions with PG&E.  These need to go into the system. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THIS. 

BT

Barry, what did you do to the company!?  Listen, sorry to hear about the 
problems at ENRON.  What a strange turn of events.  It is pretty bizarre 
after 10 years of ENRON being the model for other companies on how to 
succeed in the energy industry. What's your take on why it happened?  We get 
a little bit of news down here but we're a little out of touch.

How are you taking it?  Are you pissed? Do you feel like you squeezed pretty 
much what you wanted out of the job? What's the next thing for Barry Tic?  
Well, like all of life's curve-balls there is always something sweet in the 
next pitch you get (jeez, how sappy is that!).  Anyway, hope you're taking 
it all with the good nature you always do.

Hey, maybe this will give you the chance to take a holiday in Ecuador 
(Christmas turkey at our house this year?).  Say hi to Kim for us, drop me a 
line as soon as you can (a better address to reach me is craigh@ph.com.ec).  
Sorry I haven't sent a note before this but you know we are always rooting 
for you.

Your pal, Craig.

Great Pictures of the kids.... 

 

Mara, it appears that the PGE Topack curve is pulling in the wrong file in the swap spread model.... pls fix.

Bt 

Leon, the account number in the original document is actually not incorrect. This was the account to which the funds were to have been deposited to. However, SCE deposited the funds to a different account.  As a result, I agree that we should amend the document to reflect that the account where these funds where they actually ere actually sent and this will conclude our busines. 

Your file did not come over correctly but if you could hand correct the original documents by changing the banking instructions and fax to me, i will provide proper signatures on amendment and we are done.

Mr. Tycholiz:

I represent SCE's Energy Supply and Marketing Department with respect to
the above-referenced subject.  It is my understanding that the account
number in Section 2 of the Transaction Agreement Regarding Collateral
("Agreement") is incorrect.  I propose that the parties correct the error
by lining out the incorrect number and inserting by hand the correct one.
I have drafted and attached a letter agreement reflecting that intention.
Please review and call me at your earliest opportunity so tht we may
discuss further.  Thank you.

          (See attached file: EnronLetterAgreement.doc)

I tried to call you last night around 6:00.  I was unable to leave a message on your home machine or cell.  Really nothing too pressing but Schonne is wanting to follow up with us on our plans.. I did talk to him and told him not to assume that our PGT capacity will go to NEWCO, because NEWCO does not really exist and may never... SO, I told him to review  the tariff and make a determination as to whether or not it is still ours to use, if it isn't, then we don't really need to talk.. it they determine it is still ours, then we need to think about what the estate should do with it, including the upstream parts.  
 
Call me this a.m. 
 
BT 

 

Jim, stephanie will be in this morning, cannot do lunch, and we will be back to you by 12:00 our time to confirm the 4:00 pm conference call.

We have set up a conference bridge for the call tomorrow at 4:00.  It is
301-280-5125, pin 25#.  

Do you have time to do lunch tomorrow?  Perhaps we could talk a little then,
or I could come over before the call and we could visit/strategize a bit
before the call.

stephanie, I know that Ed McMicheal has appointed someone from the estate to start to consolidate all of our transportation positions ( if any remain ) and also our obligaitons.  I will confirm his name and from here on in, you may be asked only to assist, not lead these discussions.  However, for the purposes of PGT ( at this time ), I would ask that you continue on your path of resolution. 
 
I will follow up with Canada this a.m. to ascertain what they have done with the NOVA and ANG portions. 
 
BT 

Greetings Steve:

We have had many inquiries regarding our transportation agreements, specifically PGT, Kern River and El Paso.  

Most pressing is PGT's request to market capacity on our behalf. Although I do not believe we need to have PGT perform this function, I do believe we could mitigate some demand charge exposure for "the estate".  

Are you available to meet with Barry and I first thing tomorrow morning? We need to have an answer for PGT's request. We need to know what the contractual rights are for 1) the pipeline when a shipper declares bankruptcy and 2) our ability to mitigate demand charge exposure by releasing capacity on a short term basis (month at a time?).

Better yet, can we unilaterally turn capacity back to any of these pipes or do we need to reach some type of court approved settlement?

Obviously, we have many questions. Please advise of your ability to meet ASAP.

Thanks,

Stephanie

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

I am still here and probably will be here until atleast the end of Feb.  I have had to lay off about 5 of 12 people which includes outright termination ot allocation to the estate( clean up, bucket brigade ).  I have been designated to go to the NEWCO which is the trading and marketing core asset business that will be sold lock stock and barrel to a Wall Street firm.  It is looking ok at this time and we will find out in the next couple of weeks what happens.  

We are still planning to be home for christmas and plan on seeing you guys... somehow. 

Talk to you soon. BT 

If you get this e-mail I take it you are still there? What's your status. 
I swear I saw you on nightline at the pink slip party.

Jacy

Lorelie, I know we did not get to finish our conversation. call me on Friday ( if you so desire or have time) . 

In thinking through this issue, I am not really sure that it matters how these deals are now being confirmed, nominated or paid. settled or netted against. I am not even sure that we can do anything to change them once we filed.  

There is a good chance I am not thinking about it properly and will be happy to discuss on friday.

Thanks, 

BT 

I assume this is for my info only, or do I need to do something with it.

As always, Thanks. BT 

High .....merry christmas.  Thanks for the note.  Sorry for the delay in replying.  My blackberry does not work in Canada believe it or not.  I was on the phone with tech help....and we discovered this...what a pain.

Hope the holidays have treated you well... I am planning on going to work on. Weds but from what I hear not much going on.  Still a few co's kicking tires....

Keep you posted as I hear.  Cheers, BT.....m

I will confirm meeting time. 

Thanks, BT 

Greetings:

1) I haven't forgot about Baldwin, but it seems that things have changed for him (and his company?).  His long-standing number know longer works and there's no forwarding number.  I'm trying to track him down.

2) What time's your weekly meeting on Thursday, and is there a call-in number?

Best,
Jeff

We should get together and put this package together...let's plan on spending some time today.

Yes, once I complete, I will send over.  BT

Who owns Williston Basin, the storage field, the utility.  

BT 

When you say ownership grid what are you reffering to?

Can you include in your summary, what the ownership grid looks like for WBI.. who are the players. etc.

John stopped by and we will schedulea meeting with him for friday afternoon.

BT 

I am sure I will be here... Let me take you out for lunch. 

BT 

Hey guys, I'm coming to Houston October 6th - 9th and I was hoping that we could do lunch or dinner or something.

Let me know if your going to be around and maybe we can hookup

Thanks

Liz Prior

Thanks for looking after this.  I am not as interested in who or how we spent the money, but more so on where our estimates were off.  The whole reason for setting up and getting approval is being accountable to the plan. 

Give me a call.... when you have a moment. 

BT 

We estimated 27,700 (including 3,000 for airfare for Enron people)
We spent 25, 096 (not including airfare or fishing or anything that was put on credit cards)

I will need to get an actual cost for the airfare and anything that was expensed to be able to give you a complete cost of the event.  I will contact Jessica to get this information from her.  I will then include it and send it back to you.

The bill has not been paid. As soon as I got it I put the list together for you.   I am sending it to accounts payable to get paid tomorrow.

I'll get everything to you as soon as I get it.

-Laura

Thanks for file.

Has this bill been paid as of yet?

What was our buget vs actual for each of these events. 

I would still like to reconcile all expenses... even though they were all not master billed..

BT

Let me know if you have any questions.
I did not have a cost for the fishing, it was put onto Mark Whitt's credit card.

BT 

Steph, what do you think about RFPing the PGT capacity if and when we get a standstill from Suncor...I was thinking we could send to SMUD, Morgan Stanley, Calpine, perhaps avista.  It might be a bit radical... but perhaps can drive out the highest value.

BT 

Jessica, as part of the process when updating or adding items to my calendar or stephanies, pls send a note to me advising who it is and what the planned agenda is.

thanks, bt 

Dave, We believe that Avista has been kicking tires on picking up some term PGT, Nova and ANG capacity... We may be selling it.  

Pls hunt down a contact who handles this and find out if they want to see our piece.  We will probably have 10,000 MMBtu/day. starting out of Nov 2002. 23 years. at expansion rates. 

Call stephanie or myself to discuss. 

BT 

I was in Denver when the attacks occured and then I drove from Denver to Houston ( 15 hours ) to get home... I was not in the office until thurs afternoon.  

BT 

Hey that sounds great!  Were you on holidays last week? or just really busy, I was suprised I didn't hear from you earlier.

Can't wait to see Houston...

I don't believe that the agreement you had sent to me for Cochrane is the latest version. I thought we executed a new agreement with tiered volumes... can you have someone re-check this and get back to me.

BT 

We have faxed these.  Hope they help.

Eric, can you have someone fax to me a copy of the TCPL Cochrane shrink agreement and also the PC ( empress ) shrink agreement.  SPPC has asked me to help her figure out the deal she has and I need to refresh on paper issues. Don't know if there is a deal here or not? 

Thanks, BT 

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

BT 

Mike, I have asked INA to check into the coordination of a tour for our group( trading and marketing) prior to the official move in.

I would like to restrict the attendees to the commercial staff, traders and marketers... and this will give everyone a chance to see the new digs.. and then I would also like to suggest that we all slide out to the local watering hole for a drink... it is long overdue.. 

Any suggestions on a date, perhaps 3:00 - 3:30 for a tour.. then out for a drink... what about next tues.... 

Pls advise. 

BT 

Meeting with PG&E went OK... they are unable to commit to a letter that I had sent them on swapping out some capacity, but still very much want to trade with us and would like trade access to EOL.  PROGRESS I guess.... 

Flights were good.. got home around 1:45 am houston time, so it was a long day... 

IF you think we can get the plant names they they are have the toll on.. .that would be great. 

BT 

It was good to see you.  No thanks needed.  I'm pretty sure that I can get you the info on the plants--it's in the contracts and I'm fairly certain that we have that analysis.  How'd the meeting with PG&E go?  You get back to Houston OK?

Best,
Jeff

BT 

Were you referring to my lunches..... ?  

BT 

Theresa,   I agree.   I will accept Aeco DI from Tenaska for gas not taken
on Sept16/01 @ NIT.
 
Cliff,   please arrange to invoice ENA for price difference (contract price
- Aeco DI - fuel to Harper )  for gas not taken - it's about a US$0.28
/mmbtu touch.    I recognize that some spill more than this at lunch time,
but we should proceed anyway.     
 
Thanks, mr  
 
 

On 9/15/01, Enron failed to take full volume at Harper on T1134F.  This
backed up to Aeco.  Tenaska is planning on purchasing this gas at Aeco daily
for 9/16/01.  The volume not taken is 1,917 dth at Harper.  This equates to
2,103 gj's @NIT.  I don't know why Enron did not pull all of the gas.
Please let me know if you do not agree with selling to Tenaska.  
If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks Theresa

All,

Here is a draft document for BP, please review and comment.

Dave

 << File: EPNG Capacity Proposal II.doc >> 

received your phone message, call me on thurs. 

BT 

Barry,

My name is Alisha Mahabir and I have been working on negotiating the MGI/ENA GISB.  I have been in contact with Lourdes Cervantes at MGI; her phone number is 525-232-5990.  There are still a few issues left to be resolved before we can proceed with the execution of this document.  Per Geral Nemec's request, I will outline these changes as they are addressed in Exhibit B to the GISB that was sent over by Lourdes.

Initially I want to note that some changes must be made to the front page of the GISB.  MGI has previously agreed to allow ENA to be the confirming party under Section 2.5.  Additionally, there have been a few problems with allowing payment to be made on the 30th day of the month.  It appears that MGI has been construing this provision broadly so as to make payment on the 2nd day of March after a short month in February.  Thus, we would like Section 7.2 to read "30th day or, for the Month of February, on the last day of the Month".  

As for Exhibit B, the changes are as follows:

#4 The words "or interruptible" should be deleted from this provision.  The interruptible language conflicts with the ability to do 30 day firm deals under this contract.

#11 This provision deals with when notices are deemed received.  The provision as written provides that notice by first class mail is deemed received 2 business days after mailing.  MGI would like to change this to allow for receipt to mean actual receipt.  Lourdes told me that she will check to see whether the change can be stricken or at least to extend 2 business days to 3 business days.

#12 (a) MGI has agreed to strike the term "letter" from the requirement that the Parent issue a guarantee should doubt arise as to Enron's ability to pay.  
      (b)  Originally the GISB provides that a contract can be terminated without prior notice should certain conditions be met.  MGI wants to change this to require the parties to provide 48 hours notice.  Lourdes told me that she would check to see whether this could be changed to 24 hours prior notice.

#16  The language designating ICC is acceptable, however any redundant language should be stricken.

If this memo is at all unclear, please feel free to call me.  My extension is 52722.  

Alisha Mahabir

that was today... I had heard they were sniffing around about optionality values?  

It is not in the agreement. just a question. 

We decide to leave out the $ value in order to focus them on the structure.  I do not see the conversation about option values on the pipe?

I thought we were going to show them a number to work with.... What is this conversation about option values on the pipe?

I am probably going to slip out on friday and catch 9 holes and then probably on sunday.. I a go, i will let you know so you can watch for me on TV.

See ya. BT 

I guess I can't make it as I sit here in windy/wet/cold weather. I just
checked the internet and Weir is tied for 2nd. Maybe if it returns in a
couple years I will be able to come down. I'll look for you this weekend.
Will you be the guy in cut off sweats and a muscle shirt (Dauphin golf
course dress code)?

Mark, thanks for seeing us this week. 

I am working internally to get our corporation over the top on the primary contractual and credit issues and believe I am making progress. I shall get back to you soonest.   

Can you please advise as to the payables policy of DWR. For example, if I were to sell you gas via Enron Online for the month of November, would DWR be paying that invoice on the 25th of the month following delivery? 

Is there any possibility that this could get paid on the 5th of the month following delivery( at least in the beginning).

Thanks in advance, 

Barry Tycholiz

WOW.... I am positive that your beautiful wife did not sign up for hauling three rug rats( plus 1 dad )  around the back streets of London.... what have you done???? 

I would love to talk market conditions with you but I think we are banned from doing any work for the next three months while this co. continues to fucks with my money.... HACKS !!! 

Although not bitter, for years I have heard the story about being paid fair value for a job well done.. and that my time was coming...( just around the corner).... !! little did I know that when I made that turn, some guy named Jerome.( take a minute to imagine) ...was standing there with a baseball bat looking to smack my head a few times just to make sure I knew I wasn't quite there yet.

HACKS !!! 

Kids are doing well... my boys turned 1 in September and running rampant
around our house... the rest of the family including myself are scared of
them.  Olivia turned 4 recently and has quite a British accent now... I
sometimes wonder where she came from.
Josee has her hands full at home right now and after a weekend I am more
than ready to return to the office for rest.  
Markets have been choppy... my trading strategy over the past 2 months has
been very simple however.. as Randolph Duke said in the OJ futures pit on
Trading Places... SELL MORTIMER SELL.

Will send you a picture soon.. 
say hi to the wife for us.

PS-  took some clients up to play Turnberry in September for a few days...
what a peach, you would have LOVED it...

Info... 

I asked Derek to pull some data together...  FYI

Grant, ENE trades at 7x 2001 expected recurring earnings and 0.9 times book value.  This is far lower than a quick industry average of 15.5 times 2001 expected earnings and 2.8 times current book value (industry includes Duke, EL Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Kinder Morgan, and Aquila).  I think what these ratios demonstrate is the risk of the unknown that is being priced into ENE.  For example the current price to book seems like a suspect ratio to use for ENE given that it is unclear what is on our books and what else needs to be written down.  If you look at ENE on a price to earnings after non-recurring items for 2001 it looks far less attractive at 22.9 times.  If you take ENE's earnings after "non-recurring" items and slap on the industry average multiple of 15.5 times ENE's share price is $8.51 (ouch).  Now obviously not everything in the non-recurring events are actually recurring but there is talk of some wholesale losses being buried in the "non-recurring" loss.

ENE's long-term debt to equity is 0.9 times but if you include all the off balance sheet leverage and the leverage inherent in our trading business the true number is significantly higher than 0.9 times.  On a positive note the ENE's debt is trading higher today (price not yield).

Here is a spreadsheet from Bloomberg with the S&P pipelines sub sector P/Es, and P/Bs. and dividend per share (ENE's is 4%, nothing like a share price falling by 85% to get that div yield up).  I have also attached the latest Wall Street Journal article touting Berkshire, Royal Dutch, and GE as potential suitors (do you think Buffet can understand ENE?).

Hope this helps
--Derek

  

Ray... seems like its been a while since we met in San Fransisco, ....  and of course so much has happened since then. 

I have been talking with our in house legal and with Canada and I know Eric and yourself have also been talking. I believe that the door has been pushed open a little and if everyone tries to get these agreements cleaned up  and executed that PG&E and Enron ( Canada & US ) can start to transact.

With that being said, there are two areas which I would like to refresh from our discussions..

1.  Did you give any further thought to the utilization of Daily gas sales as a collateral.. I truly believe that this vehicle is a very efficient,easy way for PG&E to enhance the credit with ENA and once we have a 30 day bucket... we can get you trading access to EOL.  Lot's of details to work out, but I would like to keep this discussion at the forefront. I can send the details of how this proposal would work if required. ( let me know ) 

2.  As discussed, ENA holds some 5 year El Paso capacity. I am looking to assign this capacity and possibly and would like to investigate your supply requirements and possible alternatives such that you can consider our capacity.  

I trust all is well and look forward to talking to you soon. 

Barry Tycholiz 

Amy, can you add the cash and rest of month price for Henry Hub onto your daily pricing sheet. I think the cash to futures spreads for pretty relevant in today's market place as the cash market continues to trade well below futures.

Thanks, BT 

  

GWF ??? 

Counterparties with whom DWR has option of fuel are GWF, Calpine, Dynegy, Coral, Sunrise, Sempra, Wellhead and Pacificorp

Best,
Jeff

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

BT 

Good morning Chris.  Further to our conversation of yesterday.  

I believe that your skillset would be a positive addition to the West Gas origination group. We can provide for you a new learning experience by becoming a key component of the team. You will be asked to provide real time modeling, DCF, research on wellhead to burner tip strategies. You will learn a tremendous amount about the Natural gas business with exposure stemming from the wellhead to the burner tip. Some areas include, commodity price risk structures, risk management initiatives, financial and physical markets, structured products and transportation related initiatives.  

Please use this note as a formal offer of employment. I would like you to start as soon as you can.. ( next 2 weeks) and will leave this for you to think about until the end of day on Monday. 

Pls contact me directly if there are any questions regarding this note or any other matters. 

regards, Barry Tycholiz 

I wanted to thank both of you for taking the time out of your busy schedules to meet with me.  I greatly enjoyed hearing about your group and the deals that you have been involved in.  It seems like there are a lot of exciting things going on with your group right now and in the future.  Please allow me a few days to get back to you.  Thank you for your time and consideration.  

Sincerely,
Chris Czuppon

Chris Czuppon

Yes... 

You still interested in meeting with Edison's CFO?

Let's discuss on Monday.. I am open to either plan.

BT 

Barry,

Do you want to call Bill and set up a joint power/gas meeting or do you want to pursue this separately?

Chris Calger
503-464-3735

Just got off the phone with Rick Hawley--Puget's CFO.  He was very cordial and indicated the company was interested in talking with us.  We had a fairly open discussion of who we should contact.  In the end, he suggested that we call Bill Gaines, VP Energy Supply.  He said that as CFO he is head of the Risk Management Committee and that anything that was discussed with Bill would go through his committee.  I highlighted the notion that we were interested in talking about services that could be helpful to their risk management efforts and that would be beneficial to both of our companies.  

By the way, at the beginning of the call, I made clear that we were not talking about total outsourcing.  

He didn't immediately respond, but in the context of our discussion re:  who to talk to he stated that we should talk to him if we wanted to have a more strategic discussion on outsourcing.  Then he said something to the effect of "of course, we're not at all interested in a more comprehensive outsourcing product."

Bill's number is 425.462.3145.  He said that we can tell Bill, Rick suggested we call him directly.  

Mara, pls ensure that your file includes pipelines that flow east of the rockies, like trailblazer, Northern, NBPL, ( check with the Denver guys to get all the pipes.)

BT 

Thanks for the reply.. 

Let's talk asap regarding this transportation. I can send you a summary sheet as to what we are looking to place. You had indicated that your a larger portion of your load is south. We have some 1,2 year service starting now, and we have the five year to PG&E.( we also have the baja).  

25th of month following on payables is normal protocol...that works fine!

I had assumed that for starting out, we would only work on sales to you on a Cash basis, or very short term( intra-month).

Thanks in advance,  Barry Tycholiz 

Barry,

It was a pleasure to discuss the upcoming gas supply needs of DWR and the
potential supply options that Enron may be able to provide . I am interested
in further exploring the discounted transportation/ supply program we
briefly discussed at this week's meeting. As for the payables, DWR is
following standard payment terms; the latter of 10 days after receipt of
invoice or the 25th of the month following delivery. DWR would not agree to
accelerating payments. Additionally, please be advised that DWR would be
contemplating relatively short term transactions with Enron at this time. If
you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.

Mark Baldwin, IGS.

jessica, can you check on getting us set up for every second monday. Also, please look into pre-booking conference room space. 

BT 

Done.... for dinner, let's have perogie... what do you think?

Thanks. What's for dinner? 
KIM  XOXOXOX 

Dave. is this the meeting time on monday?  

BT 

I think that this note did you receive you the first time...

Sorry, BT

Has anybody from Calgers group met with him recently,( I know Mike was involved). 
 
BT 

You still interested in meeting with Edison's CFO?

Benny, Lavo gave me that voucher to use at the TPC.. .. are you able to get away thurs afternoon, or friday or on saturday some time. Let's try to get this used up.

In terms of a 4 some, check to see if Fletch wants to play.  I will re-check with Lavo to see if he is available.

BT 

Mike, from what I am hearing, we will not get into the 6th floor to show the staff around ( prior to the move in).  I still think it would be timely for all of us to get together for a drink but in light of this small logistical issue we may want to postpone until we move in and then go out next week. 

Once things settle down ( assuming they do) I look forward to talking specifically to you regarding increased initiatives on our parts to ensure we are getting everything we can out of marketing and trading efforts.  It is my observation that we have not made the progress I would have liked in terms of information flow... and although there has been progress, there is a ways to go. This probably has as much to do with individuals as it does anything else.

Looking forward to those discussions. 

BT 

I think we had discussed this but as a result of security issues accessing the building we will defer until next week our plans.

Thanks, BT 

Ina could not get us into the new building tomorrow, so we will not get together after work.  We will plan on going out as a group after we move over.

Mike

pls defer meeting plans until further notice. 

thanks, BT 

Talked to Craver's office. His office is going to get back to me about meeting at Edison early next week.  That work for you?

Best,
Jeff

I would be happy to take a run at this, see where the customer is at, and then set up a joint session for you and me.

I will update you asap.

Jessica, I have a 2:00 meeting with the weather desk can you verify that I have a room booked ( my room is fine), just make sure Grigsby is not using it either.

BT 

Just checking in.... We keep waiting for that 3:00 am call to watch Micheal.... Is she getting close? .... I heard Kim and her had their nails and toes done yesterday... nice.... I may want to sign up for that.  ( not the nails part...... just the schedule).

TIC 

Bill,as requested,  I talked to Michael Tribolet last week and he felt that transactions under 1 year would be ok with PG&E Company . I would like to take the next step with them and assuming we get paper executed for ECC and ENA ( which is pending).... I want to give them TRADE ACCESS TO EOL.  

Cumulative unsecured exposure would be about $300,000/day. ( estimated ) and  I would try to get the payments from them to us made on the 5th business day vs the 25th business day following delivery. Our master will give us rights for reasonable financial assurances but not definative collateral threshold amount, infact we should keep this at zero for both sides until the air clears. 

All transactions will come through EOL and the products being sold by ENA, ECC will be cash or rest of month, AECO, Sumas, Malin or PG&E Citygate.

The bottom line on this is do we want to enter into Gas related cash transactions that increase of exposure on a receivables basis to PG&E.  Commercially, I believe they are someone we want to do business with and we can increase deal flow on EOL for some Canadian and U.S. products. I do not think we are in a position today to ask for pre-pays. 
 
Please advise if any questions otherwise I am seeking the GREEN Light from you to take the next step.

regards, BT 

I am available from 1:30 - 2:30 Houston time. BT 

Eric LeDain has requested that I (re)schedule the conference call to discuss PG&E.  Please advise if you are available Thursday (Sept. 20) afternoon for approximately 1 hour.

Thanks,

yes, I would like to interview some of the candidates.... please schedule within reason, and as required. 

BT 
Barry,
 
Are you interested in the new Origination Track program?  If so, let me know what dates you can interview.
 
Thanks,

We will but choose the words you use very carefully with regards to what those may be.... LC's, cash are difficult. Basically the most that they are ever exposed to us for is 55 days of gas... and very little mark to market valuations. 

Thanks, BT

Here is the questionnaire

I look forward to discussing this next week (Thursday, 8th at 2:00 pm).

Entering into term agreements with Enron today is probably not the best play until our credit / restructuring issues are resolved.  What are you thinking about? 

All is fine, hanging in there, pissed off like you would not believe... but not much I can do now but wait it out.. I have very little interest moving back to canada at this time so it should be interesting. 

BT 

would you have your grandmother contract with enron?

I was in an electronics store the other night... Panasonic has 9" Portable DVD player ( like your sony) with an 8 hour battery... $999.00 US. It is sweeeeeeet.

TIC  

I think we should still do this, and I may join you guys.

BT 

Dates please.

FYI

We are planning on joining Crestone for a combined Denver Christmas party.  The cost for our share will be approximately $1,000.  I know it is not cheap, but I think it is an important signal and morale booster which is critical at this time.  We have a long way to go in this deal.

Tom, no problem.... 

Can you reply to this note.... or advise how to incorporate the rotating symbol into a file.

Thanks, BT  

what date is this planned for. BT 

We would love to have you and Kim.  Might even be some snow by then.  Just let me know if you can make it so they can get a good head count.

Can i have a copy of these forms pls. 

BT 

Barry,

Attached is a memo describing the Cascade Marketing Agreement that I have been proposing.  I would like to have a conference call with Gerald and Mark after you have had a chance to read my memo and the agreement.

Thanks,

Dave

    

Bill, FYI, I have received a formal request from PGT asking Enron to provide security on their pipeline.  The request is for approx $ 11MM. They are referencing a provision in their tariff  that says that if a co. goes below BBB by S&P, then they have the right to ask for security.

I have discussed this request with them and they assure me we are not being singled out. I told them we will review the letter with credit and management and get back to them prior to the deadline imposed on their request( Nov. 20).

A copy of this request will be on your desk first thing this a.m.

regards, BT 

Carl, just wanted you to know that I have decided to NOT offer William a rotation in west gas and I have talked to him this a.m.

As discussed, I like his basic skill sets but I decided this a.m. to hold off for the next 2 weeks or so before filling any spots for the end of the year.  I am sure he will find a good rotation, just wasn't the best fit for me at this time.

Thanks, BT 

Ty, pls check your model, I would believe you have a file reference error on the July 25, 55 day payables number ( when you include new deals).

Pls update and re-issue to me first thing. 

BT 

I've updated the spreadsheet to show the payables totals for the existing and proposed deals as Jan 25, 2002 and July 25, 2002, respectively.  I have also modified the payables calculation to consider only 2002 prices, as this is the applicable period for our exercise.

 << File: Huber - Existing & Proposed Deals 111201.xls >>

Leslie, I presented a form of assignment to PG&E as recently as 2 weeks ago( including other structures).. Generally speaking, they HATE the El Paso pipe because of it's flow risk and are not interested in discussing this with me until such time that EL Paso deliverability becomes more reliable. 

Having them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view ( assuming you can agree on values), but I think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get. Regardless, it is a an out of the money position for us and we could accomodate if they wish to discuss further. Have Lisa or Michael call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this asset.

Thanks, BT 

Steffes and I were just chatting and an idea came up, that we try to offer our El Paso capacity to PG&E in their bankruptcy suit (in which a settlement is being negotiated) and perhaps we can, in turn, reduce our claim against PG&E in that case.  Maybe this is already being done, but if not, it is a thought.  Lisa Mellencamp and Michael Tribolet are doing the bankruptcy case. 

Mike, this was that item I wanted to talk to you about... I assume Kim got to you first. 

I appreciate your response... It is extremely important that we maintain the highest quality of service to the wholesale customers where we have MSA's or full requirements arrangements and obligations.  

Thanks, BT 

We need to protect the flows to Citizens on TW.  I know you guys have been working on this, but Citizens continues to receive cuts.  Please secure the supply off of TW.  Let Sempra know that IB Link gas will not do.

Thanks,
Mike

Dave, although we need to track deal count, I continue to get orig amounts granted to you for $ 40.00... that is to small a number to worry about... I would think $ 500.00 / transaction would be a better cut line... 

Remember, we are after deal flow, and orig.... 

no need to reply.. 

BT 

Jeanie, as I read this e-mail i cringe at the thought that we have been dancing around this issue for  4 months yet all around us we will be laying off some very good employees who really deserve to be here, and more importantly, want to be here.

Plenty of time has been given to this issue..... please fix as soon as possible. Do you need anything from me? 

As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary:

Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate.  I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.

The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.

We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.

In summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.

 

Mark, for right now, I would not suggest we pursue any external hires. We are going to see  a lot of internal staff from different business groups looking for work. 

BT 

Kim, please schedule the appropriate people for a 15 minute discussion. I am sure that this can be resolved.  Also, be prepared to discuss the "Penalties" component of our obligations to put this in perspective.

BT 

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

Thanks,

Kim

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  

Howard, can you please verify what you mean by renewal rights.. specifically who owns what rights and until which period.

It is my expectation that with the exception of CNRL, ENA/ECC holds the obligation and annual renewal rights on Nova, ANG. We have assigned the PGT permanently out of Nov 08 to Calpine and Sierra Pacific.. We also have the obligation to give them the matching upstream capacity at that time.

Also, where do you think AEC, Talisman and CNRL will be to take permanent assignment of this pipe effective asap... thus changing the deal delivery point around..( an the credit situation). 

Included in the shuffle will be the liquids obligations, nominations, ( ENA /ECC can still act as the agent) but most importantly the thing we need to transfer over is the pipe obligation on PGT..... stat !!! 
 
Pls advise.  

 << File: PGT.xls >> 
Barry. I hope this helps. If you need anything else, please let me know. H

Pls set up a 15- 30 minute meeting with John and Mark Whitt ( Denver ) to discuss Williston Basin ( storage blowdown). 

Pls advise.

Barry Tycholiz 

I want this program continued for my group at this time. BT 

Deskheads:

After this week I was going to discontinue lunches other than bidweek for everyone except EOL traders.  There are too many people going downstairs to get their lunch and your cost center is being charged daily whether people eat or not.  I have had a couple of you approach me that you still would like for your groups to be included in daily lunches.  Please email me by tommorrow and let me know if you would like to continue.   For those that do not, I will notify your groups that this Wednesday will be the last day for their groups to eat.

Thank you,
Ina Rangel
Administrative Coordinator

No problem... by the way, I heard you guess were able to get the VNG deal completed... that  is great news.  Congratulations.
BT 

Barry, I am out for the rest of the week.  Ruth has been working on some opportunities that may require a Confidentiality Agreement to be executed over the next few days.  She may come to you if you are here to sign.  I appreciate it.  

Frank

Chris, why does Puget have credit concerns with us?  It was my understanding that we had a MTM of $50 MM in which they were out of the money.I thought the risk was realtively short term. ( winter Gas).  You would think that they would be fine with loading up on Enron. Irony comes in all shapes and sizes when a LDC doesn't like our credit!!!! 

With regards to a meeting.... I have yet to make my way up that way, and would still like to make that tour which includes Puget, Northwest Natural, Cascade etc. 

I think that a meeting with these guys on a consolidated risk management plan would  be ideal.  I will call you today. 

BT 
I called Bill Gaines of Puget to try to relax our credit constraints.  We just traded voicemails, but agreed to talk on Monday.  My general message, unless you have something to add or subtract, will be: "lots has gone on at both companies, makes sense to get together to meet your team to talk about gas and power - probably is more we can be doing together, etc. meeting in late Nov/early Dec".  

Thoughts?

Chris

  

kevin, do you have the phone number for Geysa Arujo at the Williams Shrink - Cochrane facility. She called me the other day and I must have taken her number down incorrectly.

Thanks. BT 

We just moved over to our new building yesterday and i was moving my rolodex and your card popped up... 

Everything good by you? 

BT 

Thanks for the note back.... yeah, I am still kicking.... and I am sure you know this that it will take a little more than a bankruptcy to shake this guy... when I grab on , I grab on tight.... 

Sorry for putting you through the inconvenience of having to read our documents.. I think we have all had to dust off the paper... but I sincerely hope most of it is behind us. 

I knew Karen was at Progas, glad to hear that she is enjoying work... 

I have not been to Calgary since May, and am not sure when I will be back up... and if it will be on a permanent of temporary basis.... all in all Houston is treating us pretty good.  Work really has been great and I have such a good marketing region... california, arizona, Denver.... vegas... are some of the highlights... so when I need to, I go blow a few braincells out in one of these fine regions..

Kim is working a little ( 2 shifts in 1 year).... she may have to pick up the pace on that effort... ( she is fighting me on that one)... House is good, weather right now is great... 80 degrees ( all the time)... there is something to be said about living in shorts and sandals... 

Better run, take care, talk soonest. 

BT 
hey guy,

rumours of your demise are greatly exageerated !

I'm surviving - just finished an NEB Hearing yesterday on our bypass
pipeline (bypasses NGTL in the Med Hat area). The week before that we had
this little meltdown of our strategic alliance partner which caused a few
sleepless nights and much reading of the contracts...but we survived.

karen is over at progas and seems to be enjoying it.

when are you coming up to the great white north ? let me know and we should
have a beer and shot some pool.

cheers

Paul, thanks for the note... do we have a position with these guys today either in the form of MTM or payables/receivables? 

Like everyone else, the street continues to pick it's spots on new dealings with us but I wouldn't mind knowing what our existing exposures are to them.

BT 

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, "it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new." 

Paul

PS  I have signed the document and have Fed Ex'ed it back to Houston.

Not really...someone from Williams called you regarding a document that needs to be signed by the 30th.. is that a C/A for NWPipe.... 
 
She was covering for Jan, I did not get a chance to take the call, just heard about it...

If one of the exercises is to standardize ( as best as possible the two agreements) I think we need to create a document that identifies the variance in the agreements. Has this been done and if so, can I have a copy to review. I have gone through both the US and Canadian agreements but am not sure where some of the subtle differences lie.

Call if you want to discuss.

BT 

Dave, I have read the proposal. Pls coordinate a tele conference with yourself, mark and me. sometime this a.m.

Good morning.... is all of Nevada Powers generation territory served from Southwests full requirements off of El Paso, or do you get some load from them at Kern? 

Bt   

Can we reschedule this for some other time today?  I just realized that I have the Kinder Morgan guys coming in today for a meeting on a new storage expansion of Huntsman storage.

Jessica, did we place the order for the playoff tickets... BT 

I can do it anytime up until 1pm Houston time.

Can we reschedule this for some other time today?  I just realized that I have the Kinder Morgan guys coming in today for a meeting on a new storage expansion of Huntsman storage.

Mike, here is a very brief overview of planned or approved expansions by major pipeline.  There is a lot of detail that supports each of these pipe expansions including, proposed start dates, delivery points, probability etc... 

Let's discuss needs...

Perhaps, we can give your group a general overview on expansions in the west, current status etc. 

BT

San Diego at Dallas......this weekend.( i think).... Road Trip

With the crack team of developers that you had..... you should be able to fetch a pretty premium.!!! .. didn't she write code while eating her lunch and breast feeding her kids? 

Yes, it could be used - with of course excessive costs to buy.
We're currently looking at re-working the code to update.

Are you still using the Access Database for PC and if so, do you think this could be applied to Utility Usage , portfolio MTM etc?

Please note that, since this particular presentation is for Xcel, we have included some Rockies fundies information that may or may not be applicable to other customers.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Barry,

As promised, here are some of the current redeployment candidates that have a marketing/structuring/trading background for consideration concerning your West Origination opening.  I believe that you have seen Jim Lowe before and expressed some limited interest in him.  The other candidates are most likely new to you.

Let me know if you would like to pursue any of these redeployed employees.

 << File: Alok Garg.doc >>  << File: Mark Dypiangco.doc >>  << File: Laura Odenthal.doc >>  << File: Audrey O'Neil.doc >>  << File: Jim Lowe.doc >> 

Also, I spoke with Mark McConnell today, and he mentioned that he had accepted the offer to join the Transwestern group of ETS.  He primary motivation for selection of this option was his desire to work with asset deals.  As we know, given EWS "asset light" approach to deal making, this option would be difficult to fulfill within the West Origination group.  However, he mentioned that he was very impressed with your group, and short of the asset piece maintained a high interest in your open position.

Regards,
Todd Peikert

thanks, I will review in detail and get back to you to discuss a plan....
bt 

Talked to Mark.

First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get "soup-to-nuts" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.

Best,
Jeff

Mark, Dave, I talked to Lavorato regarding a non-compete... he was fine with proceeding to negotiate a commercial deal but did not want us to commit to a non compete ( just yet) for these reasons.

1. He wants to not restrict EES in their abilities to market in that region ( I will discuss with Delainey).
2. Unless we have an exclusive he thinks we are boxing ourselves.

Pls digest these points as you proceed and keep me posted on where Cascade is even with the paper we showed to them.

BT 

As we had talked about yesterday.... any deals cut by El Paso are going to be opposed by the shippers ( when it comes to adding new capacity or expanding ) until the existing issues are resolved.).

BT 

As discussed, we knew this was coming!
NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : September 20, 2001
El Paso's Bid to Hike Export Capacity Opposed 
Southwest local distribution utilities and municipal distributors have called on FERC to reject, or convene a technical conference to consider, El Paso Natural Gas' application to boost export capacity on the Samalayuca Lateral by about 100 MMcf/d to meet natural gas demand in northern Mexico. They argue that such action would deprive existing El Paso customers of already-tight capacity on the pipeline's South Mainline. 
There are a number of ongoing cases at the Commission addressing the limited capacity on the El Paso system, and its capacity-allocation procedures, the distributors pointed out. "Yet...El Paso proposes to allow a unilateral reallocation of 100,000 Mcf./d of capacity to serve customers outside the United States without fully disclosing from which customer the capacity will come and its likely impact on all these pending matters," said Southern Union Gas Co. The utility asked the Commission to convene a technical conference. 
Southwest Gas Corp. and the El Paso Municipal Customer Group said they were concerned the proposed increase in the lateral's capacity may "adversely affect" them and other customers because capacity on the South Mainline would be needed to move the additional export load. FERC "should not approve increased export capacity without a corresponding increase in mainline capacity" on El Paso's system, they said. 
Southwest and the municipal distributors urged the Commission to either: 1) reject the El Paso application outright; 2) in the alternative, set the case for hearing to assess the impact on existing customers; or 3) absent rejection or hearing, defer consideration of the application until other pending cases related to the level of capacity on El Paso are resolved. 
In its application, El Paso asked FERC for the go-ahead to increase the maximum daily export capacity on the lateral by about one-third to 308 MMcf/d to correspond with the "rapid development" of the gas infrastructure in the northern Mexico state of Chihuahua. It said it already had entered into a long-term agreement for the entire proposed increase of 100 MMcf/d of export capacity with MGI Supply Ltd (See Daily GPI, Aug. 31 <d20010831e.html>). 

FYI

Mark, I talked to Fred.. this meetingis cancelled until further notice... and for sure you  and your people were going to be invited.

BT 

Paul, let's try to find some time on Friday to discuss next steps.

BT 

Mark and Barry

I have talked to Crestone about backing us in a Northern Border transportation deal.  Basically they are on board, however I have not shown them any economics.  What I believe needs to take place is to identify Northern Border shippers who would be willing to release their capacity.  Once we are able to put the capacity release economics together, which will be driven by the Northern Border shippers, we will be able to 
show Crestone a deal.  I do not have any potential parties willing to release Northern Border capacity.  I have talked to the Central desk about this opportunity, they informed me that they had no interest in this type of an arrangement.  I personally believe we can manage ENA's current Northern Border position more efficiently but have been unable to convince others of this.  Any ideas you can provide would be helpful.

Paul 

Where are we on the Northern Border deal?
Mark, Good Morning.  

Any updates on Crestone structure ( re-price of deal), also, Paul discussed the Northern Border deal with potentially the producers underpinning... pls keep me posted on status.

BT 

When you talk to Robert Neustaedter, ask him about the Montebello storage field in Socal's territory that was blown down this year. I would like to know what application they filed, when it started and a summary of the details regarding this deal.

There was about 14 Bcf blown down. 

BT 

For your reference in the 10:30 am (CST) meeting tomorrow, I have attached a memo outlining the potential WBI storage blowdown deal.  Please contact myself or Mark Whitt if you have any questions ahead of the meeting.

 

Regards,
Tyrell Harrison

Can you see if you can float out these tickets for tonights game... I cannot make it. I have all 4.

BT 

Leslie, further to our conversation. I don't think the prize in $$$'s is going to give us the leverage we had hoped but I will know better early next week exactly what that looks like. At the very least, we are going to position ourselves with El Paso such that we can have a commercial discussion.

BT 

In consideration of the sensitivities regarding this asset and ENA's efforts to manage this risk. I believe we need to formalize and coordinate any external communication with El Paso.

Please advise by name who your lead contact is or would be and what the general purpose of the conversations is concerning.  If you do not have a primary contact or do not talk directly to the pipeline, pls advise. 

thanks, BT

Todd, further to your voice message. Yes, I did meet in person with Robert Ayers, the meeting went well, and he was going to contact me on Friday. He was considering another offer ( a different co.) and wanted to make a decision this week. As such I committed to informing him as to whether or not an offer will be made to him.

At this time, I am not going to make an offer and will advise him as such upon my next contact. Although he has some good qualities I am going to continue in my search.

Mark, I was looking at that pricing sheet and would like to suggest that the shading in the commentary boxes... under the assumption that this becomes a printed document and that it is printed in black & white, it is very difficult to read. Perhaps a more solid background would work better.

BT 

Steph, further to our discussion, Pls review.  I took a quick look at the locations and most appear to be East based.  You might want to use an analyst to figure this out. Also, they have valued the inventories off of the Nymex only ( or so it appears) and I would have to believe that the value of these molecules is materially different than this. 

Pls review and let's discuss asap.

BT 

Barry,

Let me know if you have any time to review.

Bill

Bill -

I have attached a breakdown of our gas inventories by location.  The valuations have not been updated to take into account the downward move in gas prices.  

When we meet with you here in Purchase we would like to this to be one of the topics of discussion.  If you need any additional information (or more detail), please let me know asap.

Barry, trust all is well. 

I just wanted to update you on a couple of things and re-check SMUD's interest.

1. The on again off again PGT assignment of 10,000 MMBTU per day out of Nov. 2002. appears to have surfaced from our counter party again and under the assumption you are still interested I will forward to you latest offer once we have FIRMED it up with the third party. 

2. It is my understanding that you own El Paso - PG&E Topock capacity until May 31, 2003.  ENA has some of the same capacity and is prepared to offer this into the market place from the period June 1, 2003 - May 30, 2006. ( with the renewal rights), PLUS some sort of " Payment " from ENA to SMUD.  Rather than renew your existing capacity at full tolls, this is a way to pick up transport below the normal tariff and retain renewal rights after 2006. 

Pls advise if either of these points capture your interest. 

Thanks in advance, 

Barry Tycholiz

Peter, Eric.... I talked to Bradford this a.m. regarding another matter and managed to discuss with him general credit terms for PG&E. He said he would review Post Petition credit status and also needs to discuss these credit lines as potentially part of our ongoing issues related to PG&E. He was going to discuss internally and advise.

I am not sure he will have any comments back by this weds, so this may conflict with the timelines Eric and I discussed this a.m.

BT 

Jeff, did Mark H. sign off on us removing triangular set-off between affiliated entities.  We have removed the concept as instructed by Barry, but do not want to send to PG&E unless we have Mark's OK.

Also, Eric/Barry you were going to canvass Bill in terms of what he would require for Credit.

Peter.

Good news on the CMS Deal... How much will this be? 

BT 

I have received the signed CMS Agreement.  I have signed it and returned it and we will be booking the earnings over the next couple of days.  Huber is trying to figure out how they will structure the purchases at the wellhead for royalty purposes.  They are doing this as part of their counterproposal to us.  I do not have very high expectations for this deal happening in the 3rd quarter.  However, Brian Stone will be stuck in a boat with just me and a guide for a total of 8 hours on Wed and Thurs. and I hope to make significant progress in that time.

Mark

Mara, pls ensure that everyone takes the time TODAY to fill this out with all the customers that we can market this to, including names and action plan.

I will need to review with Phillip and John later today.
BT 

I put the El Paso capacity marketing sheet for everyone to fill in on the o drive.  go to o://gas_trad/shortcut to west gas orig/bronstein/el paso pipeline capacity marketing.

Mike, for your info... we just received this message from IGS re: DWR purchases.  As previously discussed seeing the DWR rfp will require some credit and contract enhancements and that process is underway but it is moving slower and with less push than I would like... For sure, there are alot of hurdles...

It is our opinion that any transactions that are being done by the DWR with third parties are relatively short dated..  1 month, 2 month etc.. but we will keep you posted as we move forward.

BT 

Barry,

Interstate Gas Services, on behalf of the DWR, will be soliciting bids for
gas supply.  We are currently contemplating limited gas purchases, and would
like to get a GISB in place.  We would like to do a quick follow up in
regards to the status of the GISB contract between yourselves and the
Department of Water Resources.  If your legal department has any questions
or concerns, please contact Mark Baldwin of Interstate Gas Services at
925-243-0350.

To address any credit concerns you may have, the department is currently
preparing a complete credit package which we will forward to you upon its
completion.

Again, please do not hesitate to call.

Also, in the swap-spread models... please expand the model to incude curves like, ventura, chicago, ngpl mid con. 

Thanks. BT 

Mark, I saw the funds come in last night... $ 1,045,000.  Good job... let's keep it going.

$1MM.  Could be another $45,000 because of interest rate decreases.

Louise, further to our meeting last week, the contracts have been executed and the Rockies transportation has been sold to CMS. Origination and trading participated in the P&L.  Orig = $ 1,045,000.  Trading approx $310,000. 

We are a little closer to our Q3 targets of $ 2MM in sept.

Good morning... There is NO issue on your e-mail that is going to get in the way of Family issues... so don't worry about that. Don't knee cap the band because you guys owe me $ 4,000.00.  I was just checking on what your decision was... keep me posted. 
 
BT 

 Well, I am glad you made it home from Denver. It must have been a little hairy around there Sept. 11. Were you in the air already or just getting ready to leave when it all happened. Does any of this change you plans for Xmas?
 
We have not made a decision yet. The reason for that is, we can't make a 'good' decision until we know whether we will get to the U.S. or not for the tour. It is that up in the air. If things work out for the worst, we will not recover from this and will be forced to sell the van. It will be the end of the band obviously. Hopeful y that will not happen. My problem is that I don't want o get in any situation that might cause you and I any problems. This business that you and I do together is for the band. The band is just not that important to let it get in the way of family. I won't let it get in the way of Michele and I ..........so. I just want to make a good decision on this. I( guess for you it does not make too much difference either way, does it? I mean either you will get the balance paid or a payment in November. Sorry I did not get back to you about it, it's just that I really didn't have an answer. How's Kim. I guess you know Marge got a dog.
I never heard back from you guys.. what did you decide to do?  Are you going to sell the van or defer the payments for the next couple of months.
 
Let me know...
 
BT 

Sonya, further to our conversation the other day... I am still not able to read the first couple of letters on the left hand side of the page under Headlines... Have you had a chance to look at this.

BT 

Never did... but glad we were here to ensure it was captured.

BT 

Good job.  I bet you never thought you would retrade the transport this much.

I would probably drop the range volume and go with a specific amount... 10,000 - 25,000 instead of up to 200,000 as I am sure there is no way they will get that high. 

BT 

Steph,

Here's my proposal for Valero.  Would you (& legal?) like to review it before I send it?

Dave << File: EPNG Capacity Proposal.doc >> 

sure

I agree they won't want 200,000 but I want to make sure they don't throw it out because the volume is too high.  Otherwise you're OK with it?

Dan,

Most things here look good.  From my term sheet, page 1 under El Paso Capacity, what about selling them San Juan gas?  (B.)  And what about page three, number 8?  Let me know -

Please review the foregoing and let me know if there need to be any changes.  Thank you.

I have added Socal to the worksheet.  The prices listed are as of last night.  Nymex is up $.04 - $.05.  Basis is pretty much the same.  Let me know if you need anything else and I will let you guys know as soon as I get the option information.

thanks,

Kim

 

Kim,

Do you have any price indicators for CA Border (Topock) gas?  Thanks.  Larry

Hi guys,

I have been working on some pricing information for you guys and have
attached the fixed prices after today's close for Nymex, Aeco, San Juan,
and Permian as we discussed.  The guys on our structuring desk are
pricing up calls and puts for the same delivery points for August thru
March and August thru July, 2002.  The Nymex was crushed today, about
$.13 down for the year strip.  The balance of 2001 was down almost $.20.
The balance of 2001 is up about $.015 on access.  The socal basis fell
significantly today as well.

Let me know if there is anything else you need.  Jack, I will send you
the storage info I have asap.  Had trouble accessing it today for some
reason.  I will send the option pricing as soon as I get it.

Thanks,

Kim

 <<price indications june 25.xls>> 

Jack,

Attached is a graph showing storage year by year.  We are expecting another rather large injection this week.  Cal 02 Nymex is up about $.0125 but the balance of 01 is down about a penny.  There is no weather to speak of and therefore,  no demand for physical gas - this is what is driving prices down.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Am still working on the option pricing.

Thanks,

Kim

 

Boring!  things are slow here, too.  Playing golf Fri?  

at this rate it looks like it 

Let me know what you want to do about a load forcast model.

Hello again,

Attached is a worksheet showing price indications for Calls that are $1.00, $1.50, and $2.00 out of the money.  I priced the puts that you would sell to me as 25% and 50% of the call premiums.

I did this for Aeco, Permian, and San Juan.  Let me know if there is another way that you would like to look at them.

Thanks,

Kim

 

Hey Chris,  glad to hear from you.  I am going to try to make it by your party tomarrow night - and perhaps, bring my friend Camille.  Let me know if there is anything that I can bring.

See you then -

Kim

Suzanne had previous plans so I thought that I didn't confirm the reservation.  I will be in the Grenadine Islands on the 14th - what's the occasion?  I think we will try to come in August some time.  Will that be OK?

Thought you were coming in town last weekend as you did make a
reservation????

There will be a big party at my house on the 14th of July.

We did have fun - Camille was interested in the other Chris and wouldn't leave - I think we were loaded too. 

 Sorry for flirting a little too much - I don't know if you told Stanton that I hit on you until 5 in the morning or if he just read that into your story - but it drove him crazy. He called my house at 2:30 am Sunday morning very drunk and being very wierd!  

Anyway, it was a great party - thanks for the invitation.  Until next time -

Kim

Did yall have fun the other night?  I was a bit loaded.  I hope I was not
rude or obnoxious, but regardless it was good seeing you and meeting your
friend.

Here is a summary of the structure we are using to buy gas from the gas desk for Harbor.  This is basically what I plan on using for any future tolling deals that come up.  We can always enhance the structure by replacing the Gas Daily with a fixed price or NGI border price.  

Also, can you get me an indicative 5 year offer for PG&E Citygate out of August for 10,000 MMBtu/d?

Thanks!

C

Attached is a summary of the new gas deal.  Essentially, we will sell selling Gas Daily mid plus $.10 on a variable basis will a cash out on imbalances each month.  This will become effective on June 1 and on a month to month thereafter.  I have added a clause that indicates that EPMI will be assured we will collect our gas costs each month.  Please let me know if these terms do not represent your understanding.

New VERY IMPORTANT deal.  I promised parent guarantee requirements and credit and collateral term probobly in the form of an Enfolio by Thursday.  This is a power generator that we do services for in Portland.  Tracy is very familiar with this company and has reviewed their credit.  She should have all the infor you need.  If not let me know.

customer:  Wheelabrator, a subsidiary of Waste Management.  

They need gas for their Lassen, California plant and HAVE to close something by next week.  I am showing them a basic structure with a baseload volume with swings being priced at gas daily.  9,000/day baseload @ Malin.  Today the fixed price is about $4.10

Is there anyway to get this done?  Please let me know so that i can pursue.  Also, can we do physical gas deals under the EEI?  We have an EEI with them.

THANKS,

Kim

Kim,
 
Thanks for forwarding the Collateral Assignment document this  morning.  Our counsel has given it his blessing and we are ready to proceed  with execution of the Agreement with on exception.
 
The only change needed from our perspective is the  following:
 
                 SECTION 6, Paragraph (g).
 
                 Upon termination of the Master Agreement and  confirmation from the Secured Party that all obligations                           thereunder have been satisfied in full in the form  attached as Exhibit B hereto, the Escrow Agent shall remit                  to  the Secured Party any funds remaining in the collateral  account.
 
 
                 We think that the last sentence contains a typographical  error, and that it should read ...the Escrow Agent shall remit to                  the  Grantor any funds remaining in the collateral account.
 
Please let me know if your attorneys agree after their  review.
 
Thank you for your attention to this matter.
 
Thomas L. Goudie
    

Attached are some changes I scribbled on the document that Theresa sent me for the City of Mesa.  Stacy will probobly call Debra with all of these changes.  Also attached is the term sheet for this transaction.  (Alternative one).

Dave Fuller will be working on this document and with this customer starting thursday, July 12.  I will be back on the 25th.

Also, Jan Kennedy's (the customer) email address is Jan_Kennedy@ci.mesa.az.us

thanks for your help.

ps.  I can't attach the changes but I believe Stacy has everything.

I have been wondering all week whether you got on the boat.  I looked at continental's specials and their weren't any for this weekend.  But if you plan ahead or are flexible on flight times, you can definitely get here for less than $200!

HOw was the rest of your trip?  Anything exciting to report?  How was your time with Turbo?  

I wish it were last wednesday!  I think I am going to sell all of my belongings and live on a beach somewhere!!

Let me know what's going on!

K2

oh Yeah,  I got some pictures back and will send you some.  what is your address?

What did you do in Rome????  you must have had Capt. Neil.  I understand that he is a big golfer.  when did you go?  I can do lunch - what time?

I did do the Windjammer on that exact boat/iten.  I am not a cruise guy, so WJ was the way to go.  I dived and/or played golf every day.  The captain and I played one day.  St. Martin and either Nevis or St. Kitts has a casino, St. Barts is my favorite island overall.  I was a FREE man....when in Rome....!

Got time for lunch?

Sounds like fun!  I just got back last night too.  It is a windjammer but someday, I want to get a bunch of people to charter 3 - 4 sailboats and do the same thing.  Did you go on a windjammer too?  Or did you just sail around since you lived down there?  I've gotten my pictures back but I am waiting to see pictures from the other people that went.  I was using diposable cameras since mine was broken.  I was so disappointed that I went out and bought a new one the minute I got back!

That is the exact itinerary I sailed.  Are you going on a windjammer or wind-something?  St. Barts is my favorite island.

I left Thursday for a wedding in Green Bay, and then Sunday the bride and groom and a bunch of others, went up to the bride's family cabin up in Northern Wisconsin.  It was great.  We canoed, fished, drank a lot of beer and listened to awesome guitarists jam around the campfire.    Got back at 11:30 last night.  

PJh

I want to sell all of my belongings and move to the beach!  It was so awesome!!  I think I am going back in January to sail St. Martin, St. Barts, St. Kitts, and Nevis.  

Where did you go on your vacation and how was it?  when did you get back?

Stephanie,

Can you help me answer John's questions regarding our capacity and deliveries to Nogales? 

Thanks,

Kim
Good morning Kim, 
You mentioned yesterday that Enron had some EP capacity to sell.  Well,  
Citizens is wanting to know if Enron could make firm sales to it for gas to  
its electric generating facility, Valencia, located in Nogales, AZ.  As I  
recall the gas requirements are in the range of 1 to 2 MMcf per day.   
I have the following questions which I would like to discuss with you on this  
subject: 
1) Is there sufficient available capacity on the pipeline that will allow the  
gas to flow? 
2) Could you make deliveries for the month of August and possibly September? 
3) What would be the delivered price? 
4) What is the expectation of this gas showing up everyday? 
Give me a call on my cell phone to discuss>

Lou,

Sorry I am just now getting back to you but I have been on vacation.  Anyway, the answer to your questions is $.70 today.  That number can change with the market though.  Keep me posted on any potential gas transactions you have going on and let me know if you need any price indications.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim:
    I appreciate  receiving the pricing updates from you last week for 5 yr. and 3 yr. gas  strips.  Henwood is working for several generation clients doing  gas/electric consulting, so I'll probably be contacting you again for an  indicative price, or you might receive an RFP for gas that we're helping a QF  write.
  
    One question that  I have now is, do you have an idea on what the premium would be for a 5 yr. gas  supply that was 5x13 or 5x16 rather than a base-load 7x24 at the PG&E  Citygate?   Thanks, Kim.

John,

Our primary delivery point on the EP capacity is the border so it would have to flow as an alternative delivery location and would be subject to cuts.  I would like to talk to you in more detail about this with the assistance of Stephanie Miller who is the tport expert in our group.  Then you can decide how you would like to persue.  Stephanie will be available in the morning before 11:00 am CDT.

Please give me a call when you can -

     We do not have to book air now.  We can actually wait til Dec if we
     want
     however the airfare is not guaranteed at $884.73.  The flights to St.
     Maarten are not as long so it looks like we would be in at about 2:30
     ish.

     If you have any questions please ask me I will try to find out and
     pass
     it onto everyone.

     See ya!  Stacey

Where's my BHP doc????????????

Janette,

Attached is the Parent Guaranty form that we need to get executed in order to do business.  Enron's credit department is asking for the guaranty to be for $10 million.  Let me know if you guys are agreeable to this.  Also, I need to know if the name of the guarantor is BHP BILLITON LTD.  We couldn't tell from the web site if this was correct.

Let me know if you need updated pricing.  Prices were down on the day but have moved back up.

Thanks,

Kim

Janette,

I did leave you a voice message.  The Commodity price right now is $2.55 with a $.03 premium to schedule out of the basin and a $.05 premium to schedule the delivered volumes at the delivery point.  Also, in order to be allowed to schedule for you, we will have to get an agency agreement in place with El Paso, which could take some time.  In the case we don't get it in place to schedule for you Aug 1st, you could request El Paso to put your nom in daily until we get the agreement executed and in place.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim,
I will discuss the Guaranty form with Vito and pass it along to the people
that will need to handle this issue.

We do need updated pricing - I left a message on your voice mail about 15
minutes ago.  A reply by e-mail will be fine.

Thanks,

Rolling in to work at 8:30 something?

Laird,

Call me if you have any quesitons.

Thanks,

Kim

 

I was working out at 5:30 this a.m.!  What's the matter with you?  Were you able to get the trailer off of your truck?  When I got home, Suzanne came and got me and we went shopping and then to the grocery store.  Went home and laid on the couch for about an hour then met Suzanne at the park for a jog.  Then she came over and we grilled steak on the grill, stir fried some veggies, had a glass of wine and watched Sex in the City. 

Lonely, huh?  When does Lawrence move in?

K. 

Always!  The laugh is that Tosha gets here at 9 if she is lucky and Carl is an 8:45-9man!  I'm the early bird.  Both of them are ex bankers so they prefer working late.  How was your Sunday?  The rest of the day without me could only have been a let-down!

I had fun with Rob.  I played horribly on what is a very short, but tight and tricky course.  88.  Then we had dinner at Champs.  I played Mr. Domestic and put Miracle Grow on all my shrubs and flowers.  My mom told me to do it a month ago and I have blown it off and some stuff died.  What an ingrate.

Now I have empty nest syndrome now that Joe is gone!

PJH

Rolling in to work at 8:30 something?

Janette,

We are offered at $2.69 for San Juan gas for August.  The adders for scheduling are the same.  Let me know if there is anything else that you need.  Sorry for the delay but I think we've gotten everything straightened out here.  The trader just had a computer issue.  '

what kind of breakdown?  when did I ever have a breakdown?  A mini mid-life crisis maybe (hence the belly ring).  Nothing new - stayed in town this weekend and had a fun relaxing time.  Theresa just called and wanted to know if I was going to COGA.  I had to break the bad news!  When Lisa and her current boyfriend break up - (gerald met him too) I will let you know!

So what is going on the weekend Barry is making us go up to Denver?  Should I come in on Sat - since I can't go to NYC for the US open!!

I knew it!  Houston, like Las Vegas, has all the trophy women!  What's up with you?  Everything going ok, or are you in the mist of your latest breakdown?

Sean,

Attached is a document with the changes we discussed.  Let me know how things are going with your legal staff as well as with the collateral section.

Thanks,

Kim

Revised per our discussion.  Please forward to Citizens.

 

Thanks so much for sending the CDs.  I really didn't think I would ever see them again!  I take it that you are still considering coming back to windjammer.  I guess it will depend on what happens when you get home.  Kim 1, Stacy, Susie and I are considering the Poly trip in January.  I haven't been to those islands (St. Martin, St. Barts, etc.) yet so I might have to go.

I can't imagine a place better than the caribbean - I would love to see it!  So if you're not serious - don't tease me!

Take care and thanks again for the CDs -
Love,
K2

Glad you had a good time, hopefully we can catch up
again at some time in the near future. If I dont come
back to windjammer and stay at home you are most
welcome to come visit.
Were I live is even better than the Caribbean.

PS> Your CDs are on there way to Miami, I sent them
to the office today with the other mail, so they
should have them soon this week.

Take Care
Love Lyndon

Please call me.

Kim -

Tomorrow morning after 9:30 is OK for me.

JRW

we need to do it sooner than later - would today or tomarrow morning work for you?  I am really curious about Frank Vickers and when he is avail.  Can I let you know when I hear from him?

Kim -

Can we set up the call for 3:30 p.m. instead?

JRW

Guys,

I am trying to set up a conference call with Steve Snyder, (etal) of HESCO to determine once and for all if we can do business with them, what it will take to do business with them, and what kind of business we can do with them.  If we can't do business with them, we need to say so with an explanation.  How does Tuesday afternoon at 1:30 sound?  Let me know ASAP so I can set it up.

Thanks,

Kim

Linda,

Hey - how are things going for you back in the real world?  I have to admit, it has been a very slow adjustment for me! Anyway, I was never able to log in to the July Jammers website and now I no longer have the invitation to join.  Do you still have the email or invitation that would allow me to join?  I can't wait to see the pictures out there!

I think Kim 1, Stacy, and Susie and I are going on the trip in January.  I have never been to those islands to I am really excited.  Wish you could join us!

I hope all is well with you - take care!

Kim 2

I have conference room # 3268 reserved for 3:30 today.  Steve Snyder and Tom Goudie of Hesco may be here in person.  Thanks for your participation.  Let me know if any of you have a conflict.  

Thanks,

Kim

Jason is available at 3:30 and I agree we should get together before - do you want Jason involved?  We could meet at 3:30 and bring Hesco in at 4:00.  Let me know your thoughts.

thanks,

Kim

Kim, looks like 4:00.  That is fine with me.  We should have some internal time before we get on a call with HESCO.

Frank

Could each of you confirm if you are available for a conference call with HESCO today at 3:30 p.m.?  If you are, I will set up a room and let you know where.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

we should get financials from Knauf friday morning in the over night mail - I will keep you posted.  I think we can get this deal.  Also, we are three more deals and $100,000 closer to Pebble Beach - I sold gas to Palo Alto yesterday.

How are things coming with Willis Bennett's customers?

K./

H. & C. were suppose to get back from Hawaii on Saturday.  H had to leave on Sunday for Maine but was suppose to return last night or today.  I don't have Mrs. Mauney's number but I think my mom has it if you want to call her - 901-396-0399.  Still trying to figure out this weekend.  I would love to play golf instead of go to that dumb picnic.  One problem is that I pulled the daylights out of my left hamstring and it is affecting my game.  I will keep you posted.

K.

Kim,

Do you know when H and Chase are do back?? Do you have Mrs. Mauney's phone
number? Mr. Mauney's IRS tax credit check came to the house and I need to
get it to them somehow

Thanks

Wes

Ok - we will meet at 3:30 and call hesco at 4.

This is about credit working with HESCO right ?  IF so then we should know what ENA credit (Jason) is planning to discuss with HESCO, so I do feel that we should have that conversation with Jason prior to bringing anyone in. 

Frank

Jason is available at 3:30 and I agree we should get together before - do you want Jason involved?  We could meet at 3:30 and bring Hesco in at 4:00.  Let me know your thoughts.

Jane,

The difference between your price indications and EOL are twofold.  One, we are showing you physical markets on the price indications and EOL is strickly financial and for a specific product.  There are many differences in these two products, depending on term, physical premiums, the trader's position, etc.  Two, the price indications that you receive are based on yesterday's markets.  EOL is a real time current market price for the specific product listed.  Give me a call if you have any more questions and we can discuss further.

thanks,

Kim

Mara;

I am wondering why the basis shown on the indicatives is much higher than
basis shown on Enron Online?  For example, basis to PG&E citygate on
EnronOnline is about $0.88 for Nov01-Mar02 and $0.78 for Nov02-Mar03, but
the indicative shows about $1.18 and $0.92 respectively.  Are these
different products?  Is the difference attributable to the indicatives being
for physical products?  Just trying to learn something.

Jane.

SMUD is buying, we are selling.  It is a fixed price call - not gas daily.

Is this fixed priced or gas daily calls.  If it is a gas daily call, is the strike fixed or FOM?  Is SMUD buying or selling?

Sorry guys, I need to clarify my previous request.  SMUD is looking for a financial call option at Malin (or Aeco) with the strike 10% above today's market and 20% above today's market for 5000/day.  Term is April 01 through Mar 03.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Here is the lastest spreadsheet of deals I have done with Citizens.  Please call if you have questions.

Thanks,

Kim

 

J.,

BHP is still in the market for Balance august San Juan.  Can we do this or can you call that guy that spiro recommended ASAP?  Please let me know.

thanks,

Kim

I didn't get it.  It may be because you sent it to Kim.Ward@ect.enron.com.  Sometimes that works and sometimes not. If you get a chance to try kim.ward@enron.com it would be great. Sorry for the trouble!  Thanks for helping me out!

What do you want to do with bhp for august?

It's official - I am coming in on Saturday, Sept. 8.  Missing the matchbox 20 concert here in houston!

Wes,

Attached is our Master Firm Purchase/Sale agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  Let me know if you have any questions - I can have our legal team standing by to answer them.  Also, if you need any price info, just let me know.  

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Chris, 

Besides making this consistant and pretty, how does this spreadsheet look to you?  Am I leaving anything out?  According to the desk, they didn't take much during July.

Thanks,

Kim

 

I am sort of bummed about not going matchbox - but I will see them next year.  Dinner and Downtown sounds like fun, since I will be staying downtown - with no car!  Don't know when I will get there yet.  Is there anything in particular that I should come in early for?  I think fuller gets in town in the afternoon.  Should I pack my bike, skis, and golf clubs?  or just my drinking goggles?

Really, I'm going to the Matchbox 20 concert up here on the 18th.  If you want let's look to eat dinner and then party downtown.   Do you feel like doing anything in particular?  (Mountain Biking, Golf, Skiing, Massive Drinking, etc)

any news on doing a one month deal with bhp?

I think he gets in around 3.  I can try to arrange the same and we can go straight there.  Where do you want to play?

If Fuller gets in early, let's play golf!  What do you think?

John, 

Sorry this took me so long but I had to wait for the schedulers and Janey.  Let me know how it looks to you.  Thanks for your help.

Kim

 

Trader says to just use the mid curves.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim

I'm working on a toll for S. Rosman; could you provide a bid adjuster (I'm using yesterday's mid curves) for PG&E CityGate for 2 deals. Both start 6/1/02; one is for 1 year and the other is for 15 years....so ending 5/31/03 and 5/31/17. Thanks

Hey,  just heard from the girls that you are now a tv star.  They saw you on some E! Entertainment special.  I am sorry to say that I missed it!  How are you and where are you?  I am assuming that you have now left the boat and are wondering your way to Austrailia.  Hope you are enjoying yourself.  I just spent the weekend in Memphis - visiting family and friends.  It was a lot of fun!

If the show runs again and I am able to see it, perhaps I will record it for you!  Have fun and keep in touch!

Ann,

Can you check on the palo alto confirms for deals that were done around the 20th of July?  I think there are about three confirms they have not received and Karla at Palo Alto is going to get in trouble internally.

thanks,

Kim Ward

This was hilarious!  I can't believe that you remember I have a cat!  How are things?

For all those cat lovers.

Chris,

Call me if you have any questions.  These prices are pretty much where our offers are.  Also, I didn't do anything with the physical premium.  We could probobly get is lowered.  Let me know.

thanks,

Kim

Anne,

I just got another phone call from Palo Alto.  They still have not received three of their confirms from deals done around the 20th of July.  They have ceased to do additional business with us until they receive these confirms.

thanks,

Kim

Where is Moab - the place where you burn your feet?  Barry is in Canada - for his grandmother' funeral.  Went out with him - too forward and outspoken for me - at least for a first date!!  And you thought I had a strong personality!!!  Going to Palo Alto Thursday - hope to get a management services deal.

Just got in from Moab.  Is Barry in today?  Was that guy that you had the bad date with the one that told you "call me within 24hrs or lose my card?"
I was thinking about that guy after we talked, I hope he was joking or else he is a major loser!!!

<Embedded StdOleLink>

Jeff, 

If you have the tracking number for the financial info you sent, I can track it down this morning.  Let me know.

Thanks,

Kim

Any word on BHP copper?  We have a couple of days to determine whether we can transact with them or not.  Right now, they are only looking at Bal Aug, Sep, and Oct San Juan.

Let me know

Thanks,

Kim

What's up with this?  they are looking to lock in 12-16 months of gas prices.  We have been selling to them month to month for 6 months.  Have there been any problems?  Are we going to let them go to Amoco?

Will advise as to any netting benefits we may get regarding gas/power deals with Smurfit.  For now, the gas team does not want to take on any incremental risk with Smurfit from the physical gas perspective.

We can still look at case-by-case physical power deals with EPMI given the collateral that we're holding.

Tracy

Tracy,
	Talked to Tanya regarding the long deal for SSCC and relayed to her your suggestion for handling gas.  She is ok with managing both gas and power through EPMI as long as legal is on board and all necessary EPMI docs are in place or amended (netting, physical gas), and that we are comfortable with the receivables risk to SSCC.  She actually mentioned that there has been discussions about merging EPMI and ENA into one entity to more properly handle net positions, so she seems to like your idea.  
	With that, I guess I'll pass this deal and legal relationship onto you unless you need or want me to help with any of this.  

Thanks,
Max

I just talked to Jay and he doesn't want to do a long term deal with them.  I have a call in to the consultant.  Max Jay might agree to is 3 months.

I don't know - maybe we should talk to Ann Bike.  I guess it should go in as an annuity.  Would you like for me to talk to Ann?

Hey Kim,

I need to see about getting the fee due to John Cogan entered in Sitara.  Should I contact Kim Olinger on this?  Please let me know ASAP

Thanks
Darla

I would love to - I really like going to the movies but never seem to make it!  Only one stipulation though - we don't go see planet of the apes!  I heard it was REALLY bad - possibly the worst movie ever made.

No innuendos at all, i just did not realize my cumulative rudeness!  Would you like to go to a movie some time this week or weekend?  

I'm quite sure - but I don't understand your email.  Are you insinuating that I was being dramatic?  Not what I intended at all!  

That I did not realize.  Are you sure?  Well, then, perhaps I could coerce you into seeing Apocolpse Now Redux or some other theatrical event?

PJH

It was fun - you missed out.  How could anything be more important than dinner @ vanny's?  especially when she made a cake!  You realize that that was the third time I've asked you to do something and you have said no.........

Oh that's right.  Glad you had fun.  How was Vanny's dinner?

Was in Memphis for the weekend.  It was lots of fun - saw a lot of my friends, hung out with my neice.

I would be but I already have plans.  I would like to do something later in the week though.  Were you in town this weekend?  My bro, sis in law and nephew were in all weekend and we had fun.  A lot of golf and some swimming with the little man.

PJH

Any interest in a bar-b-q at Suzanne's tonight?
Kim and I are having people over for dinner tonight at my house.  We are going to throw something on the grill, drink some cold beer and enjoy the Houston humidity.  Let me know if you are able to make it.

Could you do me a huge favor and have Vito give Jay Williams of our credit department a call.  Jay is having trouble getting through the pohone lines to you guys for some reason.  Jay has tried to track down some financial information internally and has had no luck and doesn't know where else to look.  His number is 713-345-3923.  I really do appreicate you passing this message along.

Thanks,

Kim

Ann will be calling you today and will set this deal up for you.  I am assuming this is for the June payment.

Kim

I called her earlier this week and haven't heard back from her.  I guess you could probably talk more sensibly about it , so if you'd call her that'd be great. Just let me know the outcome.

I will try to find out and let you know.

Would the contract be with Citizens or Gelber?  I have tried numerous times in the past to get an ISDA with Citizens but their corporate leaders have always been hesitant to enter into derivative transactions.

C

Hey Chris,

I don't know what these gelber guys have in mind but I thought You might be interested.  I have been working on an ISDA for about 3 weeks.  what do you think they want to do with power?  Call me when you have a minute and let me know if you want to be involved.

Kim
Kim,
 
We are very interested in putting in place  an ISDA for weather derivatives, power, and natural gas transactions in regards  to Citizens Communications.  Please get with me as to Enron's interest no  later than Monday, April 23rd.  There is also some opportunity to do  physical power purchase and sales with Citizen's.  It might be worthwhile  for you to set up a meeting with you, me, and the appropriate power guy (Mike  Grigsby?).
 
Hope all is well.

Take care and keep in touch!

Kim,  how was Sat. night?  I didn't get finished at the Redbirds game until
10:30.  I couldn't have showered, changed and arrived before 11:45.  Didn't
think there was much of a chance anything was still going on at that time.
Hope all went well.  Bring me up to speed as to what went on.  Look forward
to hearing from you.

I will be out October 17 - 19th.

I've got Travis on the phone RIGHT NOW with Hesco info.  I want to conference you in

This is ok with me - I take it we have used the "long form" with them in the past.  If this is the case, can we get an isda draft together for them? 

Thanks,

Larry,
	Yesterday I noticed a small collar executed with the above entity.  We have no legal documents with this CP so would like to send out credit in the confirm.  There is little exposure to this CP, but I'd still like to cover the bases.  Please advise if this is ok with you.

Ann & Darla,

I am attaching a spreadsheet that details what should be booked and billed to Citizens under the NEW gas daily call option/transport deal to serve the Griffith plant.  It is somewhat complicated but don't be scared - I will help both of you understand what needs to be done.  Hopefully, we can set up a procedure whereby this deal can be taken care of each month.

I think we should set up a meeting to discuss.  Let me know when you guys are available - hopefully sometime monday.

Thanks,

Thought you might enjoy a little humor from some  children who know more about relationships than some adults. 

What do most people do on a date? 

Dates are for having fun, and people should use them  to get to know each other.  Even boys have something to say if you listen  long enough.

--Lynette, age 8 

On the first date, they just tell each other lies,  and that usually gets them interested enough to go for a second date. --Martin,  age 10

What would you do if a date was not working  out?  

I'd run home and play dead.  --Craig, age   

When is it okay to kiss someone? 

When they're rich. --Pam,age 7 

The law says you have to be eighteen, so I wouldn't  want to mess with that.  
--Curt, age   

The rules goes like this:  If you kiss someone,  then you should marry them and have kids with them.  It's the right thing  to do. --Howard, age 8

How would the world be different if people weren't  married? 

There sure would be a lot of kids to explain,  wouldn't there?  --Kelvin, age 8 

What is the right age to get married?  

No age is good to get married at.  You got to be  a fool to get married.  --Freddie, age 6 

Is it better to be single or married?  

It's better for girls to be single but not for  boys.  Boys need someone to clean up after them.  
--Anita, age 9 

I don't know which is better, but I'll tell you one  thing, I'm never going to have sex with my wife.  I don't want to be all  grossed out. --Theodore, age 8

How do you decide who to marry? 

You got to find somebody who likes the same  stuff.  Like if you like sports, she should like it that you like sports,  and she should keep the chips and dip coming.  --Alan, age 10

No person really decides before they grow up who  they're going to marry. God decides it all way before, and you get to find out  later who you're stuck with. --Kirsten, age 10

How can a stranger tell if two people are  married? 

You might have to guess, based on whether they seem  to be yelling at the same kids. --Derrick, age 8 

What do your mom and dad have in  common? 

Both don't want any more kids.  --Lori, age   

How would you make a marriage work?  

Tell you wife that she looks pretty even if she looks  like a truck. --Ricky, age 10 

Ellen,

Palo Alto is telling me that they need Enron signatures on all of the confirms that we sent them last week.  If you could print out copies and have them sent to me, I can get Barry to sign them and overnight them to Palo.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Karla,

We are printing the confirms and signing them this morning and will fax them to you soon after.  If a faxed signed copy is not ok, please let me know and we will send you originals overnight.

Thanks,

Tahnsk you for sending the needed confirmations.  I am told by my risk
manager, that I need an Enron signature on each confirm.  Please resend  the
confirms for gas post the Transaction Agreement with an Enron signature.
Thanks.

Attached is a revised form of Collateral Assignment (this version provides Enron with a security interest in the marketer's Gas Purchase Agreement with the generator, and is marked to show changes from the last version that the marketer reviewed), as well as a draft of the consent to assignment that we would ask the generator to sign.

I did run across some missing NSP deals for June and July and some price mismatches for a couple of NSP deals for July.  

For June, 3000/day priced at $4.70 and fior July. 3,100/day priced at $4.79.  Also, I am resending you July and the Yellow highlights show the two deals that I don't agree with the price.

I have revised the spreadsheet I have been sending you with the fixed prices for the citizens deal.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to see additional enhancements.  As deals are done, I will continue to update this spreadsheet.

Thanks,

Kim

 

Steve,

Attached is a term sheet describing our proposal for September.  The changes are highlighted in yellow.  One of the things you guys might be interested in looking at long term is extending the current fixed price deals that you have and blending the price.  Another is a peaking option or cap.  We can talk about these things on the phone.
Give me a call when you have a chance to review the term sheet and let me know what you guys want to do.

Funny - I get an email from you and Keith Aaron on the same day!  Not much going on - just settling down and staying home a while since I traveled non-stop June and July.  I have planned to go to Aruba in October (16th - 20) and then to St. Martin etal in January.Come to Aruba and bring friends.  We are staying at the Allegra Resort all-inclusive.  But we are somewhat boring - sun, san, surf, and a few suds.

Let me know what else is going on!  Oh, yeah - my home email address is kward1@houston.rr.com.  My boss is nosy and reads my emails!

Take Care,

Kimmie

What's going on?  I had a minute and wanted to say hello.  What interesting
travel plans do you have in the near future?  If it is anything fun, kidnap
me and take me with you.  I need a serious break!  Just wanted to say HI!

Ann,

Would you be able to meet this afternoon (2:00) with my self and Janine Cashin to discuss the first Palo Alto invoice and what is in the system for July?  It shouldn't take very long - maybe 15-20 minutes.  Please let me know

Thanks,

Kim

Kim -
I looked over the spreadsheet and I am available this afternoon around 2:00 PM and tomorrow afternoon.  Please let me know when you are available.  You may want to include Patti and/or Ann when we meet since they would drive any Sitara changes that will have to be made.

Janine,

Attached is a new spreadsheet detailing what Palo Alto's July invoice should include.  However, I would like to get together with you again to go over the information that you have and have some of the volumes in the system corrected.  Please give me a call when you are ready to work on this invoice and we can get together then.  I am available for the rest of the week.

Thanks,

Kim

 

Lou,

We are working up some prices for you today.  I will call you when we have those numbers.  Let me know if you need anything else in the mean time.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim: 
        It's been a little while  since I last spoke to you (about the call option), but I'm checking if you have  a refreshed price for a 39 months firm gas supply at the PG&E Citygate  to run from 6/1/03-8/31/06.  The volume would be at least 5,000  dth/day.  I'd also like to see the indicative prices of a "no-cost" collar  for this time period; for example, if I'm interested in a ceiling at  $5.00, would the floor price be $3.75/dth, $4.00/dth?  The call  options premiums were just too expensive.
 
    If you have any  questions, give me a call.  And thanks again for all your  help.

Lyndon,

I finally got my CDs back yesterday and I was so happy!  Thanks again for making sure that they were sent to Miami.  How are you?  Where are you?  where have you been?  Since I have to sit in this office everyday staring at a computer screen, I must live vicariously through people like you!  I'm actually not traveling until mid september.  I go to Denver on sept. 8 - 10 and then to Southern California the following week.  October brings Arizona, Aruba, and perhaps northern california.  Looking forward to Aruba - don't really care about the rest since they are work!!  Anyway - hope all is well with you and that you are enjoying yourself - wherever you might be!

Take care,

K2

Karla,

The confirmation group will resend the confirms and it does look like we will need you guys to sign them and fax them back to us.  Our fax number is listed below.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim,

Sure, we can refax the confirmations - Richard, please take care of this. 

Yes, we should get them to sign and fax them back to us - our fax number is 713-646-4816.

Ellen,

Palo Alto asked me to refax the confirms that we recently sent because they had problems with their fax machine.  Also, do we need to have them sign the confirms and send them back to us?  If so, I need to l let them know.

thanks for your help,

Kim

Barry wants to know the credit status post the financial info I gave you yesterday.  he is meeting with Mark Baldwin on Thursday and wants to prepare.

K.

Jay is looking at updated financial information we received yesterday but I haven't heard from him.  Stacy is working on a Master Draft as well as the other documents we received from them.  Her ETA as of this morning is this afternoon.  Basically, jay is ok with using the GISB for up to three months if Stacy is ok with it.  He said that he would require a master for a 6 month transaction or longer.  

Will update you as soon as I get more info from Credit and Legal.

kw

Kim, what is the status of paper and credit with the DWR. Are we negotiating the credit terms.  Who are the lead players for ENA. Jay ?, Stacey? 

BT 

Willis,

I just got off of the phone with my credit guy - He says that most of the people on this list are not public companies.  It would be very helpful and will expedite the process if you could get the latest audited financial statements, with notes, from each of these companies.  With the PG&E thing, credit is swamped, but, if I had the info in hand, I could push our cause.

Thanks,

Kim

Hope this helps

Going to Scottsdale Wednesday night for a little sun, spa, and relaxation!   Have fun in Houston -

i'm still here. we'll have to wait and see to see how it affects us. we have
our own credit rating, so technically it should not affect us. but it's the
perception more than anything when your name is attached to pg&e. i'll keep
you posted. are you ready for easter ? do you guys have off friday. i'm
coming home on friday. it's going to be one of those church weekends. church
friday and saturday night. then dinner at my moms on sunday.

Still employed?  How are you affected by this bankruptcy news?

Here is Pasadena's nomination summary for Sept.  Let me know if you need anything else!

Thanks,

Kim

Kim, Jan, Suzanne, and Tori-
 
The total nomination for month of September 2001 is 17,027MMBtu per day.  This odd number is made up of the sum of the following:
 
1. 4,027MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Malin (net, after PG&ENW  losses 4,135MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa@ $7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
5. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;
6. 2,000MMBtu/day under two July - October separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
7. 2,000MMBtu/day under the latest July - Ocober fixed contract; and
8  2,500MMBtu/day under a Q3 contract @ $8.925/MMBtu that we had forgotten about earlier...
 
 
Losses on the PG & E line have increased from August 2001 to 2.57%.  We have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day) at this time.
 
We are still waiting (and waiting, and waiting) for, and fully expect, temperatures and thus generation to rise next month.  One steam unit (Broadway 3) is on line and a second one, Broadway 2, is off and on during the month.
 
If you have any questions, please contact me.
 
Thanks.

Hi Steve,

Just wanted to update the status with the ISDA.  I believe that you have received a copy of the new draft with all of the changes that we've agreed to.  If you guys approve of this draft, we can have an executable copy drawn up and sent to you.  As for the outside council opinion, Sara Shackleton is out of the office until next tuesday and her assistant doesn't know how to proceed with this process.  We will have to wait for Sara's return in order to facilitate that process.  I have sent her an email so that we can get started right away.

Let me know if there is anything else that you need from me or if you have any questions.  I do hope you are able to enjoy the long weekend!

Thanks,

Kim

Sara,

Marie was able to incorporate the changes to Glendale's ISDA and send them a final draft.  I am waiting to hear from them to send them an executable copy.  Marie did not know how to proceed with obtaining the outside council opinion.  Could we start that process when you return?  I think that is the only thing we are waiting for.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Hi guys,

Just wanted to let you know that Palo Alto received some confirmations for transactions that they should not have received.  I think both are related to their term third party purchases that were entered into the system.  One was for 1500, which I think is related to their purchase from BP and one was for 1135 which are third party purchases from us and should already be in the system as several sale transactions to them.  I can fax copies of these confirms if anyone is interested.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim 

Let me know when you find out.  Have a good day!

K.

Yeah, I pretty much need brakes.  Just do not want to spend $100 just bc I misplaced a set!

Should know about the runoffs by tomorrow.

PJH

I think you need brakes!  Especially if you plan on winning lots of races!  So are you telling me that your car doesn't have all of its brakes?  Have you found out if you are going to the race you might have enough points to go to yet? (I can't remember what it is called - sorry)

K.

I cannot believe you ate the leftovers.  I had them on the brain last night!

Hard work on the car is done, except that I have misplaced a set of brake pads which is driving me nuts.  I'm not sure I even need brakes....hmm.   :-)  

Hey - my Monday was good, too.  I have a truck load of stuff to take to goodwill - and a lot more work to do!  It is amazing how much junk I own!  I want to get rid of it all! How's the car?  Ready to race?  Went back to Suzanne's for left overs and a movie.  We watched "The Gift".  It was really creepy!

How was your Monday?  Mine was productive.  Worked on car most of day and went swimming with LP and Sara.

I left you a message but wanted to send you a note too.  I am still waiting you your recommendations for improving Hesco's contracts with their customers so that we can continue to pursue business with them.  they are consistantly presenting us with opportunities that we are missing out on.  I am currently pricing up a deal for 1200/day for 1 year.  They want to transact by mid next week.  Is it possible to make these recommendations so that we can get this paperwork in place?

Let me know how things look for you as soon as possible.

PG&E City Gate is the delivery point and lets start out with $.05.

Also, what is the location for the original swap, and how much orig do you want on the extend piece?

Thanks!

Kelli,

I sold a swap to Merced for 2,040/d that goes through Feb 03 for $7.85.  Can we look at a blend & extend that starts Jan. 02 and we would extend our deal out to Dec. 05?

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Jason,

I need your help on 2 EASY things -

1)  I have been discussing fixed price baseload gas for United Technologies @ PG&E City Gate for June 2003 through July 2006.  United Technologies is a subsidiary of United Airlines.  What do I need to get from them to satisfy your credit requirments?  And once we get that, I would like to send them a Master Draft to be prepared to transact when/if the time comes.

2)  THIS IS REAL DEAL:  Merced Irrigation District.  They are looking to purchase gas, 2040/d, at PG&E City Gate for March 03 through Dec 2005.  I gave them an indication of $3.85.  I also am having structuring price up a blend and extend to blend the gas we sold to them Mar 01 - Feb 03 @ $7.85.  Where are we with respect to credit with them and what would credit require in order to do either one of these deals?  They were concerned about what credit would require.  

Please let me know as soon as possible!  I haven't bugged you much lately and I don't want to go to credit jail!

Thanks,

Kim

Sure!!  Jeff at Merced said to tell you not to stay late!!  

Thanks,

Kim

Kim,

I'm working on finishing this up - can I get you the price tomorrow morning?

In addition to reviewing our Q3 gas and power portfolios, we are currently
assessing various new local generation resources.

As part of our assessment, it would be quite helpful to have a relatively
current forward curve for NYMEX gas, CA Border gas, and SP15 electricity.
Could you provide monthly data for 12-18 months and annual data for 5-10
years for forward transactions?
This doesn't necessarily need to be today's curve, as long as it is recent
and the prices are from the same point in time.

Also, please provide current SP15 and Border gas quotes for Q3 and 12-month
strip.

I just got your documents.  Call me.

No problem - left a message for Steve Lins but never heard from him.  Will probobly send him an email today.  Thanks,

Kim

Kim:  FYI - I am still trying to locate ENA's California outside counsel.  Thanks for your patience.  Sara

Sara,

Marie was able to incorporate the changes to Glendale's ISDA and send them a final draft.  I am waiting to hear from them to send them an executable copy.  Marie did not know how to proceed with obtaining the outside council opinion.  Could we start that process when you return?  I think that is the only thing we are waiting for.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to help.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

We are going to get thsi Merced deal done!

Are you going to send the letter our or email it or do I need to do anything?

thanks for your help,

Kim

Kim, 
Unfortunately, all of the provisions I put in my letter are needed.  I did not put in any "nice to have but not needed"  provisions.

Stacy

Stacy,

This looks good to me.  Are there any of these issues that we would be flexible on?

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Kim, 
Please review the letter and let me know what you think.

Call or come by when you get a chance - I have a question on the blend & extend

Thanks,

Kim

Go to www. unitedcogen.com

Steve,

It appears as though the outside council opinion is no longer keeping us from completing the ISDA.  If you guys are ok with the current language, we can send you an executable copy and you guys can sign and send back with all of the documents that are required according to the ISDA.  We are prepared to provide you with our documents and will send them with the executable copies of the ISDA.

Call me when you get a chance and let me know what your status is.  I think Barry and I will be in So. California the 17th and 18th.  If you have some time, we would like to stop by and see you guys.  Just let me know when you are available. 

Thanks,

Kim

Gentlemen,

  As you know, I have been working with Steve Lins to negotiate the ISDA agreement so that Enron and the City of Glendale are able to enter into financial transactions.  I spoke with Steve today and he plans to review our latest draft and get back to me with any final changes so that we can send him an executable copy, along with our required documents, for signature next week.  In other words, I am confident that we will have an executed ISDA within the next couple of weeks.

  My boss, Barry Tycholiz, and I are going to be in southern California September 17 & 18 and would like to set up a meeting with you guys to discuss alternatives to swaping out some of your index priced gas supply.  We are available to meet with you after 2 pm on the 17th or at any time on the 18th.  Please let me know when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  

We look forward to meeting with you and expanding our business with the City of Glendale.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
Manager, West Gas Origination

Mike,

I have attached an indicative terms sheet for full-requirements gas supply.  It is similar to the initial proposal that I have made to other municipalities in northern California.  However, many changes were made and negotiated based on several factors.  Some of those factors include the types of customers behind your city gate (residential, power generation), what your load profile is correlated to (weather), transport owned, and other services requested.  Also, the type of pricing you are looking for can affect the structure.  Call me on Tuesday and we can talk about the City of Roseville more specifically.  (I will be out Monday)

Have a great weekend!  I hope this is helpful.

Kim 

 

Sara,

I am in Denver at an offsite but will be back in the office tomarrow.  Glendale left me a message on Friday that they are ready for an executable ISDA agreement.  I left you a message earlier but wanted to make sure you got it.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  My cell phone number is 713-412-4571.

Thanks,

Kim

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

I have been trying to get an ISDA going with Enron for several months. Who
is the best contact to call?

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Thanks,

Did we rebook the volumes for Palo and book the third party supply deals at Malin?  Let me know where we stand.

Thanks!

Mike

Stephanie and I talked about this as well - I think lunch today would be a good send off and a wedding gift on his return would be in order.  

Guys, has there been any arrangements made for a send off for Phil.... 

We need to get him a card and a wedding gift ( I assume you would agree).

I would also be more than happy to take the group out for lunch 11:30 - 1:00  if people are interested. 

Pls advise.

Hey Lyndon!  Very glad to finally hear from you.  Sounds like you are happy=
 back in Austrailia!  I would love to see it sometime.  Unless things chang=
e between now and January, some of us are suppose to be on the Poly on Janu=
ary 6th.  We have booked our trip and the pictures of the beaches on St. Ma=
rtin look fabulous.  We are going in on the 3rd to stay a few days before w=
e get on the boat.  I hope you are there.  Although I would understand if y=
ou stayed where you are!  Keep me posted on your plans - whether you stay i=
n Austrailia or go back to work on the Poly.

As for the recent tragedies here, I am so very lucky that no one really clo=
se to me was killed.  I actually flew in from Denver on Monday night, just =
in time not to get stuck there.  One of my very good friends was suppose to=
 be in the WTC, worked on the 105th floor of tower one on monday and was ca=
lled back to Houston for a meeting tuesday.  Flew out of Laguardia at 7:30 =
am tuesday morning.  That meeting saved his life.  I am so glad that he had=
 that meeting.  I would have been devasted if something had happened to him=
.  However, all of the people in their offices there are missing.  He is ve=
ry sad but greatful to be alive.  It does make you think about what you are=
 doing with your life and what is important but I don't think it will make =
me stop traveling or doing the things that I love to do.  It is sad that th=
is thing has already affected our freedom, some more so than others.  Most =
things won't be as easy as they once were - but I guess that ease and freed=
om were taken for granted.  I also can't believe that someone could come in=
 and do so much harm to innocent people.  And I don't know what should be d=
one to stop such things from happening in the future.  Can I just run away =
to the beach and ignore it?  It's a good thing that not everyone has that a=
ttitude! =20

Anyway,  I am glad to hear that you are well and having fun.  I am doing th=
e same - just here in ugly Houston for now!  I think that my trip to Aruba =
for October has changed so I better get something planned before the end of=
 the year!   Please let me know if you are back in the states and if you go=
 back to the Poly.  Oh, and thanks for the picture!

Take care,

Love, K2

ps.  I have another email address at home.  It is kward1@houston.rr.com

To my lovely K2,

Sorry I haven't written in a while but life has been
passing by so fast that I rarely know what day it is.
I hope that you and any friends or family were not
hurt in any of the attacks on the USA. It's just
unbelievable that someone could hold so much hatred
for others that they would do these things. It's
beyond my realm of understanding.
I hope life is treating you well and you are safe.
As for me I am back a home and trying to decide
whether or not to leave and go back to work. I am
supposed to go back to the poly on the 7th Oct but
don't really want to leave home. It's so beautiful
here, and I am a little worried about the next war
that is going to happen. Worried for all hatred and
sadness that it is going to cause. Its really got me
thinking about living more in the present rather than
planning ahead, not that I have had much forethought
to begin with but something to think about.
I have some photos for you that should be attached to
this email.
Again I hope you are well and still loving this life.

Take Care

Love Lyndon

An EFO is a result of parties not complying with an OFO after multiple noti=

The same rules apply to an EFO as an OFO.  EFO stands for Emergency flow or=

=09I have removed the red-line from the above document.  If it is in order,=
 please print 2 originals, have them signed, and forward to me for signatur=

 to handle a trade with Palo Alto, and I will also have  a certificate of i=

 fully executed contract for your files.
=09Regarding the OFO language, usually the pipeline notifies its customers =
of the OFO event and leave it to those customers to notify their parties.  =
Therefore, if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and your=
 transporter declares an OFO, you will get notice and be responsible for gi=

   I am not familiar with the concept of EFO, but do not think that  the OF=

Kim,

I met with the lovely Bruno Jeider last week.  If I were to characterize him, I would have to say that he reminds me of Schultz from "Hogan's Heroes".  He sees nothing.  He knows nothing.

I asked him about SCE's impending bankruptcy.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him about his gas/power positions.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him about Burbank's power plant development.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him if he knew how to please a woman.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

In short, if you plan to meet with Burbank, make sure your meeting includes their traders.

Laird

so what does this guy do for Burbank and why do they pay him the "big bucks"????

  Kim: I just wanted to touch base to see if you received the RFP. I am
trying to see who is interested
          in our gas service at this time for next September. Thanks.
      Jim  

Jay,

We have been short listed on an rfp for Noresco, a power plant developer.  Attached are the financial statement for the parent who is willing to guarantee the project.  They plan to refresh prices and perhaps transact this week.  they have received contracts from other potential suppliers already.  I got the RFP late and therefore, I am running behind.  I am attaching my proposal in case you need it.  It will basically be a full requirements transaction out of our Socal Pool for up to 20 years.

CAN WE MAKE THIS OUR NUMBER 1 PRIORITY AND GET CONTRACTS TO THEM TODAY??  PLEASE?  I WILL SUPPLY BEVERAGES LATER IN THE WEEK OR PERHAPS A TICKET TO ASTROS TONIGHT (if I can find them!)  

Please call and let me know if we can make this hurdle!

thanks,

Kim

I don't know how well your weekend was, but do I need to be looking for a new back-up?  That is, when I am 50 and single, will you still be there?

Chris,

The package you sent me was delayed due to weather - I should get it in am.

Good morning!  Got your message last night when I got home from the game.  Didn't want to wake you up.  How was your day yesterday?  Mine was very busy - lots of things going on.  Hopefully some tickets and $$$ will come out of all of it!  Anyway - I hope you have a good day today!  Talk to you later -

K.

That is very cool!!  Sounds like Tom did great - too bad we weren't there to watch.  And it is great that you get some $ for going!   Just think - with your awesome new car next year - you could be up there with Jimmy and that other guy!  I could grab dinner or something later - when are you planning to go to Tom's?  I have nothing going on - may try to get a quick workout in.  You can just let me know what you want to do.

K.

ps.  I told Suzanne that I got to drive the race car and it was really cool!

BTW, Tom drove from 12th to 6th in his race.   Very impressive.  Also, Kramer told me yesterday that the SCCA tow fund is paying us $600 each.  Yeah!  It goes to the top 3 guys that go and there were only 3 guys from our region!  Also, did you know Jimmy won close to 10k for getting 2nd?  Spicer (winner) got something like 13k in cash and trinkets.

Cool!

K.

I think I would like santa clara first.  when you get the chance.

Ok - what is your timing on this and the Santa Clara (which one would you like first....)  Thanks!

Remember the collar spread that we looked at for tucson electric?  Can we reopen that when you guys have time?  They want to look at the entire calendar 02.  Please let me know of any questions.

Thanks,

Phil,

Thanks,

Kim Ward
Manager, West Gas Origination

 Kim, here is your draft for Noresco. Call me if you have any questions. I realize the name is wrong on the file I will change this, it is correct in the contract.

Mike,

Attached are Palo Alto's historical loads, which have been verified with Palo Alto.  If you would like to see a different format, let me know.

Thanks,

I am showing some physical and financial transactions to the city of Santa Clara, also known as Silicon Valley Power.  We have done a lot of business with them on the power side and I want to sell them some gas.  Can we review them and send out a draft Enfolio and Isda? 

Let me know if you have any quesitons.

Thanks,

Kim

what do you guys think about this one?  Jay, we have talked about them before I think.  Can I get a response in order to put this away or pursue?

thanks,

Kim
Kim,

We spoke last week about a possible 5 yr gas deal for our Yuba City plant.
Below is our RFP.  I'll call to discuss.

Thanks, Paul Cummins
916-996-2291 cell
916-447-5171 work

Request for Proposal ("RFP")
Yuba City Cogeneration Partners, LP
650 Bercut Drive, Suite C
Sacramento, CA  95814

Background.  Yuba City Cogeneration Partners, LP ("YCC") is the owner of a 49
megawatt cogeneration facility ("Facility") in Yuba City, California.  YCC
sells its 49 megawatts to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. ("PG&E"), an entity
that recently filed for bankruptcy protection.  YCC recently entered into a
five-year, fixed-price electricity agreement with PG&E, and YCC desires to
enter into a long-term Natural Gas Supply Agreement ("NGSA") with an
appropriate supplier ("Seller") of natural gas.  The NGSA shall be subject to
approval of the YCC project lenders, and YCC will only be able to enter into
the NGSA after bankruptcy court approval of the five-year, fixed-price
electricity agreement with PG&E. As a result, YCC will require a daily update
to proposals it receives (to account for varying market conditions) until it
receives all necessary approvals to enter into a final NGSA.

Term. The term sheet contemplates either a three-year natural gas supply
agreement or a five-year natural gas supply agreement.  Under either term,
the starting date will be tentatively August 1, 2001, subject to the
necessary approvals.

Point(s) of Delivery.  PG&E City Gate.

Annual Volumes.  For the purposes of this RFP, it is assumed that the
Facility will consume monthly and annual gas volumes under one of three
different operating scenarios:

    Scenario        Annual Volume, mmBtu

       1                1,210,000

The typical, historical daily usage at the Facility has been 6,000 mmBtu/day,
except periods of maintenance or reduction by the Facility due to the
satisfaction of capacity requirements under its power purchase agreement
("PPA") with PG&E, and the typical, monthly historical usage has been based
upon a Monday through Friday operation.  Scenario 1 is indicative of plant
operations for the satisfaction of the minimum requirements of the PPA,
essentially 80%.

YCC would prefer a NGSA that is based upon annual volumes in a rolling
12-month period.

Monthly Balancing.  Monthly balancing on the PG&E system shall be the
Seller's responsibility, subject to the limitations of the YCC's natural gas
transportation agreement with PG&E, and subject to the PG&E gas system rules
and tariffs.  Seller shall be responsible for any gas imbalance charges
incurred on the PG&E System.

Usage Estimates.  For the purpose of assisting Seller in the Nomination
process, YCC shall make usage estimates in advance and as usage occurs.
Seller should specify requested frequency of usage estimates.

Monthly True-Up.  Actual usage at the Facility will almost certainly be of
some variance to the forecasted monthly gas volumes.  Seller shall propose a
means of "true-ing up" the actual usage to the forecasted monthly volumes.
The ideal system of true-ing up would allow for flexibility to both YCC and
Seller ("the Parties") under the following minimum circumstances:

1. True-up of variance between forecasted usage and actual, if any.

2. If gas price volatility has created daily or other market pricing that
creates financial incentive to the Parties to curtail deliveries to the
Facility and remarket the natural gas to the spot or other market.

3. Allowance for the Facility to curtail deliveries for planned or unplanned
maintenance.

Monthly true-up may incorporate resolution of the differences between price
and volume.

Day of Nomination.  The date of Nomination of daily gas volumes by the Seller
to the PG&E City Gate shall be at the option of, and as determined by Seller,
subject to the limitations of YCC's natural gas transportation agreement with
PG&E, and subject to the PG&E gas system rules and tariffs.

Maximum Daily Nomination Quantity:  YCC's natural gas transportation
agreement with PG&E allows for a maximum daily nomination quantity of 9,550
MMbtu/Day.

Price.  YCC seeks a NGSA that will provide a physical price hedge via three
alternative strategies.  The strategies are as follows:

Strategy        Price Hedge

       1            Fixed price for the term.
       2            Floating price, with a not-to-exceed cap.
       3            Floating price, with a minimum and maximum price.

YCC acknowledges that other hedging strategies exist and may be advisable for
the NGSA.  The Seller is encouraged to supply a proposal that incorporates
other strategies.

Credit and Payment Terms.  YCC can offer the following credit and payment
mechanisms for the purpose of removing credit and payment concern from the
Seller:

1. Semi-Monthly Payment. Semi-Monthly payment for gas based on expected
consumption over the first fifteen (15) calendar-day period of each month,
and the expected consumption over the balance of each month via a wire from
YCC to be made one day following the receipt of payments for electrical
energy from PG&E.

2. Priority payment.  YCC has an agreement with its lender that costs of fuel
shall have first priority in the waterfall of cash flows, i.e. the fuel
supplier shall be paid from project cash flows prior to the payment of all
other costs incurred, including repayment of debt, operations and maintenance
costs, management fees, etc.

RFP Response may be sent via fax to Paul Cummins @ 916-447-7602.  Please call
916-447-5171 for questions.

1) hesco additional collateral
2)Noresco - they want to focus on 10 or 20 years - can we get there?  

I don't have their financials but lets get started on what we can get started with. I am not expecting to do financial swaps in the immediate term but I would like to be preparted when we are ready.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim -

You should probably hold off on the financial trading for now.  Santa Clara is a municipal entity, and until Legal has scrubbed them for authorization to trade financially, we can't do anything with them.  As you know, this is not a quick endeavor.

I can start working on a Master Physical right away, though.  Do you have updated financial info from them?

JRW

I am showing some physical and financial transactions to the city of Santa Clara, also known as Silicon Valley Power.  We have done a lot of business with them on the power side and I want to sell them some gas.  Can we review them and send out a draft Enfolio and Isda?

Thanks,

Steve,

Attached is a term sheet showing price indications for the products that we talked about.  The market it down today so they may appear to be a little high.  I am still working on a structure term sheet for the pipeline capacity that we breifly discussed.  Please give me a call and we can update these prices for you or we can adjust the structures if these are not the products that fit your needs.

I would like to be prepared in the case that we are able to put physical or financial transactions together.  In order to do so, we would like to put both a physical purchase/sale agreement and perhaps an ISDA master swap agreement in place.  One thing we would need is someone to contact for financial or credit information so that we can insert the appropriate credit language in the contract drafts that we send to you.

Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be in touch with the transport structure.

Thanks,

when is the meeting and where?

thanks,

Kim

   

I have set up a meeting to discuss invoicing for City of Pasadena for February production going forward. Tori Kuykendall is no longer
involved in that deal and will no longer be invoicing. Kim Ward will explain the structure of the deal to all of us and it is my goal that
the traders will not be involved in creating invoices. Let me know if you will be unable to attend. Thanks. 

Just talked to Noresco again and they are trying to get a handle on the credit requirements that we have so that they can be prepared.  They want to do a 20 year, fixed price transaction with 10 % swing at that price.  All other gas outside the 10% swing will be priced at Gas Daily +/- $.05.  We are adding a $.25 premium on the 10% swing and the baseload is approximately 1000/day.  If the credit requirements are different for a 10year deal, they would like to see what those are - that might sway them.

Jay, I know I have been bugging you about this but I do need it in order to go forward with trying to get this deal.  And they have asked me for this credit information twice today.  It's all about you!!

Thanks a million for your help!

Kim

no.  I will try to investigate today.
Kim:

Are you aware of what's going on here.
 
C
We need to be more diligent.  I sent the request and notified all via e-mail (see below).  Please be sure we follow through.     -Craig
 
Craig,
 
In the month of August, EPME nominated the requested volumes to 9JZ2 (Citizen's San Juan Pool Contract).  The nomination was not confirmed by your operations group, thus the nominated volume was reduced to zero.  To answer your question, I recommend confirming the gas EPME nominates.  If you have any questions about the nominating procedure, please contact Jason Kelm (713-420-6038).  In regards the month of September, the first day the gas was confirmed was 9-8-01.  So far, 10,313 mmbtus have been delivered.
 
 
Robert Mitravich   

I sent the message below at the end of August and the one below that at the end of July.  

The only problem is that NO gas was scheduled during August and I can't find any gas for September!  Now the imbalance has grown larger instead of smaller!!  

I also need gas for October.  What do I need to do to get this scheduled and confirmed for October?

They are forwarding the name and number of a financial/credit guy from Noresco as soon as they can.  They asked for a ball park and I could not help them.  Would it make a difference if we did 20 year index (for baseload) with gs daily for the swing?  Due to credit requirements from others we are competeing with on this, they are considering an index with the supplier with Noresco doing an internal financial swap with a sister company, perhaps Equitable.  
what do you think?  I will keep you posted on discussions.

Thanks!

Kim

Antoher thing they brought up was locking in physical basis only.  How does this affect credit?

Thanks again,

Kim

Thanks Mike, we have left a message for Dave and are waiting to hear back from him.  Also, we are definitely willing to fix the physical basis for you and float on the Nymex.  And this will help your credit cause.  So now I am assuming that you guys are focusing on fixed basis for 1000/day with GD on the swing.  Would you guys be interested in looking at a transport structure for the first 18 months of the transaction?  I am looking at the economics of this to see if it will help you.  Call me if you need anything.

The answer about environmentalist making it hard to build power plants in california is YES.   Even with load growth and, asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up.  They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.

Environmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.  It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.  This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.  Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 4200 MWH to California.  Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.  The light WILL go out in Cali!!!!  

Kim

You seem to be up on current affairs associated with power.

 

Reference to the power crisis in California, did the whacko environmentalist have anything to do with it???  I am hearing that California has not built any power plants in the last 10 years due to environmentalist putting on too many restrictions.

 

One other question about the environmentalist trying to get rid of the hydroelectric dams in Washington State, will this lead to more power problems for California if they accomplish their goal?

 

Let me know? jp

Every time I pop up there you are huddled up and yappin w/Barry!

you goin?

you working out today?

Hello again, 

Now that air travel is somewhat back to normal, Barry and I are rescheduling our trip to Southern California.  It is my understanding that the ISDA itself has been executed and required attachments are in the process of being gathered.  Therefore, you will soon have the option of transacting with Enron financially.   We are available to meet with you at any time on October 11th.  Please let me know if and when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  

Again, we look forward to meeting with you and exploring new opportunities.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

ok, I was wondering if you came to work today.  I certainly didn't want to!  still sorry to hear about your deal.  I hope things get better!

You should pay me a visit this afternoon.  You might get a free watch!  come down the stairs and head towards 1oclock adn you will find me in the corner.

BTW, it turns out that the trader was just being an asshole and did not actually transact but was playing games with the structurer and caused the misunderstanding.  Although the result is the same since the trader is suddenly 'no bid'.  I guess he could even be lying about the transaction, but that would be pretty ballsy at this stage.

my friend Shannon is coming over at about 6:30 and we are going out - somewhere.  what are you doing?

yep,  what are you doing later?

still goin?

me thinks so

you goin?

you working out today?

Chris,

this looks good to me.  Stephanie is checking with Transwestern to see what their parking/lending fees would be for weekends, just for an idea.  I am also talking to the desk.  I will keep you posted.

Kim:

Please review and add anything you want and return.

John/Sean:

A few thoughts on the Griffith deal:

1.  Term:  PPL indicates they want to do the deal through 2003.  That is really 2003 - 2004 as it incldues Nov - Mar.  Extension until this time might require extension of our underlying deal.  This would be OK with us.
2.  Character of service:   The text indicates that PPL would have the right to request deliveries be made to an alternqate point on TW.  Why would they want this?  This could be a problem if we know the gas wouldn't flow as we would shut in puchases.  We would like to make this on a mutually acceptable basis.
3.  Pricing:  Does the reservation cahrge include variable transport?  I think that is what we proposed.  If not, then the Commodity rate flow needs to include the variable cost of  transport plus fuel.
4.  Conditions:  Noms must be in at 8:00 am.  This is very important and the a deal killer.  We need time to manage the position.  Also, the weekend issue needs to be addressed.  As we have discussed, weekends trade as the same quantity each day.  If they want to vary the daily amoount during the weekend and make Sunday higher than Sat or Monday, that is fairly ewaasy to deal with.  If they want to have lower takes on Sunday, this is more difficult ad increases costs.  We might be able to craft a solution to this however.

Chris

Do you think it would be beneficial for me to go to WSPP?

oops - it's ksward63

It was the leg's fault.  yahoo says kward63 is invalid??

I hope it was not because of me. I slept fine.  (Maybe you need some physical therapy!)  Anyway - trying to plan trips out west.  It is such a pain - I hate trying to get it all together to make it worthwhile.  If you ever want to IM me, my id on yahoo is kward63.  I hope you have a good day!

 Buenos dias to you.  I have yahoo.   Leg hurts.  Did not sleep so well.  

Good Morning!  How's the leg?  Do you have instant messenger of some kind?

K.

Chris,

Attached is my new and (in my opionion) improved spreadsheet for the citizens deal.  As you can see, there are slight differences between my calculations and John Cogans. the main issue is as follows:

1)Calculation of the spread - he is taking the greater of PG&E topock minus $.10 minus pipeline demand charges OR SJ + fuel.  This can create a negative spread value equal to pipeline commodity charges (which we are reimbursed for).  The results of all of this is mulitplied by $.085.  I am assuming that the floor for the spread is SJ, therefore, the spread = zero if it does turn out to be less than zero.

I hope you have time to review - Once this is fixed you are done - just collecting money.  I am working with Darla and Ann to get the orig granted.

thanks,

Kim

   

went this morning - did you go?

got your running shoes on?

Any word on Noresco?  Just got a call -

Darla,

Attached is a spreadsheet we prepared that details August business with Citizens regarding the Griffith deal.  Please use this to prepare your invoice.  Also, please inform me if they do not pay us by the due date.  John Cogan should not be paid until we get paid by Citizens.

Please call me and we can discuss the spreadsheet as there are cells that must be verified against the TW invoice as well as Sitara.  In addition to billing Citizens, the following entries need to be made each month:

1)  payment to John Cogan
2)  origination to Kim Ward and Chris Foster (50/50)
3)  payment to EARMS for the $.02 insurance Chris negotiated

These amounts are dealed in the last three columns of the spreadsheet.

There may be some updates to the spreadsheet that will create some prior adjustments but these should be ironed out soon.  Call me when you get a chance.

Thanks,

Kim

trying to see who is interested
          in our gas service at this time for next September. Thanks.
      Jim  

Jay, 

A couple of weeks ago I asked you to review the City of Las Cruces and let me know if we have an enfolio or if we have sent them a draft.  Could you let me know where we stand with that?  I need to respond to them by Monday, the 8th.

thanks,

Kim

PS  Also, I know you sent Debra a request for an Enfolio for IID but I never received a copy.  Did you?

Hi guys,

Could we provide a price indication to PNM for a physical call option (offer) for Cal 02 and Q3, 2002 for San Juan gas?  Let start with $.50 out of the money and $1.00 out of the money.  This would be a monthly option.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim, just for planning purposes, what would it cost to have a call option 
for year 2002 and for 3rd quarter of 2002 for 5,000 mmBtu's per day 
from the San Juan basin? 
Thanks 
Art Avalos 

Art,

We can price this up for you but I have a couple of questions -

1)  Is this physical or financial
2)  Is is a daily call or monthly call
3)  Would you like this priced at the money or $.50, $1.00 or more out of the money?  I other words, what do you want your cap to be?

Thanks,

Kim

ps  What is the schedule for the baloon fest the 10th - 12th?  I'm trying to work around some meetings etc.

Hi Jeff,

Laird gave me your name and number so that I can pass on notional price information that you asked for.  Let me know anytime you need to see our price indications and I will do what I can to help you.  I know that Laird has worked with you guys extensively.  The prices that he said you were looking at are listed below and are based on PG&E City gate prices:

Q4, 2001                			    $11.70
2 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2003		    $ 6.80
5 years - Jan. 2002-Dec 2006		    $ 5.85
Oct. 2001 - Dec. 2003	  		    $ 7.38

I tried to call but it was after hours for you.  Give me a call and let me know where you are with your gas supply negotiations and I will try to pick up where Laird left off.

Regards,

Kim Ward

Can you price that physical call for PNM at the money and $.50 out of the money instead of what I previously requested?

Thanks,

Kim

Art,

The premium for a monthly, physical, at the money call for Cal 02, 5000/day delivered @ San Juan would be $.48.  For Q3 only, the premium would be $.49.  I hope this is helpful. Let me know if you have questions or need anything else.  I will call you tomarrow about the balloon fest.

Thanks,

Kim

This is for physical gas for a monthly call at the money. 
The Balloon Fest schedule is Oct 10th (Wednesday evening) 
through noon Friday (Oct. 12th). 
Thanks, 
Art 

Hello again,

I talked to Mary Jo yesterday and exchanged emails with Tricia - looks like they are thinking of a girls weekend in Chicago Oct. 26 -28.  If Tricia didn't ask you for your address before, she needs it - as do I.  How does that look for you?  I can get a ticket right now for $188.  

I do wish you would come down here with Jeff sometime.  Of course I would want to have you for part of the time you were here!  Jeff could come too - we could go to dinner or I could have a bar-b-que or something!

Yes - I am still hanging out with Pete.  Things are good. He is very nice and lots of fun! 

Keep me posted on the girls weekend and I hope things are going well for you!

Love, Kim

Hey Miss Kim,

I'm glad that you're doing well. Crazy world we live in now... scary!! Tricia Tlapek sent me an e-mail... it looks like she may try and organize a girl's get together w/ Mary Jo - it would GREAT fun to meet up with you there!!!

Jeff's traveling a lot less than he was... I'm sure he'll be down to Houston again in the not-too-distant future though. I'll try and swing a weekend at some point when he's down there - it would be fun to meet up in Houston too!

I'm glad to hear from you and looking forward to meeting up with you soon. Are you still hanging out with Pete??? 

I hope you're well! Miss you!!!
Laura

Laura,

Just wanted to drop you a note to see how things are with you.  With the things that happened a couple of weeks ago, our travel has been put off for a while.  I am still trying to plan a trip to N. Cali - perhaps in October sometime.  Since my Aruba trip has been cancelled, I have a little more time.  I will keep you posted and hopefully you would still like to visit Mary Jo and perhaps the spa or wine country.  Maybe we can get Vanny out there with us!  

Is Jeff still traveling back and forth alot?  The weather here just got a big break and it is very cool outside.  How is it there?  My favorite month in Portland is October, with the trees changing colors.  Anyway - must get back to work.  Talk to you soon!

Kim

Saw you at the baseball game last night.  Credit being all work and no play is just not true!

What do you know about Panda Resources?  Nothing in a rush right now but I am showing them 10 year prices for their plant in AZ.  I would, however, like to be prepared to do bidness!  Let me know what you need.

Thanks,

Ki.

Hilarious.  I saw you too.  Who was that hunky guy you were with???

Don,

Attached is a request for a gas proposal for a retail customer in California.  Now that Roger Ponce is gone, and I am unable to get in touch with Derick Kelley, I no longer have a contact at EES to send these potential customers to.  Can you tell me who is handling retail customers in the West, particularly California?

Thanks,

Kim Ward
Manager
West Gas Origination

I'm sorry.  This is GAS rather than electricity.  Thanks.

Art, 

It looks like I won't be able to make it.  I have some meetings set up that I seem to be unable to re-arrange.  I really appreciate the invite though.  Maybe next time.  However, I am going to try to make it to Albuquerque before the end of the year.  I will let you know what my plans are.

Thanks again for the invitation.  Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.

Kim

Kim, will you be able to make it to the Balloon Fiesta? 
Need to know asap. 
Thanks, 
Art Avalos 

Hi David,

I got your name from Don Black as the replacement for Roger Ponce.  I am on the West Gas Origination desk for ENA in Houston and often run across customers looking for gas supply, particularly in California, that would be considered retail customers.  I am forwarding a request I received this morning that EES might be interested in.  I will continue to forward such information to you unless you let me know you are not the person I should be contacting.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Craig,

If the file is a small blue box with deal numbers and prices, I can open it. 

Thanks,

Kim

Would you do a favor for me?  Were you able to (or can you now) open the attached Excel spreadsheet and read it?  When I send spreadsheets to Darla she can't open them.  She said they appear as a .dtf file extension and are unusable.  I've sent attached spreadsheets to people at more than a half dozen different companies and haven't had anyone else say they can't open them.  So I'm wondering if someone else at ENRON can open it.
Thanks,

Attached is a workbook with tabs reflecting the August 2001 Palo Alto calculation, Enron calculation and the manual invoice we sent to Palo Alto.  I will fax you the Enron Unify invoice and supply verification.  We met with Anne Bike to go over the deals and the Palo Alto calculation prior to forwarding the manual invoice.  We are now in the process of trying to get the deal correct in Sitara and Unity.  Please review and let me know when you are ready to discuss and how you want to go forward.

Ann,

I just spoke with Jay Williams from our credit department and he only needs CalPeak's latest audited financial statements with management notes.  Any additional information that helps us understand the company and how it is set up will be helpful.  Sending this information overnight will probobly be our best bet.  My address is as follows:

1400 Smith Street, EB3206a
Houston, TX  77002

Also, Jay's phone number is 713-345-3923.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Debra,

A couple of weeks ago, Jay Williams sent a credit worksheet to you to prepare an Enfolio agreement for Imperial Irrigation District.  I will be forwarding an RFP response to them Friday which is required to include our draft contract.  I haven't received a copy of this draft.  Could you forward this to me at your earliest convenience? 

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Kelli,

When you have a chance this morning, can we update the blend and extend with Merced?  Still an indication.  They will transact at some point, maybe not until next week but they will do something.  They are leaning towards this blend though.

thanks for your help,

Kim

thanks!

No problem - I have a 9:00 mtg. but will reprice right after that.

Steve,

Attached is a little presentation detailing our proposal for some El Paso capacity that I previously mentioned to you.  Once you have a chance to look it over, give me a call and we can discuss your interests, what would make the proposal more attractive for Santa Clara, and any questions that you might have.

Also,  did you receive my indications for the products you were interested in?

Thanks,

Jeff,

Got your message this morning and we have refreshed the blend and extent price for you.  For 2040 MMbtu/day at the PG&E City Gate for January, 2002 through December 2005, the blend and extend price is $5.205.  Nymex for the outer years has been moving up since last week, therefore, the little increase in price.  Let me know if there is anything else you need -

variable is all we reimburse them for - they are responsible for the demand.  Let me know if you need anything else with regards to the redwood capacity

Thanks,

Kim

The differences we had on Friday were mainly volume related. Correcting the deal in SITARA and UNIFY relates to volume actualizations.  It is not pricing related. As we talked about there are still some issues on the redwood gas.  Redwood gas is the gas relating to the underdelivereis.  In otherwords, when Palo Alto "Burns" less than we actualy schedule on the transport.  Presumably we sell this gas to other 3rd parties, and Palo Alto will be reimbursed for the variable transportation.  I do not think ther are additional fees we would pay on top of reimburseing them for the variable costs, but I am not 100% certain.

Please let me know if ther are any other questions.

Thanks

Anne

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this?

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice?

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Glendale's City Attorney is Steve Lins.  His phone number is 818-548-2080 and his email is slins@ci.glendale.ca.us.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  I will be in their offices on Wednesday.

Attached is a draft copy of a Master Purchase/Sale Agreement  for physical natural gas transactions.  We are working on some of the information that Bonnie sent us and will be in touch next week with some ideas.  It would be good for us to go ahead and get things rolling with this contract so we will be prepared to enter into transactions, whether they fall within the the realm of the management services agreement or not.

Please call me with any questions you might have.  My legal guys are standing by to assist, too.

Have a good weekend -

I am back in the office - we are having a conference call this afternoon to iron out the last calculation questions and you will get a final spreadsheet for August and September from Mara Bronstein.  I have not talked to Sarabeth as you have the only copy of the invoice that I had.  Have you talked to Bryce about that invoice?  What do you guys need in order to pay them?

Thanks,

Hi,  

Just wanted to get an update from you on the Citizens info I asked you about last week.  I am wondering about the payment to John Cogan for Aug production and the EAMR payment due.  Did you talk to Sarabeth about that?

While on my adventures west yesterday, Burbank and Pasadena expressed some interest in the Peaker product that Lucci and Fuller were peddling a month or two ago.  Burbank is interested in looking at a 30 day call out of 365 days (Cal 02) for 5000.  Pasadena would like to look at 10 days out of the winter.  They just want indications for comparison to regular calls.

I know you will have questions - please come by and we can talk about them.  I left my notebook at home and feel lost today.

Kim

Hey!  Glad to hear you are well.  I have thought about our days on the 92nd floor as well.  Had some acquaintances that worked for Cantor as well as a close friend who worked for them that was called back to Houston for a meeting that very morning. Very glad he is with us today!  

It is cool that you hired Palmore.  You will have to tell him hello for me.  I did come back to Houston in January.  Enron brought me back to peddle gas in the West US.  Nothing much new in my life, just a new house and job - but I am glad to be back.  I miss the outdoor life in Portland but the people here are so much more fun and nice!  If you are ever in town - you better have a beer with me!  I will let you know if I am in Dallas -
Take care,

Kim

Hey Kim,
I just received that email about Halloween, pretty scary!
You won't believe this, but I just flew in from NY City.  My partner and I had to go there on business. I thought to myself several times over the past few weeks that you, Melissa and I worked in that building.  I wonder how many people just like you and I were lost and what that has meant to their families and friends.
So it looks like you moved to Houston. (Your email reply address had Houston in it.)  I hope everything is going well.  Is there any news in your life?
There is anotherstrangecoincidence.  I hired Palmore.  He starts Monday.  He'll bring a lot of experience with him to help us with some financial projects and operational improvements.
Let me know if you ever come to Dallas.  It would be nice to see you.

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I am usually open - let me know.

Kim

Oops.  Moved out of the Heights in April.  Built a place out here in the
stix by Conoco (I-10/Eldridge).  Really miss the food downtown and being
able to go to a game or a happy hour easily.  Where are you living these
days?  Lets grab a beer.  Whats going on next Thursday?

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

K.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Hey, just workin and playin.  No planned vacations!  What's new with you?
How's work?  Things here have slowed down somewhat.  Hope that's not a bad
sign for next year!  What have you been up to?  Haven't seen you about town
at all.

Hey stranger, whats going on?

Jeff,

A 10 year fixed price indication at the PG&E City Gate out of Jan. 02 is approximately $3.32.  I hope this is helpful.  Let me know how I can help facilitate the blend with Merced.

Let me know if there is any thing else that you need.

thanks,

Kim

Kim,  can you help Merced out with a 10-year PG&E city-gate price assuming a  1/1/2002 start (see message below).  I'll get them the electricity  price.  Indicative price is fine.  We are not going to  transact.
 
Got  your message too about gas prices moving up.  We are still looking at the  blend/extend versus an outright swap of the last almost 3 years.  I'll be  in touch.
 
Thanks  for your help.
 
Jeff
 
Do you  have on hand data on natural gas futures for 10 years  
and  Electric Prices projected for 10 years.
If  Available we can use them this morning.   I know the lead time
Is short  but would appreciate any help you can  provide.
 
Thanks
 
Roy

Roger, 

I don't know if you are the one to send this to but i am starting with you - let me know what we can do to take care of this EES customer.

Thanks,

Kim, the attached e-mail is from John Gregg.  He is a lawyer from Washington DC.  His firm represents alot of the Muni's across the country.  He represents Mesa and others in the West.  It appears that Enron is having some problems with WIlcox.  Did we give that account to EES ?  Do you know this JAmie Bellamy ?  If possible we need to get this cleared up so that John does not take it out on us in the furture.

Frank

Good to talk with you Frank.  Funny you called when you did.

While you were "gone," the mighty City of Wilcox, AZ signed up with Enron.  I got a call today from a frantic city clerk because Enron has fallen a few months behind in billing after many months of fine service.  This is bad for several reasons, not the least of which is that Enron is paying the pipeline for Wilcox.

The reps name is Jamie Bellamy.

Could you kick him in the butt for one of the smallest munis in the country?

David, 

Here is another possible retail deal in Cali.  Good Luck!

Kim

Kim, this is in regards to my conversation with Barry T.  I don't have much additional information other than the volume is <100 MM/day.  My number is 416-865-3712 if you have any questions. Cheers,

Sara,

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Thanks,

Kim

I would like to begin working on an ISDA, I have attached our standard form
schedule and CSA for your review.  I think this is a good window of
opportunity.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

marussel@srpnet.com on 04/05/2001 08:20:15 AM

I have been trying to get an ISDA going with Enron for several months. Who
is the best contact to call?

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Jay,  Can you send a credit worksheet to Sara for an ISDA for Salt River Project?  

Sara, I am attaching the SRP documents.  

Let me know if you guys need anything else.  What do you think the timing is on getting a credit worksheet together and a review of their docs?

Thanks,

Kim

 

 

Kim:

Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?

Jay and/or Tracy:  Who will prepare credit?

Thanks.  Sara

J.,

I am attaching proforma statements for the 2 Panda projects in Arizona.  Hopefully we can put together a credit worksheet and send them a contract. (At least that's where I think we are!)

Any news on SRP or NCPA?

Thanks,

Kim

 

 

J.,  Sorry, I sent the other email before I got this one.  The contact that I would recommend at NCPA is Dean Park, 916-781-4224.  He will either help you or can direct you to someone else.  You can reference the RFP if you would like.

You are right, NCPA is a consorsium of Munis.  The ones that would be involved in this particular transaction would be the Cities of Roseville, Lodi, Lompoc, and Alameda.
The transaction would be a physical basis transaction for 5000/day at city gate for 2002-2004.  We would be buying back $3.37 Physical BASIS for 2002.  This would be a sort of blend and extend.

Our deal would be Physical Basis.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim -

Do you have a contact at NCPA that I could call to discuss credit issues?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think NCPA is simply an operating agency for numerous California communities' utilities, and I need to investigate how obligations flow from NCPA to the member municipalities.

Also, is the deal that you are considering with them a financial or physical deal?

Thanks,

JRW

Thanks, Beth.  Credit will review and I will let you know if he has any questions.  I think the next thing we were waiting on were your new contracts.  If you guys need anything   while we are waiting on those, please let me know!  Also, if we need to meet in person, once we get things rolling, we are available to come to Dallas.  

Thanks,

Kim

Kim,

David,

I got a phone call from Summit energy, through whom I supply full requirements gas to Smurfit Stone Container Corporations plants in southern California.  Smurfit has a couple of plants in El Paso, Texas, on the Southern Union System, that Summit is looking to obtian bids for.  The contact at Summit is Jason Ramsey and his number is 502-429-3800.  Their load is about 100,000 MMBtu annually.  Is there someone at EES that would be interested in working on this transaction?  Let me know if EES is not interested and I will let Jason know.

Thanks,

Kim Ward 

Mara,

Here is the proposed revised contract with Citizens.  Could you take a look at it and see if the logic works in accordance with the spreadsheet?  sort of like how you built the original spreadsheet from the original contract.  Let me know if you have any questions and how this turns out.

Thanks,

Kim
John:

Here is a very rough draft of the amendment that 1)  clarifies the gas pricing and 2) adds firm peaking gas.  I will call to discuss.

PS How are things?

Hi Kim.  Anything working on the gas master agreement?  Just a small
reminder.

Kelli,

Attached is a request from PNM for an indication for the price of a put for Q3 next year.  This is a physical option that is at the money.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

Hi Kim, 
Could you please give me an estimate for Q3 2002, on the cost of a put 
option for 5,000 mmBtu/day (daily and monthly) from the San Juan Basin. 
Thanks, I really appreciate it. 
Art Avalos 

Art, 

We have priced these at the money puts and they are kind of expensive.  For the monthly put, Strike of $2.72, premium would be $.495.  For the Daily put, the premium would be $.535.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Prices might be lower tomarrow given the downturn since AGA's came out.  If you are willing to look at out of the money puts, the price would be better as well.

Thanks,

Kim

thanks,

Hey Lyndon,

How are you?  Long time - no email!  I hope things are going well for you.  Went to Happy Hour with Kim 1, Susie, Stacy, and Melissa last night.  Susie and Stacy just got back from the Bahamas.  Kim 1 and Melissa left today for Cabo San Lucas.  As for me, I am painting the inside of my house.  Not nearly as much fun.  But with this economy combined with my company's 3rd quarter earnings - my net worth is the worst it has been in YEARS!!!!  In other words - I am poor!  

Anyway, we were talking about our upcoming trip on the Poly in January and we were all wondering (especially me) if you had decided to remain in Austrailia or rejoin Casey on the boat.  I think we all hope we see you in Jan! 

Gotta go back to work and try to get this stock price back up - take care, keep in touch, and let me know what fun things you have been up to!

Love, K2

Darla is ready to bill citizens for Sept.  I guess we can use Cogans sheet if we are comfortable it is correct.  Let me know if you need anything and when you think we can get this to Darla.  ]

Thanks,

Kim

Hi Kim,

I am ready to invoice Citizens for September.  Do you have the Griffith sheet ready yet?

Thanks
Darla

I am back in the office - we are having a conference call this afternoon to iron out the last calculation questions and you will get a final spreadsheet for August and September from Mara Bronstein.  I have not talked to Sarabeth as you have the only copy of the invoice that I had.  Have you talked to Bryce about that invoice?  What do you guys need in order to pay them?

Thanks,
Kim

Hi,  

Just wanted to get an update from you on the Citizens info I asked you about last week.  I am wondering about the payment to John Cogan for Aug production and the EAMR payment due.  Did you talk to Sarabeth about that?

Thanks

Tomarrow, we need to add a little orig!  Please let me know if any of you have any questions.

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

Oops.  Moved out of the Heights in April.  Built a place out here in the

days?  Lets grab a beer.  Whats going on next Thursday?

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more

that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Hey, just workin and playin.  No planned vacations!  What's new with you?
How's work?  Things here have slowed down somewhat.  Hope that's not a bad
sign for next year!  What have you been up to?  Haven't seen you about town
at all.

Hey stranger, whats going on?

Amy,
 
Could you remove Jan Kennedy from your email list (City of Mesa) and add clifford_cauthen@ci.mesa.az.us <mailto:clifford_cauthen@ci.mesa.az.us>?  Let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks,
 
Kim
 

J.,  what is the status of this?  Mark Russell called again this morning for status.  I think he talked to Bill.  Please let me know.  

thanks,

Kim

Kim:  I have never received credit from Jay.  Sara

Jay,  Can you send a credit worksheet to Sara for an ISDA for Salt River Project?  

Sara, I am attaching the SRP documents.  

Let me know if you guys need anything else.  What do you think the timing is on getting a credit worksheet together and a review of their docs?

Thanks,

Kim

 << File: 070301.sample Paragraph13 credit annex isda.doc >> 

Kim:

Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

Can you resend the email version which Salt River sent to you?

Jay and/or Tracy:  Who will prepare credit?

Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Thanks,

Kim

I would like to begin working on an ISDA, I have attached our standard form
schedule and CSA for your review.  I think this is a good window of
opportunity.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

I have been trying to get an ISDA going with Enron for several months. Who
is the best contact to call?

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

tomarrow is fine.  Talk to you then.

Kim,

Both Karla and I are out today.  When are the baseload quantities for
November 2001, due to you?  If I don't hear from you today, I will send them
to you tomorrow, Thursday 10/24.

Monica

We could meet at my house and sit on my patio.  I should stick around until 5:30 or so.  I could be home by 5:45 or 6.  Is that cool?

What time do you get off?  Do you want to meet somewhere in between?  Your
place?

Brad

of course - where do you want to meet? and what time?

We still on for tomorrow?
What's the plan?

Brad

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

Kim

Oops.  Moved out of the Heights in April.  Built a place out here in the
stix by Conoco (I-10/Eldridge).  Really miss the food downtown and being
able to go to a game or a happy hour easily.  Where are you living these
days?  Lets grab a beer.  Whats going on next Thursday?

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday

The physical basis offer indication for Dec - March at the City Gate is about $.32.  The fixed price indiation for the 38 month period you mentioned is approximately $4.39.    We need to discuss this structure in detail if you are serious about buying physical gas from us and we also need to get contracts in place. 
Let me know if there is anything else you need.

thanks,

Kim
Kim: 
        I'm checking into a  PG&E citygate basis differential for the 4-months Dec.thru March off the  NYMEX for United Cogen in San Franscisco.  Right now, the 4-month  strip is about $3.03/dth. Whoops, make that $3.26/dth.
 
    Also, I'm checking  into a price for a 38 months firm gas supply at the Citygate to run from  6/1/03-7/31/06.  The volume would be in the 5,000-5,500 dth/day  range.  Everything at United was put on hold following the 9/11  disaster.  If you have any  questions, give me a call.  Is now a good time to buy Enron stock?   Hope you're all doing well.

where will you be coming from?

If you go south on Kirby, turn left and travel west on Richmond.  Take the first right onto Lake street.  Go through the first stop sign and I am behind the black iron gate on your left.  My address is 3110 Lake and I am behind 3112 Lake.  Park on the street.  If the car gate is closed, the people gate code is c1984.  

See you then -

How Enron Blew It

Texas Monthly

November 2001

Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?

by Mimi Swartz <http://www.texasmonthly.com/mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.p=
hp>

THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"

For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.

This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."

The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.

Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.

ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20

From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."=20

He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."

PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?

But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.

HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."

Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.=20

LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20

It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.

Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."

The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."

Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.

=20

THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."

Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20

You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)

For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."

Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20

And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).

But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =
"FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"=
 sang the New York Times in 1999. "In the staid world of regulated utilitie=
s and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis," crowed For=
tune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetabl=
e, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million=
, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to dis=
cover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, ste=
el, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron=
 client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedg=
e against the usual winter downturn?

But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech c=
ommunications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline be=
came another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades o=
nline in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bi=
d price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enr=
on, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empt=
y lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from tradi=
ng the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for wha=
t the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year=
 deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people=
 in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. "Its strat=
egy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commo=
dities can help it do well even in an uncertain market," BusinessWeek insis=
ted.

There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: =
the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of c=
ustomer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle cust=
omers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had t=
o come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business cli=
ents as customers and began calling them "counterparties."

Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were m=
aximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became=
 overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk ventur=
e quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oi=
l-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to un=
derwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its mark=
ets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals=
, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happene=
d at all.=20

While many businesses used what was known in the industry as "mark-to-marke=
t accounting," for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The c=
ompany priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's=
 idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't ge=
t deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like an=
nuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. How=
ever many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they=
 went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there mig=
ht be something fishy about what they called "subjective accounting," inves=
tors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the mark=
et fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a projec=
t that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't =
going to be high enough. "Enron is known for leaving people at the altar," =
says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the comp=
any could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser=
 for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a c=
ontribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's compe=
ting literacy charity: "Even the person who was supposed to give money away=
 for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron," he says.

As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created =
took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the En=
ron family put it, "It became a company full of mercenaries." The change st=
arted at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most =
of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like t=
he commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported ove=
rhearing orders like "I need a smart person-go buy me one" or "Buy me an in=
telligent slave, quick." Enron had never been the kind of place where peopl=
e sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-pa=
rody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was to=
o disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.

And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension=
. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by S=
killing in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking s=
ystem in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and t=
hose with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname qu=
ickly became "rank and yank.") It was a point of pride that Skilling's divi=
sion replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling assoc=
iate put it, "Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery=
 store." Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enro=
n's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' att=
itude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading cultur=
e, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enr=
on higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World,=
 he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially m=
ore lucrative project was pending elsewhere.

Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: =
"They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost s=
ight of the future," says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close de=
als within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-u=
ps who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so ofte=
n as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase "No old tapes" became a=
n Enron clich?. "People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight," says=
 one former Enron executive.

In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restr=
ictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company.=
 E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, on=
e for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, =
but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture thi=
s way: "They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while y=
ou bleed to death."

BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy =
company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: J=
ust as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of i=
ts remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dea=
lt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who d=
ealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enr=
on's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building pr=
ojects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enorm=
ous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. "It wasn't the tim=
e for long-term approaches," an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood.=
 "It was the technology era."

To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebe=
cca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many ye=
ars the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her n=
ickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had th=
e requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of En=
ron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed =
$20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent o=
f Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-on=
e Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including =
two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corpo=
rate America.

But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, Indi=
a, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron w=
ay: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 p=
ercent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three c=
hanges in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and oth=
er Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals=
, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.

Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisio=
ns were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firin=
g lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relen=
tless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keepin=
g a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour=
 deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly d=
ifficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company a=
s smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most=
 visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disa=
ster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mar=
k her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, =
Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water uti=
lity that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water pri=
vatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greate=
st water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like anoth=
er sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million.=20

But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a =
business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not li=
ke gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give=
 it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, an=
d confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started =
out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much=
 diminished, was folded into Enron. "I think it's best for Rebecca to start=
 afresh," Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal.=
 Or as one critic put it, "They were more interested in destroying the old =
culture than running a business."=20

As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay=
 announced the inevitable: "The best time for the succession to occur is wh=
en the company is doing well," he told the press. "Enron is doing extremely=
 well now." In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.

ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-=
power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debac=
le. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying t=
he company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (L=
ay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to Georg=
e W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying fo=
od or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent =
anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of=
 the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in Calif=
ornia, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had t=
ried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy d=
eregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media=
 was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its we=
aknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in=
 January.

Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The =
India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of =
constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situa=
tion was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim th=
at the state had never built enough power plants to service its population =
and never properly managed those it had. "For three months Gray Davis did a=
 very good job of blaming us," says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corpo=
rate communications. "We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the Whi=
te House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his big=
gest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take c=
are of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis." (Californi=
a utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might=
 be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's al=
l too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a jo=
ke comparing California with the Titanic. ("At least the Titanic went down =
with its lights on.")

But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had =
been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors=
 believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as=
 it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for=
 buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billi=
on in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too d=
id the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first tim=
e in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to ma=
rket. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds,=
 Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.

Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, t=
he stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. D=
uring the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who chal=
lenged Enron's financial reporting an "asshole." When the company reported =
hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profit=
s had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old asse=
ts. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling pr=
omised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. "Th=
ere wasn't any positive news," Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says n=
ow. "Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade."

The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had aske=
d in March whether Enron was overpriced. ("Start with a pretty straightforw=
ard question: How exactly does Enron make its money?") The routine cashing =
in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portray=
ed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken L=
ay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Jour=
nal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife with=
in the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possibl=
e failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in th=
e stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutio=
nally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. "When Wall Stre=
et is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,=
" says Carol Coale. "When a company falls out of favor, all these issues ca=
rry more weight."

This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started e=
xperiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as =
the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their sec=
retaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of th=
eir ways. "It just created an attitude," one executive still at Enron says.=
 "If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? Th=
ere was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"=20

Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it=
 now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardshi=
p duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. "But," as=
 one Houston oilman explains, "if you have to negotiate a hardship duty wit=
h someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporati=
on that's better suited for good times than bad."

As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the sto=
ck price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness=
 and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employe=
es killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for hi=
m, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named =
a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors=
, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and =
everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but "innovat=
e much closer to our core." As for the culture: "Things like the Performanc=
e Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to cate=
gorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a mo=
rale problem."

That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news=
 of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to=
 their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure wi=
th Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always belie=
ved in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them wh=
en the company was in trouble, it was different. "Even Jeff's biggest detra=
ctors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door," one loyalist admits.

But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. "Look," he s=
ays with finality, "ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my int=
erests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely."

Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling hims=
elf back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new tech=
nologies. "The first wave never gets it right," he says. "The stand-alone d=
ot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a secon=
d wave that will change the world." Houston, he promises, will become the w=
orld's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In f=
act, he is already shopping for office space.

"This is the second wave, and Enron's got it," he says, almost breathless. =
"There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that g=
et it."  <outbind://13/Image2.gif>

Dan, 

El Paso Electric's lawyer is Will Garant and his number is 512-495-8832.  He is the one dealing with our LT contract and is familiar with the collateral issues.  Matt Henry is the lawyer that drafted their long term contract attached.  I can get his number if you need it but I think he works at the same firm as Will.

Let me know what I can do to help and if you have any questions.

Thanks again for your help.

Kim:

Thank you for dinner on Tues.  As discussed, pls find EPE's draft lont-term
gas contract for your review.

Barry

(See attached file: EPE LT gas contract Feb 28 2001.doc)
 - EPE LT gas contract Feb 28 2001.doc 

It is right behind 3112.  There are only 3 garden homes inside the gate - and 3110 is real big on my double green doors.  Call if you get lost - 713-412-4571.

Kim

how do I get to your house after I come in the people gate?

where will you be coming from?

If you go south on Kirby, turn left and travel west on Richmond.  Take the
first right onto Lake street.  Go through the first stop sign and I am
behind the black iron gate on your left.  My address is 3110 Lake and I am
behind 3112 Lake.  Park on the street.  If the car gate is closed, the
people gate code is c1984.

See you then -

Kim

sounds great....give me some directions and I'll see you at 6 or so.

We could meet at my house and sit on my patio.  I should stick around until
5:30 or so.  I could be home by 5:45 or 6.  Is that cool?

What time do you get off?  Do you want to meet somewhere in between?  Your
place?

Brad

of course - where do you want to meet? and what time?

We still on for tomorrow?
What's the plan?

Brad

I am living in an awesome garden home 1 block west of Kirby between
richmond and West Alabama.  Awesome location.  You will have to see it
sometime.  I think I invited you to my housewarming party.  I will just
have to keep your name on the list for future parties.  I never have
customers in town but I have three in next week, including dinner plans
with Tucson Electric on Thursday night.  Maybe the following Thursday?  I
am usually open - let me know.

Kim

Oops.  Moved out of the Heights in April.  Built a place out here in the
stix by Conoco (I-10/Eldridge).  Really miss the food downtown and being
able to go to a game or a happy hour easily.  Where are you living these
days?  Lets grab a beer.  Whats going on next Thursday?

I thought you lived in the Heights?  Shows how much I know!  Don't know of
any specific happy hours but it seems as if there is always something going
on.  I'm not hooked into the broker market so I'm sure you hear about more
happenings than me!  Let me know when you are around and maybe we can get
some people together for a beer.

K.

Just tryin' to make a buck. I got back from a Mexico dove hunt yesterday
that was awesome!  We haven't seen alot of slowdown in the business
(thankfully) but the economy will back a little demand off the market.
Hoping the low price will continue to offset that and get prices moving up
in the next few months.

Don't get into town much since I live and work in east San Antonio.  Any
happy hours worth coming into town for?

Hey, just workin and playin.  No planned vacations!  What's new with you?
How's work?  Things here have slowed down somewhat.  Hope that's not a bad
sign for next year!  What have you been up to?  Haven't seen you about town
at all.

Hey stranger, whats going on?

Attached is the new contracts by which Los Angeles Department of Water and Power intends on entering into natural gas purchases and sales.  Is there any hope of getting in on some of this action?  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

 

 
Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

(See attached file: Spot Gas Cover Letter.doc)(See attached file: New Spot Gas
Contract.doc)

I am available next week.  I would love to get together.  Tonight, an old friend is coming by the house for a drink around 6.   I would love for you to join us.  He is married and will probobly have to go home.  Don't know what's going on after.  Pete and I broke up last night.  Very sad.  Call me if you get a chance 713-853-0685

K.

Hey. How's it going? I've been going like crazy--I know you've been out of
town, too.  Anything going on tonight? I have allergies that are killing me,
but haven't been out in a while.

Rola called me and would like for us all to get together some night soon for
dinner--are you avail next week?

Please call me when you get a chance.  I have a question.

thanks,

Kimmie x30685

Funny you should ask about my life right now.  Now you are sure to get an earful!  Beware - My country is at war and going into a major recession, my company is falling down around my feet, my grandmother is sick,  I am broke, and my boyfriend broke up with me last week, further confirming my ability to fail when it comes to relationships.  ( I know I act tought when it comes to this stuff but I am really sad about this one)  I guess that I am not sick and I do have lots of friends.  But I am tired and need someone to take over at this point - - - - 

I can't believe that you didn't get my email about gas being a buy a couple of weeks ago.  I guess if I had seen you when I was there, I could have told you in person.  AS for business over here, gas and power trading is still going strong.  However, all of the events have affected us in a huge way financially.  Down to whether we get bonuses or not.  It is not going to be a good year just trying to stay strong but I think that we will survive, and mostly thanks to EnronOnline.

Curious about what's going on there since you mentioned it.  Anyway - sorry to burden you with my personal problems.  I do hope things are going ok for you - too bad you're not going to make it here.  As we are in a cash crunch, I think I am probobly grounded for the remainder of the year.  Who knows!

Keep in touch -
K.

k,

thanks, i could use all of the luck that i can get right now trading this
market.  i have heard so many rumors about what's going on over there that
my head is spinning.  i won't bombard you with questions though.  how's
everything going other than work?  any opinions on this gas market?  you are
supposed to be my gas guru, i thought i would have heard from you a week ago
telling me to buy it, that it was going to make this huge move.  maybe the
email got lost.  went to florida this weekend for the ga/fla game and once
again left disappointed.  anyway, hope all is well, let me know if you're
going to be out this way anytime soon, my nov trip might be cancelled now,
i'll tell you more about all the crap going on over here next time i see
you....

E

Sorry I didn't forwarn you so you could choose to re-schedule.  Funny how things can change in just one week!  Suzanne is awesome - don't know what I would do without her.  We just went to Berryhill and had a taco and margarita.  Not a late night.  You didn't have to leave - I am glad you came though.  Hope we can do it again sometime - once I get over this hump.  (See, I am still insecure and a disaster when it comes to relationships! and I hadn't even gone there in 5 years!)

Take care and keep in touch.

kim

Good to see you....sorry it was a bad time for you.  Things will get better.
It was nice meeting Suzanne and Elizabeth.  Suzanne seems like a really neat
person.  Did ya'll hang out late?  I didn't want to run off but I thought
you probably needed some quality "girl time".
It is right behind 3112.  There are only 3 garden homes inside the gate -

Chris,

Can you send or fax me a copy of the contract between us/Citizens and EARMS?  I don't have a copy and i need one in order to get these invoices processed.

thanks,

Kim

Lynn,

I thought you might be interested in the new draft proposal for the QFs in Cali.  

 

Kim

PLEASE take me with you.  I am at a low in my life - recently reassured that I am a failure in relationships that really mean something to me.  The only point in my life where I can't seem to be successful.  

How are you? Holding on for dear life? I've never needed a sailing trip worse in my life!

Elliot Mainzer
Renewable Power Desk

Please remind me of the exact changes so I can go to my back office.  Things have just been crazy around here so sorry for overlooking this.  '

Thanks,

Kim

Do you need something from me in order to redo those confirms we talked
about?

Art,

We are pricing the calls up for you and will have them in the morning.  As for the comments on the contract, you can send them to me and I will put them in our lawyers hands.  Thanks so much for getting that document throught the system.  I will talk to you tomarrow.

Thanks,

Kim

Hi Kim, hope you're doing well.  Just received comments from our 
Lawyers for your Master Enfolio. Should I be speaking with you or 
someone else? 
Also, could you give me a quote of what a daily call for Q3 will be 
at the money for 5,000 mmBtu/day. 
Thanks, 
I really appreciate it. 
Art Avalos 

I found it!  It was in a box in my garage.  Thanksgiving was just ok - have had better.  how was yours and what did you do this weekend?

just wanted to remind you to start looking for your c-card now!  don't know if you want to scuba or not, but nice to 
have options.

Hope you had a nice thanksgiving - we need to go for drinks soon!

Kim

came back from dallas friday - just went to houstons with a friend.  Saturday, worked on the house and ran some errands.  Went out saturday night and drank too much - just hung out yesterday.  Nothing at all exciting!  I am very boring these days!

excellent!
My turkey day was nice - saw my niece that i haven't seen in 10 years - had about 18 people at my parents, so it was a mad house!

Didn't do alot, did some shopping, set up my new computer, went to dinner, cleaned the house....how about you?

Megan,

Are we going to owe Pasadena money for every invoice?  If not, since we owe them so much on this one, is there a way we can offset with future invoices where they owe us money?  Can we check into that?

Let me know - 

Kim

Steve:
I have taken over your account from Janine Cashin and am working on the invoices for April forward.  As I complete them, I will send them to you for settlement.  The April 2001 Calc sheet and Invoice are attached.  Enron plans to wire the City of Pasadena $1,853,770.40 on Friday, 11/30/01.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.

Suzanne, 

can you forward to Lori and Joe Gordon.

Terri, 

Can you forward to Pierce, Stacy, and Donna?

Thanks you so much for working on these as fast as you have - there was a priority in getting them out.  However, as you know, the less cash outlay that we have right now the better.  Lets wait and try to offset the amount we owe them with what they owe us - so I say wait until you get July and August done.  What do you think the time frame is on this?  And when would be the earliest that we would make the payment?

Thanks,

Kim

Kim:
I have completed the invoices for April, May and June and we owe Pasadena each month for a total of $3,615,910.62.  I am waiting to hear back from Patti on May and June to make sure they are okay with her.  Do you want me to pay Pasadena on Friday for these months or do you want me to hold off until I finish July and August?  Again, I do not have all of the information for July and August, so I cannot give you any numbers.  If I go by what is currently in the system as a guide, Pasadena would owe Enron a little over $1 mil.  I need to forecast the money today, so please let me know what you would like to do.

FYI-I will be out of the office all next week.

Chinese Good Luck

You may not believe in this but the advice is great!
Read all the way down, you might learn something
THE FOLLOWING IS A CHINESE GOOD LUCK TANTRA TOTEM.

This tantra totem has been sent to you for good luck. It has been sent
around the world ten times so far. You will receive good luck within four
days of relaying this tantra totem.

Send copies to people you think need good luck. Don't send money as fate
has no price.

Do not keep this message. The tantra totem must leave your hands in 96
hours. You will get a very pleasant surprise. This is true, even if you are
not superstitious.

ONE. Give people more than they expect and do it cheerfully.

TWO. Marry a man/woman you love to talk to. As you get older, their
conversational skills will be as important as any other.

THREE. Don't believe all you hear, spend all you have or sleep all you
want.

FOUR. When you say, "I love you," mean it.

FIVE. When you say, "I'm sorry," look the person in the eye.

SIX. Be engaged at least six months before you get married.

SEVEN. Believe in love at first sight.

EIGHT. Never laugh at anyone's dreams. People who don't have dreams don't
have much.

NINE. Love deeply and passionately. You might get hurt but it's the only
way to live life completely.

TEN. In disagreements, fight fairly. Please No name-calling.

ELEVEN. Don't judge people by their relatives.

TWELVE.   Talk slowly but think quickly.

THIRTEEN. When someone asks you a question you don't want to answer, smile
and ask, "Why do you want to know?"

FOURTEEN. Remember that great love and great achievements involve great
risk.

FIFTEEN. Say "bless you" when you hear someone sneeze.

SIXTEEN. When you lose, don't lose the lesson.

SEVENTEEN. Remember the three R's: Respect for self; Respect for others;
Responsibility for all your actions.

EIGHTEEN. Don't let a little dispute injure a great friendship.

NINETEEN. When you realize you've made a mistake, take immediate steps to
correct it.

TWENTY. Smile when picking up the phone. The caller will hear it in your
voice.

TWENTY-ONE. Spend some time alone.

Now, here's the FUN part!  ["FUN"!!?!!]

Dan,

Attached is a term sheet that has been agreed to with the City of Pasadena to extend a current deal that we have with some minor changes.  Could you help me put together the confirmation?  

Please call me with any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

 

Patti is the one with the details, I'm just the deal maker and don't have access to any of the systems.  All I know is what fixed priced baseload deals we have.  I have no idea what flows.  I hope Patti can help you soon.  Let me know if you don't hear from her today.

Thanks,

Kim

If I can get all of the information today, I can tell you this afternoon.  It doesn't take long to create the calc sheets.  I understand from Janine that you or Patti can provide me with the detail that I need.  If necessary, I can come pick it up.  I have sent Patti a list.

For payment, we have to forecast the money two days out.  So, if I know today, I can pay on Friday.

Megan

thats fine - we can't pay them anyway

I'll check with Patti later today.

Are you going to hang out with me and Camille tonight?

Jack,

Thanks so much for the message.  You are right, we are still a great trading organization.  Unfortunately, we had some people outside this organization make mistakes.  As for Tuesday, lets play it by ear.  I think we will continue to be a business and I still consider you a great customer.  Call me when you get into town and I will have a lot more information to share.

Thanks again for your email -

Kim

Hi Kim,

Just wanted to say, well I don't really know what to say.  For what its
worth, you guys are the sharpest group of traders and one of the most
innovative companies I have ever dealt with.  You'll find a way through
this.

If you need to reschedule our meeting Tuesday evening I completely
understand.

Thanks,

Citizens is initiating the process to terminate our agreement.  They will likely recall the capacity on TW and terminate our agency relationships with EP and TW.  They want to know if we are continuing to deliver gas.  Can you call Sean and tell him?

Suzanne, 

can you forward to Lori and Joe Gordon.

Terri, 

Can you forward to Pierce, Stacy, and Donna?

why are they doing this?

Citizens is initiating the process to terminate our agreement.  They will likely recall the capacity on TW and terminate our agency relationships with EP and TW.  They want to know if we are continuing to deliver gas.  Can you call Sean and tell him?

C 

So do we have a special agreement in place for the full requirements gas deal?  I think that you did that deal before I came to the gas desk.  How can I get a copy of the penalty language?

Thanks,

Kim

The contract provides for a Material Adverse Change if our credit rating goes below BBB- which it has.  This is a triggering event.  When this occurs they can initiate the process moving to terminate the agreement.

Mr. Dossett,

I did not have your email address - however, I do recall inviting you verbally to the party, in person.  No one else on that distribution list received such an honor.  I am sorry you can't make it, as I know you have a black tie affair, however, there have been 12 girls who have accepted our invitation and only 3 guys.  Therefore, my party might have a better ratio for you.  Sorry you'll miss it!

And I have TN and 18 for a smoothie.  Think I'll win? 

Kim

John Schilke emailed the invitation to me for the TN/FL game; however, I did
not get the invite from you, meanie.

I do hope you guys have a good time (I can't go to Houston this weekend),
and I hope the Vols can keep it close for more than 5 minutes.  Did you see
that the point spread is already up to 18?

Write me.

Kane

Attached is the latest term sheet for Pasadena for April through August.  Just wanted to share with you what we were going to be doing with them in the near term.  Ann, could you help me get this deal into the system?  PLEASE let me know if any of you have any questions.

Scotty,

Long time - no email.  How are you?  As you know, things aren't so good here.  It is so sad!!!  Anyway, just wanted to put another bug in your ear - I'm still pro Atlanta.  If you know of anything going on at Mirant that would be a fit for me - please let me know.  West gas or power, origination or trading.  Give me a call sometime - I don't know how long I will be at this desk but my number here is 713-853-0685.  My cell is 713-412-4571.  That shouldn't change.  My email address at home is kward1@houston.rr.com.

I do hope all is well with you - and that you keep in touch no matter what!

Take care,

Kim

Hey,  know of anyone or anything at Mirant that might make sense for me to talk to?

Dan Hyvl - we sent them a draft two/three weeks ago.

Kim:  Mark Russell asked what lawyer will handle the gas master physical.  Have you spoken with a physical lawyer yet?

Sara Shackleton
Sara,

Attached is Salt River Projects ISDA attachments.  I know that we have previously sent them our attachments (in 1999).  Mark Russell of SRP will be contacting you to negotiate this agreement.  I hope it is ok that I have him your name.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help and keep me posted on developments.  

Thanks!

Kim

I have attached our standard CSA and Schedule.  Thanks.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

marussel@srpnet.com on 04/05/2001 08:20:15 AM

I have been trying to get an ISDA going with Enron for several months. Who
is the best contact to call?

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Bob, 

I had our contracts folks look into any contracts we had with LADWP.  It looks like we have something that would cover short term transactions.  However, in order to enter into a 12 month or longer transaction, we will need to put a master purchase/sale agreement in place.  I asked legal to send our standard agreement to you.  I hope that you will take a look at it.  Any questions or issues that you might have with it, you can bring to my attention and I will make sure the appropriate parties are brought into the conversation.

Also,  I have attached the prices that you asked for earlier.  Let me know if you need anything else!!

Thanks,

Kim

 

rpetti@dwp.ci.la.ca.us on 03/28/2001 09:44:31 AM
Kim- I checked.  Enron has a spot agreement with LADWP.  - bp

I told you

Bought at .37 cents and now at .27 cents.  Not good.

As you probobly knew, Camille is gone.  I missed working out with Dean this morning - oh well.  Thought you might want to know about Camille.

I'm still holding on by a thin thread here in Portland, but I wanted to send you my vitals as I'm experiencing advanced symptoms of the travel bug. Needless to say, you're one of the major reasons I have no regrets about having worked at Enron. Definitely stay in touch.

Hey, 

I called both of your contacts on Friday and have not heard back from either of them!  Does Kristin Stanton work for either of them?

Kim

ps.  I'm still at work - will know more by Monday

I am definitely in.  Please let me know the details.  I am so sorry to hear this.  If you have Susie's address, can you send it to me?  Thanks,

Kim

Hello all, 

	I am sorry to send this bad news.  Yesterday Susie's father had a massive coranary.  I took Susie home around 2:00 yesterday so that she could pack and take off to Louisianna.  It is my understanding as of right now that he is/was brain dead and they were going to pull the plug yesterday.  I am going to get the information and send flowers.  Do any of you want in?  Please let me know.  Thanks all, I hope to be the bearer of good news next time.  Stacey

I'm fine so far - just looking for a job .  How are you?

Just wondering- I heard there were more people affected.

did you put that on my desk?

Cliff,

     For gas day December 6, 2001, Enron did not schedule gas to the City of Mesa.  I was unaware of this until late in the day Dec. 5.  Therefore, it is my interpretation, under section 12 of the contract, Enron is not providing sufficient gas supply to the City on this day.  The City of Mesa should determine its best course of action based on the terms of the contract given the fact that Enron did not schedule gas for December 6th.  Please notify me of any new supply or other course of action, as soon as possible.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

But Oregon would be eaten alive by Miami - they haven't played anyone this year.  Just got a call about a power originator job in Denver.  Interesting! 

I know how you feel.  No way Nebraska should be playing for the championship.  Should be Oregon.

Ann,

Attached is a draft of Enron's response to your request for proposals for gas supply to power generation plant in development by Calpeak Power, LLC.  As requested, Enron has provided indexed pricing with the option to convert to various fixed priced products during the term of the agreement.

The options presented are not intended to represent a complete list of opportunities, but are representative of the different pricing structures Enron offers.  There are several additional structures available  and we look forward to discussing these options with you.

Please call me with any questions you might have regarding the proposal.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,

Megan,

Mara has been terminated so I looked in our files and found a spreadsheet for November.  However, it doesn't have the volumes filled in. Shannon Groenewald should be able to provide you with the actual volumes and all you should have to do is add them to this spreadsheet.  I have copied Shannon on this email so she should expect to hear from you.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

 

Kim:
I tried to find Mara Bronstein in the address book, but I could not find her name.  I'm hoping you can help me.  Do you know if there is a Griffith spreadsheet for Nov?  My last day with Enron is next Thursday and I'm trying to complete Citizens before I go.

It was painful !  Actually made it through an airplane flight, 2 meetings, a reception, and dinner!!

ouch....never made it in on Thursday, don't know how you did it.

Yonnie,

I hope you are doing well.  I just talked to Wende and we discussed having lunch with you on the 26th.  My flight isn't until 7 pm that day and I would love to see you.  I hope you will be able to make it!  My job search is going well.  I was in Denver yesterday and that looks promising.  I may just wait for the new deal here to go through to see what is still left with the "new company".  I am traveling Jan 3 - 12 so it just makes sense to wait!

We can chat more when I see you!  Let either me or Wende know if you can make it!

Talk to you later -

Love,  Kim

Hey....I am sad...we will not come home until Christmas Day.  Will you back
after that?  I would love to spend some time with you!

How is Houston?  I know you liked it there before but had grown to love the
west.  Are you looking anywhere special for a job?...like Memphis?

Have you heard from any one who worked in the World Trade Center?  Of course,
I thought immediately of visiting your workplace there.  It was unbelievably
horrible!

Talk to you soon....I am so glad we are e-mailing!

Love ya,

Yonnie

check out the following websites for airfare:

www.orbitz.com - the best so far.  
www.cheaptickets.com
www.hotwire.com - with this one, you see the offer but won't know the airline or flight times until you lift the offer

register for sidestep and it will show you what priceline offers anytime you look for airfare under any other platform

Then of course, there is expedia and travelocity - but they tend to be more expensive.  Also, sometimes when you check the same website again 5 minutes later, it will show a better price.  Don't forget - tomarrow is 7 days in advance (that might matter)

p.s.  If you want to see how UN attractive my friends are - we are going to be a the wine bucket (new place - W. Alabama just east of Kirby) at 6 pm tonight.  Suzanne, Camille, Jeanie, Lori, Elizabeth.  You can check Camille out for yourself.  Bring others along.

Mary,

Patti,

Just a reminder that we are no longer authorized marketer for Pasadena or Smurfit.  HOwever, we are acting as agent for Pasadena and will continue to schedule for them.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim 

I sent the spreadsheet and instructions to Megan Parker.  She should be putting it together for you.

Thanks,

ps.  I will be out until Jan. 14 except for checking in on the 28th and the 2nd.

$353 - you have no excuse!

We are not authorized marketer - only agent.  In other words, we are scheduling for them but not supplying their gas.  

Will we be acting as agent for Pasadena in January?  Should we turn this contract back?  Let me know what your thoughts are.

Mike

WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU LAST NIGHT?  SEND ME AN EMAIL - WITHOUT REPLYING TO THIS ONE USING KIM.WARD@ENRON.COM.  WE JUST MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK AND I AM HAVING CONFLICTS WITH THE KIM WARD IN LONDON.

THANKS!

Monica,

Attached are the price indications that you asked for.  Let me know if you want to do anything or if you have any questions.  

Thanks,

Kim 

I am assuming you're looking at the "daily" tab.  The first column reflects
actual usage.  The second column is a 30 day rolling average.

Could I get price indications from you today for a customer of ours.  Their
load is pretty small, ~ 200 MMBtu/day.  I need monthly prices at Malin and
Citygate starting July 2001 through June 2003.

Thanks,

Monica

Monica,

What is the difference in the volumes in the first column and those in the
second column?  I am working on this today and must discuss with the desk -
who will be managing the extra risk.  I hope to have something back to you
by tomarrow.

Thanks,

Kim

   Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to interview you as our
   potential
   natural gas supplier.  We will make our selection by May 3, 2001 and
   would
   like to give you one final opportunity to send us your final proposal.

   As was discussed in the interview, it is the City's desire to avoid
   daily
   price risk and EFO/OFO penalties.  We understand that the changing
   market
   warrants the end user to take on more of that risk or to pay for it in
   the
   form of premiums, however, we also realize that our load is relatively
   constant and driven mainly by weather.  I have attached over three years
   of
   daily historical usage for the City.  Please consider this information
   when
   submitting your final proposal.

   Please email me your final proposal by May 2, 2001.

   Regards,

   Monica V. Padilla

Tony,

  I am still working on a term sheet for you.  I was hoping to get you something today but got pulled away.  Also, I still need to talk to our transportation expert regarding your situation.  Hopefully, I will have something tomarrow.  I will be in touch!

Thanks,

Kim:
Is Stephanie Miller the right person for this?  Can you forward this to the correct person?

Chris,
The owner of an underground gas storage facility called me today asking to contact a person in Enron regarding the possibility of leasing his storage. It is a depleted gas reservoir in Antioch, near the Sacramento River. It is connected to the Calpine system, but it is not connected to the PG&E system. Its capacity is six bcf and currently contains one bcf. It is surrounded by several hundred available acres if you wanted to consider building a power plant.  

If anyone in ENA might be interested in talking to this guy, could you please refer them to Ken Beebe whose phone is 925-837-9019. Thanks!

Art, 

Attached is the contract that would govern this transaction.  Barry and I have discussed San Juan risks but we are willing to take it - however, the actual offer at this time is $4.65 for 15,000 to 20,000 delivered at the Blanco Pool.  When you are ready to transact, I will update the exact price at that time.  Let me know what you want to do.

Thanks,

Kim

 

Sara,

I am available all day wednesday but will be out of the office on Thursday.  Let me know when you would like to meet.

Thanks,

Kim

Just spoke with Mark Russell.  SRP will be in Houston next week on Wednesday and Thursday and would like to meet to discuss the ISDA with legal and credit.  I told Mark that I was available Wed. and Thurs. morning.  Are you guys available at the same time?

Jay - please call me with your bond rating info so that I can email a draft agreement to SRP.

Please forward me your login ID for the gas fundy site.   There will be security measures to enter this site now and your login id is needed.

Lou, 

Attached is the RFP response we discussed.  Enron has the capability of offering an array of risk management products.  We are unable to provide gas to you at Malin as we do not own firm transportation on the Redwood line.  Please call me with any questions that you might have.

An at the money Daily call option (against first of the month index) for gas at San Juan is $.24 for Q3 next year.  At the money monthly call options would be $.58 with a strike of $3.10.  A fixed price daily call option would be $.60 with a strike of $3.10.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Items To Bring:
Also if anyone has a cooler they want to bring for water, soda  or other beverages for the bus that would be great.  The bus also has a CD  player and VCR if you have cd's to bring that would be great or a movie you have  been wanting to catch up on ;)
Tentative Schedule:
9:00 -  9:45                 Continental  Breakfast @ MJ's - Coffee, Juice, Muffins etc.

Please see the attached website for details.   http://www.alexandervalley.org/first.html << File: http://www.alexandervalley.org/first.html >> 
 
If there are enough people interested I was thinking of  arranging the rental of a party van/shuttle bus for the day Sunday November  4th, from 10:00 - 5:00 leaving from my house in the Marina.  After  talking with a few limo companies, the price per person for limo/shuttle  service will probably be around $50 - $60 for the day.

As far as I can tell, Craig's requests are ok.  Also, the NSP and gelber invoices you sent me look ok.  I am attaching my manual spreadsheet for the deals I have done from August forward.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Remember to use this spreadsheet in conjunction with what is in the system.

Mara,

I am just sending you this spreadsheet.  This has nothing to do with the Griffith deal.  We can discuss later.

Thanks,

Chino plant 100% down = 80 MW
Bagdad plant - 50% decrease in production = 40 mw
Cerrito plant - 50% decrease in production = 40 mw

Basically 120 -150 MW offline due to PDs decrease in producion.  the same percentage decrease in gas demand is what we should see.  Let me know if you would like us to investigate this further.

Thanks,

Kim

Thanks, Kim - for always sending me my stray emails!

schedule and CSA for your review.  I think this is a good window of
opportunity.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

I have been trying to get an ISDA going with Enron for several months. Who
is the best contact to call?

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Since I have my long vacation in January, the less time I have to take off, the better - so I think a long holiday weekend would be good.  Let me know!

Kim

Ok, Ladies,

John Tlapek called tonight....we discussed a ski trip....he wanted me to ask
everyone for an alternative time to go, other than New Year's Eve......

Will each of you email me weekends in Dec/Feb/Mch, that you are currently
available...and I will match them together for
all 5 of us...and provide John w/ one or two dates...

THANKS, TAKE CARE,
TRICIA

chris,

Here is what is going on with Citizens right now:

1)  Mike Grigsby and Randy Gay are reviewing the revisions to the Griffith contract from their perspective.  I will have Patti review it once they are done.  I looked at your peaking language and was not able to enhance it.  However, does the new calculation address any unanticipated pipeline rate changes such that the demand margin or sales margin could be negetive?
2)  interuptible gas will flow right now to Nogales from the Waha pool, according to Pattie
3)  I am attaching a summary of the conference call we had on the 18th and would like your input before sending it out.
4) the capacity release was posted and matched successfully.

Let me know ifyou have any questions.

thanks,

Kim

 

Hey Jeanie,  thanks for the invite.  Please keep me posted.  Last night was fun.  Had just the right amount of trick or treaters to have one piece of candy left over for each of us!

Kimmie

Barring any construction mishaps, the big tv will go into the wall this weekend.  As a result, Matt plans to have people over on Sunday for a Band of Brothers finale party.  I'll give you more details later but wanted to let you both know that you are especially invited(as is Robbie Mac).

How was last night?  Lots of trick or treaters?

Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

Chris, 

If you have a minute, will you look at this term sheet?  His volumes are really small but if we get the Palo Alto deal it won't be that big of a deal - unless we have to schedule less than 1 MMBtu. Oh yo!  His average daily volume, for both plants is about 178/day, based on annual usage.  I have proposed basically a GD deal with a first of the month index option if he can set a BDQ.

Thanks in advance.

Kim

 

I forgot to mention that Scott Masuda of Los Angeles Department of Water and Power will be in our offices on Monday afternoon.

Thanks,

Kim

Gerald, 

I sent the following email to Jeff Hodge and Jason Williams on October 25th ad have heard nothing.  I reminded them this morning as we need to reply by mid next week.  Also, LDWP will be in our offices Monday afternoon.  Is this something that you can address faster than Jeff?  If so, just let him know and let me know how to proceed.  There was an article in the NGI publication this morning regarding this.

Thanks,

Kim

Karla,

Have you received these confirms yet?  Please let me know.

thanks,

In June 02 we should have sold to you 1487 MMBtu/day at CG instead of 1750
and in July 02 we should have sold you 1530 MMBtu/day at CG instead of
1640.
Thanks.

Please remind me of the exact changes so I can go to my back office.
Things have just been crazy around here so sorry for overlooking this.  '

Things are fine here.  I will miss Monica.  I am assuming you know that not
only is she not working on gas stuff anymore - she's taking a 4-month leave
to take care of her father.

Just got an email regarding our trip to the Caribbean in Jan - more guys have signed up that women!  You should definitely think about it - especially since there is such a large group of us.  (protection in numbers)  There tends to be lots of drinking though - but a very laid back and relaxing time hanging out on beautiful beaches! 

Glad to hear you had a good weekend.  I was sick with a cold/sinus infection the entire weekend - stayed home alone - am sick of myself!  Is Caraba's still the place of choice tonight?  Just let me know what time.

K.  

Hello! Yes, I'm good for tonight. I need to workout though--I pigged out all

I'm sick of this! But, the weather was fantastic and we had a great time.

Houston has actually been nice - hasn't gone above 85 and it is great to sit outside at night.  Anyway, you work too much and need to think about getting a life!!  

We had the best intentions of going to Greasewood flats but were too lazy to drive there.  It was an awesome relaxing weekend and the weather was great!!  We hiked camelback on Saturday.

I will be coming back to PHX to visit Arizona Public Service soon.  don't know exactly when yet.  

Let me know when you feel the need to get away to some nice humid weather - it's good for the complexion, you know!!

Take care,

Kim 

It was 107 degrees here yesterday...but a dry heat. I wonder how that
compares to Houston Humidity?

This Friday, May 11, I have four new brokers coming over from the
competition, so I'm afraid my weekend will be spent at the office working
with them. Honestly, I'd rather be sweating in Houston and be at your party.

Did you make it to Greasewood Flats?

Attached is a summary of the conference call held between Enron, Citizens, and PP&L on October 18th.  Proposed procedures on how we will handle cuts from now on are also included.  Enron is making every effort available to ensure that PP&L receives 100% of the gas that they call on.  I feel that we need to formally agree to these procedures, either in the form of an amendment to the agreement or a formal letter signed by all parties.

Please let me know if you have any comments regarding these procedures and how you would like to proceed.

I don't know what to do.  Boss says I don't need to look for a job and they will have to find some $$ to keep people. don't know that I want to be among the 7000 enron employees beating the streets.   Any suggestions?  there have been no formal announcements of layoffs but Logically, I feel like about 50% of my friends here will loose their jobs.  Especially the ones not associated with gas or power.  The world is in turmoil!  Wish I had my sailboat and 6 mos. $$ to live on - I would go to the caribbean and stay for a while.

so what are you going to do now?  have they made any kind of announcements
or anything?

Dynegy Calls SEC's Probe of Enron `Financial Noise' (Update5)
2001-11-12 11:03 (New York)

Dynegy Calls SEC's Probe of Enron `Financial Noise' (Update5)

     (Updates share prices in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Nov. 12 (Bloomberg) -- Dynegy Inc. Chairman Chuck
Watson said he's convinced Enron Corp.'s trading operations are
sound and described disclosures about affiliated partnerships that
helped drive Enron's stock down 67 percent in three weeks as
``financial noise.''
     Dynegy agreed Friday to buy Enron for at least $23 billion,
including at least $8 billion in stock and $15 billion in assumed
debt. Dynegy shares rose as much as 16 percent today. Enron rose
as much as 20 percent.
     In an interview after the merger announcement, Watson and
Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay discussed how the Houston-based
companies reached agreement less than three weeks after Enron's
shares began plunging.
     ``All the financial noise about the partnerships, maybe it
has damaged the Enron brand a bit,'' Watson said. ``But I'll tell
you what it hasn't impacted, and that's the high regard that the
industry places on'' Enron's trading business, he said.
     Enron last week restated earnings for four years to include
losses from three affiliated partnerships, reducing earnings by
$586 million.
     Six employees, out of Enron's 20,000, may have improperly
benefited from the partnerships, Lay said.
     ``I'm sorry those six people seem to have gone somewhat over
the edge in their dealings or transactions, but you can't be
absolutely protected from that in any business,'' he said.

                        Lost Effectiveness

     Lay didn't specify which six people he was referring to. He
removed Andrew Fastow, who helped set up and ran many of the
affiliated partnerships, as chief financial officer on Oct. 24. An
Enron securities filing says Fastow made more than $30 million off
two of the partnerships.
    Fastow ``had lost his effectiveness because of all the press
coverage'' on the affiliates, Lay said.
     Treasurer Ben Glisan and Kristina Mordaunt, a managing
director and a corporate counsel for an Enron division, also were
fired, Enron said in a corporate filing on Thursday. Former
employees Michael Kopper, Kathy Lynn and Anne Yeager were in a
position to profit from partnerships, the filing said.
     ``You trust people, you accept their representations and
proposals,'' Lay said. ``Sometimes when you do that, you get
surprised and disappointed.''
      Both executives said they expect antitrust regulators to
approve the merger because the two companies own different types
of assets and won't dominate any market.
    ``There really isn't anything that lays on top of each
other,'' Watson said Friday night. ``We're not in the pipeline
business and they are. We're in the generation business, and
they're really not.''
     Dynegy shares rose 6.2 percent on Friday after terms of the
Enron purchase leaked to the press. Watson expects the acquisition
to add 90 cents to 95 cents a share, or 35 percent, to Dynegy's
2002 earnings. Enron is selling for $10.41 a share, one-fifth the
average price over the past 12 months.
     Enron stock climbed 97 cents, or 11 percent, to $9.60 in late
morning trading. Earlier, they touched $10.38. Dynegy rose $4.54,
or 12 percent, to $43.30 after touching $45.

                            Cash Crunch

     The rapid decline of Enron threatened to bankrupt the company
and disrupt energy markets. Enron handles an estimated one-quarter
of U.S. electricity and natural-gas trades. A falling credit
rating made it difficult for the company to raise capital needed
to back trades.
     As part of the purchase, ChevronTexaco Corp., which owns 26
percent of Dynegy, agreed to provide Enron with $2.5 billion.
     ``What we found when looked under the hood is that the core
of Enron was still there and working as well as ever,'' Watson
said. ``That business was pristine and had nothing to do with the
partnerships.''
     Dynegy began taking steps toward the acquisition in late
October, when Watson called Lay to offer assistance with Enron's
growing financial crisis, the two men said. That led to a Saturday
morning meeting in Lay's kitchen.
     ``He even made me a breakfast roll,'' Watson said.
     ``He didn't eat it,'' Lay said.
     Lay said he won't be an active manager in the new company.
Watson said Friday that he and Lay hadn't discussed a severance
package.
     As head of Enron, Lay had refocused the Houston operator of
U.S. natural-gas pipelines on trading and international expansion,
boosting reported revenue 20-fold since 1995 to $100.8 billion
last year. He said he doesn't regret the strategy.
     ``Clearly, Enron has gotten involved in business that hasn't
turned out well,'' Lay said, pointing to money-losers Azurix Inc.,
created to supply water and build related projects around the
world, and NewPower Holdings Inc., a seller of electricity to
homes and small businesses. ``But you have to keep in mind, too,
that 12 years ago we weren't in the wholesale merchant (trading)
business. Today that's an incredibly valuable franchise.''
     The trading business, which accounts for about 97 percent of
Enron's revenue, buys electricity, gas and other commodities from
producers and sells them to end users such as utilities and
industrial customers. It also advises big business customers on
energy use and sells them gas and electricity.

                     Reassessing Steel, Lumber

     Watson said the new company will keep trading coal, gas,
power and petroleum products, and plans to expand by buying assets
and using them to develop trading. ``We'll just have to reassess
over time whether we stay in'' trading of steel, lumber and other
non-energy commodities, he said.
     Enron wants to shed its 65 percent stake in Dabhol Power Co.
in India, which is owed $64 million in overdue bills from a state
government agency that has refused to pay the power prices Enron
was promised in contracts.
     ``We have strong legal remedies and we're heading down the
path toward arbitration, but we'd still very much like to work out
a settlement with the government,'' Lay said. Potential buyers
have balked at Enron's $1 billion asking price for Dabhol.
     Neither man would comment on whether Dynegy plans to cut jobs
after the merger, or what will happen to the naming rights to
Enron Field. The Major League baseball stadium is home to the
Houston Astros, and Enron paid $100 million to have its name on
the ballpark.
     ``The name of the company is now Dynegy,'' Watson said.
     Dynegy's acquisition requires approval from U.S. securities,
antitrust and energy regulators. Watson expects soon to share
details of the new Dynegy with regulators from the European Union
and U.K., where Enron operates a trading desk and owns a water
company and two power plants.
     ``I don't know if we are required to do so, but we will talk
to them anyway,'' Watson said.
     ``We don't think there are going to be any problems,'' Lay
said.

Hey Lyndon,

It was nice to hear from you.  We are in dired need of the upcoming vacation!  Things here have been changing by the day.  To make a long story short, my country is at war and going into a recession, the company that Kim 1, Stacy and I work for was purchased on Friday by another company after finding out that our Chief Financial Officer was involved on some questionable activities - (to the tune of about $3.5 billion) practically taking our company down single handedly, loosing about 90% of the value of our stock,  therefore, we are broke, AND my boyfriend and I broke up.    Things just aren't right.  But hopefully, things will start to get better.  I'm very glad I have a trip (that is paid for!) to look forward to!

How was your gay cruise?  I think I would have a hard time with that one myself!  I do hope all is well with you.  We will all be ready to play and relax in January!  Take care -

Kim

Life has been very busy back here on the poly. We have
just come out of wetdock and the ship is a mess but
will be awesome by the time you get here. Our first
cruise this week is a gay cruise, very strange!!!!!
Its not really my type of cruise. Seeing 2 guys
cuddling each other sleeping on the deck is a bit much
for me. I dont dislike it, its just I dont understand
it. Women are such beautiful creatures, why !!!
Anyway yes I will more than likely be here when you
get here, unless I get sacked or quit, but more than
likely I will be here.

Take Care
See you soon
Love Lyndon

MJ,

How are you doing?  Things here are definitely roller coaster status but stablizing a bit!  How was your wine tour?  I thought about you guys.  It looked like so much fun!  Elliot is thinking about having people come to Stinson Dec. 15 and 16 and I was thinking about coming a day early or leaving a day later (or maybe both!)  I am thinking that you might be out of town around there but If you are around, I would like to get together with you if it all works out.  Let me know what you think!!  And I hope all is going well for you!

Kim

El,
I am in for sure.  Just gotta look into possibly using miles.  I think Suz might be in as well.  What about Rosie?  Let me now the details!
Thanks for the invite - 

K.

My folks have offered to let us use Chez Stinson for the weekend od Dec 15-16. Do you think you guys can motivate a Houston group to the Bay Area for a few days?

Elliot Mainzer

I certainly understand your concerns and believe that they should be voiced.  I will also babysit the situation and try to make sure she abides by the rules!

We should definitely invite Rosie, but she has to promise to stay out of my parents' bedroom!

Gerald & Stacy,

I didn't which of you would have the most time to deal with this, but, I am responding to an RFP for provide gas to several Frito Lay plants in California for the term Dec, 2001 through October, 2003.  It will be a full-requirments transaction whereby we manage the imbalance and transportation.  Based on the request, they would like to execute a GISB with special provisions that I have attached.  I have also included a confirmation form they would like to use to confirm the transaction for each of their facilities.

ALL REQUESTED MODIFICATIONS TO THIS CONTRACT FORM MUST BE SUBMITTED WITH THE RFP RESPONSE which will be emailed to them by noon central time on Thursday, Nov. 15.  Sorry for the rush, I just received the RFP yesterday and didn't realize this was a stipulation until just now.  No modifications indicates that the proposed language is acceptable.

I am also attaching the RFP itself.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  this will be a pretty standard full-requirements offer.  Please let me know if you have any questions or what I can do to help.

Thanks,

Kim

   

el, I think you sent this to the wrong place.  just talked to suzanne and she is in - as long as we can get there cheap.  As for Sunday, when do you think people will leave.  Being 2 hours later here in houston, we might have to leave pretty early.  what are your thoughts?

We can come in on Thursday evening (so we can spend friday in the wine country) and leave sunday afternoon at 3:20 for 20000 miles!  So we are definitely in!  What do you think?

I understand the need to find cheap flights. this whole enron meltdown has forced us all to take a closer look at our personal balance sheets. i imagine it might be pretty hard to take monday off, but one option would be to catch a morning flight home on monday. i'd be very inclined to do so, but it may be hard for you guys. maybe you have some work to do in California?? i will probably stay through sunday night. check with southwest airlines-- they may have a cheaper fare to oakland, and i can definitely get you to that airport. any thoughts on who else from houston might want to come down?

Dear All,

There will be no Gas Rehedges for Eastern for COB 13/11/01 as Residual Discounted Delta Volumes are below the Rehedge limit of 1 BCF.

Regards
Suzanne

Quite commendable, I have to say.
As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Amy,

Well they just cancelled my B-737 training that I was scheduled for on
Thanksgiving. Had started class last Sunday but suddenly they cancelled DFW
737 base flying. Thought it might be a little late to schedule our
Thanksgiving for the homeless strays.  Let me know a head count if we need
to do this.  Looks like I am one of the strays this year!

John

Sports: Volleyball, pool or table tennis.

Schilke, are you doing Thanksgiving for the "homeless" this year?

Pookie and eating lunch at her parents' house, but were going to go by your
place after, if you  are doing the "homeless"  thing.

U.S. STILL ON TRACK FOR ANOTHER COOL WINTER
November 15, 2001 - Don't let the recent short-sleeve temperatures fool you: The U.S. remains on track for a repeat of last winter, NOAA <http://www.noaa.gov/> forecasters said Thursday. In an update to its official winter 2001-02 outlook <http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s794.htm>, NOAA's National Weather Service <http://www.nws.noaa.gov/> said it still expects the coming winter to bring abrupt swings in temperature and precipitation, including heavy lake-effect snows in the Northeast and Midwest, cold air outbreaks in the South and the potential for Nor'easters <http://www.noaa.gov/questions/question_010901.html> along the East Coast. (Click NOAA image for larger view of snowfall in Long Island, New York, on March 5, 2001.)
Forecasters said the winter outlook update, which covers December 2001 - February 2002, is missing the influences of either a strong El Ni?o <http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/> or La Ni?a <http://www.elnino.noaa.gov/lanina.html> climate pattern, and paves the way for a winter of weather extremes.
"When neither climate pattern is present, other climate factors can play a significant role in the day-to-day winter weather we experience," said James Laver, acting director of NOAA's Climate Prediction Center <http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/>.
Laver said the other climate factors include: the Arctic Oscillation, which influences the number of cold-air outbreaks in the South and Nor'easters on the East Coast, and the Madden-Julian Oscillation, which can impact the number of heavy rain storms in the Pacific Northwest.
Regional Outlooks
?	In the Northeast, colder-than-normal temperatures are expected. Snowfall for the entire region will depend on the fluctuations of the Arctic Oscillation; 
?	The Mid-Atlantic states have equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal temperatures and precipitation. Storm tracks could bring more snow than the winters of the late 1990s, but this largely depends on the Arctic Oscillation; 
?	The Southeast should be drier than normal. Temperatures have a slightly enhanced chance of averaging above normal; 
?	In the upper Midwest and Great Lakes, temperatures should be lower than normal, with more sub-zero days than the average of recent winters. There are equal chances for cumulative precipitation to be above normal, normal, or below normal; 
?	The northern Great Plains and Rockies should see below-normal temperatures with more sub-zero days than experienced on average during the winters of the late 1990s, but wet and mild weather is more likely for the southern Plains. The central Rockies can expect equal chances of above normal, normal, or below-normal precipitation and temperatures; 
?	In the Northwest, there are equal chances for above normal, normal, or below-normal rain and snow. Heavy coastal rain events are more likely compared to the previous three winters. A repeat of the near-record dryness seen last winter is unlikely; 
?	Expect warmer-than-normal temperatures in most of the Southwest and equal chances of above normal, normal or below-normal precipitation; 
?	Southwestern Alaska can expect a wet winter. The rest of Alaska and all of Hawaii can expect equal chance of above normal, normal, or below normal temperatures and precipitation. 
The 2001-02 winter outlook will be updated on Dec. 13, 2001, at 3 p.m. EST.

Thanks for the funny!  We had a rough couple of days and I am tired of being the daily headline but I am told that I am safe - at least from loosing my job.   Although most of us have been told that we are safe - for now - everyone seems kind of down.   I'll be glad when things are back to "normal", whatever that is.  Talk to you soon -

Kim

Heya.  Hope things are good.  How are you looking with the buyout?  I
haven't heard any screams from Midtown so I'll take that as a good sign.
Thought this might put a smile on your face.

Cheers Bye, Kim

Kim, 

How's the hiring climate over in Barry's world?  The future here in broadband obviously is bleak.  I'm trying to generate job leads at a company that is quickly shrinking.  Not an enviable position.  

Attached is a resume.  Any inquiries on my behalf are appreciated. As for added comments to hiring people: although I've spent my entire 2 1/2 year Enron career at EBS, I've been in trading, structuring, and origination roles the entire time. I can model and sell w/ the best of them.  I also know Jean Mrha and Tom Gros well. (If that's worth anything.)

Any help is much appreciated. 

Thanks

Bring EJ with you

john,

I think my parents are coming to houston and I think EJ might be around on
thanksgiving day so you are more than welcome to come to houston and hang
with us.  we will be having turkey!  Let me know what you think.

Kim

Well they just cancelled my B-737 training that I was scheduled for on
Thanksgiving. Had started class last Sunday but suddenly they cancelled DFW
737 base flying. Thought it might be a little late to schedule our
Thanksgiving for the homeless strays.  Let me know a head count if we need
to do this.  Looks like I am one of the strays this year!

John

Sports: Volleyball, pool or table tennis.

Schilke, are you doing Thanksgiving for the "homeless" this year?

Pookie and eating lunch at her parents' house, but were going to go by your
place after, if you  are doing the "homeless"  thing.

I have responded to PurEnergy to supply gas to two of their power plants located in southern california.  We are going to propose a gas daily option with a demand charge.  The contact for credit is Ms. Suzette Brower @ 315-448-2266 and her email is sbrower@purenergyllc.com.

Let me know if you have any questions. 

thanks

Kim

Please e-mail me your network user id and password today.  Also, notify me if there is anything particular to your configuration that I should know about.  I will be coming in on Sunday to ensure that our programs and hardware are running correctly after the move.  

Thanks.

Heya.  Hope things are good.  How are you looking with the buyout?  I
haven't heard any screams from Midtown so I'll take that as a good sign.
Thought this might put a smile on your face.

Kim:

It sounds like there have been some changes in the settlements group that have resulted in a billing error for Smurfit.  My guess is they are using the spreadsheet rather than the SoCal Gas imbalance statement to set the volume.

Can you please check and get back to John?

Chris,

Enron may have a new person in charge of SSCC Vernon's account now as there
are billing differences once again. Hannah Nguyen was kind enough to send
SSCC a bill for October 2001 for 68,243 mmbtu's of gas. The sum of the
delivered volumes from Southern California Gas for the accounts SSCC Vernon
is paying for seems to be closer to 108,975. Upon advising Houston of the
additional payment that would be received for the underbilling, SSCC Vernon
received a fax to the effect that actually 109,130 mmbtu's were due.

It may be unclear that SSCC Vernon pays for delivered gas volumes, or the
volumetric information SSCC faxed to Houston may not have been legible. In
any event, attached is the e-file used for the calculation for Enron's
review.

are you talking about JS?  thought she was going to kentucky?  I was going with my friend Elizabeth but she is probobly going to have to work on Friday.  So I may just ride back with her.  Trying to figure it  all out.

I spose so but we might have to take stupid as well I just found out.

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

Thanks,

Kim

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  

Let's meet today at 3:00 in conference room 6106 to discuss the griffth deal and our reply to citizens.  If you are unable to make it, please let me know.

Thanks,

Kim

Jim,

Attached is Enron's response to your Request for Natural Gas Supply Proposals.    If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at 713-853-0685.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sean,

I will have a written response to you by tomarrow - the desk is "assuring me" that they have made some changes and we should expect better performance.  Let me know what else you need and I will get this response to you tomarrow.

Kim!  Good to hear from you.  I could use that beer right now!  My weekend
was busy (holiday shopping, etc.)  Did you do anything fun?  RE:  the party,
I would have the party at my place, but I have a one bedroom apt. (not

get this thing planned, and soon!

I am heading to Tennessee on Wednesday.  I hope it's cold there, I'm ready
for some winter weather... Dallas sounds nice, I hope you have a great time.
Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!!!!

04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a "material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern," it warned.

19:23 19Nov2001 RSF-Enron sounds debt alarm, reduces reported earnings

    By C. Bryson Hull
    HOUSTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Humbled energy giant Enron Corp. <ENE.N> on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt by next week and reduced its already-abysmal third-quarter earnings.
    The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week.   That marked the start of a nine-day period that expires on Nov. 26, during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships.
    If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash.
    The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat.
    Enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share. The move reflects adjustments made after the quarter's end, Enron said.
    On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001. On Nov 8, Enron said it had restated earnings for 1997-2000 and that net income for the four-year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported.
    It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust.
    Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and "would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern," the company wrote.
    Enron had released those figures earlier, but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability.
    CREDIT COULD BE A KILLER
    Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to "Baa3" and "BBB-minus," just one notch above "junk" status. Each warned it may cut its respective ratings again. Moody's also cut Enron's short-term debt rating, which affects  commercial paper, to "Not Prime," a junk rating.
    In nearly all of its partnership deals, Enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels. At the close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were at $9.06 - well below the trigger prices.
    All of the partnerships, which Enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet, have become the once-proud company's bane. The SEC is investigating potential conflict-of-interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow served as general partner.
    Enron had to extract itself from those partnerships, which led to a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity.
    The revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory, leaving Enron to be bought on Nov. 9 by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N> for the fire-sale price of $9 billion in stock.
    In an unusual note, Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant, per SEC regulations, because of "the need of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditors, to complete their review procedures."
    Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion.

Settlements found the problem they had with billing LADWAP and has corrected it.  

Please let me know if you have any more questions.

when can we meet today to discuss our written response to Citizens?

Let's not forget the fact that Citizens has cut Enron more during the life of the deal.  The only company walking away from a deal will be Enron.  We will set up a meeting to discuss fixing the problem.

Thanks,
Mike

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  

FYI, We are addressing this today.  Grigsby knows they are pissed and he knows that I am pissed.  If they expect me to continue to sell products involving service from their desk, and they get paid for that service, they are going to have to do a better job.  Citizens isn't the only one that I feel has service issues from the desk. 
 
Kim:

I know you cannot control this.  If we can say anything to give our side of the story, we should.  Grigsby should know that the customer is a little pissed.

Did either one of you guys work on the APEA (American Public Energy Agency) gas prepay deal?  I think it was done in 1999 and Laird Dyer worked on it.  We are changing one of the counterparties and delivery points so we are going to need to amend some of the documents.  I know you two are going to fight over this so as soon as the dust settles, let me know who wins!

Thanks, 

Kim

Call me if you have questions or don't know what deal I am talking about.  I have copies of some of the documents so they may be helpful.

if you are on continental, are you flying into IAH?  Maybe that is what I should do and we could take one cab.  what do you think?

in the case that you want to call him!

of course, I'm just tagging with you guys.  Did you ever go to Christopher's?  I might go pick up some wine - any requests or recommendations?  And where do you want to leave from? 

Is it okay to leave around 3:00?

Terri,

We are definitely watching the ballgame at suzanne's on saturday.  I am getting an email list together so if you have some people you want to add, just let me know.  How was Tennessee and your Thanksgiving?  Mine was just so, so.  Worrying about work and my friends (and self) getting laid off.  I do hope all is well with you - call me sometime this week -

Kim

Kim!  Good to hear from you.  I could use that beer right now!  My weekend
was busy (holiday shopping, etc.)  Did you do anything fun?  RE:  the party,
I would have the party at my place, but I have a one bedroom apt. (not
conducive to parties).  Tell Suzanne that it will all work out!  We need to
get this thing planned, and soon!

I am heading to Tennessee on Wednesday.  I hope it's cold there, I'm ready
for some winter weather... Dallas sounds nice, I hope you have a great time.
Have a safe and happy Thanksgiving!!!!

Terri,

What's going on and how was your weekend?  We are still working on the
TN/FLA party - Suzanne is worried about enough places for people to sit -
but I say she shouldn't worry - just have a lot of beer!  Are you going to
see PH over the holiday?  Don't know for sure what I am doing yet -
thinking about going to Dallas - gotta work out the logistics though.
Let's get together for a beer soon -

Kim

I just spoke to Jan Kennedy and they are going out for an RFP for their gas supply once our contract with them runs out.  She "recommended" that I tak e a look at your response to the last RFP because it was so good - far surpassing any of the other responses!!  If you still have a copy or a file of that response, would you mind if I took a look at it? 

thanks,

Hey,

What's been going on?  Hopefully something besides work!  Finally getting moved in - well - almost.  Still have the junk room!  Went to mexico for a few days and it rained the entire time, which wasn't much fun.  Hoefully my next trip will be better!   anyway, it looks like I will be in Phoenix June 28 - 29.  If you are around, I would love to get together!

Hope all is well -

Monica and Karla:

The attached draft Natural Gas Services Agreement contains the remainder of
my suggested revisions to the document, beginning with Article 12 (where I
stopped renumbering!).  There are no additional changes to the redlined
portion of the draft (Articles 1 thru 9) I sent yesterday.

Let me know as soon as you find out about the time scheduled for the
conference call with Enron.

Of course you can use me as a ref.  And good luck.  I think Barry and I are coming to AZ the 28 - 29.  I know we will be coming to your office so hopefully I will get to see you.  Be sure to bring pictures of Abri!

All is well in Phoenix...except the heat, but that's the usual gripe.  Glad
to hear you are not under water.  Thought you were leaving the extreme rain
behind when you left Portland.  Oh yeah....those darn tropical storms.  Hey
I might use you as a reference if that is okay.  I am flying to Dallas next
week for an interview.  They haven't asked for any yet, but I would like to
okay it with you in case they do.

I am lucky as I unknowingly bought a house on a little hill with great
drainage!!  My street flooded but it didn't make it up to my house.  Water
did get in the house behind me.  But all is well and everyone I know is ok.
Only a couple of car fatalities that I know of - thanks for checking!  How
are you?

Attached is a clean and red-lined version of the latest draft of the above-referenced agreement.

Stacy

  

Hi guys,

I have been working on some pricing information for you guys and have attached the fixed prices after today's close for Nymex, Aeco, San Juan, and Permian as we discussed.  The guys on our structuring desk are pricing up calls and puts for the same delivery points for August thru March and August thru July, 2002.  The Nymex was crushed today, about $.13 down for the year strip.  The balance of 2001 was down almost $.20.  The balance of 2001 is up about $.015 on access.  The socal basis fell significantly today as well.

Let me know if there is anything else you need.  Jack, I will send you the storage info I have asap.  Had trouble accessing it today for some reason.  I will send the option pricing as soon as I get it.

Thanks,

Kim

 

Hi guys,

Attached is the swap picture we discussed.  I am working on some call prices as well and will send them asap.  Prices fell significantly today - probobly $.20 going one year out at the PG&E City gate.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

 

I have another meeting from 2:00 - 3:00pm.  I would only be available for the first 30 minutes.  

TK, since you, Steve and I are traveling tomorrow, could you work with Lynn to schedule this meeting for Wednesday.  You, for sure, need to be there.  

Thanks, Kim.

	
	I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
	procedure Transwestern is using today for the SoCal Needles "window" allocation.

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?

	I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We are looking
	at Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m.

	Please let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you.  Then we will
	get a room and let everyone know date and time.  

	Thanks. Lynn

Thanks, Audrey!  Kim.

All Team Members:  Please try to get your bullet items to Kim for her review no later than 10:00a on Friday mornings.  Kim has an awesome responsibility of getting the bullets to Steve by 11:00a on Friday mornings.

We will need your assistance in obtaining these objectives.  Let's try our best to get items in on time, even if means updating a few items after lunch.

Can you assist me in this effort?  Yes, you can!!!! (smile)

Happy Thanksgiving.  Kim.

	Kim -- Do you know someone named Audrey Robertson?  She books the 49/C2 room.  I need to know if someone 
	turned in a purse and a briefcase this morning (left there).  And, if not, who booked that room after Stan's 8 am -9:30 
	staff meeting was over.

	(I've tried to call her; got her no. from Cindy Stark, but no answer.  I don't know if she is in today or not.  I went up to 
	49/C2 and no purse or briefcase is there.  Yes -- I am losing it!)

Thanks for the chuckle! Kim.

THOU SHALT NOT SKIM FLAVOR FROM THE HOLIDAYS 

By Craig Wilson, USA TODAY 

I hate this time of year. Not for its crass commercialism and forced 
frivolity, but because it's the season when the food police come out 
with their wagging fingers and annual tips on how to get through the 
holidays without gaining 10 pounds. You can't pick up a magazine 
without finding a list of holiday eating do's and don'ts. Eliminate 
second helpings, high-calorie sauces and cookies made with butter, 
they say. Fill up on vegetable sticks, they say. Good grief. Is your 
favorite childhood memory of Christmas a carrot stick? I didn't think 
so. Isn't mine, either. A carrot was something you left for Rudolph. 
I have my own list of tips for holiday eating. I assure you, if you 
follow them, you'll be fat and happy. So what if you don't make it to 
New Year's? Your pants won't fit anymore, anyway. 

1. About those carrot sticks. Avoid them. Anyone who puts carrots on 
   a holiday buffet table knows nothing of the Christmas spirit. In 
   fact, if you see carrots, leave immediately. Go next door, where 
   they're serving rum balls. 

2. Drink as much eggnog as you can. And quickly. Like fine 
   single-malt scotch, it's rare. In fact, it's even rarer than 
   single-malt scotch. You can't find it any other time of year but now. 
   So drink up! Who cares that it has 10,000 calories in every sip? It's 
   not as if you're going to turn into an egg- nogaholic or something. 
   It's a treat. Enjoy it. Have one for me. Have two. It's later than 
   you think. It's Christmas! 

3. If something comes with gravy, use it. That's the whole point of 
   gravy. Pour it on. Make a volcano out of your mashed potatoes. Fill 
   it with gravy. Eat the volcano. Repeat. 

4. As for mashed potatoes, always ask if they're made with skim milk 
   or whole milk. If it's skim, pass. Why bother? It's like buying a 
   sports car with an automatic transmission. 

5. Do not have a snack before going to a party in an effort to control 
   your eating. The whole point of going to a Christmas party is to eat 
   other people's food for free. Lots of it. Hello? Remember college? 

6. Under no circumstances should you exercise between now and New 
   Year's. You can do that in January when you have nothing else to do. 
   This is the time for long naps, which you'll need after circling the 
   buffet table while carrying a 10-pound plate of food and that vat of 
   eggnog. 

7. If you come across something really good at a buffet table, like 
   frosted Christmas cookies in the shape and size of Santa, position 
   yourself near them and don't budge. Have as many as you can before 
   becoming the center of attention. They're like a beautiful pair of 
   shoes. You can't leave them behind. You're not going to see them 
   again. 

8. Same for pies. Apple. Pumpkin. Mincemeat. Have a slice of each. 
   Or, if you don't like mincemeat, have two apples and one pumpkin. 
   Always have three. When else do you get to have more than one 
   dessert? Labor Day? 

9. Did someone mention fruitcake? Granted, it's loaded with the 
   mandatory celebratory calories, but avoid it at all cost. I mean, 
   have some standards, mate. 

10. And one final tip: If you don't feel terrible when you leave the 
    party or get up from the table, you haven't been paying attention. 
    Reread tips. Start over. But hurry! Cookieless January is just 
    around the corner.

The Interconnect would be downstream of the El Paso take off from the Ignacio lateral..   The drawing attached if pretty crude but....... this is what I was talking about..

 
The legal description for the proposed Southern Trails interconnect north of the Blanco Hub is Sec. 13, T29N, R11W, San Juan County, NM.  This is on the old NWPL receipt line coming off the 30" Ignacio - Blanco line into the Blanco Hub upstream of the El Paso Blanco measurement.  Bottom line is it's the same place we talked about earlier this week.

Lee,

Here is the Agave I/C agreement.  I made a few changes.  Please review:

Para 1:  Agave....a New Mexico corporation...
Article 2.1:  term of ...five (5) years
Article 3.3:  New paragraph.  Please wordsmith as necessary.  Also, notice the weird indentation on 3.1 and 3.2.  Can you help this?
Article 8.5:  filled in detail on Agave contacts as per their request. 

Let me know.  Thanks, Kim. 

Kevin,

We can meet at 3:00pm in EB1336.  Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kirk,

I just wanted to check on you and see how the approval process was going.  Have you heard from the ACC Commissioners yet?  Please let me know if we can do anything for you.

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim.
Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a vote
yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be approved,
and may opt to resubmit.
Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in the
ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
Commissioners....major blunder.
I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect agreement,
etc.
Best regards,
Kirk

Thanks Lindy.  Have a good time in sunny California!  K.

Well, now my curiosity is peaked.  I'm sorry I will miss it.  We did just get confirmation this morning on our SoCal meeting.

HAVE FUN!
Lindy

This is just a Reminder!!!!

 << OLE Object: Microsoft ClipArt Gallery >> Breakfast will be served at 7:15 AM and we will begin promptly at 8:00AM.  Once again we encourage you to dress casually, but keep in mind the Hotel Room may be Cold!!!  Maps to the Secret Social will be handed out following the afternoon brainstorming event!!!  
		We look forward to seeing YOU there!!!  

This is a sweet note.  Let me know what he says.  K.

Mike & Cheryl -

We heard yesterday about Cheryl's illness.  You guys have been such special
friends to us, we both wanted to know if there was anything we could do to
help.

If Cheryl is going to be going down to MD Anderson for treatment, either on
an outpatient or inpatient basis, consider this:  our house is less than a
ten-minute walk from MD Anderson.  We have a spare bedroom and free parking.
If it works out that Mike drops Cheryl off and needs a place to stay, either
overnight or periodically during the day, we'll leave a key at the front
desk of the Spires and one (or both) of you can base out of our place.

And if you need someone to take care of the menagerie up north, I'm sure we
can figure out how to get that done while you're staying down south.
Remember that I make the reverse commute up there every day, and you both
have a lot of friends and co-workers that can pitch in to help out.

We think the world of you guys and want to help.  Let us know how we can.

Kim & John

FYI, Kim.

Kim,

	This was filed yesterday.

 

Lee, 

Please look this over.  This is the Questar I/C agreement for the east leg of the Southern Trails Leg.  Let me know if I can send it out.  Thanks, Kim.

 

Lorraine, 

Here are the proposals that we sent to SW Gas last week.  

Thanks, Kim.

  

Steve,

FYI, Kirk did not have good news on the approval for Big Sandy yesterday, but it looks like they have Plan B moving forward.  I will stay in touch with Kirk and keep you posted. 

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim.
I trust that you are hanging in there with all of the recent activity.
As for Big Sandy, the project was denied a "permit" yesterday by the ACC
commissioners, driven principally by water issues.
As for next steps, Caithness plans to submit a new filing for the same
project, getting their "ducks in a row" on the water issues, and perhaps
even conceding to the potential of dry cooling versus wet cooling.
They expect to file this within the next 60 days.
Thus, with a little luck, we will be back in the game on this project with
an induced delay.
I will keep you posted along the way....please do the same for me regarding
any offerings/news/etc from your side.
Thanks for all of your help so far on the project.
Best regards.

Kirk,

Well, I am sorry that the project was denied a permit yesterday.  I know that you (and many others) have worked very hard on this project.  Transwestern is still very interested in having Big Sandy connect to our pipe.  I will stay in touch with you over the next few months, but please don't hesitate to call me if there is anything we can do to help you.

Thanks for keeping me posted,

Thanks!  This is great news!  K.

Good news.

Larry wanted me to let you know that the air permits for Stations 3 & 4 were issued yesterday (11/19).  The permits for Stations 1 & 2 are expected by the end of next week.

Attached is a schematic showing the proposed location of the Questar Southern Trails interconnect.

Dear Gaylen and Jodi,

Attached, please find the Questar Southern Trails Interconnect Agreement and drawing of its location in the San Juan area.  The estimated cost of the interconnect is $702,000.  This cost estimate is what we call a "Level A" which means it is + or - 30%.  Once we execute the agreement, we will perform a "Level B" which will narrow the cost range. 

Please review and let me know if you have any questions or comments.  

Thanks, 

Kim.

      

P.S.   I'm having trouble attaching the drawing.  I will send it under separate cover.  

Dear Gaylen and Jodi,

I was having technical difficulty in sending this drawing with the I/C agreement.  Here it is.  Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks, Kim.

Attached is a schematic showing the proposed location of the Questar Southern Trails interconnect.

Ron Matthews

 

Yes, I will wait for you.  Thanks, Kim.

I am in a due diligence meeting until 6:00.  I can review afterwards and get back to you tonight.  Is that ok?

I wanted to send a note to let everyone know that the rate for the firm transportation agreement with Agave (K#26490 & #26606) increases by $0.01 for all volumes west and east effective November 1, 2001 through October 31, 2003 as follows:

New Rate
For West Flow volumes of 70,000 MMBtu/d - $0.15 (#26490)
For East Flow volumes of 40,000 MMBtu/d - $0.07  (#26606)

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.  

Thanks, 

Kim   X33098

Glen,

Interesting reading from one of our customers. Kim.

I just got this and thought you might find it interesting as well.

Amy

Dear Colleague,

The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper, The California
Electricity Crisis: Lessons for Other States, which I wrote. The paper is
available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com
<http://www.ehirst.com/> . Please let me know if you have any comments on
the paper.

Here is a summary of the paper:

        California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter
electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public
Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring
competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and
more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy
suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.

        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April
1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster
for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities.
Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable
concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity
industry. 

        Although a few states have decided, based on the California
experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome.
Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are
that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for
California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and
prices affect market outcomes.

        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity
regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred
beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance
to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity
industry. This section makes several points: 

*	Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new
generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned
to meet growing loads. 

*	Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural
gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads,
maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large
regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants. 

*	Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and
voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale
markets). 

*	Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with
artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to
offer retail services without favoring individual competitors. 

*	Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply
and price risks. 

*	Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy,
ancillary services, and transmission congestion. 

*	Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and
vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and
transmission). 

        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and
prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer
efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve
reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing
options. 

        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is
turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because
electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is
our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy
to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a
real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the
same time. 

        Although the problems that have occurred in California are
substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should
focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and
accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to
recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond
the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and
wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to
have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces
time varying prices. 

        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for
wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will
enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and
price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability
services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict,
and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants
will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers. 

Eric

Glen,

This is very interesting reading.  Please read this (sorry, it's kind of long) and let me know if it meshes with what you think is happening in California.  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,
Thanks again to you and Lorraine for a wonderful time at lunch yesterday. I
hope we can do it on a much more regular basis. Here is the web site with
the CEC report I was referring to yesterday. I think this is a useful
reference; the FERC is giving it some serious thought as well.

Amy

Larry, here is draft #2.

Again, many thanks!  K.

 

Lorraine, 

When you get back in the office, let's talk about the new interest to connect into the SJ Hub.  I, too, have a few customers who are interested in connecting into the Hub.  We should generally discuss this from a big picture perspective so we can understand the total limitations of the Hub and lay out our strategy for moving forward.

Also, FYI, in your EDG comment below, our pipeline profile has all the lat/long locations specified if that helps identify the locations best for power plant sites.

Thanks, Kim.

El Paso Field Services - EPFS has contacted TW with interest in tying in the Blanco and Chaco Plants on the San Juan Lateral.  A tentative meeting has been scheduled for 8/10 to meet with EPFS to discuss locations and cost estimates.  (I need Ron to go with me).

Amoco Florida - BP has requested TW consider increasing the meter at the Amoco Florida Plant.  Currently, it is sized for receipts of 165,000 MMBtu/d and BP is interested in doubling the size of the interconnect.  I am waiting on a Facility Planner.

Red Rock filing - a filing was made on 7/31 to FERC requesting approval to utilize an incremental 5 acres at each station for construction purposes.  A Director's Letter must be received because of this change in our construction procedures and is expected to be issued by FERC within 2 to 3 weeks.

NGPL Eddy - I have received Facility Planning's preliminary comments on the Interconnect Agreement and am still awaiting Legal's comments in order to return TW's comments to NGPL.  

Energy Development Group - I have attempted to continue to try to work with EDG to locate TW's pipe in specific locations in AZ and NM in order for them to better site power plants off TW.  This week there have been no Facility Planners to help me with this and I have a call into Tiny for assistance.

Lorraine 

Jean,  all is correct except that Steve Harris should get two flat screens instead of Michelle and me getting a third panel.  However, I did want to mention to you that I would like for Michelle to have a third flat screen since she handles all of our EOL transactions thereby giving her a screen for Dashboard/Pipeline Profile, Outlook and EOL.  Is there an extra one around for her?  
 
Many thanks, 
Kim

I have not received these yet.  I am checking on thru Buyer-Mark Adleman
 
Thanks, Karon

Karon -- also the laptop for Kim???  Thanks.  Jean
 
Karon -- did we get in those 14 15" flat panels yet?  They need to go to the following people...
 
1 to Kim Watson (she already had 2)
1 to Michelle Lokay (she already has 2)
2 to Palu G.
2 to Jan Moore
2 to Lorainne Lindberg
2 to TK Lohman
2 to Lindy Donoho
2 to Jeff Fawcett's desk (he's gone.. right next to Lorainne)

Kay,

Thanks for the update.  Actually, I did not realize that Jeff's computer had Prophet X on it.  I would like to get together with you in the next few days and discuss the software package with you.  We may indeed wish to keep a user on it but I would like to understand it better.  I'm out of the office tomorrow, but will be back in on Thursday.

Thanks, Kim.

Steve and Kim,

Since Jeff Fawcett left, do either of you have an interest in giving his desktop access to Prophet X software (via the FIMI server)  to someone else in your group?  Since TW is still paying Jeff's user fee, I need to either have FIMI remove his permission from the server, or I can have them change the permission on the server to a different user.

Please let me know what you would like to do, and I'll take the appropriate action with FIMI.

Thanks,

Kay

Questar Can't Sell from Proposed Pipeline Under New CA Rate 
Although not giving up its search for customers in California, Salt Lake City-based Questar Corp.'s oil-to-natural-gas converted pipeline from the Four Corners of New Mexico remains stymied in operating its portion within California under a newly revised "peaking tariff" for Southern California Gas Co., according to Questar officials who have been analyzing the new rate established Aug. 2 by state regulators.  Questar is looking at alternative uses for the California portion of the approved interstate pipeline. 
"We can't work with (the rate) as it is," said Chad Jones, a Questar spokesperson. "It definitely doesn't go far enough to remove the obstacles in the way of developing new pipelines in Southern California. It still doesn't level the playing field. Although it is better than the current RLS (residual load service) tariff; it still punishes customers who want to take partial service from a SoCalGas competitor. 
"Customers still have to pay higher interruptible penalties than in other parts of the state, and higher rates for balancing services. We're at the point where we're not going to stop trying to market capacity on Southern Trails, but we're definitely at the point where we have to consider some alternative uses for the California portion (of the 700-miles, 16-inch-diameter pipeline)." 
One of the alternatives would be to operate the California part of the line as a petroleum or liquids line carrying product from the Long Beach Harbor area to existing petroleum or liquid products pipelines in and around the California-Arizona border. That's the alternative, however, Jones said, but finding a customer for a major portion of the converted pipeline's 120 MMcf/d capacity is still Questar's preference. 
After months of reviewing the issue and weighing alternatives, the California Public Utilities Commission last week established a new "peaking" or standby charge for customers taking partial service from a SoCalGas competitor, allowing those customers to pay only for the amounts of gas they use at any given time from the local gas transmission and distribution utility, SoCalGas. 
The CPUC tried to balance the need for the local gas utility to be made whole so added fixed costs did not have to be shifted to other customers, while trying to "encourage and promote additional natural gas resources without encouraging cherry-picking or overbuilding," according to CPUC President Loretta Lynch. 
Questar officials said Tuesday they have pretty much exhausted their appeal resources, and they are "not about to go head-to-head with the established big boys" in lobbying California's governor or state legislature, Jones said. "Thus, we're still looking for a large customer who would be willing to break the gridlock in Southern California in the name of promoting competition." 
The east-of-California portion of the Southern Trails pipeline is already fully subscribed and will start operations mid-year next year, Jones said.

Kim -- can we reschedule lunch?  Sorry.  Jean

Dot,

I'm so glad you know what the problem is.  My brother had a similar micro-surgery last year.  He went home on the same day and was only off work for a couple of days.  Will you be able to start a rehab program/routine after surgery?  Is your doctor comfortable with you traveling to Italy this fall or will it be a wait and see situation to see how you are doing post surgery?  Keep me posted.  Thanks, Kim.

	Kim--

	Got the news today -- good news is we now know what the problem is & it can be fixed.  I have a protruding disc between L5 and S1 that is "impinging 
	upon the nerve root for L5" -- i.e., causing the numbness in my left leg and foot.  Bad news is -- surgery is the fix.  However, the neurologist says that 
	recovery from the surgery is pretty short, in light of the micro-surgery they now do on this.  Trying to get in to see the surgeon now, to see how soon 
	I can schedule something.  Keep you informed...

	--Dot

	Kim --

	Thanks for the note -- I had a cat scan yesterday, along with more hip x-rays.  Tomorrow, I have something called an EMG -- "electro-myogram" -- sounds 
	similar to the old "myleograms", so I just assumed it would be similar -- dye into the spinal cord & take pictures.  However, Staci looked it up on the 
	Internet for me and reported that it is a series of needle probes into various muscles to check for nerve problems, and is somewhat painful -- just what I want 
	at this point!   Surely doesn't sound too great...  oh well, still hope to find something out by tomorrow around noon...
	
	I did hear from a friend of mine, who had something similar a few years ago; she opted for some injections into her back, which worked, so that would be 
	better than surgery or continuing like this, at least. The neurologist did say last week that it is not necessarily my back (altho' that is the most likely 
	cause of this) but said that it could be something in my hip...  So, maybe I'll have a number of options, like physical therapy, injections, etc. and not just 
	surgery.

	--Dot

Dot,

Please keep me posted on your tests.  Also, don't forget to tell the doctors that you just need the really BIG shot now so that you will be ready for Italy in the fall.  Don't over-do it!  I does take time for the back to heal.  

I had lunch with Sue Neville yesterday and she had some great advise for the Amalfi Coast(she and her family just returned from Italy).  On one of the islands near the Amalfi Coast, there are plenty of "natural spa's" with salt water, fresh water, hot, cold, dry and wet saunas.  Sounds like a good stop and may even be helpful to your current condition.

Stay flat!

Kim.

	Update -- went to see neurologist on Friday (only got in that early because I practically yelled at a number of people for several hours on Thursday -- I guess they think people can afford to wait 6 weeks to see if they feel any better!  They were willing to set me up with an appointment in Sept., can you imagine???).  

	Anyway, the neurologist knew what nerve is pinched but not where it is getting pinched, where the problem is coming from -- could be my back or my hip.  Having x-rays and cat scan on Monday pm, with something called EMG on Wed.  Let you know what I learn.  

	--Still flat on back in Houston...Dot

We are tracking this one down.  I'll keep you posted.  Kim.

Can we contact them to find out about how they plan to get their gas supply? I know Stan will ask me about this one.

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, "We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies." 
Regent President John Ehrman said, "The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease." 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease. 

Steve, 

Do you want Audrey to have one or two flat screens on her desk?

Kim.

I just wanted to get back with you on the Salt Dome Storage question you asked earlier.  I have not been able to find anyone in TW who has knowledge of exploring it, but per Kevin's recent message, it looks like SWG is beginning to pursue it.  Do you have any comments or thoughts?  I will be in Omaha on Thursday of this week for a RM meeting, maybe we can hook up for a few minutes and visit about this.

Thanks, Kim.

At our meeting Thurs 7/19 with SouthWest Gas, Tom Armstrong informed us that SWG is the property and mineral rights holder for this salt dome north of the TW line near Kingman.  SWG is completing a feasibility and engineering analysis on developing the potential gas storage site.  I indicated that TW / Enron would welcome an opportunity to work with SWG in developing the storage field and Tom was very receptive to the idea.

SWG refers to the project as their Pataya or Red Lake storage field.  The project would be 12 bcf net of pad gas, turn 12x per year, with 300mm/d deliverability.  Phase I of 6 bcf may be operational by late 2003.  Tom and I agreed to stay in touch on the project.  SWG hopes to have a decision to move forward by year end 2001.  

Hi Kevin,

Do you know anything about potiential salt dome storage near Station 1?  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim, I sent the message pasted below to Kevin 4/16/01.  As a matter of fact Kevin caught up with me Friday to chat about a peaker facility being investigated near Flagstaff and I asked him about this.  He did not have much info yet but said he was just getting to the point of having an opportunity to look into it......   

Kevin, I can't remember who was asking (or if it was even Marketing asking the question) but, a couple of weeks ago someone wanted to know if we knew of any salt domes or potential storage fields in the Needles area.   Well I kind of forgot about it for a few weeks and once I got to checking there are some salt domes in the Kingman area.  They are located about 10 miles North of Kingman and word is that El Paso had looked into developing these domes several years ago but never did anything but look.  I'm under the impression that the area is still privately owned but I'm not certain.  Anyhow, just thought we would pass this along and if this is something of interest or if you need more information let us know....  Oh yea, Transwesterns pipeline is just South of Kingman, Az.  (approximately 10 to 12 miles from the domes.)  

Tiny,

Now that we are bobbing up for air from Red Rock, I wanted to investigate this a little further.  I have not found anyone from Marketing who recalls looking at a potential salt dome storage on TW near Station 1.  Are you familiar with anything that may be happening on this?  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,

At one time there was someone in marketing looking at developing salt dome storage on TW near Station 1.  I was wondering what if any was the status of that evaluation.  Given the increasing number of power plants being installed in the area, this has the potential to reduce expansion costs where we have highly variable loads.

Gary Choquette

Thank you!  Kim.  :>)

It's done....

Here is our list from the strategy meeting.  Thanks, Kim.

Kim-

Listed below are the issues, pretty much as written, in the meeting on the West Texas Leg.  Some are self-explanatory while others are somewhat cryptic.  I will follow up with a list that better defines each issue, and you might have your guys think about each as well.  We'll get back together soon (I'm not sure I can do it this week), and discuss an action plan.

-	CS 9 fuel
-	Atoka Lateral 	We have both supply and market opportunities within the lateral itself
-	Turbocharge the Atoka #3 units
-	Look at Zia pressure obligation on the contract
-	Agave replacement gas at Atoka #3
-	Complete the loop between WT-1 and WT-2
-	Coolers to WT-2
-	Pecos compressor re-wheel and engine upgrade
-	200 	300 (WT-2 to Pecos) flow study
-	Look at Block Valve 16 bi-directional interconnect w/Sid Richardson, and ability flow incremental above 340 on the total system
-	Look at Keystone into NNG; back to TW south of WT-2
-	Check pressure of Stations 6 & 7, and PNM receipts
-	MAOP restriction on Panhandle leg due to encroachment

Let's talk.

Thanks,

MG

Palu,
 
Are we getting a portion of the 49C2 conference video?  We are getting something from one of the video rooms.  any ideas?
 
Thanks, Kim.
    FYI,
 
Audrey,  No Steve Harris's cost center is not currently charged for use of the video conference.  We are however currently assessing allocating some portion of the cost to the various users.
 
Dana
 

Dana, would you be able to tell me if Steve's Cost Center is being charged for the use of the Video Conference Room - EB-4102.  If it is, what percentage.
 
Thanks in advance,

Audrey, as far as I know, TW is not presently being charged for the Marketing Video Conference room.  Dana could probably tell you more but we were under the impression that it was all being charged to NNG.  If you do not get this resolved with Dana, let me know and I will do some additional research on it.
 
Talk to you tomorrow.

Lindy, I will be travelling to Farmington and Artesia on this day.  I will just catch up with you along the road.  

Thanks, Kim.

Please plan to attend a meeting on Tuesday, August 21st from 2:30 to 4:30 in 49C2 (video) to discuss the letter TW received recently concerning our 637 filing.  If you have not seen a copy of the brief letter, dated August 8, 2001, it reads as follows:

	"On August 15, 2000, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed pro forma tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-490-000 in compliance with Order No. 637.  Protests were filed in this proceeding.  Transwestern and its customers have been meeting to attempt to resolve some of the issues raised in the protests.  Staff understands that Transwestern may file revised pro forma tariff sheets if there is agreement with its customers on the matters at issue.

	Accordingly, you are encouraged to finalize discussions with your customers and file any revised pro forma tariff sheets in the near future.  Otherwise, Staff will proceed to process your filing based on the pro forma tariff sheets submitted on August 15, 2000."

We would like to discuss our strategy in response to this letter.

Dave,

May I ask you to take a look at this spreadsheet, please?  Steve and I are hoping to connect up with Danny tomorrow afternoon and discuss both our fuel strategy and our Index to Index Deal strategy.  I have put together some numbers on the I to I deals, but I would like to discuss them with you to make sure I am not missing anything.  Although Larry Pavlou is on vacation tomorrow, he will be conferenced into our meeting.  You are also welcome to join our meeting if you are available.  I believe that we are meeting at 1:30 tomorrow afternoon.  

            

Janell, FYI, 

John and I emailed the Hotel Mozart in Rome for availability.  I'll let you know if I hear something.  

Have a great day!  K.

Hello!

We have three couples that will be in Rome September 29, departing

Theresa,

I've been out of town the last couple of days, can we get together later today to discuss this?  

Would you be available for lunch or right after lunch?  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,

Have you thought about buying a call on the spread instead of unwinding the spread outright?  (Just a thought)

Steve,

FYI, on Larry's NYMEX update.  Kim.

In yesterday's memo to you, I mentioned that the long-term trend has shifted from down to bottoming, with a good chance for wider trading ranges and a greater chance for volatility to the upside increasing. During this period, the primary issue now is neither a support or resistance point, but instead how much time passes without making a new low.  In a macro sense, the more time prompt continuation spends without a break below the 2.881 low, the more unlikely we'll see a breakdown to new lows.  What this means is that time appears to be on the side of the bulls and not the bears.

Here's the market structure:

5.640	If we get a decisive break > 3.880, then 5.640 is minimum implied long term upside target (.382 correction of 10.100 to 2.881) 

4.490	Highest price still consistent with bear market correction.  Any reversal lower from 4.490 targets the potential for a decline to 	2.510.

3.880	If prices trade > 3.880, then most bearish scenario is greatly minimized.

3.290	Current prompt continuation price 

	
3.040	If 2.881 is a major long term low, then prices must not close < 3.040 or trade < 2.990 (.7862 and .852 of 2.881 to 3.620)	
2.990	
 

2.510	

2.170	Most bearish scenario

For Elliott Wave followers, here's the revised count which shows how the numbers above are derived:

10.100 to 5.615		<I> down

  5.615 to 7.100		<II> up

  7.100 to 2.881		<III> down

  2.881 to ?????		<IV> up
			4.490 = .382 retracement; if 4.490 is top of <IV>, then <I> = <V> implies 2.510 as end of <V> down.
			3.880 = .236 retracement; if 3.830 is top of <IV>, then <I> = <V> implies 2.170 as end of <V> down.

Call if you have questions. LP

J, you are too funny!  I am always entertained by the wonderful way in which you express yourself in these emails.  You make me laugh.  ILY, HA!  K. 

DD -

Well, perhaps your poor Texas cousins need to make another trip up there to 
see their rich Arkansas relations, their mountain hideaway and that fabulous 
object d'art that you're rumored to have on loan from the Tate (not to be 
confused with O. L. "Spud" McLanahan's "Tater" Museum, with its current 
exhibition titled "Homage to the Yam").

Once we return from Bella Italia (perhaps even planning while climbing steps 
up to or down from an Amalfi aerie, assuming we can spare enough breath to 
speak), we could look at a November or December date for a long weekend.

I can't tell you how much Kim and I are looking forward to another trip across 
the pond with the A team.  Six weeks and counting, I'm thinking, and I can 
already taste the first glass of vino rosso at Alla Rampa.  It's been too 
long.

Tonight, we're hosting a flood-delayed Father's Day (Tom) and an early 
birthday (Wanda) combo-dinner at Pappas Bros Steakhouse.  Tomorrow evening the 
Donnellys are arranging a sitter so that the grown-ups can meet for dinner and 
a movie that doesn't have a single purple dinosaur or juice box or singing 
cowboy (although there may be other music in a movie titled "Captain Corelli's 
Mandolin," I suspect -- just to get us in the mood for the trip).

Hope golf is treating you well, and that you're abusing the hell out of those 
little dimpled aerospheres.

Looking forward to seeing you guys in six weeks for la dolce vita in Roma.

Presidential Task Force on Oil spillage,Department
ofPetroleum Resources,
Victoria Island,Lagos Nigeria.BUSINESS PROPOSAL WORTH
$31.8 MILLION DOLLARS
STRICTLYCONFIDENTIAL  Dear Sir,
This proposal is coming to you with the ardent belief
that you will take advantage of our goodwill and out
of our desperation to have a trusted foreign partner
whom we can entrust our funds with for safekeeping.
This is not a fairy tale but for real. I am
Dr.Dandyson Openam, the secretary to the
PresidentialTask force on
Oil spillage in my country. We are the 6th largest
producer of crude oil in the world and more often than
not, we always experience oil spillage in the Niger
Delta region of my country. These spillage causes a
lot of havoc to inhabitants of the community and hence
contracts are awarded especially to foreign firms to
clean and mop up the spilled crude oil from the areas
affected. The spillage sometimes cover several
kilometres and the value of contract also runs into
millions of dollars. Between 1999 to 2000, some
contracts were awarded to a conglomerate of foreign
firms by  my committee. While awarding these
contracts, we have taken time to deliberately over
invoice one of them to the tune of $31.8m ( Thirty
one million, eight hundred thousand dollars)
What we did was to in addition to the original
contract sum, revaluate and approve this amount
separately and it is presently lying idle in a
suspense account with our apex bank here in Nigeria.
This amount by all standard now belongs to us but we
cannot claim it because it has been made to appear in
the ledger as belonging to a foreign contractor. What
we desire at this moment is to have this funds
transferred into a foreign account but being civil
servants who are still in active government service,
we are barred from maintaining bank accounts overseas.
Thus we have decided to solicit your assistance with a
view to going into a joint partnership to get this
fund out from the bank. At this juncture, we want you
to provide us with a bank account where this fund can
be transferred into first and thereafter, we would
come over to your country to take possession of our
share where we hope to invest part in profitable
ventures with you as our adviser. We would like to
inform you that the nature of your business or
profession at this point is immaterial  because in all
over the world, bigger firms after bidding for and
winning some contract especially in a third world
economy like ours, do subcontract part or whole of the
contract to other firms for execution. It could also
be carried out in any capacity as an individual. So,
you or your organization, having the status of a
subcontractor , with proper documentation, can file an
application for the payment of this fund in your name
and into your bank account. We have agreed in
principle to share this fund in these ratio: 74.5%
will be for my colleagues and I, 25% will be given to
you for your assistance and .5% has been earmarked to
take care of any expenses during the course of this
transaction. All modality for the smooth transfer of
this fund has been worked out and it meets all legal
and administrative requirement in Nigeria as
applicable to foreign contractors payment in the past.
If your response is in the affirmative, within a
period of two weeks or 10 working days, this fund
would have been confirmed and transferred into your
account. We have taken the risk aspect of it into
consideration and I want to assure you that it is
actually risk free as the contract will be re-awarded
in your name before the application will be made. We
will follow the procedures systematically with
flawless documentation. This is authentic.
If you feel you will be of assistance and a
beneficiary from this largesse,kindly send a reply to
this mail to that effect and I will oblige you with
more information as to the smooth take off and
conclusion of this once in a lifetime
opportunity.Thanks.Your sincerely,
Dr.Dandyson Openam.

Jan,

Thank you for keeping this up to date!  Kim.

FYI.  Received the following message from Cheri.  Looks like we are in agreement through the 20th.

Jan

Jan, sorry it took me so long to get back to you but we match exactly
through the 20th.  There are no discrepancies at all!  Yeah!

Hi Cheri.

Attached is the spreadsheet for the negotiated rate deal between Astra
and TW through August 20th.  Please review and let me know if you find
any discrepancies.

Yes, I will need everyone's passport for possible reservations on a ferry.  Thanks, Kim.

Janelle,
I trust you on the hotel.  I assume you have also enlisted a travel agent?

Kim,
I don't remember a request for passport numbers, so you need ours?

Interesting that tourist season ends in Sept but it still appears to be
full.

Hi Guys!
We're having a small amount of trouble finding a hotel in Rome on the front 
end.  So I'm going to ratchet the price level up somewhat.  If anyone has a 
problem with that - let me know.  (But be aware, you will be asked to name 
that tune and make the long distance phone calls.)
Also - to Paul and Judy - the Sheraton near the airport was full for the 
tailend of the trip.  So I'm still looking for something near the airport 
for October 11 for the 4 of us.
Also - to Kim - will send passport #'s later.  I haven't been by the bank to

pick up Dennis' passport yet.
Talk to you later,
Janell

Audrey,

Here are my bullets for the week. Michelle may have one more bullet to add to the Current Week Activity section if she closes her deal for September with Burlington.  

Thanks, I'll give you a call somewhere along the road.  Kim

Rich,

Thank you for keeping us in the loop on this unit.  Kim.

	Phil I just got off the phone with Arnold and we have been advised that in the morning around 5 o'clock eastern time is the earliest that Alstrom will have information for us. From talking with Arnold, Alstrom has to get permission from England before they can give us approval to pull the unit. Since the unit is still under warranty we'll need to wait on directions from Alstrom. The team is doing more testing with Alstrom during this time to try and figure out how much damage the unit has.

	We do have Norm Spalding's group lining up a contractor to assist in pulling the unit and transporting it for us. I'll keep everyone undated as soon as we get more information.

	Thanks
	Rich

	Subject:	Gallup Compressor

	Steve here's where we are on the Gallup Compressor. Part of the stator is damaged and we're not sure if it can be repaired in place at this time. This will be decided sometime this morning and I'll let you know. If the stator cannot be repaired in place it will have to be pulled and returned to the factory. If this happens we'll be down for (I'm guessing on this) but from past experience it will be two weeks or more. I'll be at the Gallup site this morning.

	Thanks
	Rich

Audrey, I added one more bullet from the earlier version I sent you.  Please work from this one.  

Michelle, please fill in the appropriate volume amount for the volume affected on the Gallup compressor outtage.  Also, per my voicemail to you, please check with Palu on the highlighted blue bullets to confirm that your two bullets are not already included in the numbers that Jan gave me on her bullet.  

Thanks, Kim.

Audrey,  email from home works differently than the office.  I hope this attaches this time.  Sorry. 

Thanks, Kim.

I got it....Kim Watson

please excuse the intrusion.....

however, would you please reply to this message so we can have an accurate indication of how many folks are actually getting/reading email from our list?

many thanks,

management

Theresa,  FYI, Let's talk on Wednesday.  I'm in Dallas tomorrow.  Thanks, Kim.

Dear Kim and Vernon:

This is the requested statistics of California Border - Permain spread and California Border -San Juan spread.  You can make an appointment with Krishna to discuss in more detail.

  

Best regards,
Seksan.

I have a tentative Spires Board meeting.  I should know in the next week or so if that is a firm date.  If it is not, then I would love to be at Perry's with you.  

ILY, K.

Darlin' -

Another dinner at Perry's Grille in the Woodlands, Wednesday, September 26,
6:30 p.m.  I'll be attending, but I'd love to have you there, too.

Can you make it?

JW

I probably prefer the 3 or 17.  Let's get the rest of our invites together this weekend.  ILY, K.

I've put a hold on those three Saturdays in November.  Take a look at your
calendar and let's narrow it down from there.

Couples:

Jane & Barry Hill
Lee & ___ Farrell
? (possibly Mark & ___ Montondon)

ILY,
JW

John,
Thank you for the invitation.  We'd love to come.  We don't have any plans
for Saturday, November 3rd, 10th or 17th.  Let us know.  Have a good weekend
and say hello to Kim.

Thanks again,
Jane

Darrell informed Burlington late on Friday that we will have an unplanned o=
utage next week for two days.  We will talk with their commercial folks on =
Monday morning to make sure that they are in the loop.  We anticipate that =
we can be back online by September business so Burlington can proceed ahead=
 with their September business as usual.  We will also talk with the other =
SJ players to help fill the gap so that we can maintain 800,000MMBtu/d down=
 the lateral while Burlington is down. =20

Thanks, Kim.  =20

=20

The effect will be to the Burlington (low pressure) system only.   We can s=
till flow 800 mmcfd down the lateral, we will just need to make up the low =
pressure volumes recieved from Burlington through the high pressure custome=
rs.  I've discussed with Darryl....

Today Burlington is flowing approximately 130 mmcfd.  Limited to 800 mmcfd =
down the lateral due to Gallups condition. =20
What will be the volume impact during the outage? Thanks.

A conf. call has been set up for Monday morning 9:00 a.m. CST to discuss a =
force majeure situation on the #3 unit at the San Juan Compressor Station. =
 877-795-3687 pin 475577=20

Overview:  (for those uninvolved to date)
     In a walk through of the San Juan Station with the Team Thursday eveni=
ng 8/16 it was noted that severe settling issues on yard piping existed.  T=
he Team had been working with Engineering on developing an action plan to a=
ddress over the last several months.  Upon a visual inspection we requested=
 that the Team contact a local contractor and have the pipe cover (dirt) re=
moved immediately to allow the piping to relieve itself.  This would provid=
e the necessary time to follow up with Engineering and attain feedback on t=
he status of the project and implement remedies.  The Team had a contractor=
 on location the following Monday 8/20, and work removing the cover was com=
pleted this Monday 8/27.  However, the expected results were not achieved. =
 In other words the piping did not spring back to the degree that pipe stre=
ss concerns were eliminated.  We requested that a structural engineer be se=
nt to the site immediately to evaluate the integrity of the piping.  He was=
 on location Thursday morning (8/29).  In a phone conversation with Phil Di=
ckenson (Trigon structural engineer) he mentioned that his immediate concer=
n was how this much displacement could not induce high stresses.  However, =
no pipe coating cracks were visible so he wanted an opportunity to input th=
e data in a model and evaluate prior to making any recommendations.  He did=
 offer, that at a minimum, we stand a good chance of exceeding the .5 desig=
n factor, but without reviewing the data further he would not commit to a c=
onclusion.  We asked that he work through the evening, if required, to prov=
ide the necessary information with regards to the pipes integrity.   While =
waiting on Trigons report, we notified the Team and asked that they contact=
 Foutz & Bursham (local pipeline contractor) and get an evaluation from the=
m on the estimated down time it would require in a worst case scenario to m=
ake the repairs/replacements.  (4 to 5 days)  We then requested that the Ro=
swell CDC (Ernie DeLosSantos) determine the availability of approximately 1=
50" of X42 356 wall 10" pipe, 12 ea. Y42  365 wall 90's, and 1 ea. Y42 365 =
wall 45.  (all material is available at Redman Supply in Farmington) =20

Conclusion:   =20
     Mr. Dickenson called with the results this morning and informed us tha=
t we appear to be exceeding allowable stress levels.  The stress levels cal=
culated by Dickinson were in excess of yield as follows:  1.09% of SMYS at =
the connection between the recycle/surge line and the discharge header, and=
 1.01% of SMYS at the elbow immediately outside the building wall on the 10=
" recycle line.    His recommendation was that the piping be cut and re-wel=
ded to return the piping to a lower stress condition and that suitable pipe=
 supports, not subject to subsidence, be provided.

     Conference calls with Engineering (Spalding, Eisenstein, Rance, Pebdan=
i, Minnoti ???) were set up to review the data with Mr. Dickenson and it wa=
s decided to have Greg McIlwain on location Monday in conjunction with Mike=
 McCracken to initiate the necessary repairs.  After much discussion with D=
ickenson with regards to the modeling performed, Engineering indicated that=
 the system is Operational and therefore we will remain loaded until early =
next week when repairs are made.  The repairs will be isolated to the #3 un=
it only so, the downtime is not expected to exceed 2 days (48 hours).  Howe=
ver, furhter evaluation by McIlwain will confirm timelines. =20

If anyone has questions through the weekend prior to Mondays call, I can be=
 reached at 520-853-3253.

I love this report.  How often will you send this out?  Thanks, Kim.

What do I need to do with this?  Should we be talking to our customers?  Are we all in agreement as to our position?   I just want to make sure that I'm not letting anything slip through the crack. 

Thanks, Kim.

Attached is the summary of our filing position and proposals for tariff and service revisions and a summary of protests for review prior to our discussions on Tuesday.  gh

       
Do either of you have info concerning the intervenors/protestors and their issues that could be distributed electronically before next Tuesday?  Glen, maybe you could also distribute you summary of TW's filing with that info.

Lindy - Is there a way for someone to compile a list of shippers who protested and intervened in our compliance filing and what the issues are prior to this meeting?

Please plan to attend a meeting on Tuesday, August 21st from 2:30 to 4:30 in 49C2 (video) to discuss the letter TW received recently concerning our 637 filing.  If you have not seen a copy of the brief letter, dated August 8, 2001, it reads as follows:

	"On August 15, 2000, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) filed pro forma tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-490-000 in compliance with Order No. 637.  Protests were filed in this proceeding.  Transwestern and its customers have been meeting to attempt to resolve some of the issues raised in the protests.  Staff understands that Transwestern may file revised pro forma tariff sheets if there is agreement with its customers on the matters at issue.

	Accordingly, you are encouraged to finalize discussions with your customers and file any revised pro forma tariff sheets in the near future.  Otherwise, Staff will proceed to process your filing based on the pro forma tariff sheets submitted on August 15, 2000."

We would like to discuss our strategy in response to this letter.

How was this meeting?  Any additional capacity identified?  Thanks, Kim.

I have a tentative meeting scheduled from 9:00 - 9:30.  I will attend this meeting if possible.  I have invited Michelle Lokay to sit in for the commercial group.  

John - Please advise both Michelle and me of the location for this meeting.  Thanks.

Lorraine

John,  I will be travelling on Wednesday with Mansoor to see Questar and Agave and will not be in the office to attend this meeting.  I would like to ask Lorraine Lindberg to be involved in this meeting in my absence.

Lorraine, would you be available to attend this meeting for our team regarding capacity on the mainline?  

Thanks, Kim.

Michelle,

Did everything get paid?  Is all resolved?  Thanks, Kim.

Terrific news that the meeting with EOG went well last Friday.  I will speak to Mark Kraus (EOG Commercial) to recap, in case he was not aware of the results.  An invoice needs to be sent to them for the equipment we have already ordered.  My preference is for them to pay prior to any installation.  And, of course we want to inspect everything before we pull our equipment out on September 1.  You also had a question about the Interconnect and Operating Agreement... one had already been executed last August stating Enron will operate and EOG will own.  Thanks.

I was informed by Lone Star that they have not completed their transaction with Sid Richardson and they will continue to take deliveries from TW until further notice.  (I suspect that they may not sell this asset, after all.)  Assume no sale for now, I will keep you posted if anything changes.  

Thanks, Kim.

Sorry -this should be Lonestar & not Longhorn.

It's my understanding that Transwestern currently has firm deliveries at the Lonestar Ward Co I/C which is bi-directional.  Lonestar is planning on conveying the line to Sid Richardson who will turn the line into a sour gas line.  As a result deliveries (&/or receipts) will no longer be made.   The Lonestar Ward Co I/C, is currently listed as a 311 point.    Upon Lonestar's conveyance of the line to Sid Richardson, the abandonment of the I/C point would be reported to FERC in the annual 311 Report only if ground disturbance would occur in abandoning Transwestern's facilities.  

Dan,

I do not understand what this message means.  Please advise.  

Kim.

SoCal Needles Allocation meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, July 25 at 12noon-1:30p.m. in conference room EB4102.  Lunch will be provided for those in Houston office, please let me know if you will be attending.

Thanks,
Ava-35842

	
	I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
	procedure Transwestern is using today for the SoCal Needles "window" allocation.

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?

	I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We are looking
	at Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m.

	Please let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you.  Then we will
	get a room and let everyone know date and time.  

	Thanks. Lynn

Michelle,

Any luck helping Debbie with this?  

Thanks, Kim.

I've talked with Kenny Aston, Gary See, & David Dobbs all are in Tulsa.

Thanks, Debbie

Hi Debbie,

Can you tell me who you have talked to?  Michelle is the Oneok rep and is out of town until Monday.  I will ask Michelle to assist you in this collection.  

Michelle, would you please coordinate with Deb and see if you can find the right person a Oneok for us to talk to regarding the AR issue. 

Thanks, Kim.	
Kim, 

There are some outstanding AR issues regarding ftps for Westar/KN/Oneok.  I've tried to contact them and talked to 4 different people with no avail.  The last person said he's not so sure that they are valid.  I've got to locate the contract and send to him.  I believe I'm going to need marketing assistance in collecting.  Can you tell me who I need to talk with.

Debbie

Audrey, one more name in addition to the ones I've already given you.... please add Elizabeth Brown on the invite list.  Thanks, Kim.

Tiny,

Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to come to Houston to attend this.  TW is assured the best success when all key departments are part of the strategy.  I have always appreciated your input and your enthusiasm for success.

Thanks, Kim.

Just a quick note of appreciation for the invite to this Team Building session..    It won't mean much coming from an Advisor way out on the West end of TW, but none the less, you are both to be commended for putting this togeather.  I went through the same Personality Profile with all the Teams on the West End when I started this advisor thing, and going through it again reminded me of some of my interpersonal skills that need immediate attention.  

Oh yea, I don't know if either of you are interested or familiar with the Zenger Miller Team building training sessions that are offered through ETS.  Most of the advisors are certified facilitators and a variety of team building topics are available.  I'm not the best at facilitating these sessions but, I can certainly point you all in the right direction if there is an interest or we can provide a list of the various topics and course details....   (4 to 8 hours courses typically)  Anyhow, thanks again and have a good week....

This is just a Reminder!!!!
	August 8th - Four Seasons Hotel Downtown

Mary,
I got your voicemail last week.  I am so glad you guys had a great time.  John and I leave for Italy at the end of the month for two weeks.  I am very ready........Will you be coming to Houston this fall?

Thanks, Kim.

Howdy Miss Kim,

How's your summer going?  It has been as hot here as there!!!!  We have been
in the high 90's with humidity to match.

What type of clothing did you take to Scotland?  We are planning on going
everywhere and it looks like the further north you go the cooler it gets.
Would a mix of long and short sleeve shirts be good?  Thought we would bring
a sweatshirt, jacket with hood and umbrella.  Do people wear tennis shoes
and jeans?

We leave August 6th and can hardly wait!  Have reservations for the Tattoo
and two nights booked in Edinburgh.  The travel agent didn't feel we would
have any problem finding a B&B along the way.

Thanks for the advice!

Hugs,

M

Steve and Dave,

As a follow up from our meeting on August 16, we all had the question about=
 what, if any, price risk we had on the fuel portion of the Index to Index =
deals.  Here are my thoughts...

For purposes of this discussion, let's just talk about how the Dynegy, San =
Juan to SoCal Needles firm transport for 35,000 MMBtu/d for Calendar 2003 c=
ould impact our fuel risk.  Dynegy will not be giving us fuel in-kind for t=
his transaction.  All fuel needed for scheduled volumes on this contract wi=
ll have to be provided by TW.   In a normal year TW over collects approxima=
tely 25,000 MMBtu/d in fuel.  Because we will now need some of this over co=
llected amount to provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal, we actually have so=
mething less than the 25,000 MMBtu/d for the total 2003 fuel over collectio=
n.  To make the math easy to follow for purposes of discussion, let's assum=
e after all of the Index to Index deals for 2003, we will only have 20,000 =
MMBtu/d of over collected fuel on the system.  We will need the remaining 5=
,000 MMBtu/d as fuel for the Index to Index deals.  Let's also assume that =
we have hedged or plan to hedge (by means of the whole calendar year, seaso=
nally or monthly) the 20,000 MMBtu/d of 2003 over collected fuel.  The rema=
ining 5,000 MMBtu/d of over collected unhedged fuel is what will be used to=
 provide the fuel for the Dynegy deal. =20

It is my thought that the price risk question surrounds the 5,000 MMBtu/d o=
f the remaining over collected fuel that is not hedged.   On any day where =
Dynegy would schedule the full 35,000 MMBtu/d to flow, the fuel actually bu=
rned on that day for Dynegy would have the same value as all other shippers=
 who provided in-kind fuel on that same day.  The other shipper's in-kind f=
uel (I'm referring to the 5,000 MMBtu/d that is not hedged) is what is actu=
ally used to provide fuel for Dynegy.  On this particular day, we do not ha=
ve additional adverse price risk.  However, on any day that Dynegy does not=
 have the full 35,000 MMBtu/d scheduled to flow, we have an opportunity los=
s on the value of this fuel.  If Dynegy does not flow all or any volumes on=
 their contract on any given day, there is no fuel burned.  This means that=
 we now have extra gas, that was not previously hedged, in the pipe provide=

Rich,

Can you help us in defining how we can participate in the Laguna festival?  Steve, TK and I are available to participate on Tuesday, Sept. 18.  We would have to be able to leave Albuquerque around the noon hour on Wednesday, Sept. 19.

Thanks, Kim.

pricing are falling more.....Cal 02 is now $3.27.  EOL still does not have Perm Basis posted for Cal 02, but we suspect that it is in the $.11-.14 range.  FYI.

In talking with Larry and Morgan, it is a belief that there will be people covering short positions by tomorrow or Wed before the close of Sept. contracts and AGA on Wed, we could see a pop back up in the next 48....Shall we watch it?  Kim

Gerry,

Lindy and I are going to tag team on this.  She and I will get together on the results of these meetings.  Thanks, Kim.

Michelle, please respond to Ava if you would like to attend.  Thanks, Kim.

SoCal Needles Allocation meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, July 25 at 12noon-1:30p.m. in conference room EB4102.  Lunch will be provided for those in Houston office, please let me know if you will be attending.

Thanks,
Ava-35842

	
	I would like to have a meeting to review pros and cons in relation to the
	procedure Transwestern is using today for the SoCal Needles "window" allocation.

	Some of the questions being asked:

	1.  Why are we allocating for SoCal, (at their request)?

	2.  Why are we allowing SoCal to set the capacity lower than TW's primary firm?

	3.  What are the options for TW to change the alloction procedure at Needles?

	I am sure there is a host of other questions we could answer as well.  We are looking
	at Tuesday, July 24, at 9:00 a.m or Wednesday, July 25, 1:30 p.m.

	Please let Ava Garcia (713-853-5842) know which day is better for you.  Then we will
	get a room and let everyone know date and time.  

	Thanks. Lynn

Yikes, another message.  Thanks, Kim.

Presidential Task Force on Oil
spillage,DepartmentofPetroleum Resources,
Victoria Island,Lagos Nigeria.BUSINESS PROPOSAL
WORTH$31.8 MILLION DOLLARS
STRICTLYCONFIDENTIAL  Dear Sir/Madam,
This proposal is coming to you with the ardent belief
that you will take advantage of our goodwill and out
of our desperation to have a trusted foreign partner
whom we can entrust our funds with for safekeeping.
This is not a fairy tale but for real. I am
Dr.Igho Richard, the secretary to the
PresidentialTaskforce on
Oil spillage in my country. We are the 6th largest
producer of crude oil in the world and more often than
not, we always experience oil spillage in the Niger
Delta region of my country. These spillage causes a
lot of havoc to inhabitants of the community and hence
contracts are awarded especially to foreign firms to
clean and mop up the spilled crude oil from the areas
affected. The spillage sometimes cover several
kilometres and the value of contract also runs into
millions of dollars. Between 1999 to 2000, some
contracts were awarded to a conglomerate of foreign
firms by  my committee. While awarding these
contracts, we have taken time to deliberately over
invoice one of them to the tune of $31.8m ( Thirty
one million, eight hundred thousand dollars)
What we did was to in addition to the original
contract sum, revaluate and approve this amount
separately and it is presently lying idle in a
suspense account with our apex bank here in Nigeria.
This amount by all standard now belongs to us but we
cannot claim it because it has been made to appear in
the ledger as belonging to a foreign contractor. What
we desire at this moment is to have this funds
transferred into a foreign account but being civil
servants who are still in active government service,
we are barred from maintaining bank accounts overseas.
Thus we have decided to solicit your assistance with a
view to going into a joint partnership to get this
fund out from the bank. At this juncture, we want you
to provide us with a bank account where this fund can
be transferred into first and thereafter, we would
come over to your country to take possession of our
share where we hope to invest part in profitable
ventures with you as our adviser. We would like to
inform you that the nature of your business or
profession at this point is immaterial  because in all
over the world, bigger firms after bidding for and
winning some contract especially in a third world
economy like ours, do subcontract part or whole of the
contract to other firms for execution. It could also
be carried out in any capacity as an individual. So,
you or your organization, having the status of a
subcontractor , with proper documentation, can file an
application for the payment of this fund in your name
and into your bank account. We have agreed in
principle to share this fund in these ratio: 74.5%
will be for my colleagues and I, 25% will be given to
you for your assistance and .5% has been earmarked to
take care of any expenses during the course of this
transaction. All modality for the smooth transfer of
this fund has been worked out and it meets all legal
and administrative requirement in Nigeria as
applicable to foreign contractors payment in the past.
If your response is in the affirmative, within a
period of two weeks or 10 working days, this fund
would have been confirmed and transferred into your
account. We have taken the risk aspect of it into
consideration and I want to assure you that it is
actually risk free as the contract will be re-awarded
in your name before the application will be made. We
will follow the procedures systematically with
flawless documentation. This is authentic.
If you feel you will be of assistance and a
beneficiary from this largesse,kindly send a reply to
this mail to that effect and I will oblige you with
more information as to the smooth take off and
conclusion of this once in a
lifetimeopportunity.Thanks.Your sincerely,
Dr.Igho Richard.

Hey guys and girls,

Janell has a Sheraton on the outskirts of town booked on the front end of t=
he trip.  I sent 17 faxes this morning to hotels in the city center looking=
 for something closer to our sights.  I received an immediate response from=
 the Hotel Condotti.  They have 3 standard rooms available.  I believe it i=
s a 3+ star hotel (I'm guessing from the prices they charge).  From the art=
icle in my book, they have recently remodeled.  They are located near our H=
otel Firenze between the Spanish Steps and Plaza Del Popolo.  The rate is 4=
30,000 Lire (approximately $215).  It's $25 more than the Sheraton but we w=
on't have to taxi between the city center and the outskirts of town which g=
ives us more flexibility to easily scoot back to the hotel as we fade with =
jetlag and eat dinner in town after a nap.  They also have a 72 hour cancel=
lation policy (there could be a slight fee to cancel, their fax just says t=
hey have a 72 hour cancellation fee), if we are OK, I'll confirm this cance=
llation with our reservation. =20

I think we should go with this.  I'm not sure how fast I'll hear from the o=
thers, if at all.=20

Please let me know your thoughts ASAP. =20

Thanks, Kim.

11:30 in the lobby sounds fine.  I would be happy to drive.  Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim:

I have made reservations for Damians Restaurant at 11:45 today.  Do you
want to meet Vince and Krishna in the lobby at 11:30?  And do you by
any chance have your car and could drive?

Let me know.

Shirley

Shirley,

Let's book Tuesday, Aug. 28.  

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim:

Vince and Krishna are both free for lunch Monday and Tuesday, August 27th & 28th or
Friday, August 31st.

Let me know which day works best for you.

regards,

Shirley

Yes, I will be there.  Thanks, Kim.

Morgan and Kim,

This e-mail is to inform you that the meeting to discuss the TW hedge of
transport deals will be 9:00-10:00 AM on Thursday morning (August 30th) in
Morgan's office (EB 3942).  We do not have access to Enron e-mail, and
therefore, I cannot access your calendars.  Would you please confirm with
me through reply to this e-mail that the scheduling will still work for
you?  Thanks.

John,

I will be able to make the Thursday meeting.  I will be out of the office on Friday afternoon.

Thanks, Kim.

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks for your help on this.

J, D, P and J,

Here is a previous email from the travel agency regarding car and ferry info.  I have asked Dee to book the overnight ferry from Palermo to Naples.  I believe that we still have a 6 hour drive to Lucca, but that will put us there sooner than the overnight ferry to Livorno with a 2 hour drive.  She is also confirming the car and rate for us (approx $742 for each car). 

FYI, I have received a few more faxes from available Rome Hotels, but none of them have a better location that what we have booked and a few of them were even more expensive than what we have booked.  Janell is on the hunt for a Florence hotel.  I will prepare faxes in mass for Florence tonight and send them out tomorrow.  

Dorothy called me yesterday and wanted to know how our plans are coming.  She and Tom are very sad that they will not be able to join us.  I told her we will drink for them everyday and have them in our thoughts.  She is doing well and hopes to return to the office in about three weeks on a part time basis.

Also, John and I are confirmed in a Rome hotel for the 11th-13th which is only about 5 blocks from the train station where we will return the cars.  We can put everyone's luggage in our room when we return to Rome and have a nice dinner before you guys taxi to the airport to return home.

I will keep you posted as we hear more. 

Thanks, Kim. 

I have 2 Alamo full size 4 dr/5 passenger  cars reserved for you. We do not
have to prepay. The all-inclusive
rate is 1,617250. ITL (approx 742.00) for the 12 days. This includes
collision and theft insurance, taxes and
unlimited mileage. I think that this is very good. 1 car booked under John
Watson and 1 under Dennis Dye.
They are manuals.

The ferry from Palermo to Naples is daily, departing at 800pm, arriving
700am. It looks as though the vehicles will cost between 111,600 and 134,600
each. The passengers in a double outside cabin are 96,500 to 111,500. ) I
believe, per passenger.

The ferry from Palermo to Livorno departs at 1100pm and arrives the next day
about 5pm. The double outside suite is
240,000. The coach seat is 120,000. Each car is 175,000 to 205,000. I need
to verify if the cabin rate includes the
passenger fee.

I had found a ferry to Salerno, but it only operates 1 day a week, not the
day you need.
I'll get back to you.

John, FYI, I'll let you know when I hear from her.  Thanks, Kim.

	Kim--

	I am not sure what the deal will be, as I am waiting to get a referral and to get into the neurosurgeon.  However, I spoke to a surgeon friend of mine in San 
	Angelo this weekend.  She says I should not plan on being able to go.  She said if it were just a month later, I might could make it.  But she says that, 
	even if I get the surgery scheduled soon, that there will be a lot of rehab and that first of Oct. is too soon to stop rehab.  I was hoping to get some definite 
	answers to questions today, but neither my regular doctor (who said she would call me back today after she received the information on the tests done 
	by the neurologist, etc.), nor the nerologist, who I left a message for, called me back.  So, I am not positive about anything...  The neurologist made it 
	sound like the recovery from this new "microsurgery" was not that difficult or long but he was not specific about the exact period.

	Do you have any back-up takers for going on the trip, in the event my doctors say "no way"?

	--Dot

Dot,

I'm so glad you know what the problem is.  My brother had a similar micro-surgery last year.  He went home on the same day and was only off work for a couple of days.  Will you be able to start a rehab program/routine after surgery?  Is your doctor comfortable with you traveling to Italy this fall or will it be a wait and see situation to see how you are doing post surgery?  Keep me posted.  Thanks, Kim.

	Kim--

	Got the news today -- good news is we now know what the problem is & it can be fixed.  I have a protruding disc between L5 and S1 that is "impinging 
	upon the nerve root for L5" -- i.e., causing the numbness in my left leg and foot.  Bad news is -- surgery is the fix.  However, the neurologist says that 
	recovery from the surgery is pretty short, in light of the micro-surgery they now do on this.  Trying to get in to see the surgeon now, to see how soon 
	I can schedule something.  Keep you informed...

	--Dot

	Kim --

	Thanks for the note -- I had a cat scan yesterday, along with more hip x-rays.  Tomorrow, I have something called an EMG -- "electro-myogram" -- sounds 
	similar to the old "myleograms", so I just assumed it would be similar -- dye into the spinal cord & take pictures.  However, Staci looked it up on the 
	Internet for me and reported that it is a series of needle probes into various muscles to check for nerve problems, and is somewhat painful -- just what I want 
	at this point!   Surely doesn't sound too great...  oh well, still hope to find something out by tomorrow around noon...
	
	I did hear from a friend of mine, who had something similar a few years ago; she opted for some injections into her back, which worked, so that would be 
	better than surgery or continuing like this, at least. The neurologist did say last week that it is not necessarily my back (altho' that is the most likely 
	cause of this) but said that it could be something in my hip...  So, maybe I'll have a number of options, like physical therapy, injections, etc. and not just 
	surgery.

	--Dot

Dot,

Please keep me posted on your tests.  Also, don't forget to tell the doctors that you just need the really BIG shot now so that you will be ready for Italy in the fall.  Don't over-do it!  I does take time for the back to heal.  

I had lunch with Sue Neville yesterday and she had some great advise for the Amalfi Coast(she and her family just returned from Italy).  On one of the islands near the Amalfi Coast, there are plenty of "natural spa's" with salt water, fresh water, hot, cold, dry and wet saunas.  Sounds like a good stop and may even be helpful to your current condition.

Stay flat!

Kim.

	Update -- went to see neurologist on Friday (only got in that early because I practically yelled at a number of people for several hours on Thursday -- I guess they think people can afford to wait 6 weeks to see if they feel any better!  They were willing to set me up with an appointment in Sept., can you imagine???).  

	Anyway, the neurologist knew what nerve is pinched but not where it is getting pinched, where the problem is coming from -- could be my back or my hip.  Having x-rays and cat scan on Monday pm, with something called EMG on Wed.  Let you know what I learn.  

	--Still flat on back in Houston...Dot

Steve,

James ran numbers.  $.22 for 10 yr. for 43,300/d is a DCF of 16.57% with no resubscriptions.  This looks better than any of the 5 year cases on either a 120/d case or 150/d case.  Thoughts?  We have not approached Duke with a 10 yr term yet.  Thanks, Kim and Michelle

Audrey,

Would you please set up a meeting for me on Wednesday (tomorrow) to discuss the Griffith plant and some of the problems we have been having lately with respect to TW's responsibilities, EAMR's responsibilities and Trigon's responsibilities.  (Please share this meeting purpose in the email notice of this meeting.)  We would like to meet from 3:00 to 4:00 pm, we need a conference room in Houston with the ability to conference in several other locations.  In addition to the names below, please include Don Hawkins, Sarabeth Smith, Donna Scott, Dennis Alters, Darrell Schoolcraft and me.  

Many thanks,

Kim :>)

Regarding our discussion about setting up a meeting for Kim about subject at 3:00 tomorrow, please invite the following operations personnel and provide a conference number or bridge for their access.  Thanks, EF

Are you online?  MSN shows you not logged in.  BTW, my car is ready.  I will pick it up tonight.  It was the starter.  $550 (includes a new battery).

FYI, ILY, K.  

PS.  I will keep you posted on the ferry poll.  I still vote for arriving in Lucca earlier in the day, only because if we don't arrive untill evening, then we will spend the whole next day in Lucca instead of getting to Florence.  I'm trying to keep us (you and me) whole for 2 - 2.5 shopping days in Florence before heading to Rome.  

K.

Option 1 -Palermo to Naples (11 hrs) vs. Option 2 - Palermo to Livorno (18
hrs):

Option 1 - Afternoon in Sicily, early dinner, 2000 departure from Palermo,
0700 arrival in Naples, followed by a 6-hour drive to Lucca (arrive around
1300, assuming no stops).

Option 2 - Afternoon and evening in Sicily, normal dinner, 2300 departure
from Palermo, 1700 arrival in Livorno, followed by a 1-hour drive to Lucca.

Remember that these ferries have shopping and dining and other stuff.  If
the cost difference isn't much (Dee told me she's getting an exact cost from
the ferry companies), I vote for the longer ferry ride arriving closer to
our final destination.

John

I talked with Russ.  I told him if he wanted a 5 year, we needed $.26.  We could consider going a little lower if he extended his term to 10 years....I told him we really need $.24 to make it work for 10.  He will run the numbers and call me in the morning.   Kim.

Jo, here is the message on the EPNG Marketing Affiliate case. =20

Thanks, Kim.

In a release from Natural Gas Intelligence according to FERC staff counsel,=
 El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant Energy possessed market power dur=
ing the summer of 2000 and violated FERC's marketing affiliate standards. T=
he article states that El Paso had market power after May 2000 for at least=
 two months when pipeline capacity constraints created a separate relevant =
geographic market in California. The evidence pointed to the now-infamous F=
ebruary 7 and 9, 2000 telephone conversations showing that the operating em=
ployees of El Paso Merchant, El Paso Natural Gas and Mojave Pipeline "were =
not functioning independently," according to staff counsel.=20

The phone conversations took place just days before El Paso pipeline began =

Great, would you reply that we may need up to six chairs, but we will know the exact count within the next week.  Also, ask her about a table cloth to see if we can borrow it.  

Thanks, Kim.

FYI...

Mrs. Watson -

There is a 6ft portable table you can use for your event.  Let me know if
you need any chairs, we have 12 available.

Hey guys,

We got our first response to a Florence Hotel.  Please read this message and take a look at the attached links to their hotel website to get a feel for the location.  Janell and I think that it is close enough to the city center, but we are open to fresh eyes.  Let me know your thoughts.  I sent about 12 faxes this morning, this is the first to respond.  Janell has personally called about 8 hotels in Florence and they have all been fully booked.  

Let me know what you think.  

Thanks, Kim.

J, are you interested in this?  K.

Hey - Is anyone interested in going to the Plaza Club on Thursday, Aug. 16 for an All You Can Eat Lobster Night from 6:30 - 9:30?  Jules and Hugh and I are thinking of going.  Let me know.

Lorraine 

9:00 works best for me.  I can swirl other stuff for 10:00, I would not be able to do 11:00.  Thanks, Kim.

Well, that didn't work.

Neither Thursday nor Friday at 2:00 will work.

I'll try one more time for this week.  Please let me know by noon, Thursday if you can not make any of these times:

  9:00 CST, Friday, 8/31
10:00 CST, Friday, 8/31
11:00 CST, Friday, 8/31

I will send a note by end of day, Thursday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks,

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks for your help on this.

Another response.  I think it is further away than Hotel City?  Can anyone look at a map and tell us?  It's crazy at the office today and I won't have time.  Thanks, Kim.
Dear Ms Watson,

thank you for your kind fax of yesterday and for your interest in our hotel.

I am afraid, but we do not have enough double rooms left available for the dates you require. If at all suitable for you, over the same dates we can offer you one of the following accomodations:
       - either TWO triple rooms     - OR one double room and one large room for four people
all our rooms have private shower/WC, color TV/radio, air conditioning and telephone.

The daily rate for such rooms in that period (extremely busy) is Lit. 320000 for each triple room OR Lit. 240000 for the double room and Lit. 400000 for the quadruple one, which at the moment works out to be around US$ 150+150 or 113+187 per night, including buffet breakfast and all taxes and service charges.

Should you wish to book (and I really hope so), we would need a confirmation e-mail or fax from you together with your Visa, Master, Amex or Diners' Club credit card number and expiration date, which will only prove as a guarantee of your arrival. Otherwise, you can e-mail or fax us the confirmation and then send us a cheque for the first night's amount, but this takes longer and is more expensive both on your and on our side. Please note that cancellations or amendments should be made in writing up to one week before arrival at the latest, otherwise the amount of the first cancelled night will be charged.

Our hotel is very centrally located only 150 yards away from Florence Cathedral and very close to all monuments and museum. In order to reach it from the Railway Station, there is a choice of three options:
- a taxi will cost around Lit. 12000 and is readily available from the main exit in front of tracks no. 8-9-10);
- by bus lines 11 or 17 from the side exit by track no. 5: get off at the stop after the Cathedral and walk another 50 yards on the other side of the street;
- walk all the way (8-10 minutes): leave the Station by the side exit by track no. 16, take the underpass to the right until the end of it and then keep going straight ahead for about 400 yards, until reaching the Cathedral (a massive white church): at that stage turn left into Via Martelli, which becomes Via Cavour after 50 yards.

I hope that we shall be able to warmly welcome you all to our small and family managed hotel and I can assure you that we shall endeavour to make your stay in Florence as pleasant as possible. 

Yours sincerely,

10 yr. deal not looking good.  I have a call into Russ about taking some of the resubscrip space that starts 6/03.  

FYI, on resubscription space, if we sell 2,000 6/03 and incr.to a total of 7,000 4/04 thru 5/31/07 at $.22, to keep a 15% DCF we have to sell the 43,300 at $.218.

I think this bounced back to me.  Sorry.  Kim.

The La Plata DRA conference call has been scheduled for 9:00 a.m., CST, Friday, 08/31.  The dial in information is below.

The purpose of the call is to review all we know about now about applying a drag reducing agent to the La Plata to Bloomfield line and decide whether it is beneficial to pursue.  If it is decided to pursue the DRA application a work plan will be made.  The agenda is:

Project benefits
Project requirements
Facility modifications
Application requirements
Schedule
Pursue project?
Schedule
Responsibilites

Thanks for everyone's efforts in scheduling this call.

John

Per your request, I have scheduled a conference call on the above referenced subject for tomorrow, Friday, August 31 at 9:00am (Omaha time).

Your dial in numbers are as follows:

1-877-795-3687
code:  583204

If you should experience difficulty in accessing this call, please call the OCC at 402-398-7773.

Well, that didn't work.

Neither Thursday nor Friday at 2:00 will work.

I'll try one more time for this week.  Please let me know by noon, Thursday if you can not make any of these times:

  9:00 CST, Friday, 8/31
10:00 CST, Friday, 8/31
11:00 CST, Friday, 8/31

I will send a note by end of day, Thursday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks,

John

I have been asked to pursue an effort to apply a drag reducing agent (DRA) to the La Plata to Bloomfield pipeline with the intent of increasing the San Juan lateral capacity.  I would appreciate it if you or your representative could participate in a conference call to initate this effort.

The desire is to have this done in the September - November time frame as December is a tariff month.  A launcher and receiver as well as other facilities to make the line piggable would have to be installed, cleaning pig runs completed and the DRA applied.

Please let me know by noon Wednesday if you cannot make either of these times:

2:00 p.m., Thursday, 08/30
2:00 p.m., Friday, 08/31

I will send a note by end of day Wednesday confirming the time and giving the dialing information.

Thanks for your help on this.

Great draft Maria.  I couldn't resist adding some stuff.  Remember Kathy's transcript correction?  Barry's testimony originally read exactly like Kathy's protest--they both demanded that released capacity and our own capacity be posted "on the same platform" whatever that means.  The correction added "on the same page" to the "same platform" concept.  I inserted a paragraph that suggested that the Indicated Shippers aren't sure what the hell they want and keep changing their story so should be ignored.  Cut it if you like but it was amusing.

Audrey,  would you send an invite to Brad Holmes and Teb Lokey?  Thanks, Kim.  

Sorry, I tried hard to make sure we didn't leave anyone off.  

I would include Brad Holmes who is Ramona's Director (If you do not know him, I would take the time to chat with him.) and what about Teb Lokey.  

Donna, would you please check this distribution list and let me know if you think we might have accidentally omitted someone that should have received an invite?  I don't want to leave anyone out that should come.  Thanks, Kim.

Steve Harris would like to let you know that your hard work during the past few months has been sincerely appreciated.

Here are the bullets for this week.  Thanks, Kim.

 

Lindy will attend for our group.  Thanks, Kim.

I owe you lunch...Thanks, Kim.

Kim, 
	I am planning on attending the meeting today from 1-2:00 for us, unless you'd like to come =)

Lindy

I saw you log in, but I don't see you on MSN.  I, too, am still at the office.  What a day!  K.

Jean, thank you so much for taking care of this for us!  Are you available for lunch on August 10 or any day during Aug 13-17?
 
Thanks, Kim.

Karon/Larry -- please order 14 15" flat screens (and cards), and 1 Compaq M300 with all accessories (docking station, DVD, memory, bag, additonal larger battery).  
 

Please code everything towards the "Marketing 41k refresh" bucket.  I estimate totol purchase amount to be $14,000.
 
If you have any questions, please let me know.  I will be out of the office on vacation tomorrow but can be reached via cell phone-402-689-1333.
 
Thanks.  Jean
 
 

Have you guys heard anything about shippers wanting gas at this point?  Let me know.  Thanks, Kim.

I'm with you.  If we can't make money, why enter into an agreement?   The team at Canadian is under the impression that they are going to be asked to run the units long term.   Not sure where this is coming from.
I think there are probably better places to put the units.

Randy:  I'm waiting to hear who has requested us to run the units, but if history is repeating, it is Duke wanting us to run them for 2-3 days to move their gas during an NNG outage.  I believe that even at maximum rates, we do not cover our costs.  No one in TW Marketing has heard from a shipper yet.  If it has been over a year since the units were last run, we have the option of abandoning them at any time.  What do you think?  Steve 

I understand that there has been a request to run two units at this location beginning Thursday.  Is this a long term commitment?  I've been told that the units will need some work at some point if we expect them to operate on a daily basis.  

Mike Flynn - Canadian Team:  These units are candidates for abandonment.  What day were each of these units last run?  If they have been idle for over one year we can abandon the units under automatic blanket authority.  If we run them, however, it postpones the abandonment-under-automatic-blanket-authority option by another year.  Please let me know ASAP.  Steve

Steve- Eric is meeting with KinderMorgan & Calpine today @ 1:45 to discuss possible merging of projects...do you want me to go in your place?  Eric just happened to mention this meeting to me.  Call me.  X33098. 

Thank you for setting this up.  Kim.

Hey guys,

Since I am out of the office tomorrow, here is the beginning of the bullets.  I need to you add your weekly bullets to this list.  Please coordinate with each other before you send them to Audrey (by 10:00am, please).  Please file save the final version on the shared drive under my folder.  All of the previous weeks bullets are in the folder by date order.

 

Steve,

FYI, Kim.

fyi

Yesterday evening I phoned both the state of Arizona ( agency for stations 1 and 2) and Region 9 EPA ( agency for stations 3 and 4) concerning the status of when the air permits would be issued by both agencies for the Redrock expansion.  I was surprised to find out that both agencies stated a 2-4 month delay prior to issuance.  They cited back log of other permits, public comment periods, and workload as being the main reasons.  I am particularily disappointed because there were pre meetings with both agencies identifying what was to be included in each application package, and even after the applications were submitted in March of this year, each agency came back and asked for different information that from what was discussed at each meeting.

I have a call into the state of Arizona ( construction is to begin at Station 2 and they have jurisdiction for this station) to see if we can initiate  some construction activities  such as laying pipe and building foundations prior to receiving the permit.  I have been given these types of approvals from other agencies in the past, but these types of approvals are extremely narrow and restrictive.   If this flys I am sure that they will require us to make sure the turbine is not brought on site until the permit has been issued.  I know this will require written approval from the agency, but this may allow us to proceed on schedule and avoid any delays.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue.

twist....Lee Ferrell just left Enron last week.  He now works for Reliant.  I still want to invite him, it may take a day or two to track down his new phone number or email.  I will keep you posted.   

ILY, K.

Kim - we really need to get Lee Farrell locked down for either 11/3 or
11/17, so I can release Jane and Barry the other weekend.

John,
Thank you for the invitation.  We'd love to come.  We don't have any plans
for Saturday, November 3rd, 10th or 17th.  Let us know.  Have a good weekend
and say hello to Kim.

Hi TK,

We are still on target for a shipper meeting on Nov. 8 with the Market Services Goup, I would like to have our map updated so that we can hand it out at the meeting.  Let's visit about this sometime today or tomorrw.  I also want to get the NNG people involved to update their portion as well.

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Stephanie,

By chance are you available for lunch today?  Kim.

no, not yet?  Who has it?  K.

Kim - did you get your new laptop yet?   Thanks.  Jean

Jean, can you help me?  My cell phone was stolen from my briefcase sometime this afternoon.  I also received this message that the recipient below in not known....I do not know who this person is or what/why is was returned to me, so now I am worried that someone was at my computer doing something before the screensaver came on.  Can you help me do some detective work here?

Thanks, Kim.

J, does the $20,000 include the cost of the video?  K.

Houshyar -

Based on committee input yesterday and Patsy Bolton's investigation, I have
filled in the budget numbers for the attached board request.  I understand
that it needs to go before the Finance Committee prior to presentation to
the board, so I would ask your assistance in providing a copy to Lew Humke
and the other committee members.

I will be out of town on Thursday and Friday, returning late Friday night,
so I will not be immediately available to answer questions about the
proposal.  Should you need to contact me, I can be paged at (713) 687-6941.

Let me stress the time crunch under which we are working:  we were fortunate
to get a prime location at a reasonable per person cost tentatively booked
at this late date, but they are going to need a firm contract before the
actual date can be secured.  This does need board action this week.

Thanks for your help.  If you need to reach me today, my contact information
is shown below.  After today, you can reach me by pager.

Thanks again,

TK,

Are you referring to the Dynegy deal in December being the "I to I" deal that we have already hedged?  Have you already included the previous "I to I" deals that you have done earlier in the year?  Outside of these deals, I am not aware of any others.

Mary Davrveaux is asking the question is there any other negotiated rates in 2001 other than USGT in November and Dynegy in December.  This is all I remember.  Please let me know if you have any additions.

Mary,

You are going to have such a great time!  Yes, you will need a mixture of both long and short sleeves.  You might be able to take one pair of shorts, otherwise, jeans or other long pants will be the preferred leg coverings.  A sweatshirt and jacket will be just fine.  Is your jacket water wary?  Tennis shoes are definitely OK!

You will love the Tattoo and Edinburgh.  Find the Fringe Festival Schedule as soon as you get into town.  Look through the book and select a few events that look interesting to you and buy a ticket (there are signs everywhere or ask someone where the ticket offices are - there are several in town).  Entertainers all over the world come to the festival to get their start.  Some of the names you will probably recognize....they got their start there!

Call me when you get back.  I'd love to hear all about your trip!

Hugs back at you, Kim.

P.S.  Stay away from Haggus(spelling?).

Howdy Miss Kim,

How's your summer going?  It has been as hot here as there!!!!  We have been
in the high 90's with humidity to match.

What type of clothing did you take to Scotland?  We are planning on going
everywhere and it looks like the further north you go the cooler it gets.
Would a mix of long and short sleeve shirts be good?  Thought we would bring
a sweatshirt, jacket with hood and umbrella.  Do people wear tennis shoes
and jeans?

We leave August 6th and can hardly wait!  Have reservations for the Tattoo
and two nights booked in Edinburgh.  The travel agent didn't feel we would
have any problem finding a B&B along the way.

Thanks for the advice!

Hugs,

M

Steve,  FYI, another step forward for opportunities to resolve imbalances....Kim.  

	Wanted to be sure you were both in the loop that we are NOT posting Shipper
	imbalances to the Web, only OBA Dollar Valued agreements.  If you have any
	questions, please let me know.  This was decided after a meeting this morning
	with Shelley and Teb to review TW tariff and compliance.  Thanks. Lynn	

FYI - TW Imbalances...

Please review the attached draft on the TW posting for trading imbalances.
The data is not real imbalance data.I wanted to get a draft out since Glen would be out of the office until Thursday.
Please make any changes to the document & return to me by COB Wednesday, 9/12/01. I will then send a revised final draft out on Thursday and Richard will send the imblance posting document to Toby on Friday afternoon for posting.

Thanks Ramona

 

Hi Ed,

Gosh, I am so sorry we have not connected yet.  I have been on a fast run.  How early in the morning do you come in?  Do I need to be at my desk?  How late in the evening are you in? 

I will make time for you.  Thanks for your persistence.

Kim.

Hi Kim,

	I'd like to schedule 10 mintues of your time so we can adjust your Business Objects file locations to the new ETS Marketing standard configuration.  When's a good time for you?  I'm available except between 14:00 and 16:00 on Tuesday.  I'd like to help you complete this configuration as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Hi Dan!

I am glad that your family is well.  My heart is so heavy with the tragedy of the WTC.  I cannot fully comprehend the enormity of it all.

I will be glad to bring the tape in.  I am actually going to be in the office late Sunday afternoon to begin packing my desk.  We are temporarily moving to the 13th floor mid next week while they reconstruct our floor.  

I will have the tape on my desk in an envelope with your name on it, too.  Also, I have a little book that you lent me with nice verses.  I will bring it as well. 

Thanks and take care.  Kim.

Kim,

Hope none of your family/friends were impacted by the WTC disaster.  We had a scare in our family.  My bro & sis-in-law, and 3 other cousins & their spouses are doctors.  Did not hear from them or about them for days.  Heard from my brother for the 1st time last night.  They were working round the clock helping the injured, so had no time to call!.  I was 90% sure they were OK, but that 10% caused sooooo much anxiety.  I just cannot imagine the plight of folks who probably are 150% sure that their loved ones are no more, but are still clinging on to some hope/miracle!.

I will probably swing by Enron tomorrow around 12:30 pm.  If possible, could you bring the tape on Logic of Sprituality with you.  If you are not going to be around, can you leave it on your desk!

Hope things are going well for you & Martha.  Please say hi to her. say hi to Janell too!

Take Care

Dan

Morgan,  should we just drink the wine and beer from the Mad Potter vs. bringing our own?

If Morgan is good with the memo, go ahead and distribute.

I just wanted to follow up with you that everyone in Eric's group (plus Steve Dowd) have a place to land when we move.  I have not seen the area that you guys are supposed to move and I just want to make sure that no one falls through the crack.  Are you satisfied that you have spaces for all?

Hi Pam and Donna,

I am not certain that Susan has been made aware of where and which spaces have been allocated to her (Eric Gadd's group) with respect to the move.  In effort to make sure that no one falls through the crack, would you please coordinate with Susan as to which floor and specifically which cubical/office locations she can slot her people in.  Susan will also coordinate Steve Dowd with the rest of Eric's group in the move so we need to keep a space for him.  

Susan,

Please let me know when you have accounted for everyone in Eric's group (plus Steve Dowd) for the move and have the location assignment.  

The goal for all is that everyone will have a chair when the music stops.  :>)

Thanks to all for your help!

Kim.

Michelle, please put another packet together on Southern Trails for Mike McGowan.  Some of the pieces may have to be faxed/mailed if you don't have them electronically. 

Mike,  please feel free to call either of us to walk you through the packet and if you need more detail we can send that to you also.  

Thanks, Kim. 

Yes, I will have Kim Watson forward that info to you as well.

Steve - at today's staff meeting, Danny McCarty asked to see the rate derivation of the Southern Trails pipeline with the conversion costs.

Could I get a copy as well?  I am working with Steve Dowd on evaluating the Questar pipeline and this is a big part of it.

Thanks.

Sue,

Have you talked to your mom since last week?  I would like to visit with her by phone or email about what her views/opinions are of the local viewpoints of the WTC tragedy.  May I have her phone number and email address again?

Thanks, Kim.

Please see attached.

Mark and Paul, 

It would be good to set up a time to demo this model.  In fact, I would like to attend with you, since I havn't seen it for almost a year.  

Thanks, Kim.

If anyone is interested in my demonstrating the model I can do this individually at your convenience, just let me know when and where.  Also please forward this to all appropriate personnel within your groups.
Thanks
Kim Kouri

Rick,

Thanks so much for the lead!  In fact the timing is very good since we are trying to determine a viable scope of the Sun Devil expansion.

Lorraine,  would you please give Rick Padia a call and see if there is a fit for us to service his area.  Maybe they can form a coalition of all the land owners for the White Cliffs Area?  Also, please keep Rick Smith posted of our conversations with this possible new customer(s).

Thanks, Kim.

Kim, I was contacted by Rick Padia, who is a landowner in the White Cliffs Area (this is very near the Gallup Compressor Station), and he is inquiring about gas service for himself and possibly 100+ houses in that area. I told him that I would forward his request to Houston and someone from Marketing would get in touch with him sometime this week. He called from Santa Fe this morning at (505-455-0627) and his work number is 505-986-6398.  Kim, thanks for you help on this and please keep us posted as to the status.          Rick

Hi Debbie,

Can you tell me who you have talked to?  Michelle is the Oneok rep and is out of town until Monday.  I will ask Michelle to assist you in this collection.  

Michelle, would you please coordinate with Deb and see if you can find the right person a Oneok for us to talk to regarding the AR issue. 

Thanks, Kim.	
Kim, 

There are some outstanding AR issues regarding ftps for Westar/KN/Oneok.  I've tried to contact them and talked to 4 different people with no avail.  The last person said he's not so sure that they are valid.  I've got to locate the contract and send to him.  I believe I'm going to need marketing assistance in collecting.  Can you tell me who I need to talk with.

Debbie

Steve,

Done.  Michelle sent it out this morning.  We will follow up with Mike to make sure he understands how the numbers were derived.  

Kim.

Yes, I will have Kim Watson forward that info to you as well.

Steve - at today's staff meeting, Danny McCarty asked to see the rate derivation of the Southern Trails pipeline with the conversion costs.

Could I get a copy as well?  I am working with Steve Dowd on evaluating the Questar pipeline and this is a big part of it.

see map---K.

Jo, I actually mentioned this in our TW staff meeting with Steve yesterday about using the OBA's to balance this point for November service if the interconnect was not ready.  We could carve out a few minutes after one of the morning meetings to discuss this with Market Services - both TW and NNG representatives to work out the details for their shop.  FYI, Michelle is working with Burlington to deliver gas to NNG@Gray on their firm contract as well as discussions with Oneok to deliver gas to TW@Gray.  

Thanks, Kim.   

fyi.  I had requested Earl to provide an update on this interconnect.  If we have actual flows scheduled (and we know we have 25,000 of firm contracted) before the 12/1 date, we might have to do something at Halley to balance flows.  Should we start working out the details of that?

Jo

R-O-W has gave 30 day notice to adjacent landowners
Survey has been completed for pipeline
SHPO & F&F survey being completed on pipeline route
Valves has been quoted for a 8 -12 week delivery, unacceptable. Have requested buyer purchase Grove Valves with a 4 week delivery.
Should know on pipe this week for delivery and cost.
The existing Gray county I/C will be relocated to P-3 as a complete unit
An 8" meter tube and two 12" valves have been located from surplus for installing at the original I/C with dry flow measurement
Installation will be T&M to reduce time frame for bid package and drawings and allow quicker contractor move in and start up.

The target date is 11-1-01, but with the delay, 2 1/2 months, in approving the P.A., as stated in the original cost estimates, E&C required a June approval to meet the in service date of 11-1-01, we have a forecast ready for service date of 12-01-01. We will expedite materials and installation in an attempt to meet the target date.
If any questions, lease let me know

Earl,

I haven't heard anything lately on the status of the Gray Interconnect.  Has the cost estimate remained the same?  What is the schedule for in-service?

Jorge sent these changes to me, but I thought you might want to take the lead on these possible changes since it is a NNG IT contract.  If you don't mind, just keep me posted on what you finally decide.   Many thanks, Kim.

  

FYI, Kim.

Rick (FYI),

	Elizabeth informed me about a report she's been administering regarding all TW deliveries to California.  This is a new report that was created per an FERC order.  After discussion with the TW Admin team, it would seem appropriate that the Deal Capture team administer the FERC report at this time.  Elizabeth will begin the transition of this report to Deal Capture as soon as her schedule permits.  This report, along with some other TW Demand Rate admin pieces and the Firmbook, would be a significant part of the duties for the 3rd member of our Deal Capture team.

Can you help with this?  

Thanks, Kim.

Team,
We need to know what to code from so until we get a final decision this project cannot be completed.  When can we get a final answer?

Dale,

There are still questions related to unsubscribed including EDI reporting.  Toby, Theresa and I had a conference call yesterday with Mary Darveaux and Ranelle after this memo was sent out.  There should be further discussions soon.

Mary

fyi........

Below is the Regulatory view of what should posted.

Dale Ratliff

We have agreement among the Regulatory Group and the Planning Group that the way the NNG unsubscribed reports are showing points currently is the way we would like to continue to show them.  Specifically, we would include all physical points that are valid for transport but would not include farm taps.  We would also not include non-physical points (such as zone points) except for Demarc.

The only question I had was on TW with respect to the "new" point established for the precedent agreements on the Red Rock expansion.  I wouldn't want to show both the physical points with the associated capacity and the "new" point with the same associated capacity (I don't know if this is the case, that was just the only unusual item we could think of on TW).

Call if I have further confused the issue.
Ranelle

FYI, Kim.

Obviously we have called all our day-to-day contacts about the ongoing Inte=
rnet situation.  I believe that we have been able to accomodate all nominat=
ions, even if by fax.  Since this is going on for the second day, I thought=
 you may want to give a heads up to your marketing contacts.  If you hear o=
f other companies that are having similar problems please let me know.

This is the equipment for the proposed interconnect. The Enron "e"nternet is down at this time and I will e-mail your the Engineering Standards when it is running. Jim Williams will be here this PM and I will give him a typical I/C package drawing and Material list set that you can review. This is a typical set and for your proposed I/C, a few modifications to package would be required but it is 80% of what is used at most I/C. 

You can develop a cost estimate from this package with your modifications. 

If any questions or if I can be of assistance, please contact me.

Please be informed, because a large number of our invitees had conflicting schedules, we are moving the date of our Appreciation Luncheon.  Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  To achieve this effort, the luncheon will be moved to a date and time which does not conflict with activities within ETS.  

As soon as we confirm our date, we will notify you via email.

Please review the attached agreement for the Big Sandy Interconnect.  It is very standard.  It is reimbursable.  It has a few blanks that have to be filled in for certain dates that we (or Caithness) don't know just at this time with respect to receiving regulatory approval, in-service date, etc.  Caithness wants this agreement for their prospective equity partners to review for content.  

Teb, Lee and Ron, this agreement has not changed since you have last seen it, but I just wanted you to give it one more look.

I would like to email to Kirk (Caithness) tomorrow afternoon.  

Thanks, Kim.

  

Thank you, Julie!  Kim.

FYI

As we return to our regular business activities following last week's tragic events, we wanted to disseminate as widely as possible the following information on security and travel.  Updates will be posted as necessary under "bulletins" on the Corporate Security website located at www.home.enron.com.

We do not believe that any terrorist groups will target Enron's employees or facilities.  As a precautionary measure, however, we have increased security in and around our facilities.  We urge all employees to maintain a heightened sense of awareness and to immediately report any suspicious activity to Enron Corporate Security in Houston at (713) 345-2804. 

All non-essential business travel should be postponed until further notice.   Airline schedules and flights will be disrupted for some time - and bomb hoaxes, false alarms, and increased security measures will result in additional delays and disruptions.  In addition, all carriers, particularly U.S. carriers and those of U.S. allies such as Israel and NATO member countries, may be at risk for copycat hijackings.

	We realize that, as Enron conducts its business, some air travel is unavoidable.   Enron employees who wish to discuss their travel options should contact Corporate Security at (713) 345-2804 or via email at CorporateSecurity@enron.com.   

	U.S. military action in retaliation for the terrorist attacks may result in violent Islamic extremist reactions in a number of countries, particularly in Afghanistan, Yemen, and Pakistan, as well as in Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria and Tajikistan.  Reactions could take the form of acts by individuals or organized groups against U.S. government or commercial facilities.  All travel to or through these countries should be canceled.

Most of the U.S.' busiest airports have implemented the FAA's stepped-up security measures and are open and operating, with the exception of Washington Reagan National Airport.  If you are traveling by air, allow plenty of time to check in under these new security procedures.  Contact your carrier directly to find out about flight schedules and specific boarding requirements.  You can find more information on the new security standards as well as a list of airports that have certified they can meet the new security standards on the FAA's website at http://www.faa.gov. 

What were the offer dates for the Gormet Group?  Didn't we offer all three weekends?  I'm open all three weekends in November, however, we might want to steer clear of the 17 just incase we decide to travel during the week of Thanksgiving.  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim - Any reason I can't tell Jane 11/3?  That's one of the Gourmet Group
dates, but we can steer that to the 17th, I think.  Or should I offer Jane
the 10th?  Did you have a conflict then?  JW

Pencil in the 3d and the 17th.  We'll narrow it down to one or the other
shortly.

Looking forward to it!

John,
Thank you for the invitation.  We'd love to come.  We don't have any plans
for Saturday, November 3rd, 10th or 17th.  Let us know.  Have a good weekend
and say hello to Kim.

Thanks again,
Jane

sounds good.  K.

All three weekends were available, but Jim & Hattie (our hosts) can't do it
the 10th.  Let me go back to Jane with the 10th, since we know that won't be

Susan,  

Thank you, but I will be out of town on Mon and Tues of next week and will not be available to attend.  I would recommend that Martha Janousek (or Bobby Mason) be aware of this meeting as they might be interested in attending since they are building several other web based tools for us.

Thanks, Kim.

Dan Mooney wants to pitch a business development concept to ETS based on using web-enabled capabilities his company (Aurion Technologies, Inc.) has developed to serve gas producers and field gathering companies.  He will be in Houston on Tuesday and plans to meet with Chris Hilgert at 10 am.  Eric suggested that Steve Hotte (or an alternate)meet with Dan.  Also, it would be useful to include somebody from one of the commercial teams (Mike Stage, Kim Watson, ???) to listen to the pitch.  

I have spoken with Chris and Dan and we agreed that it one presentation made the best use of Dan's time so it will be at 10:00 a.m. in EB3567.

Please let me know if you will attend or who you want to send so I can confirm with Chris.

Thanks!

Dear Jorge,

Although we expect to receive specific feedback on our July 6, 2001 proposal to Pemex for the TransPecos Pipeline very soon, we sent the attached letter today to Pemex (with a copy to Kinder Morgan) that will withdraw our proposal on October 1, 2001 if the LOI has not been executed.  

Kinder Morgan has agreed with the sending of this letter.  Pemex has been aware of the contents of this letter since Monday, September 17.

We will keep you posted of our detailed discussions with Pemex as they proceed.

Thanks,

down.  Thx,  JW

Hi Patrick,
 
This sounds just fine.  Shall we call you in your office?
 
Thanks, Kim.

How about 1:00 Pacific Time on Wednesday,  September 26.  Some of our folks trade or schedule in the morning so the 8:00 time doesn't work.

Attached shows a revision on page 2, paragraph 1.7.  There are really two (2) 12" taps proposed; one tap on each the main and loop lines.  They both swedge up immediately to 16" and from there into the proposed Big Sandy's lateral pipeline.  Nothing else stood out.

Kirk,

Attached, please find the Delivery Point Construction and Operations Agreement.  Please feel free to call me if you would like to walk through it.  I would be available for you tomorrow to do this if you would like.  Just let me know.

Thanks, Kim

                   

FYI - I spoke with John Sturn yesterday and he is coordinating the pigging of the SJ lateral to see if the efficiency of the drag reducing agent will increase.  He says the pig run will not interrupt scheduled flows on the pipe.  If the efficiency of the SJ lateral does not increase from the pig run, then Operations will look to reapply the DRA.

Kim.

Thanks John Monday October 1 will work for me.
RJ

To recap past conversations, Bloomfield to Gallup flow efficiency has decreased since application of the drag reducing agent last February.  It is planned to try and raise the flow efficiency by running a pig.  If this does not restore the flow efficiency and capacity, re-application of the DRA will be considered.

How does pigging Bloomfield to Gallup the first week in October sound?  Darrell pointed out that would provide a week's run time on the Gallup unit and be after a rotor inspection scheduled for September 29.

I suggest the teams ensure a pig is ready and make any other preparations necessary to run the pig.  The afternoon of Monday, October 1, a conference call would be held.  If there were no complications with Gallup or any other issues, the pig run would be scheduled for Wednesday or Thursday.

If you see any problems with this or have any other suggestions, please let me know.  Also please let me know if having the conference call at 2:00 p.m., CST, Monday, October 1, would work for you, and if not, then what time would be good.  I will plan on sending out the conference number and code next Monday, September 24.

Thanks,

John

Ron, would you please give me your thoughts on Kirk's question.  Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim-
Quick, question...on the cost estimate, does the cost include the meter set,
etc?
If so, can we have that broken out, as we discussed, so we can independently
bid that part of the interconnect?

FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Lindy,

Since the tolerance range is currently on the whole contract on a monthly basis, can we force the daily balancing issue?  Or at least pull the monthly tolerance level down to 1-2%?

Thanks for the note.  Kim.

Already in TW's Tariff

1.	Dollar valuing.  Need to terminate volumetric OBA's where possible to minimize TW's financial exposure.

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Keep

1.	Mandatory cash-out each month (after netting and option to trade).
2.	Definition of 6 indices (vs. 3 in current tariff).
3.	Parties may mutually agree to cash out PNR.  Could probably do today without this language.
4.	Clarification that PNR may be used by Operators.
5.	May use PNR for "auto-balancing".

Proposed in TW's 637 Filing - Could "Trade"

1.	Daily balancing.  Including daily tolerance, daily auto-transfer to PNR & daily pricing.
2.	Smaller tolerance range.  Proposed change from +/- 10% to +/- 5%.

	

Please let me know if you are available on Tuesday, September 25 to attend a lunch for Palu as an appreciation for her work on TW.

Thanks, Kim. 

I heard from Palu, she is available for lunch next Tuesday.

Michelle,

What is the status of your conversations with PG&E on the possible partnering on joint line in Calif. to serve power plants?  Kim

Yes, I plan to attend.  Thanks, Kim.

Please read the below letter (Sample) that you will be getting with your packet. 

Please confirm that you are planning to attend your session by responding to this email.  This is very important since I will be distributing the packets next week.

Next week you will be receiving the packet spoken of below containing:
A Participant Letter (see below)
A manager cover letter
A manager questionnaire
Seven employee cover letters
Seven employee questionnaires
Seven pre-addressed return envelopes for the completed questionnaires.

Further information will be sent periodically.

Thanks,
Maggie

Dear Participant:

It is our pleasure to welcome you to the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program on October 31 - November 2 at the Doubletree - Travis 1&2 .  The program is designed to help leaders develop the skills necessary to manage direct reports.  The program focuses on participative management skills and has leaders and their reports working together to shape goals, standards, and operating procedures, that I believe you will find both relevant and enjoyable.

Program Details

The program will begin at 8:30 a.m. each day and end at approximately 5:00 p.m. on the first 2 days and at 3:00 p.m. on the third day.  Dress is informal.

Because of the full program schedule, there will be no time for regular business contacts.  Therefore, we ask that you clear your calendar for the 3 days and make arrangements for someone to cover your phone calls.

Preparation Materials

Enclosed is the Preparation Materials booklet that you should read over and bring to the program.

Distributing the Enclosed Questionnaires

As part of your preparation for the Becoming an Exceptional Leader: a manager's level training program, you will also be distributing the enclosed questionnaires to your direct reports.  Many leaders spend a lot of time trying to figure out what their direct reports are thinking.  To help answer that question, one of the key components of this program is a confidential survey of your direct report's perceptions of your management skill.  The survey will help you to identify your strengths and determine areas in need of improvement.  You are the only person who will see the survey results, unless you decide to share them.

Distribute one of the enclosed questionnaires to each of the seven direct reports that you have selected.  You may wish to hand deliver each questionnaire so that you can personally explain its purpose.  In doing so you should emphasize that:

The reason you are asking him or her to fill out the questionnaire is to improve the quality of communication and effectiveness of work that transpires between you.

His or her responses are strictly confidential. (The survey report that you will see at the program will be the combined results of all your direct reports.)

The completed questionnaire must be received by the Forum Corporation for scoring no later than October 24th. Please allow 2 weeks for the questionnaire to travel through postal system.

The questionnaire instructions explain that the direct report must fill in the level he or she feels is required in each dimension and the level he or she feel you have attained.

I am confident that your direct reports will be happy to oblige.  The questionnaire should take no more than 10 minutes to complete.

Please note that a feedback report can only be generated for you when you use the questionnaire that I have assigned to you.  Should you or your direct reports misplace a questionnaire do not use a colleague's "extras" or photocopy questionnaires.  The questionnaires that have been assigned to you have a unique coding number which has been assigned specifically for you in order to create a custom feedback report.  The questionnaires assigned to you cannot be duplicated or modified in any valid way without my knowledge.  If you need replacement questionnaires for any reason, please see me and I will provide you with any extra questionnaires you may require.

I look forward to your participation in the program and know you will find it to be an interesting and rewarding experience.  If any questions remain unanswered, give me a call.

Sincerely,

Tom Wilbeck

L, 

Thank you for handling.  K.

Received a call today from Russ Boone with Duke out of Salt Lake City.  He was inquiring as to the cost of an interconnect and approximately 2 miles of pipe for Phase 1 - 105 mmbtu, and Phase 2 - 210 mmbtu.  He said he felt confident that 10" pipe could be used and asked if I could provide him with a ball park number on cost for Phase 1.  If I understood him correctly the location of the interconnect will be somewhere between West Texas and Roswell...   I didn't really get to much detail as I informed him that I would get in contact with someone that could provide him with the info requested.  He asked that if at all possible someone get back with him today.  (Tuesday)  

He can be reached at 801-531-4423.  

FYI, Kim.

	
FYI, here is an update from our meeting today,	

I did some checking to follow up on the Socal Window issue discussed in the meeting  today with our TMS IT team and Mary Draemer to find out the exact date when we implemented the EDI Socal Capacity Window. It was implemented on April 27, 2000. Socal began sending us the window volume via EDI at this time. Prior to this date, they faxed it to TW and the reps. would load that volume into the capacity system for the Socal point. Linda Ward thinks that we have the old fax documents saved in the file room.

Mary and I also called the EDI Hub team to find out how far back they store our EDI files. Currently the EDI Hub keep six months of data then the archive it. We could get to that date if needed. They would be a charge involved to pull archived data.

Wayne on the TMS team will also check to see if this information is replicated to adhoc (meaning we keep a complete history), or if it is not replicated (meaning we only keeps six months of data).

Please let me know if you need any other information.

Thanks Ramona

opps, I mis-typed this morning.  K.

J,

Do you think that if P & J and the kids went to Guam they would consider leaving Jo Lynn with the kids and come on to Hong Kong and join up with us?  

FYI, I still have small reservations about travelling abroad still close to our international situation.  Perhaps fear of the unknown.  Sitting on the fence.  Undecided.  

K.

Judy and I had a wild idea last night.  Since the kids are off the week of
Thanksgiving we are toying witht the 4 of us going to Guam.

Because a large number of our invitees had conflicting schedules, we are moving the date of our Appreciation Luncheon for the LAST TIME!!! 

This will be our last attempt to accommodate everyone.  Trust me, the food and games at Jillians will be well worth your patience.

Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  We feel that Friday,  the 5th of October would better suit the majority of our teams.  

We thank you for your patience and please respond by September 26.

Lindy,  Do you know if this means any changes for us?  Kim.

=09I believe that, unless a stay is granted, we must comply with the requir=
ements.

Christi --  I don't think it changes the requirement to file by October 1 e=
ither, and we are proceeding under the same schedule.  Several rehearing re=
quests were submitted, including one for ENA/EES.  However, note the follow=
ing which I sent out in an earlier message to the ENA/EES western commercia=
l and government affairs folks (I noted you deleted your message without re=
ading it.)  I consider the tolling of the rehearing order along with this O=
MB ruling a good sign. =20

As detailed in the attached FERC notice, the Office of Management and Budge=
t (OMB) has approved FERC's Information Collection Request for "Reporting o=
f Natural Gas Sales to the California Market" through the six-month emergen=
cy period that will expire on 1/31/02.  (Emergency reporting requirements a=
re automatically approved for six months under the OMB regulations.)  Howev=
er, it gave FERC several conditions that would have to be met before the re=
porting requirements could be extended.

OMB has advised FERC that, if it decides to request renewal of the Informat=
ion Collection Request after that date, it must address certain issues as p=
art of its supporting statement (more specifically, "include an explicit di=
scussion").  As you may remember, in addition to requesting rehearing of th=
e FERC order, ENA and EES submitted comments to OMB regarding our problems =
with FERC's estimate of the burden on affected companies of the proposed co=
llection of information.  We pointed out that we do not manage our business=
 in the manner contemplated by the reporting requirements, much less keep o=
ur records in that manner.  We manage our business on an aggregated basis, =
and complying with the requirements will require us to implement significan=
t manual review and analysis to arbitrarily define the components of a sale=
.  We stated that we might even have to hire full-time staff to dedicate to=
 the task.

The issues that we raised in our comments are the same ones that OMB requir=
es FERC to address if they submit a request for approval to extend the repo=
rting requirements past 1/31/02.  (FERC indicated in its July order that it=
 intended to extend the reporting requirement through 9/30/02 to coincide w=
ith the end date of its mitigation plan.)  OMB questioned the practical uti=
lity of requiring disaggregated data when "commenters" reported that they d=
id not maintain the data in a way that allowed them to report it that way. =
 OMB expressed concern that the data collection would require significant d=
ata manipulation in order to respond, and the resulting disaggregation woul=
d likely be artificial.  OMB also required FERC to evaluate its burden esti=
mates after "consulting with respondents", and it must provide a list of th=
e names, affiliates, and phone numbers of the respondents it contacted.

FERC has not yet issued an order on our rehearing request.  While we would =
not expect them to withdraw the reporting requirements entirely, it may be =
that the OMB action will affect their final decision.  At the least, it sen=
ds a signal!

 << File: IC01-721.00A (OMB).doc >>=20

Does this result in any change to the requirements to comply on 9/30?  I do=
n't see any, but was curious??  Mary Kay

FERC issued this tolling order today  on natural gas sales to California

Hey gang,

I just wanted you to know that I sent a fax early this week to cancel our hotel in Positano (Hotel Marincanto).  I did not receive a confirmation back from them, so I called them this morning.  Julio is the gentleman I talked to and he did inform me that the four rooms we had booked are cancelled.  I think we are OK, but I would feel better if we had written confirmation of the cancellation.  Please watch your credit card charges to ensure that you do not get billed for the hotel.

I have received written confirmation from the hotel in Rome (front end of trip) and the hotel in Florence of our cancellation.

Let's start looking at dates in 2002 to rebook this trip.  If one of you has some time, would you check to see if the weather would be better in May or June? Any thoughts? 

Thanks, Kim.

Steve and Teb(for Steve Veach),

Please review the attached work order for the tap and side valve for the new Agave interconnect.  Please forward an email message to Robert Geheb giving him your approval on this work order so that he may begin working with the appropriate people to get the materials ordered.  We are under a very tight time frame and we don't want to loose anytime.  The "paper" will follow to you shortly for signiture, but this email approval will keep the process moving.  Also, as soon as we work out the remaining details with Agave on the remaining costs, we will revise the work order to include the items that Agave will be constructing for us as well as provide the economics for the interconnect.  This, too, will be routed to you for your approval.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks, Kim. (X33098)

I don't see you on MSN, but I am on the phone now with Nanci and she is having back problems (a long story, I'll share later), but we are going to have to cancel the lake this weekend.  I have a 10:00 meeting, so I will have to run soon.  I'll call you when I get back.

I'm still OK taking off tomorrow and next week.  Maybe we stay home this weekend to be with Herschel, and if he is better, then we can take him to my mom's on Mon or Tue and go on to the Hyatt Hill Country next week.

Thoughts?

ILY, K.

Lindy, Since I will be gone tomorrow and next week.  Would you mind providing this information to Carmen?  I owe you one!

Overall, the results from Thursday's open season on our Sun Devil Project were very favorable (see below).  Contract terms ranged from two to sixteen years.

San Juan 	84% subscribed	at targeted transport rate
Phoenix		97% subscribed	at nearly targeted transport rate
Cal Border	77% subscribed	at 61% of targeted transport rate

We obviously have some work to do on the California piece but overall, the market interest supports our efforts to move forward with all due haste to the next level.  With that in mind, we'll begin working on the next steps below:

Next steps-
	 - Finalize Level A hydraulic study (9/7)
- Prepare Level B estimate  (9/30)
	- Schedule on-site ROW reviews (9/10)
- Schedule briefing session with FERC in September
- Issue press release on open season results (week of 9/3)
- Mobilize commercial teams to firm up contracts (week of 9/3)

For now, please regard this memo as highly confidential.  We appreciate everyone's support and hard effort thus far--  now the real fun begins!  Look for more info to follow soon and regularly scheduled project update meetings to begin in September.  

Please call me with any questions / concerns at 853-5559.
Best Regards,
Kevin Hyatt

The California Energy Commission has issued its final report on the California Infrastructure which is to be voted upon by the Commision on Wednesday.  Below is a summary of the report that was in Inside Ferc and attached is a copy of the full report (123 pages).  There's an executive summary at the beginning which is about 10 pages.  Although, as stated in the summary, the Commission found a lack of sufficient capacity on El Paso as a contributor to high prices, they do not take on the issue of market power as had been suggested by the CPUC and other commenters and blame the pipeline for such prices.  Instead they cite El Paso capacity problems as one of several factors which caused high prices last winter.  I'll keep you advised as to what happens on Wedneday at the CEC meeting.  gh

IN NEW REPORT, CEC COMMITTEE KEEPS EMPHASIS ON IN-STATE GAS CAPACITY
Constrained interstate gas pipeline capacity was just one of the factors that led to high natural gas
prices in California last fall and winter, according to a report issued last week by a committee of the
California Energy Commission. The revised final report on gas infrastructure issues notably skirted the
issue of market power as a factor in the gas price spikes that rocked the state.
After taking into consideration comments from the California Public Utilities Commission and others,
the report to the full CEC concluded that a number of factors were involved. ?Insufficient receipt capacity
within California and insufficient capacity on the El Paso [Natural Gas Co.] pipeline system both contrib-uted
to the high price of natural gas in the fall and winter of 2000,? the Sept. 24 report said. The CEC is
scheduled to vote Wednesday on the report.
The revised version took into account scarcity on the El Paso system but did not place the blame
entirely on that, noting the high demand for gas-fired electric generation and relatively low storage levels
during times of high gas prices. ?As a result of the insufficient capacity both to and within California,
buyers were less able to force suppliers to bid against each other. Whether prices during this period were, in
whole or in part, the result of a free market?s rationing of scarce suppliers through a scarcity premium, or
entirely the result of price manipulation, is beyond the scope of this report,? wrote Commissioner Michal
Moore, presiding member of CEC?s electricity and natural gas committee.
Pointing to the high-profile CPUC complaint (RP00-241) against El Paso Corp. pending at FERC, the
CEC added that it had ?every confidence that the interests of California ratepayers will be well-represented
by the CPUC.?
The report pointed to the fact that California shippers surrendered large blocks of capacity on the El
Paso system in recent years. ?The shortfall in capacity was absorbed by California, and not the upstream
customers. This is due, in part, to the decision a few years ago by California to turn back part of its rights to
firm capacity on the El Paso system. It is also due to the failure by El Paso to honor its contractual commit-ment
to deliver capacity paid for by California,? the report noted.
Moore?s committee had postponed issuance of the report after receiving comments on a draft version
from the CPUC, The Utility Reform Network and Southern California Edison Co., which all called for
consideration of allegations that El Paso exerted market power over gas sales into California (IF, 27 Aug,
1). The draft pointed to insufficient takeaway capacity in California and called for slack capacity in the
range of 15% to 20% (IF, 13 Aug, 4).
The report went on to suggest that California ?can no longer plan for the future as if we lived in a
regulated, cost-plus environment. Under price regulation, adverse hydroelectric conditions and extreme
temperatures did not lead to extreme price spikes. Under today?s conditions, that is no longer the case.?
Moore added that the state?s ?virtual complete reliance? on gas for electric generation has contributed to
the new dynamics surrounding capacity planning.
More than 100,000 Mw of gas-fired generation proposed for the Western Systems Coordinating Council
region demands expansion of the regional pipeline grid, the report continued, saying the CEC was ?encour-aged?
by recently announced expansion plans by interstate pipelines and FERC?s stated intent to expedite
review of such proposals. The report also noted that Southern California Gas Co. is developing 375,000 Mcf/
day of additional receipt capacity, which should be ready by the end of the year. Also, Pacific Gas and Electric
Co. plans to add as much as 600,000 Mcf/day of capacity by 2003, according to the report.
It observed that intrastate pipelines, in particular those in Southern California, ran at close to full
capacity at times this and last year, which created bottlenecks in delivering supplies from interstate
pipelines to gas consumers, including electric generators in 2000 and early 2001.
High prices in the future could be held at bay with the in-state expansions and the CPUC?s recent approval
of SoCal Gas? plan to remove 37 Bcf of cushion and working gas from three storage fields in Montebello and
Aliso Canyon in Los Angeles County and La Goleta in Santa Barbara County (IF, 2 July, 3).
In addition to strongly emphasizing intrastate needs, the report recommended that the state ?analyze
the consequences of the increasing upstream gas demands on the El Paso pipeline system as they affect the
flows of natural gas and electricity? between California and the Southwest U.S. and Mexico.
According to the report, the state also should: encourage in-state gas production; re-evaluate design criteria
for the intrastate system in consideration of growing power generation demand; consider gas curtailment
mechanisms; ?optimize? storage; and encourage the creation of new storage facilities in the state.
The 123-page report is available on the CEC?s Web site (www.energy.ca.gov/reports/index.html).

The attachment below is the final CEC Infrastructure report:

Hi Jean,

Is this order because Lorraine's desk top has been slow and she has not been able to keep the Dashboard and other applications open at the same time?

Also, I would like to inquire with you about ordering two flat screens for Paul.  He would like to still keep his laptop computer.  Can we accomodate two flat screens with his laptop?

Have you settled down from all the moves?  Where did you and Donna end up?  Will you be with us on 13?  

As always, many, many thanks!  Kim.

P.S.  The printers all got worked out?  Everybody happy?  :>)

fyi.
 
Karon -- please order a new desktop for Lorainne Lindberg.  Please charge to the  XXXXXX  code.

Lindy, I just saw this.  Did you know about this meeting?  I hope you were able to attend.  Thanks, Kim.

After the TW Marketing meeting in EB #1336 today please stay to discuss Ken Powers daily TW system reports.  We want to work on improving the daily imbalance reporting.

 

Steve, do you know Rodger Swenke with SoCal?  Kim.

Sounds like we will be dealing with Rodger Swenke and not Bob Betonte or Richard Ishiwaka on GISB issues from now on.  Does anyone know Rodger or know what his duties are at Socal Gas?

Dear Executive Committee Members, Alternates and Participants,

It is with regret that I inform you that Bob Betonte with SoCal Gas will no 
longer represent the LDC segment on our EC.  Bob has been with the EC for 
many years and he has worked with his colleagues on the EC though many thorny 
issues.  Clearly, his contributions will be missed.  A voluntary effort such 
as ours would not be successful without the generous donation of the time and 
efforts of committee members such as Bob, and the willingness of SoCal Gas to

Mark,  thanks for the notice of this meeting.  I'm glad you will be attending.  FYI, the Aquila folks purchased USGT from Nanci MacKenzie about 18 months ago and I'm not sure how they have incorporated the USGT organization into the Aquila organization.  Since you are the new kid, perhaps you can inquire as to the differences in these shops so that you can effectively deal with both organizations.  I'm not sure we've ever been clear on this.  Please continue to talk about Red Rock with these folks.  What would Aquila like to see TW offer?  What are their thoughts about the West markets?  What could TW do to get Aquila to be more active on our pipe? 

FYI, I am coming into the office Wed morning.  I will be in EB4179.  I need to meet with Martha and pack up this office.  I should be in by 9:00.  If your schedule permits, perhaps you and I could meet for a few minutes on Agave before your 10:00 Aquila meeting?

I'll call you when I get in.  

Thanks, Kim.  

Steve, FYI- a success of collecting one of the Shipper imbalances.

Vince, I would like to visit with you about this training.  Also, I noticed that you had some of the folks in our shop on the invite list, but not all of them?  Are you available on Monday by phone to visit with me about this training?  I would be available at 2:00pm for half an hour.  Let me know if this works for you. 

Thanks, Kim.

Kevin, when and where is the meeting on 10/8?  

Thanks, Kim.

We expect the cost estimate to be completed 10/2 and will likely begin the weekly meeting Monday 10/8.

Paul, 

Tiny(aka David Roensch - who is the Team Leader for the San Juan and West of Thoreau Area) just sent these to me.  FYI. 

Kim.

I am assuming these were the last contracts.  They are the last ones I was forwarded any how.  None the less, my top two concerns Today:

I assume we are going to compare the predicted economics to the actual economics then look at alternatives to options in Sun Devil (Like a GE turbine)  I've got an idea of what we can do for the fuel portion of this deal if we do look at turbines.
One of the issues dicussed in detail before we did this project with ECS was WHY is TW doing a deal with ECS versus a stand alone deal.  If I remember correctly, the pitch to FERC was that TW did not have the expertise to facilitate a peak avoidance alone.  Mary Kay Miller should remember these details...

Attention Korey........Per phone call this morning.......    

The CSA specifies ECS's obligation in helping us avoid the demand energy charge.  The demand charge is $12.21 * 10,000 KW  * 12 Months = $1.465,200 of potential rebate back to TW each year.

Unfortunately, I do not know Rodger.  I sent this message on to Steve to see if he knows of him.  Thanks, Kim.

Sounds like we will be dealing with Rodger Swenke and not Bob Betonte or Richard Ishiwaka on GISB issues from now on.  Does anyone know Rodger or know what his duties are at Socal Gas?

Dear Executive Committee Members, Alternates and Participants,

It is with regret that I inform you that Bob Betonte with SoCal Gas will no 
longer represent the LDC segment on our EC.  Bob has been with the EC for 
many years and he has worked with his colleagues on the EC though many thorny 
issues.  Clearly, his contributions will be missed.  A voluntary effort such 
as ours would not be successful without the generous donation of the time and 
efforts of committee members such as Bob, and the willingness of SoCal Gas to 
support Bob's participation in our organization.

The LDC segment ran its election and voted to support Rodger Swenke, Senior 
Pipeline Products Project Manager, SoCal Gas, to take the open seat on the 
EC.  Please join me in welcoming Rodger to our committee; and thanking Bob 
for all his efforts and wishing him well in his new job assignments with 
SoCal Gas.

Kimberly,

I'm sorry, I was out of the office last week and did not see this email in time.  I think it looks fine.  I saw the final version in the ebiz today.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim:

I work with Gina Taylor in Communications, and I was wondering if you would review this to see if it makes sense. It is for this Friday's Layman's Terms in eBiz.

Also, after reading this, do you think we need to put in the story the % of firm and interruptible service on Enron's pipelines? What is the advantage of firm? Would you please also verify the analogy?

Thanks!

Has anyone talked with Caithness lately?  I heard their water rights got shot down at the local town council.  Is there a possibility they may want to move their project a little further east so that it sits on the Sun Devil expansion?

Also, I believe Jo told me there was a Jeff Voydyne (sp?) that should be included.  Can someone please forward me the correct spelling of his name so I can invite him?

Thanks!

Jo indicated you both were working to update our 1998 Map.  What is your timeline for completion as we are desparate for maps and need to get some printed.

As I understand/interpret the Gallup contract, we can completely avoid electrical power demand charges (approximately $42,000 per month) if we do not run the unit during the power utilities peak power period.  If we can not shut down the unit, we can still reduce or demand costs by minimizing our power usage during the peak period.

Unlike Hubbard where the contract states avoiding the peak during a specified period of the day (5-7 PM), Gallup requires us to guess both the day of the month their peak will occur and the time of day.  Through access to Tri-States history data, I can guess what I think the minimum peak for the month will be.  I can look at the current day's usage and estimate if today's peak will be higher than the higher of (1) my estimated peak or (2) the actual peak so far this month.  If so, the "Probability today is a peak" will be near 100 indicating the operators they should expect a possible power peak sometime today.   The "Probability now is peak" approached 100 when an actual peak is underway.  The Tri-State Power Peak In Progress alarm triggers when a power peak is underway.

Note that it is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy if any day in the month is an actual power peak.  If the first day of the month has an estimated peak 1000 and last years peak for the same month, was 985.  It appears possible that this will be a power peak day.  Assume that the actual peak usage for the first day was 1010.  Now on the second day of the month, the estimated peak is 965, not likely to be a power peak day.  The third day has an estimated peak of 1005, a possible power peak day.  If the actual for the third day is 1012, it now becomes the new peak for the month.  If all other estimated peaks in the month are significantly below 1012, they are not likely to be power peaks, and unit turndown is not required.

The point is, to completely avoid demand charges, we would have had to shut down the unit for a period on the first day of the month, and also on the third day.  The utility integrates their peak over a 30 minute period, thus the minimum time the unit could be down.  I'm guessing that my utility could predict around seven peaks requiring turndown in a given month.

So far this month, I guessed a power peak on 10/1/01 starting at 20:18 and ending at 21:05.  The actual peak so far this month according to the utility was 10/1/01 starting at 20:30 lasting to 21:00.

I'm sorry for any confusion.  I had asked Dale to pass this information on to the Operators.  If there are any additional questions, do not hesitate to call me at 87-7546.

Gary would you please respond to their question as it is our concern as well.

ds

Rich / Rick,

Operations & the Gas Controllers didn't know about this till yesterday, when alarms started to appear in Houston.
I'm not sure what is expected from operations. In the last paragraph of Gary's letter, he indicates shutting down
for 30 minutes, 7 times a month. Is that what he is saying? Let us know what you find out.

Thanks,
Korey

We have added some point to the Scada database that are provided to us
by Gary Choquette's Peak Power Predictor.  His message below describes
their function better than I would.

I've listed the points below with their descriptions, alarm value(s) and
comment.

Although these points are listed with the other Analog/Discrete points,
they are not coming from the field RTU.  They will act like normal
points so it's easy to put them together.  For those using the intranet
"Adhoc" reports, they will show up on that.  The key is that the
Discretes that we receive from Gary all end in ".CC" and the Analogs end
in ".SC".  We also try to include the (CLC) in the description to depict
that the information is coming from the Closed Loop Control Systems.

Register	Description				Alarm Value
Gary's Comments

GALP.1901.CC	Tri-State Data Old - site Unavail (CLC)	0 = Normal, 1 =
Alarm 		(can not retrieve data from Tri-States site)
GALP.1902.CC	Tri-State Calc Off-Line / Data Error (CLC) 	0 =

I hope to have the revised contract for you late tonight.  Would you like to set up a time that Ron and I can go over it with you by telephone?  How about Monday or Tuesday?

Thanks, 
Kim.

Hi Kim-
Just wanted to check the status of the TW interconnect bids for Big Sandy (w
and w/o meter set, etc.).
Hope that you are doing well.
Best regards,
Kirk

Kevin, 

Thanks for keeping up with this.

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

Yes, I will be there.  Thanks, Kim.

FYI, Kim.

            We met with SoCal today to discuss the changes SoCal is making for
	November 1.  Here is a high level recap in relation to impacts on TW:

	1.  SoCal will NOT set the capacity at needles lower than 750 unless
	     they have operational problems. And they will maintain 750 for a gas 
	     day (during all cycles).  (Good news for TW)

	2.  SoCal may set a capacity higher than 750.  If they do, they will
	     maintain that capacity for a gas day (during all cycles), unless there
	     are specific operational problems. (Good news for TW)
	   
	4.  SoCal will have the option to call OFO's at the beginning of each cycle
	     for the gas day, which could cause a confirmation reduction.  Today they
	     only call an OFO before the gas day begins.   Starting Nov. 1, they can 
	     call an OFO anytime before a GISB cycle, including Intraday 1 and 
	     Intraday 2 which are cycles in the gas day. (This will be a major impact
	     to SoCal's customers)

	5.  SoCal says the "windowing" is gone.  But, they are still giving us a
	     capacity and TW will continue to do the allocation if nominations
	     exceed their capacity.

	6.  SoCal can still reduce the scheduled volumes after an allocation.  This
	     would be due to SoCal's market not burning their schedule.  At that
	     time SoCal will confirm down to the market burn.

	Overall, our process does not change. If you have any questions, please
	let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

	

I'll be there.  Thanks, Kim.

We can meet in our video conference room 42C2 which Pilar has booked for us from 10:30 to 11:00.   See you then.

Do you have open conference rooms on your floor?  If not, we have a great conference room in 1336 that is just for us.

Just let me know.  Thanks, Kim.

Thanks Kim,  Friday 10:30 works well for Sue and myself.  Where would you like to meet?

How about Friday about 10:00 ro 10:30?

Kim.

Kim,
Per our conversation yesterday after the morning meeting, Sue and I would like to get together with you to go over Agave's plan for a future Park & Ride agreement.   Would you let us know what time is good for you? 

Thanks.

Kirk,

Would you be available on Tuesday morning for breakfast?  Otherwise, both Ron and I are available anytime in the morning.  If you had only afternoon available, I can meet with you.  Let me know what works for you.  

FYI, I am sending the revised agreement to you today so that you have a chance to review it before we meet.  

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim.
I am planning to be in Houston Monday night/Tuesday day.
Not sure of exact schedule yet...if I can break free, I would love to see
you both personally.
If not, perhaps I can at least catch up with you via phone.
I will call you either way on Monday to set something up.
Hope that I can get a revised contract today to review.
Thanks for your efforts.

Steve, 

Here it is.  Kim.

 

Linda, 

Thank you for your help!  I miss seeing your smiling face.  It's lonely here on the 13th floor. 

Thanks, Kim.

 

Kirk, How early are you in on Monday?  I do have two appointments after 5:00, so Monday evening would be difficult for me, but we may be able to swing the late afternoon.  Otherwise, let me know what works for you on Wed or Thurs by phone.  

Have a safe travel...

Kim.

Hi Kim-
Right now, I think I am fully booked on Tuesday.
It may be that I catch up with you guys via phone.
However, if my schedule get's freed up a bit, I really would like to see
you.

Hi Kyle!

I must not have your current office telephone number.  Please send it to me.  I would like to connect up with you this weekend if you are available.  I cleaned all of our closets last week and have the "big load" that I would like to pass on to you for your MANNA collection.  

How on earth are you?  I am still sad and overwhelmed from the Sept. 11 tragedy.  I cannot believe we watched that event unfold like that!  These are certainly interesting times....

Call me or email me, I'd like to visist!

 Many thanks,

Kim.

Kirk,

As per our phone conversation, here is the revised Delivery Point Construction and Operating Agreement.  Please let me know if you will have some time on Monday or Tuesday when you are in Houston and Ron and I can review this with you.  If we don't connect up in person, then let me know if you would like to book a telephone conference call Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.  

Have a nice weekend and safe travel to Houston!

Thanks, 

Kim

                   

Let's discuss this on Monday.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim
Monday I will be on vacation.
I have listened to the message from Questar and it seems like that the Morongo Valley area ( with R.O.W issues) is a few miles away 
from the SOCAL interconnect. 
The distance from Needles to SOCAL interconnect is approximately 90 miles. The horse power requirements to handle up to
100 mmcf/d from Needles to SOCAL is around 2,500 hp.

Based on the above, and also assuming that SOCAL has the capacity to handle up to 100 mmcf/d at a pressure of 850 psig
at this location, the conversion/ compression cost is as follows:

Conversion costs for 90 miles:		 $9,000,000 

Compression cost:		           	 $6,000,000	

Total costs				$15,000,000

Note: As we have discussed before this cost is based on EE&CC cost estimate of 1997 plus 5% escalation for each year.

Hi everyone!

Attached, please find the resume of Mark Pickering who is the Chief Technology Officer for Enron Net Works and is the lead candidate for Bruce Stram's replacement on the board.  Please take a moment to review his resume as we will discuss his candidacy for the board this evening.  

Thanks, Kim.

 

The agenda for Monday's meeting is attached.

 << File: Agenda 10,01.doc >> 

I will meet everyone at Hungry's at 6:30.

Thanks, Kim.

Houshyar and I just confirmed dinner for tonight. He suggested that we
go to Hungry's in Rice Village for dinner at 6:30 PM. Does that work for
everyone?

Paula

Jack, 

Do we have another email address for Robert James?  My email to him was undeliverable.  Do you know if he will be at the meeting tonight?

Thanks, Kim.

The agenda for Monday's meeting is attached.

 << File: Agenda 10,01.doc >> 

TK,

Would you please handle this.  

Thanks, Kim.

I would recommend that we just have them nominate it out when it is convenient for TW and not charge them any additional fees.  Is there a procedure in place that will prevent us from missing a balance like this again? 

Sue

In analyzing shipper imbalance statements, Laura Giambrone discovered a PNR balance of 10,000 Dth on the above noted contract. The balance was parked on TW on April 26, 2000 and PNM paid a $0.03 per Dth/d fee in that month . TW has not billed PNR fees on the balance since May 1, 2000. PNM has not inquired about nor nominated the redelivery of the quantities held by TW.
How should this matter be handled?   

Audrey,

Looks like we will have to change Steve's 2002 Plan meeting....

Kim.

Please join us at an all-employee meeting at 10 a.m. Houston time, Tuesday, October 23, in the Hyatt Regency Houston's Imperial Ballroom.  We will review third quarter financial and operating highlights and action steps we're taking based on the results of the Lay It On the Line survey.  We welcome your questions.  Please send them to Courtney Votaw by e-mail (Courtney.votaw@enron.com), fax (713-853-6790), or interoffice mail (EB 4704B).  We look forward to seeing you there.

Katie,

When I talked to Kyle last week I didn't realize that you are still driving into downtown everyday.  I have my trunk loaded with some contributions for MANNA and would like to pass them off to you when it is convenient.  What is your schedule during this week?  I could meet you during lunch or at the end of your day any day this week, whatever you prefer.

Many thanks,

Kim

P.S.  How was Mickey's birthday parties this weekend?  

Can we meet on Monday?  Perhaps after the TW staff meeting which ends about 3:30 to 3:45.  

Kim.

Thanks Kim,

Let me know when you have a few minutes to visit briefly. I know you're busy, so I won't take up too much of your time.

Jerry

Jerry,

Steve Harris asked me to get with you and coordinate any outage planning input that you need from our group.  Please let me know how I can be of assistance. 

Thanks, Kim.

TK,

John and I had such a big time at your house Saturday evening!  It was so kind of you to open your incredibly spectacular home to us.  I just love everything that you have done....it is truly lovely.  It was so nice to meet your sisters.  I can imagine that your family reunions are just a hoot!  And the food.....well it was awesome.

Thanks again.  Hope you are feeling better.

Kim and John

No problem, it will be nice to visit with him.

K.

PS.  Does this mean that I will be in the back seat of the convertable?  If so, I'm afraid we will have to ride with the top up.

Kim -

Gary Heaton is going to ride with us to SA on Friday.  I'll pick him up at
noon and then we'll head down to you or to the Spires and leave from there.

SYT,
John

Audrey, how about moving the meeting to 8:30?  We will have to leave here by 9:35 or so to get a seat at the employee meeting.  

Kim.

Because of the scheduled Employee Meeting at the Hyatt, we will move Steve's meeting to 9:00a on Tuesday.

I agree with you on the Lexus.  I'm not sure we should take it out long distance.  If Gary doesn't mind, that would be great.

ILY, K.

Are you comfortable with us taking the Lexus?  Gary has offered to let us
take his car out and then I'll drive it back on Thursday (he, Lora Lee, Ivy
and an aunt are heading off to a B & B in the hill country after the
meeting).  I'd almost rather do that than chance the Lexus' transmission,
given how jumpy it was when I drove it over the weekend.

Besides, I don't think we could fit three persons' luggage in the trunk of
the Volvo.

Sounds good. K.

I'm going to meet Gary at his house at noon on Friday, leave my car in his
garage, then we'll drive down to pick you up (where?).  On Thursday I can
swap cars at his house and bring mine home that night.

Danny is sick at home but has OK letter.  Eric wants an offer 10-15MM to insure entry to data room.  I'm OK with 10-12. Kim.

From whence shall we pick you up on Friday, assuming a 1 p.m. departure?

Shelly, Steve does not know him either.  Kim.

Never heard of him.

Steve, do you know Rodger Swenke with SoCal?  Kim.

Sounds like we will be dealing with Rodger Swenke and not Bob Betonte or Richard Ishiwaka on GISB issues from now on.  Does anyone know Rodger or know what his duties are at Socal Gas?

Dear Executive Committee Members, Alternates and Participants,

It is with regret that I inform you that Bob Betonte with SoCal Gas will no 
longer represent the LDC segment on our EC.  Bob has been with the EC for 
many years and he has worked with his colleagues on the EC though many thorny 
issues.  Clearly, his contributions will be missed.  A voluntary effort such 
as ours would not be successful without the generous donation of the time and 
efforts of committee members such as Bob, and the willingness of SoCal Gas to 
support Bob's participation in our organization.

The LDC segment ran its election and voted to support Rodger Swenke, Senior 
Pipeline Products Project Manager, SoCal Gas, to take the open seat on the 
EC.  Please join me in welcoming Rodger to our committee; and thanking Bob 
for all his efforts and wishing him well in his new job assignments with 
SoCal Gas.     

Best Regards,  Rae

Where?

FYI, I am in training tomorrow, Wednesday, from 8:00 until noon in the 3 Allen Center.  I can be reached by my cell phone if you need me.

Thanks, Kim.

Why don't we try after work?  Just let me know when you are ready to walk out and I will meet you in the lobby.  We can go to your car, drive to mine and then unload.  Thank you so much for being the transportation conduit for MANNA.

Kim :>)

 HI Kim!

 It looks like I might be going to luch around 1:30 or we could try for after work. What is your day like?

 KAtie

You bet, come to EB1336.  K.

Do you have a team room available?  

Where?

Did I follow up with you verbally on this?  K.

Kim - Is there a particular person in PA I should talk to about this?  Thanks.

The work is completed and the project is closed.  The figures that I saw indicated that the project was under budget where Red Cedar might be receiving some change.  I think after a job has been closed and 180 days has passed then Property Accounting is the group responsible for handling the invoicing business that you are inquiring about.  Check with Kim Watson in this regard, she is currently working with some claim issues concerning the Calpine interconnect.  Perhaps she can direct you with the process.

Eric - Could you please check with Earl on my Red Cedar question?  Thanks.

What's your schedule on the EDG business?  I would recommend Ron, at this point.  EF  

I have figures on the second part that needs to verified by Earl Chanley to be certain all costs have been submitted.  Earl has been on vacation last week and returned yesterday.  I am sure he has been getting caught up and I await his reply.

Eric - What is the status of my request?
Eric - I am working with a company called Energy Development Group which is proposing to build power plants along TW's pipeline.  I have spent several telephone sessions with them trying to help them understand exactly where TW's line runs in certain areas of New Mexico and Arizona.  At this point in time I need some assistance from Facility Planning in order to more specifically identify the areas EDG is concerned with.  Would you please let me know who I can work with on this one?

Also, earlier this year, TW constructed a new receipt point in the La Plata station yard for Red Cedar.  Red Cedar paid TW $450,000 for the new point stating that "If the actual costs of constructing the new interconnect is less than $450,000, Red Cedar shall be entitled to a credit in the amount of the difference between $450,000 and the actual cost."  Please let me know what the actual cost of the new facilities ended up being.  Thanks.

Lorraine 

Many, many thanks!  Kim.

I spoke with Earl this morning. He has located a Grove valve from another vendor and we are still on target
for an in-service date of December 1, 2001.  

Lorraine,

I will be in a meeting during this time.  Will you be able to sit in on this and decide if we should participate further for our group?

Thanks, Kim.

A Conference call to discuss any comments we may want to make on the CPUC's Proposed Decision in the GIR Proceeding has been scheduled for Wednesday, Oct. 17, 2001 at 11:00 AM Houston/Omaha time and 9:00 AM California time.  The dial-in # is 1-877-795-3687 code: 350955.  In Houston, Conf. Rm. 1336 has been reserved for the call.  

Here it is.  

 

FYI, Kim.

Mark and Kim,

Please ask Steve Dowd to stand in for me for commercial steering/oversight - - - he's amply qualified/experienced for this endeavor and it fits his Corp Dev remit.

The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

Can't today - next week?
Hi Stephanie,

By chance are you available for lunch today?  Kim.

Sorry, believe it or not, I do know better.  I was even talking with Lee as it was being faxed so that she could grab it....she was too slow...

I will mend my ways...sorry to make you crazy!

Kim  :>)

I have a request on behalf of all the secretaries around the world:

Pretty please put fax cover sheets on your stuff!  That Conf. Agr. has been floating around up here all afternoon with no takers until Lee just asked me if she received a fax.  Thanks very much!  :-)

Paul,
 
Thanks for the update.  I'm glad that he is off the activity diet and allowed the wheels both big and small.  I'm glad your trip to the big city doc was a pleasant one.  Pediatric docs are truly a special breed.  
 
Thanks, 
Kim.

We saw the Pediatric Orthopedist today.  First I must say it was one of the most smoothly run Dr. visits I've been on.  We had an appointment at 1:30 and low and behold we were talking to the Dr. at 1:30!  The Dr. was also very nice.  He answer our questions without being arrogant and he spoke in plain English.   

Basically he said the modern theory was that half of the cases went away on their own, so we have an appointment in 3 months to check on Power  establish a trend line.  In the mean time he's free to do what he wants to but allowed to sit out if his hip bothers him, i.e.  self limiting kind of like my top speed on a bike.  If at 3 months its getting better, we continue the agressive treatment by visiting every 3 months.  If it is not getting better then we look at something more intrusive.  He explained the crutches and braces that used to be the normal treatment were more to slow the boys down than anything else and recent studies had not proven them that effective.  Power is also allowed to take some Motrin or other over the counter pain medication if he wants. 

The Dr. discouraged anything like cross country running, but emphasized keeping the joint exercised was good, so no couch potato.  The Dr. okayed the wheels so bike and skates are back on the menu.  Judy is going to sign him up for the Wednesday swim in the indoor pool at the park in Katy.   

Further updates next January 

Ron, how is your calendar tomorrow?  I probably prefer tomorrow over Monday if possible. 

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim.
Well, I am back from Houston, and would love to visit with you regarding the
agreements/estimates.
How does tomorrow look on your calendar?
I am also available Monday bright and early.
Thanks,

Has this been corrected?  Please keep Jan informed of any invoice changes. 

Thanks, Kim.

FYI.
FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, "We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies." 
Regent President John Ehrman said, "The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease." 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease. 

John, 
I've been out of town this week, but I did want you to know that I received your message.  Fran Fegan is our HR rep and she can help you and Karen coordinate the paperwork.  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim -

I am in a crisis simulation meeting this morning but wanted to make sure you got my message Friday that I would like to post for the position in your group.  I need to contact Robin Treadwell, my HR rep, to get the paperwork started from here in Santa Cruz.

Thanks,
John

FYI, Kim.

Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  

On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  

If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.

Lorraine,

Have you had any discussion with SWG regarding their Pataya or Red Lake Storage field?

Thanks, Kim.

At our meeting Thurs 7/19 with SouthWest Gas, Tom Armstrong informed us that SWG is the property and mineral rights holder for this salt dome north of the TW line near Kingman.  SWG is completing a feasibility and engineering analysis on developing the potential gas storage site.  I indicated that TW / Enron would welcome an opportunity to work with SWG in developing the storage field and Tom was very receptive to the idea.

SWG refers to the project as their Pataya or Red Lake storage field.  The project would be 12 bcf net of pad gas, turn 12x per year, with 300mm/d deliverability.  Phase I of 6 bcf may be operational by late 2003.  Tom and I agreed to stay in touch on the project.  SWG hopes to have a decision to move forward by year end 2001.  

Hi Kevin,

Do you know anything about potiential salt dome storage near Station 1?  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim, I sent the message pasted below to Kevin 4/16/01.  As a matter of fact Kevin caught up with me Friday to chat about a peaker facility being investigated near Flagstaff and I asked him about this.  He did not have much info yet but said he was just getting to the point of having an opportunity to look into it......   

Kevin, I can't remember who was asking (or if it was even Marketing asking the question) but, a couple of weeks ago someone wanted to know if we knew of any salt domes or potential storage fields in the Needles area.   Well I kind of forgot about it for a few weeks and once I got to checking there are some salt domes in the Kingman area.  They are located about 10 miles North of Kingman and word is that El Paso had looked into developing these domes several years ago but never did anything but look.  I'm under the impression that the area is still privately owned but I'm not certain.  Anyhow, just thought we would pass this along and if this is something of interest or if you need more information let us know....  Oh yea, Transwesterns pipeline is just South of Kingman, Az.  (approximately 10 to 12 miles from the domes.)  

Tiny,

Now that we are bobbing up for air from Red Rock, I wanted to investigate this a little further.  I have not found anyone from Marketing who recalls looking at a potential salt dome storage on TW near Station 1.  Are you familiar with anything that may be happening on this?  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,

At one time there was someone in marketing looking at developing salt dome storage on TW near Station 1.  I was wondering what if any was the status of that evaluation.  Given the increasing number of power plants being installed in the area, this has the potential to reduce expansion costs where we have highly variable loads.

Lee,

Well, I'm not crazy, just dumb not to think about looking at all the emails Denise has sent to me.  This is the original language you drafted for me for the Questar amendment.  By the way, I did send them the most recent version you send me which in not as verbose as this version.  Are we still OK? 

Thanks, Kim. 

This is a draft.  I don't think Enron Pipeline Company exists now.  I will check.  Also, what is the correct reference to Kinder Morgan.  Corp?  Company?  LLP?

Lorraine,

Would you please take a look at the attached spreadsheet and determine which power plants may be close to our pipeline.  Bill Wood would like us to respond by mid November.  

Thanks, Kim.

Can you please have someone in the group take a look at this so we can respond promptly? Thanks.

Steve,
 
Attached is a list of about 350 power plants scattered across the western  states.  This list includes all power plants including coal, natural gas,  wind, etc that we have identified.  Would you mind having someone checking  off which of the power plants most likely would be directly served by  Transwestern Pipeline?
 
If you have other affliates that will serve some of the power plants or if  you are aware of other plants, please include them.
 
This is a part of the integrated planning we are under taking.  Our  NARG model and the Electricty Analysis Office's models are now tuned  to include power plants that maybe directly served by interstate power  lines.  We provide forecasted natual gas prices by pipeline designation to  the Electricty Analysis Office.  
 
By having generation plants grouped by pipeline the EAO can provide back to  us natural gas demand for electricity generation by intertate pipeline.   
 
By this process the EAO gets gas prices for modeling the electricity market  and we get gas generation demand to model natual gas pipelines.
 
We are not in a rush to get this information so take your time.  If  you need a date to shoot for then mid Novemeber, say Friday the 16th.
 
Thanks for your help.

Hey Tiny,

Thanks for your voice mail regarding Griffith.  I will scout it out on Monday and let you know if I hear any confirmation of the water supply.  Gee, I hope it's not true.  

We are still on for August 8 for our strategy session between Facility Planning and Marketing.  I believe that HR will be sending out the invite.  I thought it would go out this past week, but I'm sure you'll see something early next week.  We will start at 8:00am on the 8th and go until about 7:00 or 8:00pm.  We will be at the Four Seasons Hotel in downtown Houston.

Thanks, Kim.

According to Bonnie White, the time period for Oasis to appeal ends on Friday 11/2.  If there is no appeal, then Enron will file a writ of execution with the local sherriff who will go out to the business and seize property in an amount to satisfy the judgement.  This is cheaper than hiring a collection agency and we retain more of the funds.  Let me know if you have questions.

Craig,

Can we get together and talk about this?  I was out of town several days last week, and as I look at it now, I want to make sure I understand the questions that Rita is asking and I'm wondering if we need to do something different with the way that we fill out the deal sheet.  

Can you help me comb through this?

I'm in the office all next week.  Just let me know when it is convenient for you.  

Thanks, Kim. 

I'm looking at Quickplace Business Requrement BUSRQ13.doc "Setup & Maintenance of Contract Level Discounts"
I have a question about a couple of discount data elements defined for TW.

#1
On p. 11, the requirements define values for Item (31) Discount Type:
TW 
M - Negotiated
D - Discounted

? In CBS, "M" flags "priority" rates which are like NNG's Tariff Exceptions.  
Does TW plan to use the Deal Sheet to enter both discounts & all priority/exception rates?  for discounts and for 
priority rates associated with FERC-defined Negotiated Rates?  Do you plan to differentiate between FERC Negotiated Rate exceptions  and other exceptions like surcharges, low-load GRI Reservation contracts, or points where normal tariff rates are not applicable?

NNG
C-Competitive
S-Settlement (I dont' think "S" has been used for anything except a few Gathering deals stemming from the Global Settlement).  

NNG Tiered discounts can be 
D=Based on levels of daily flow
M=Based on monthly volume levels - used mainly with tiered-reservation rates. 
    For example, if a contract has MDQ of 10,000, Monthly Tiered discount could be for
$4 on first 5000
$3 on next 2500
max rate on remaining 2500

Thanks.

DICTATION DRAFT FROM GREG PORTER

I just spoke with Georgetta Baker, lawyer for SoCalGas, and Rick Miles, FERC's ADR group.  We discussed the possibility of mediation based upon both parties representing in pleadings filed in Docket No. RP01-620 (TW Complaint) that both companies were interested in alternate dispute resolution (ADR).  After discussing the various types of ADR, we agreed to begin with mediation.  Rick Miles will be the mediator.

The mediation process that was discussed was an evolutionary one whereby parties would meet in a neutral location to discuss resolution (i.e., settlement) of its claims.  Both parties indicated a willingness to settle.  Rick Miles will act as a facilitator.  Mr. Miles' function will be one of moderating discussions and not evaluative.  As the mediation process continues without resolution, Mr. Miles' role will evolve.  Later on, if the parties desire, Mr. Miles offered to bring in a FERC staffer that is a subject matter expert to offer his or her views of each party's case.   Also, if the parties desire, the subject matter expert would indicate how he or she would recommend the Commission rule on the merits.

Initial dates of November 7-8 or November 13-14 were offered as potential dates for the first meeting.  A neutral location needs to be agreed upon.  Once additional information is learned, I will advise.  In the meantime, if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Lee, FYI, Kim.

Jodi,

Here is a list of items we would like to see in the data room.  Please give us a call so we can discuss.  

Thanks for all of your help,
Kim 

 

Steve, FYI, Lorraine is having her procedure to have intravenous (sp?) antibiotics installed for her sinus problems.  She anticipates being out of the office the week of 11/5 to recover.

Kim.

Kim - I have scheduled my surgery for Monday, 11/5.  In preparation, I must have pre-op and a meeting with my doctor on Thursday, 11/1.  I will be leaving the office around 11 am on 11/1.

Lorraine 

Mike, I'm sorry I accidentally deleted you off the distribution list when I was putting this together and didn't realize it until this morning.  My apologizes.

Thanks, Kim.

For your information, attached is the redlined version of the LOI from Pemex.  I have been discussing these comments with Dave Matney at Kinder Morgan.  I have also discussed these comments with Pemex and they do intend on giving us feedback on the rate we offered within the next week.  It is Pemex's intention to move forward with this LOI with an agreed upon rate (even though it currently says "To Be determined") prior to execution.  I will keep you posted as we get more information.  If you have any comments regarding any of these issues, please feel free to contact me, otherwise, please look forward to review our next draft prior to us sending it back to Pemex.

Thanks, 
Kim (X33098)

   

Richard,

These summaries are great!  Our desk is starting to get more of a commercial focus on these imbalances.  May I ask you to put a date on the actual spreadsheet?  As I keep them from week to week, I find that I can't always tell which one is the most current summary.  

Many thanks and see you in the next Tues. meeting,
Kim.

The attached summary will be discussed after the gas control meetings tomorrow  (Tuesday 7/24/2001)

 << File: imbalsumm0107.xls >> 

Kirk, 

No problem.  We will make ourselves available when you are ready.  We are very interested in your progress with the ACC.  Good luck and keep us posted!  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,
Thanks so much for your patience.
I have been busier than busy.
I do want to talk with you regarding Big Sandy.
The project is currently in its appeal process with the ACC...hopefully will
know yeah/neigh later today or tomorrow.
I will endeavor to buzz you tomorrow (I am in my Irvine office today, with a
full slate of meetings).
Regards,
Kirk

Kirk,

As per our phone conversation, here is the revised Delivery Point
Construction and Operating Agreement.  Please let me know if you will
have some time on Monday or Tuesday when you are in Houston and Ron and
I can review this with you.  If we don't connect up in person, then let
me know if you would like to book a telephone conference call Wednesday,
Thursday or Friday.  

Have a nice weekend and safe travel to Houston!

Thanks, 

Kim

Thanks for the reminder.  Ask me when we get home.  K.

Any answer to the question below?

Kim -

Do you have Victor's phone number?  I may need him for a project at work.

John

Audrey, this looks good.  Just to clairify, we will keep the Albq. car from Monday until Wed.  Also, could you confirm a full size car for Roswell since we have a fairly long drive to/from Artesia?

Thanks, Kim.

James,
Would you take a look at this and let us know what you think.

Thanks,
Kim

Dave,
	Using the numbers we have today and the Pemex volume of 240/day @
$0.25 as we have noted does not get KM to where we would want to be.  I
layered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some of
the gap but we were still short of targets.  I then modified the debt term
to 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported for
that length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion of
the gap.

	However, we are still short of our target and my calculations
indicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lasting
through year 20 to make up the difference.  In the alternative, a rate of
$0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there.  All
in all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we are
looking at.

Mark,
	Could you review from TW's perspective and see if you come up with
numbers in the same ball park?

We can coordinate our interviews with you on Monday morning.  We look forward to a productive two days with you.  Thank you for all of your help.

Kim.

I have reviewed the list you sent me regarding items you would like to see in the Data Room.  I spoke to Ned Greenwood and Jerry Mouser (the project coordinators) about this list.  We do have several of the items you listed, however, rather than having every document available, we have our Engineers, Legal Counsel and Financial Advisor available and ready to meet with you one-on-one.
If you would like to fax a list of specific questions you may have, please do so.  I would also like to ask that you please send me a list of the people who will be coming with you and their titles or job responsibilities.  We look forward to meeting with you here on Monday and we'll do our best to make your time worthwhile. 
Thank you.

Lindy and TK, would you guys be available to sit in on this meeting?  

Thanks, Kim.

Perry - We lost you on the original e-mail but definitely need your involvement.

Kim - Would you or someone in the TW commercial group be interesting in attending this meeting?
It's Monday, 1-2 PM.  Location to be determined.

Other Invitees include: Glen Hass, Mary Draemer (Ramona isn't available), Toby Kuehl, Darrel Schoolcraft (out of office), Maria Pavlou,
Ranelle Paladino & Rita Bianchi, 

From original meeting notice:
Are all of you available to discuss the changes to the Operationally Available Capacity report that the Commission is requiring of TW?  In case you haven't heard, FERC has specifically stated that TW needs to add a column to its Operationally Available Capacity report to capture day to day available sustainable capacity .  We would like to discuss how to get this changed within the 15 day timeframe that we were given.  This is a separate issue from the new California report that all pipelines serving California have to do by Sept. 30th.

Ramona, can you locate a room for this discussion?  Omaha will be in 7C1 extension 7017.  If anyone else needs to be included in this discussion, please invite them.  Thanks.

Ranelle & Rita

Audrey, I will be in Salt Lake City.

I'm sorry, I havn't loaded this yet.  Have no fear, I will call you.  Many thanks for your persistance!  Kim.

Hi Kim,

	Did those instructions help you get your Business Objects file locations configured Ok?

Thanks,
-Ed

Hi Ed,

Gosh, I am so sorry we have not connected yet.  I have been on a fast run.  How early in the morning do you come in?  Do I need to be at my desk?  How late in the evening are you in? 

I will make time for you.  Thanks for your persistence.

Kim.

Hi Kim,

	I'd like to schedule 10 mintues of your time so we can adjust your Business Objects file locations to the new ETS Marketing standard configuration.  When's a good time for you?  I'm available except between 14:00 and 16:00 on Tuesday.  I'd like to help you complete this configuration as soon as possible.

Thanks,
-Ed

This is a draft.  I don't think Enron Pipeline Company exists now.  I will check.  Also, what is the correct reference to Kinder Morgan.  Corp?  Company?  LLP?

Paula,  

I am out of town beginning this evening and returning home Tuesday night.  Perhaps we can catch up sometime later this week. It looks like Jim wants to transition out soon. 

Have a great week.  Thanks, Kim.

Paula, After being married to Patsy for 34 years I know that when she "starts on something" my life can return to "normal" more quickly if I manage to see it her way too !!  Planes, fires, and floods along with my inability to use the stairs as a means of escape plus her desire to be "back on the ground" again add up to our moving into a one story patio styled home in a neighborhood just a couple of miles east of San Antonio !
Just joking about the location. . .It's off I-10 at Eldridge.

Closing on that property will be the first few days of December. Closing on The Spires is not known just yet. As far as actually moving out, we hope to be in the new place before December 23.  I would like to make a "transfer of positions" before Thanksgiving. 

It has been a joy working and playing with you and Ren these past several years. . .I will treasure those memories. . .you are indeed a very special lady.

Sincerely, 
Jim Bolton

FYI, Kim.

I received a copy of an order issued by the FERc on Columbia negotiated rate transaction, which includes a formula ie indexed rate.  They accepted the negotiated rate deal but they are requiring  them to file in their tariff within ONE DAY after the rate has been determined the contract and actual rate. ( Each time the actual rate changes during the term)   Just think about this for the upcoming TW_ USGT deal and NNG"- Reliant deals.    Notwithstanding the time to actually make the filing, the cost to serve it each day if the negotiated rate is different by day and then the service when an order is issued each day---  I believe this is FERC's way to attempt to eliminate negotiated rate indexed based deals-  they are punishing themselves as well, as each filing will require a notice etc-  so every day they could need to issue an order.   

I feel we need to discuss with Columbia, INGAA and join in filing for rehearing on this administrative nightmare.  An alternative would be to require you to post on Internet website the day of the transaction the actual rate, so similarly situated customers would have access to the actual rate.  I'm sending you guys a copy of the order.  

2:30 works for me.  Thanks, Kim.

Let's see if 2:30 can work for everyone.  Please respond.

Danny has provided us with some tickets to the 2002 Olympic Winter Games Reception celebrating the Olympic Torch Relay in Houston today.  We have VIP Seating and tickets to the VIP Area (although I'm not sure what this means).  If you (and your spouse) would like to attend a private reception tonight at 6:30pm at the Renaissance Houston Hotel - 6 Greenway Plaza East (Edloe @ Hwy 59) please let me know.  John and I will be there and we have tickets for two more interested folks.   

Also, the Olympic Torch is being run in front of my home, The Spires, tonight between 5:00 and 5:30pm.  You all are welcome to come over and see this event.  I will try to leave the office around 4:15 to head home.  Please let me know if you would like to come, I will give you directions.

Thanks, Kim. 

Kevin,

Would you have some time today or tomorrow to discuss this?  Also, we should rally with Kevin Hyatt to discuss his ideas on Sun Devil and determine if we can use a similar strategy for Trans Pecos. 

My calendar is pretty open, just let me know what works for you and I'll coordinate with everyone. 

Thanks,
Kim.

Kim:
I was hoping to catch up with you after Stan's meeting to discuss TW financing arrangements.  Their is still a very good possibility that TW could be added to the Cpt. 11 companies sometime in early Jan. (the Revolving Credit Agreement would be paid off as part of that process).  Two things to remember on new projects - (i) likelihood of TW cash for equity in deal is very low and (ii) If TW is put into Cpt. 11, the implications of its credit on the other counterparties.  If we can find other people's money and structure around the TW credit risk, we have a better chance (but still will be extremely tough).  As you heard this morning, cash is at a very high premium right now (especially with Red Rock expansion).

Thanks,

Kevin

I wanted to see if you were interested in going over to High Fashion (Smith@Elgin) during lunch.  I'm looking for some velvet ribbon to tie our flood salvaged ornaments onto our skinny short Christmas tree.  

Kim :>)

Count me in!  Thanks, Kim.

It has been a tough couple of months and I know that each of you have worked hard.  I appreciate your time and commitment and hoped to something for the staff but, due to the company's dire situation, it is not possible.   
Please join me for a group lunch at Little Pappasito's on Thursday, December 20th at 11:30.  As much as I would like to treat the group, everyone would be responsible for their meal.
Please RSVP to Julie Armstrong at x33597. Hope you can attend. Thanks.

Bill,

Here are the changes to the OBA.  Please review.  Also, please look at para 5(c).  Since this gas will only be a San Juan supply, we deleted the Permian and Anadarko price basins.  So, if the TW San Juan pricing information goes away, I would like to use El Paso San Juan Pricing instead of averaging the other two basins.  

Questar is coming in for a late lunch, do you think we can have this ready by then?

Thanks,  Kim.

Kevin,

We are putting a list together for lost value for all of TW including the Trans Pecos project.  We will get this to you by the end of the day.  If your timing is different than this, please let me know.  

Talk to you soon,
Kim.

Kim:
If TW was to be included in the Cpt 11 process, what would you guess would be the lost value relative to TransPecos? I am pulling together a list of "Lost Value" items across the board to determine total value erosion of all the pipelines if this happens.

All,

Joe is able to meet with us at 10:00 Thursday, December 13 in EB1336 to discuss the OBA language as it relates to our ability to enforce dollar value, cash out and other provisions in the OBA with other intra and interstate pipelines.

Please plan to attend.

Thanks, Kim.

Jean,
 
Let's book lunch on the 10th.  Let's talk early that morning to confirm time and flavor of food.  I'm looking forward to it!
 
Thanks, Kim.

I am open all of the days below... lunch sounds great.   Thanks.  Jean

Jean, thank you so much for taking care of this for us!  Are you available for lunch on August 10 or any day during Aug 13-17?
 
Thanks, Kim.

Karon/Larry -- please order 14 15" flat screens (and cards), and 1 Compaq M300 with all accessories (docking station, DVD, memory, bag, additonal larger battery).  
 

Please code everything towards the "Marketing 41k refresh" bucket.  I estimate totol purchase amount to be $14,000.
 
If you have any questions, please let me know.  I will be out of the office on vacation tomorrow but can be reached via cell phone-402-689-1333.

Danny, 

Per your request, if Red Rock was delayed, it would have a $1.1MM impact for June and a $1.6MM impact for July.

John Buchanan

Please let me know a soon as possible this morning (by 9:30 if possible) what the annual dollars are we collect from NWPL & PNM for the Blanco Hub and from NWPL for the La Plata Facilities.  I need the total dollars (both the Operating and Market Services together).  I just need a ballpark number.  Whatever was the agreed to budget for 2001 on the Blanco Hub and whatever that flat fee is for the 3 years on the La Plata Facilities.

THANK YOU!!

I think a cocktail dress would be wonderful.  I plan to wear something fairly festive myself!  I look forward to seeing you on Sunday!
 
Kim.

Hey, Paula and Kim.  
 
Do you have any idea what the dress code for Sunday is going to be?  I know in the past with the party being at the building it's beem more casual holiday attire.  I didn't know if people would dress up more since it's at the Doctor's Club this year or not.  Would a cocktail dress be too much?  Let me know what you think.
 
Thanks, Rene'

Thanks for the reminder.  I'm looking for the list now, I'll bring it over.   K.

If you have any question give me a call.

Gary

Paul,

I need your accomplishments ASAP this morning. 

Kim.

FYI, Kim.
  Yes Ronnie, I would still like to do that for 2 reasons.

1.	It moves the overhaul on unit 401 into March, which is the same month we are doing the tie-ins at Station 1 and 3. And since there will be a flow restriction from those tie-ins we can coordinate the two outages together and save a little of the flow loss.
2.	Starting and finishing the overhauls earlier will keep us away from our summer comments, if there are problems or delays.    

       If  there are no objections, I will change the dates to the new schedule listed below. 

Jerry Graves
713-345-8923

Jerry, A while back you suggested moving the overhauls up at Station 4 to
March 1st, 2002. If its still works for you lets give it a try. The only
concerns at this time may be parts delivery time, but I think we will be
ok. The recommended outage dates are listed below. Let me know if this will
work for you. Thanks!

Ronnie........

401 start date 3-1-2002, Completion date 4-9-2001
402 start date 4-11-2002, Completion date 4-21-2001
403 start date 4-23-2001, Completion date 5-3-2001

TK,

When we get together on Wed for our staff meeting, would you please speak to this to our group.  Please let us know if we need to change our behavior on anything.  Thanks, Kim.

TK - What happened to the Posted IT Rates that were on TW's website?  If no longer posted, then why?  And if this is the case, then I will need to modify the Transactional Report which is supposed to link to this website.  Please let me know.

Also, because of the new FERC reporting requirements for California deliveries, we need to ensure that all rates (discounted or negotiated) are promptly updated daily in CBS rates (prior to 10:30am for next gas day) so that we don't have any discrepancies between the FERC monthly report and the Transactional Report.

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Thanks

I'm going to try and clear this up:

Robert Francen (928-226-2219) with Citizens called about the Griffith inter=
connect a couple of weeks ago.  He made a request that we configure our flo=
w control valve with a pressure control over-ride and reduce the supply pre=
ssure to the Citizens station supplying the Griffith power plant.  Although=
 I know the RTU has this capability, I told Robert that I would have to che=
ck with our Tech folks to see if we had this capability.  My concern was th=
at by lowering our supply pressure to Citizens it would make it easier to s=
witch or split flows to the power plant with El Paso.  El Paso's supply pre=
ssure runs a couple of hundred pounds lower than TW's in this area and they=
 cannot get in to Citizens with incurring huge swings at Citizens and shutt=
ing TW in currently.  So, simply stated, I did not want to proceed without =
direction from Marketing or Gas Control.  If I remember correctly when I ca=
lled and discussed this issue with you a couple of weeks ago, we were in ag=
reement not do reduce the pressure supply to Griffith but, you were going t=
o communicate this with them.  I am still getting calls from Robert and I'm=
 not sure how to handle his request at this point. =20

Please do not confuse this issue with the Batching valve that is currently =
out of service.  Also, do not confuse with Choquettes request to provide pr=
essure over-ride at this point as that can be done to provide steady state =
pressure with a flow control over-ride without reducing supply pressure dra=
matically to this interconnect point.  (However, there is the concern that =
if we install pressure control with a flow control over-ride that we put ou=
rselves in the position of reducing this supply pressure over time and then=
 getting into competing issues with El Paso. =20

I do not care how we configure this point.  However, again it could have im=
plications for marketing and gas control so, I prefer that you all make tha=
t call.

What transport agreement did ENA have on us? 

Below is an Excel spreadsheet that shows all outstanding November 2001 TW transportation invoices mailed to ENA on 12/03/01 in which they were designated as the payor.  Of the $569,434.56 invoiced, $213,603.58 was through our capacity release program as the acquiring shipper for two Citizens Communications Company contracts.  Another $226,350.00 was for ENA acting as agent for Eastern New Mexico Gas Association, Enervest San Juan Operating, LLC, and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.  The remaining $129,480.98 is for their own contracts with TW.  Please see the attached schedule for the details.

Citizens is aware of their accountability for ultimate payment of the demand portion of the contracts in which they released capacity.

I will be there!

Sasha,

I did not see TK Lohman or Tracey Geaconne on the distribution list.  Would you please make sure they get an invite.  Also, would you copy Steve Harris on this invitation even though I know he will be out of town on this date.  

Thanks for your help.  Kim.

Paul and Mark,

Please contact Eastern New Mexico (Mark), Enervest (Mark), Citizens (Mark) and Southern Utes (Paul) to make sure they are aware that they are responsible for making the payments on these contracts since ENA has defaulted.  Also, Paul, please confirm again that ENA is not nominating on their own contracts that make up $129,481 of the delinquent payments.

Please keep Steve and I informed of the status.

Thanks, Kim.

Paula,

Thanks for your note.  I'll give you guys a call around 6:00.  I only need the critical one or two loads and actually, we only need the washing machine since our dryer still works.  Thanks for the kind offer of Chinese, but we've got several gifts to wrap for the office tomorrow so we'd better stay focused.  We truly appreciate your kindness!

Thanks, Kim.

 
Kim,

Please feel free to call us when you are ready to do some washing and
drying tonight. Ren will be home by 5:30-6:00 PM, and I should be there
shortly after. We are going to have Chinese delivered for dinner. If you

it's work, please let us know. We'll call in something for you as well.

Many thanks, Kim.

FYI, Kim.

Since December 3rd, we've had a market structure in place that cited 2.960 as a key pivot on the prompt continuation chart; that is, if prices were to close > 2.960, the longer-term market structure would change to a bullish bias breaking out from the range-bound trading we've seen over the last three weeks.

On Tuesday night, December 25th, prompt JAN 02 reached a high of 3.050 during Access and then proceeded to close at 2.911 at the end of the regular pit session on Wednesday, December 26th.  Furthermore, prices continued to erode during last night's Access and closed at 2.775.  Currently, JAN 02 is trading at 2.680 on its expiry, and FEB 02 is trading at 2.700.  

With the inability of the prompt to close > 2.960, and a subsequent sharp drop in prices, it is logical to infer that 3.050 was definitely a short to intermediate term top. What this means is if the move from 3.440 to 2.180 was an A wave down (a 1.260 decline), and the move from 2.180 to 3.050 was the B wave up, then the downside targets (C wave down) are 2.270 (.618 of A=C) and 1.790 (A=C).
     

I wasn't sure you responded to this yet, but we are in Hong Kong the weekend of Feb. 15.  Let's not forget to talk to Valentina (sp?) tonight at JFF.  ILY, K.

I don't have McCoppins E-mail at home but you might want to pass it along.   

On an unrelated subject.  When we went to bed it was Power 96, Dad 98 on Tork game.  Power claims an unconfirmed 106 this morning. 

Merry Christmas 

Marydith slep with Liberty last night and was playing with it this morning.  The real test will be what they play with after the big delivery on Xmas 

Bill,

I've made a couple of changes related to ENA having two contracts that we want to market via this method.  Please check my comments and look to see if any of the other language needs to be changed for the additional agreement.  The letter looks great to me.  Thanks for all of your help on this.  Once we hear back from you, we will tender to ENA for their execution so we can proceed forward in selling this capacity.

Thanks, Kim.

 

Kim and Michelle,

	Attached is a revised version of the capacity release letter agreement, which is red-lined toshow changes from the prior draft.

 << File: CapRelA.doc >> 

We are drafting a letter to Sid Rich for their non-payment of $1.6 MM Nov. invoice.  You will find the letter in your email.  TK has water-dropped Sid Rich that a letter is coming this afternoon.  Kim.

Jodi, 

Here is the electronic OBA agreement.  Happy New Year.  

Kim.

 

I would like us all to attend this meeting.  Please let me know if you have a conflict.  

Thanks, Kim.

	Just a reminder, we are planning a TW Imbalance meeting on Thursday, January 3, 2002
	in 42C2 at 8:30, right after the NNG/TW morning meeting.

	Richard will bring updated reports for us to review.

	Thanks. Lynn

Paul,

This make sense to me, but please make sure you are OK with the final position now reflected in the Caminus system.  

Thanks, Kim.

Rudy,

Per your request, I have removed the 10,000/d of natural long fuel positions that were in Caminus for anticipatory hedges that were initially hedged with RMTC before those deals were terminated.  This reduced the VaR on the TW fuel book from $841k to $421K.  I did not remove the natural long position that was physically contracted (10,000/d) from Caminus.  To summarize, we had 20,000/d of natural long, 20,000 was swapped to a fix price, and 10,000 was physically contracted to perfect the fixed price hedges.  All 20,000/d of the swaps were with RMTC and were terminated.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Hey guys (or actually for our current group, girls),

Let's plan on getting together on Wednesday, Aug. 1 from 2:00 to 3:30 in EB4180.  The following is a list of things that we need to discuss and they are in no particular order of priority.  To the extent that each of you could volunteer to come with some or all of the information on the following items, it will expedite our discussion (just let me know that you would like to begin pulling this information) :

Price Spreads for ROFR contracts to articulate our resubscription strategy.
Imbalances on OBA's
Analysis of I to I spreads.  -  Review past fixed rate transport deals and compare to the historical spreads.  Would we have made more money?  Is it reasonable to carve out a percentage of our capacity portfolio and always sell on an I to I rate?
Update Map - coordinate with Darrell, Facility Planning and NNG.
West Texas Leg - discussion on our preparation for the Facility Planning/Marketing Strategy Meeting.
Arizona Strategy - including Sun Devil.
Pooling.
Analysis of our business sold and utilized.  FT, Alt. Points, IT and contracts sold for specifically for flexible delivery points. (On this item, we can discuss the type of analysis we would like to look at in our staff meeting prior to pulling any information)
Weekend on call schedule - update
Phones
Update - replacement for Jeff's position.
Frequency of our staff meeting.
Industry Conferences
Vacation Schedules

Also, please let me know of additional items that you would like to have discussed in our staff meeting.  I would be happy to include them.

Thanks, Kim.

Dan,

Thank you for the great card.  I hope all is well with you.  What are you doing now?  Are you still commuting to California?  Are you working for someone in Houston?  ENE is up today to $0.63.  Gosh, it still feels like we've got the decimal point in the wrong place with our stock.  Just heartbreaking.  Oh well, I'm glad 2002 is here.  This will be a better year for all!

Keep in touch!  Happy New Year to you and your family!

Kim.

J,  I don't have a problem committing to Italy and purchasing airfare when it makes $ sense with the thought that we can always cancell just like we did in Sept.  I don't worry too much about having to cancell, but I think a lot will shake out over the next 6-8 weeks here at 1400 Smith.  I'll keep working Dot to see if she and Tom are willing to commit to a spring vs. fall timeframe.  I suspect Janell and Dennis will be no go for anytime in 02.  If Dot and Tom are game then we can talk with D & T and P & J about meeting Jane and Barry to make our party and even 8.  If Dot and Tom are not available to go, I'm more comfortable just making the traveling party a foursome.  

Have a great day!  ILY, K.

I agree.  I hope that the first decision point, perhaps this week, answers
the "if" question.  Then, perhaps by the end of the month, if the answer to
"if" is "yes," we can then answer the "when" question.

JW

I still think we're GO, but I heard Dorothy and Kim do the "it depends on
Enron" and Janell has the broken leg issue.  Hopefully it all works out
well.  We're not at the deadline yet but at some point we'll have to make a
call.

The first hurdle is the U of H accelerated Italian course in mid February
which I plan to attend unless we've aborted.  The real deadline is somewhere
around D-30 days when the air fare/schedule becomes harder to get.

No, I was not aware of this.  Thanks for taking the lead on this, please le=

Thanks, Kim.

Were you aware of this problem?  I will pursue unless you already have....

The project C.014724 - Gray County Pipeline - was ready fro service on 12-1=
4-01. The Interconnect C.014798 - Gray County Interconnect - has not gone i=
nto service because of the bankruptcy filing by Enron. Vendors, will not sh=
ip us some transmitters and other start up materials unless we can pay for =
them up front. We have tried to work with them on payments and no luck to d=
ate. We are trying another option where a local contractor will purchase th=
e material and we will pay them for the service. As soon as we can get thes=
e issues settled, we can place the I/C into service.

Thanks

Sasha,

Great, sorry, I didn't see the scroll bar.  Thanks!

If you would just coordinate an assortment of pizza's, that would be great.  I believe Morgan may have a couple of people in his group who are vegetarians, so we should keep this in mind when making some of the selections.  I would order plenty for our hearty crowd, someone could always take the leftovers home and eat it for breakfast the next morning!

Also, will the Mad Potter provide the wine, beer and soft drinks?  Is there anything else that you can think of?  

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim,

	I checked my original invitation email and Tk and Tracy were at the bottom of the invitation (you can scroll down the list to see them).  I also had Steve Harris on the original email and he has already received it and declined but he said thanks for the invite.  I will get with Bira later today.  How many pizza's would you like and what kind?  I can look into geting an assortment of many different kinds.  Besides that I think we are all set. Please let me know if you have any other suggestions.  Thanks Sasha  (I will be attending the team builder.  thanks)

I will be there!

Sasha,

I did not see TK Lohman or Tracey Geaconne on the distribution list.  Would you please make sure they get an invite.  Also, would you copy Steve Harris on this invitation even though I know he will be out of town on this date.  

Thanks for your help.  Kim.

TK, FYI, let me know if you think otherwise.  

Thanks, Kim.

If the fuel is being nominated and scheduled the only volumes hitting the OBA are the diff. between scheduled and actual and that is what the OBA's are for as long as it is not being abused.

John Buchanan

	FYI.  Is everyone comfortable that we are NOT creating an imbalance with Sid
	Richardson due to fuel?  Just want to be sure we should not check out any
	additional information.  Terry, thanks for your prompt reply.  Thanks. Lynn

In the OBA meeting held today 01/03/02. Is the fuel being nominated or not at the Sid Richardson point #500395 or L.E. 8729? Yes it is and has been nominated as far back as I can retrieve information in TMS. The point came active in 12/1995 and remains active today. It is also part of their main OBA contract #21758. According to the information in CBS it was nominated and scheduled back then also. If there is more information or questions, please let me know. Thank you. 

Terry Kowalke

I will check.  We are in 49C1 which is a very large conference room and I'm thinking the phone is off to the side by some side chairs and may not have a long enough cord to stretch to the table.  I will inspect and keep you posted.  

Thanks, Kim .

The MLP discussions have been on using Northern Border.  

Regarding KMI, Mark and I met with them before Xmas to see where they were on the rate.  They have not presented anything to their management team for approval beyond our original proposal.  

I believe that Stan is looking for the status of the game plan.  We are looking to lay out the game plan on how we would finance the project(if we project finance I think Stan and Danny are looking at securing enough money at the same time to do the Sun Devil, Trans Pecos and PG&E 20 mile line all together), define what the project return requirement is, determine the comfort factor of the project costs, staying in concert with KMI and making the final proposal to Pemex.  

I will make myself available at your convenience on Monday morning to discuss.

Have a great weekend.  Kim. 

I will call you monday morning to discuss. What is the status of the pemex discussions? When dan mentions mlp, is he referring to using border or setting up a new one? Is stan looking for a go / no go decision?
Yes, the 1:30 is the prep meeting to the 3:30 Stan meeting.  Danny wants us to look at project financing vs. MLP.  If you get a chance, call me Monday when you get back in the office and we can discuss a little further.  Happy New Year.

On 01/04/02, M Kester, S Dernovich & R Aragon met with Bryan Dils and Jack Gasten (both Senior O & M Technicians) of Transwestern.

The TW reps agreed that the best method to accomplish the Blanco interconnect would be for TW to tap its existing 30 inch (formerly NWPL Ignacio-Blanco) pipeline that is running N-S approx 120 lf east of the proposed S Trails Blanco Meter site.

To accomplish the tie in would then require about 120 lf of 20 inch (or perhaps 12 inch) pipeline, parallel to the right of way corridor that Questar has already acquired from TW for the extension to WFS Milagro.

The custody transfer meter facilities and any control facilities would then be installed on the Questar site.

TW stated that pressure ranges between 928 to 950 psig in this  30 inch pipeline.

Agreement needs to be finalized on who installs the tap, pipeline tie in, and meter facilities.    It would be good if TW would agree that Questar could accomplish all work, with the exception of the tap of the 30 inch pipeline.

In any event, S Trails needs to contribute our meter parcel site for the location for meter facilities, whether TW or Questar installes these facilities.  

The TW reps were going to convey this info to Ron Mathews of TW.   Conceptually, this location is as shown on the TW dwg, dated 11-26-01, prepared by RLM.

The Questar group is also determining how the parcel size can be expanded, from the current 75 by 100 to about 100 by 125, to accomodate all these facilities.   Paragon's rep is negotiating parcel acquisition with El Paso for this site.

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas To Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

PREVIEW for January 6, 2001

======================================

Dear Folks -

   I know that lists like the following pop up now and again on the
internet. This one, sent to me by George Leyendecker, has some fresh
ones -

   1. The best way to get even is to forget.
   2. Feed your faith and your doubts will starve to death.
   3. God wants spiritual fruit, not religious nuts.
   4. Some folks wear their halos much too tight.
   5. Some marriages are made in heaven, but they ALL have to be
maintained on earth.
   6. Unless you can create the WHOLE universe in 5 days, then perhaps
giving "advice" to God, isn't such a good idea!
   7. Sorrow looks back, worry looks around, and faith looks up.
   8. Standing in the middle of the road is dangerous. You will get
knocked down by the traffic from both ways.
   9. Words are windows to the heart.
  10. A skeptic is a person who when he sees the handwriting on the
wall, claims it's a forgery.
  11. It isn't difficult to make a mountain out of a molehill just add
a little dirt.
  12. A successful marriage isn't finding the right person, it's being
the right person.
  13. The mighty oak tree was once a little nut that held its ground.
  14. Too many people offer God prayers, with claw marks all over them.
  15. The tongue must be heavy indeed, because so few people can hold
it.
  16. To forgive is to set the prisoner free, and then discover the
prisoner was you.
  17. You have to wonder about humans, they think God is dead and Elvis
is alive!
  18. It's all right to sit on your pity pot every now and again. Just
be sure to flush when you are done.
  19. You'll notice that a turtle only makes progress when it sticks
out its neck.
  20. If the grass is greener on the other side of the fence, you can
bet the water bill is higher.
  21. You are richer today if you have laughed, given, and forgiven.

   These are pithy sentences that can cause us to laugh and to think.

   There is another phrase I use in our work from time to time. It is -

   Having a heart as light as a feather.

   What does that mean?
    Is it possible?
     If it is, what keeps us from experiencing it more?

   These are some of the questions I want to talk with you about when
we gather this Sunday. I invite you -
   to be present,
    to bring your heart,
     to be prepared to lay aside some of your burdens, and
      to dare to open some doors to new life.

   My heart is hoping to see you Sunday.

Much love,

Bill Kerley

I forgot one thing.  Let Morgan and I know if you get any declines for our session.  

Thanks, Kim. 

Hi Kim,

	I checked my original invitation email and Tk and Tracy were at the bottom of the invitation (you can scroll down the list to see them).  I also had Steve Harris on the original email and he has already received it and declined but he said thanks for the invite.  I will get with Bira later today.  How many pizza's would you like and what kind?  I can look into geting an assortment of many different kinds.  Besides that I think we are all set. Please let me know if you have any other suggestions.  Thanks Sasha  (I will be attending the team builder.  thanks)

I will be there!

Sasha,

I did not see TK Lohman or Tracey Geaconne on the distribution list.  Would you please make sure they get an invite.  Also, would you copy Steve Harris on this invitation even though I know he will be out of town on this date.  

Thanks for your help.  Kim.

Julie,

Kevin, 

Due to Stan's floor meeting at 1:30, are you available at 11:00 to prep for the 3:30 Trans Pecos meeting?

Thanks, Kim.

Steve,

Are you familiar with this?  

Kim.

Kim,

I'm not familiar with it.  What does IPANM stand for?  If Tim Aron was a member or participated, he didn't leave any info. on it and I haven't received any correspondence from them as the mailroom usually forwards his mail to me if its still in his name.  Perhaps Leslie Launer would know about it.

Glen

Glen, 

Are you familiar with this organization?  Do we normally participate?  

Thanks, Kim.

Dear IPANM Members:

Cindy,

I believe that James Centilli will also be attending this meeting.  

Thanks, Kim.

Thanks, Kim!   I hadn't quite made it through all of my e-mails, when I looked at Stan's Monday calendar and realized I didn't have a location for this meeting, so I called you to inquire.    Sorry for the oversight.

Cindy

Please plan to attend a meeting on Monday, January, 7 from 3:30pm to 4:00pm in EB49C1 to discuss the Trans Pecos Project.  

Thanks, Kim.

Let's meeting in EB1336.  Thanks, Kim.

Yes. Where?
Kevin,

Thanks, Kim.

Due to the 1:30 floor meeting with Stan, our prep meeting for the Trans Pecos project is changed to today, Monday, January 7 at 11:00am in EB1336.  

Thanks, Kim.

When do we break bread with Art and Donna?

We have and we like it, too...

Why don't we plan to meet there at 6:30 or 7 p.m. (whatever works for you)?
Will that give you guys enough time to settle the home front before coming
back to town?

John

Have you all been to Crostini's on Shepherd between Westheimer and Fairview?
We had a department lunch there before Christmas and it was wonderful.  The
lobster bisque in a bread bowl was fabulous!  What time should we shoot for?

I've not seen this, but I would like a copy of the article when you locate it.  Thanks, Kim.

I had a copy of the Business Week with Jeff Skilling on cover.  Please call me if you have the copy or one that I can borrow.  Thanks.

Bill,
 
To get hard to find tickets, go to the Plaza Hotel (borders Central Park near FAO Schwartz) entering through the front door, proceed ahead around the big lobby/tea area around to the right and find a woman in a closet sized booth (literally a closet).  Cast members turn tickets over to her to sell that they are given for their shows.  She is completely independent from the hotel and I'm sure she pays huge rent for the tiny space that she has.  They are always wonderful seats to and usually run around $100+ for each ticket.  It is always a worth-it splurge if it is for a play you want to see.  I used to have her card, but it is long gone by now.  You might be able to call the Plaza and inquire as to her name and number and call ahead.  Otherwise, just stop in as soon as you get in town.
 
Rent is OK, but if this is your first and maybe only trip to NYC for a while, I would certainly recommend seeing other plays first .
 
I agree with John, your best hotel bet is the Marriott Marquis, which is very nice for a Marriott and the location is the best.
 
Don't forget to eat lox and a bagel for breakfast!
 
Keep us posted.  
 
Kim.
Gosh, that sounds great!
 
It's been more than 5 years since we've been to NYC, but here's what I'd do...this weekend, look around BR (that's Baton Rouge) for the Sunday issue of the New York Times.  Look in the Lifestyle section (or the NYT equivalent) and you'll undoubtedly see ads for weekend specials and/or package deals to the city, possibly including airfare, hotel, theater tickets, meals, airport transfers, etc.
 
Other than that, you can check out the Marriott Marquis Hotel, which has its own theater and may offer special weekend rates.  Don't gasp when you find out that a room is going to run you $200/night ++, that's just the going rate for a very expensive city.
 
You'll need to visit the TKTS booth in Times Square, where folks queue up mid-morning for half-priced same-day tickets to some great shows...and some real dogs.  You won't find any Producers tickets there, unfortunately, but Rent may be available.  See Phantom of the Opera and Les Miserables, for sure.
 
Grab lunch at the Carnegie Deli, but don't fall on the floor when you order the $18 reuben sandwich.  Pay the $3 split fee and share it with Teri.  Note the huge desserts and the terse wait staff.
 
See if the Rainbow Room is still open for dinner and dancing.  Kim and I celebrated our 10th anniversary there with Mike & Cheryl Pope (it was Cheryl's 40th BD, too).  The Rainbow Room is in Rockefeller Center (where NBC is located).
 
Everything is going to be expensive, so get used to it.
 
Let me know what you decide!
 
BTW, how's Poppy?  Mom said he's made an amazing comeback from the brink...
 
John
 
 
Bro:
 
I am thinking of suprosing Teri for our 20th anniversary.  I would like to take her for a quick trip to NYC.  I would really like to get tickets to The Producers but it appears to be sold out until March, 2001.
 
If we make the trip, in what part of town do you suggest we stay?  What hotel has reasonable prices?  We  would like to go to a play.  Other than that, I have absolutely no ideas.  Any ideas as to which play we can get tickets to at this late date?  Rent is still available and I've heard good things about it.
 
I would appreciate any help you can lend.
 
Bill

Good Morning Kirk,

I hope you had a nice weekend.  I have been working on the Interconnect Agreement for the Big Sandy Project and I would like to schedule some time for a telephone conference with you as I have a few "blanks" in the Interconnect Agreement that I would like to discuss with you so that our draft is as complete as it can be.  Would you have some time on Tuesday AM or Wednesday AM?  I would also be available on Thursday 2:00-3:00pm.  I'm thinking we need about a half an hour.   

Also, I can update you on the remaining capacity on our Red  Rock Expansion which could be used to serve the plant.

Thanks, 
Kim.

FYI, Kim.

California:

A01-10-011  PG&E  Gas Accord.  On Monday Jan. 7th Greg Klatt will enter an appearance on behalf of Transwestern at PG&E's Gas Accord Prehearing Conference.  This will maintain our position to participate in the proceeding as needed.

I99-07-003  SoCal Unbundling.  SoCal filed its Advice Letter No. 3015 to implement the CPUC's Dec. 11th decision to unbundle the SoCalGas Transmission and Storage Systems however the filing only addresses Ordering Paragraph Nos. 9-15 of the decision.  This section of the order directs SoCal to outline within their tariff the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement arrangements for allocating stranded costs.  It does not address capacity or open season issues as dictated by the order.  We will investigate the filing with SoCal as to the status of addressing these issues. 

A01-10-024  SoCalGas BCAP.  In regard to filing comments on EGA's motion to strike the testimony and related materials on embedded cost-based allocation versus the long-run marginal cost methodology for the hearing on Monday, Jan. 7, 2002, it was decided not to file comments, but continue monitoring the proceeding.  By participating Transwestern will continue to have the option of addressing any of the issues raised by other parties.

CPUC Infrastructure Report.  The Commission has issued its report and assessment of the state's gas infrastructure for the three major utilities in California.  Their conclusion is that the natural gas transportation and storage systems are adequate to provide reliable amounts of competitively priced gas to residential, commercial, industrial and electric generation customers.  Therefore they recommend that the Power Authority should not finance any new natural gas projects.  

Schedule:

Week of Jan. 7 -  	Omaha

FYI, Kim.

This is the info I was looking for that gives you an idea of the types of tasks/projects that have a portion being allocated to TW.  As we discussed I will pull together the actual dollar amounts by cost center and get it to you shortly.  

Dana

FYI, Kim.

Kim, The attached reflects NNG Marketing's allocation %'s for capital and allocations to TW.  The only thing I know of that will change is the Pricing desk.  Jo has ask me to get with you and Sean/Richard to determine what a fair allocation would be.  I am out for the rest of the year after today.  Can we review and determine any changes after the 1st?  I also had a summary of the kinds of things each of the teams were doing for TW but I can't seem to get my hands on it right now.  I'll look some more and maybe I'll have it for our discussion.

I need to take our cat to the vet tomorrow morning (Tuesday), so I may be a little late---approximately 8:30am.

Thanks, Kim.

Jodi,

Here is the language for the IT agreement.  We will need for you to send in a formal request form for IT service so that we tender this officially.  We can chat about this in the morning.  

Thanks, Kim.

 

Steve,

Here is the final spreadsheet that does tie back to the right dollar amount of $757,885.  Please let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks, Kim.

The attached will provide you with dollars that have been allocated to TW from NNG Commercial in the 2002 Plan.  Please disregard the previous version sent as far as any dollars or percentages.  The tasks/projects list is still applicable however.

Paul,

Thanks for the update.  Even though last week there were no translated financial statements for MGI, I'm glad that they have them now and will be sending them to you.  Jorge and I are scheduled to talk tomorrow morning to discuss the rate.  I will keep you posted. 

Thanks, Kim.

I have spoken with Jorge Rojas of PEMEX today and he is will fax translated financial statements for MGI either this afternoon or in the morning. We will continue to monitor until received. We have been attempting to obtain this information since July 10.

If you have any questions, please advise.

Regards.

Comments from Rod.  Paul see note below.

You might want to send these to Kim 

Some brief comments:

1.b)  Term:   Finance would greatly prefer a right to extend for a period of at least 10 years to be exercised at least 2 years prior to the expiration date.   This would allow for time to find a replacement shipper before the expiration date.   In no case should we agree to an annual evergreen as this is optionality without any cost to them. 
2.      Conduct of Open season/Contract Quantity Reduction:   Need to establish an "Initial Recourse Rate" prior to the open season in order for their proposed mechanism to work.  Without it there is no way to measure the "proportionate reduction" requested. 

We need to get Paul Cherry working on the credit of MGI Supply ASAP.

For your information, attached is the redlined version of the LOI from Pemex.  I have been discussing these comments with Dave Matney at Kinder Morgan.  I have also discussed these comments with Pemex and they do intend on giving us feedback on the rate we offered within the next week.  It is Pemex's intention to move forward with this LOI with an agreed upon rate (even though it currently says "To Be determined") prior to execution.  I will keep you posted as we get more information.  If you have any comments regarding any of these issues, please feel free to contact me, otherwise, please look forward to review our next draft prior to us sending it back to Pemex.

Thanks, 
Kim (X33098)

On 01/04/02, M Kester, S Dernovich & R Aragon met with Bryan Dils and Jack Gasten (both Senior O & M Technicians) of Transwestern.

The TW reps agreed that the best method to accomplish the Blanco interconnect would be for TW to tap its existing 30 inch (formerly NWPL Ignacio-Blanco) pipeline that is running N-S approx 120 lf east of the proposed S Trails Blanco Meter site.

To accomplish the tie in would then require about 120 lf of 20 inch (or perhaps 12 inch) pipeline, parallel to the right of way corridor that Questar has already acquired from TW for the extension to WFS Milagro.

The custody transfer meter facilities and any control facilities would then be installed on the Questar site.

TW stated that pressure ranges between 928 to 950 psig in this  30 inch pipeline.

Agreement needs to be finalized on who installs the tap, pipeline tie in, and meter facilities.    It would be good if TW would agree that Questar could accomplish all work, with the exception of the tap of the 30 inch pipeline.

In any event, S Trails needs to contribute our meter parcel site for the location for meter facilities, whether TW or Questar installes these facilities.  

The TW reps were going to convey this info to Ron Mathews of TW.   Conceptually, this location is as shown on the TW dwg, dated 11-26-01, prepared by RLM.

The Questar group is also determining how the parcel size can be expanded, from the current 75 by 100 to about 100 by 125, to accomodate all these facilities.   Paragon's rep is negotiating parcel acquisition with El Paso for this site.

Ron, 

John would like to know what our HP is at these units and what type of units are they?  What is the age of the equipment?  Is this something we would be willing to share?  I told him that our run time on these units was less than 1,000 hours.  If we are OK sharing this info, would you either call him or email this to him.  If we don't want to share, just let me know and I would be happy to call him and let him know.  

Thanks, Kim.

John Davis' phone number is 281-610-1333, his email is john.davis5@worldnet.att.net

Planning has discussed the possibility with Field Operations and have determined that TW could not justify converting all or part of either station to electric motor drive.  The total number of run hours in 2001 was about 700.  Most of that was at one station which would equate to less than a month total.  Concept was good but bad timing on location based on run hours.  I'm assuming you will pass this on to John Davis to break the bad news to him.  I'll do so if you want just let me know.

This looks good to me.  Question:  Is there a tax/CIAC issue with Citizens reimbursing us for this change?  Will there be an addition to our property accounting records to reflect  a change to a pressure control system?  Because it's only $5,000, there may not be an issue, but I just wanted to check.

Kim.   

Attached for you review and comments is a draft of the proposed reimbursement agreement with Citizens Utilities.

 

Steve,

FYI, the Risk Management and Reporting was allocated to TW for all 12 months of 2001.  However, since I came back to TW in May, Lee Ferrell left Enron in June and Sean and Richard moved to Jo's RC in November, the 15% number dwindled during the latter part of the year.  Martha and Bobby were the only ones in this RC that were part of this allocation all 12 months. 

Thanks, Kim.

 

Let me know if you have questions.  It may look confusing because there are TW cost centers listed also.  

Dana

Je,  attached are the final 2001 actuals distribution %'s for the cost centers I am responsible for.  Please disregard the file I sent on January 21st.  

Please let me know if you have questions.

TK can sell Feb-Dec to Sid Rich for $2.27.  Or  sell remaining Jan, Feb and March for $2.01.  We can sell 10,000 for Feb/March.  We can look at only selling 5,000 for rest of year, leaving 5,000 to catch upside(or downside).  We need to at least sell Feb/March before 1:00pm AGA report today.  Are you OK with this?

John,

Congratulations on your new responsibilities!   Please let us know if there is anything we can do for you.  Good Luck!

Kim.

The purpose of this memo is to inform you of organizational changes for ETS Pipeline Integrity Program Management.

Frank Osburn, Director of Facility and Operational Records, will move from Engineering and Construction to the Pipeline Integrity organization. Frank will bring the Document Control Team, the Mapping Team, and the Project Completion Team, as well as be responsible for Operational Compliance (Meagan Bange) and the PHD / PDMS group under Larry Abbott. We believe this entire group is critical to Pipeline Safety and Integrity and will help ensure consistent strategies.

Max Brown, currently Director of Corrosion and Risk Management, will add Pipeline Integrity Program responsibilities to his role. Max will add Ronny Davenport, Mike Ames, and John Millar to his Corrosion / Pipeline Integrity organization. This group will be working closely with the ETS Area VP's and Region Directors to ensure our Pipeline Integrity initiatives are communicated and on track. 

David Johnson will continue in the critical role as VP of Pipeline Safety, with Michael Crump as Director. The Pipeline Safety group will consist of Merlin Moseman, Pat Vaughan, and Lisa Choquette (RPT), with two Pipeline Safety Engineer vacancies currently open and posted.

Let's discuss tomorrow morning.    Kim.

Steve,

Yes, we are already putting a list together and inviting customers.  We are primarily concentrating on the Houston and Dallas customers.  We'll get the RSVP list together in the next day or two.  Let us know if you have an invite, we do not have all the tickets spoken for at this time.  Michelle has organized dinner for us at Farrago (corner of West Gray and Brazos) after the show.  They are setting up a large table in the back of the restaurant for us.

Kim.

Rod,

Thanks for your comments.  They will be incorporated into the next draft that I route.  I expect to hear from Jorge tomorrow regarding their thoughts on the proposed rate.  I'll keep you posted.  

Thanks, Kim.

Comments from Rod.  Paul see note below.

You might want to send these to Kim 

Some brief comments:

1.b)  Term:   Finance would greatly prefer a right to extend for a period of at least 10 years to be exercised at least 2 years prior to the expiration date.   This would allow for time to find a replacement shipper before the expiration date.   In no case should we agree to an annual evergreen as this is optionality without any cost to them. 
2.      Conduct of Open season/Contract Quantity Reduction:   Need to establish an "Initial Recourse Rate" prior to the open season in order for their proposed mechanism to work.  Without it there is no way to measure the "proportionate reduction" requested. 

We need to get Paul Cherry working on the credit of MGI Supply ASAP.

For your information, attached is the redlined version of the LOI from Pemex.  I have been discussing these comments with Dave Matney at Kinder Morgan.  I have also discussed these comments with Pemex and they do intend on giving us feedback on the rate we offered within the next week.  It is Pemex's intention to move forward with this LOI with an agreed upon rate (even though it currently says "To Be determined") prior to execution.  I will keep you posted as we get more information.  If you have any comments regarding any of these issues, please feel free to contact me, otherwise, please look forward to review our next draft prior to us sending it back to Pemex.

Thanks, 
Kim (X33098)

Julie, 

These look fabulous!  Thanks, I'll let you know when I cook them!

Kim  :>)

For all my chef friends. It is known that I do not cook (by popular demand) but, I had to share the below recipes with you guys.  I went to a dinner Sunday night and both items were served.  
The praline sauce was served with pork tenderloin (which was healthy), potatoes and green beans.  Feel free to also enjoy Sherri's comments.  Enjoy.
Debbie, thanks so much for the recipes.  I think Rebecca is going to use
both of them, so will let you know what the group thought.

I'm copying Julie, too, because she also thought dinner was fantastic.
She's going to share these recipes with some of her "friends that cook" -
obviously they're not for her personally ;-).  (No offense, Jules - I'm only
keeping them on file for Eddie as I'm no cook, either!)

Thanks again for everything, Debbie.  SRS

This is so true!  Thanks, Kim.  :>)

Thought you might enjoy this.

An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, "What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

Audrey,

I am waiting on Mark, Michelle and TK.  They are working on them.  I'll have them to you ASAP.

Thanks, Kim.

Audrey, here they are.  

Thanks, Kim.

 

No problem.  Thanks, K.

Hey Kim - I have tentatively set an appt. with the Treemont (Living facility options for my mom) for 2 pm Mon. 1/14.  Is it ok if I take 1/2 day vacation Monday afternoon?  Thanks.

All,

We are still working on all the details of the proposed interconnect with Questar Southern Trails in the Blanco Hub and will send you a copy soon for your review.  Since the interconnect is fully reimbursable, Questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs. paying all of it up front.  

Please take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments.  If we allow them to pay "along the way" I am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect.  The total estimate of $702,000 includes the tax gross up, which may or may not be applicable, so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount.

Does anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule?  

Thanks, Kim.

I have attached the payment schedule for the Interconnect & Operating Agreement.  We thought you should have an electronic copy as well.  We look forward to talking with you on Friday.

We will meet after the morning meeting tomorrow to discuss these imbalances with Market Services.  If you are available, please plan to attend.  

Thanks, Kim.

The attached scheduled will be discussed at the TW imbalance meeting tomorrow - Tuesday 7/31

	Invoice Date:	1-1-2001	#676-3004-0

Hi Sherri,
 
Well, your ears must have been burning.  I have been thinking about you this week.  Gee, a lot has happened since we last spoke.  I'm still here.  We are very busy on Transwestern.  I would love to catch up with you, are you available by phone sometime next week?  My calendar looks pretty open next Tues, Wed or Fri.  
 
I look forward to visiting with you soon.

P.S.  Martha is still here, also.  She is with the Northern Natural side, I'm with Transwestern.

Thank you, Amy for checking this out for us.  

Have a great weekend.

Kim.

When this invoice was input, it was paid to Lea County Courthouse (5000042878) instead of Leaco Rural Telephone (5000019852).  I have a call into Micah to explain the situation and have her return the check.  Who takes care of voiding checks in Houston?  Please let me know, and I'll have her send it in.

Thanks

FYI, Kim.

FYI
Kevin,

In following up with the Chief Credit Officer ( who is out today ) another person ( Steven Tilley in Credit ) returned my call. He advised they were not impressed with the letter and that Bankruptcy was a possibility. I replied that this is the best that we could offer short of a guarantee and that no one can predict one/two years down the road. I offered our financials which they will send a CA. I believe it would help it you could discuss their issues. I explained that improving their status was not possible, but Tilley continued to pursue. 

I have set a time on Monday at 8:30 CST for us to call Michael Sessa, Chief Credit Officer and Tilley.

Please advise if that will work for your schedule.

Regards.

feel free to sign for me.They cannot obtain a more superior creditor status.

Sorry for this omission. Sempra inquired could they obtain a more superior creditor status than normal? 

Thanks.

Kevin,

I wanted to provide an update. The conversation went well. I am faxing the " letter " , have offered the CA for financials, and walked Sempra through TW. Upon the review of the letter they will get back with me if there are further questions. Also I offered your participation if needed. With your permission may I have your proxy to sign the letter?
As an FYI the people on the call were the counterpart of Paul Y and the Chief Credit Officer.

Will keep you posted.

Regards.

Steve, 

Early this week I asked Jo for a rate and the size of volume (looking for the max volume)  we could have for transportation on NNG from WT to PH(NNG/TW Gray).  I've got a couple of follow-up calls into her, but she has not gotten back to me yet.  I hope to have a response from her before we meet with Mike Stage on Tuesday.  I'll keep you posted.

Kim.

Let's meet after the staff meeting today to discuss carving out existing capacity for June 1 as well as what, if anything, we say to the shippers for now.  Lorraine, would you please bring the volume needed for Red Rock contracts for June and July.  If we carve out existing capacity, we still may not have enough for al of them without prorating.

Thanks, Kim.

Please note, included in this report is a delayed in-service schedule for Red Rock.

Stations 1/2 June 15, 2002
Station 3 July 1, 2002

Do we want to tell our shippers yet or wait and also do we want to try to use existing space for the Oneok deal so we do not loose out on any revenue?

We will make sure it is discussed during the meeting Lynn.

	Darrell and John, could you two be sure we discuss this afternoon.  I am having
	to work on reviews and will not be able to attend the meeting.  Thanks. Lynn

I don't think that decision has been made.  I think we should be allocating.  This should be discussed today at 
the TW afternoon marketing meeting.

	grow any more?  Thanks. Lynn

that would be one of our options if they don't cash out the balance as of 12/31/01

	If I understand correctly, the scheduled volume is continually higher than the flow?  Why don't
	we allocate this point to minimize the imbalance?  Just a thought?  Thanks. Lynn

Who is the marketer assigned to Devon SFS Operating?  

Devon owed TW $161,292.49 as of 12/31/01 related to oba contract 21749.  There is one point on this contract(Bilbrey 28 Fed 1) which flows about 500 mmbtu per day.  Devon is currently having problems delivering gas into TW which is increasing the imbalance further.

Devon has told Amy that they will possibly cash out but they haven't made a commitment yet.  If Devon doesn't cash out and they do not lower nominations on this point, then we will have to explore other options to get this gas/$$$$.  

Amy will continue to follow up with Devon and pursue cashing out.  

thanks
Richard

Thanks, Lynn.  Kim.

        Please ignore the previous memo.  I had a wrong date in it.  Thanks. Lynn

The following is the procedure Gas Logistics and Marketing have agreed to beginning this weekend to
segregate the TW and NNG morning meeting.
 
1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.
2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.
3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 18 , 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.
4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.
5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.
6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.
 
If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.  
 
I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.
 
Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.
 
Lynn
 
 

FYI, Kim.

As of the Jan. 11 Amy got them to take their schedule down from .444 to .088 and TW is now receiving make up.  We 
will continue to watch this point.

	Darrell and John, could you two be sure we discuss this afternoon.  I am having
	to work on reviews and will not be able to attend the meeting.  Thanks. Lynn

I don't think that decision has been made.  I think we should be allocating.  This should be discussed today at 
the TW afternoon marketing meeting.

Julie, I currently do not utilize LIM on my desktop, however; in light of the changes with NNG/Dynegy, I believe that someone in my shop should have access to LIM.  We had been currently utilizing Kay Treat and Sean Bolks for LIM information.

Should we coordinate with you?

Please advise.

Hi JB,

I just wanted to follow up with you.  I have not seen the invoice for the work that you guys did on the new interconnect.  I'm concerned I may not be getting all my mail.  Have you sent it yet?  Just checking.

Thanks, Kim.

Julie,

Lorna, Kay and Sean, will not be available as a resource to me starting February 1 because of the Dynegy situation.  Will need our own access.

Please advise.

Jo, I wanted to follow up with you on the O&M charges and transportation capacity from Halley to Gray.  Do you have some telephone time available soon?

I'm available late today after 4:00 or tomorrow before 10:30 or from 1:30-3:00 or Wed anytime pm.  

Thanks, Kim. 

Steve,

I just wanted to let you know that I have been playing telephone tag with a couple of the Questar folks.  For the most part, they were out of the office several days during the last two weeks (of course I was out of pocket a couple days, too) .  I've left another message with Gary Schmitt, who apparently is out of town yesterday and today, but I did hear from Mary Kay Olson, who was also in our office when Gary came in several weeks ago.  Mary Kay is tracking down the status of the Western Leg information that Kevin requested.  I also let her know that we are interested in the Eastern Leg as well.  She will begin pulling that information together, too.  I expect to hear from her either later today or tomorrow with a status and timing of the data.  She will also connect up with Gary when she sees him.  I will keep you posted as I hear more information.

Also, Jodi Starley (who is also in the Questar Marketing department), is looking for me to begin the Interconnect Agreement for the San Juan Hub connect with Southern Trails .  Do you have a problem if I begin the paperwork, however, I have several other Interconnect Agreements that are higher priority at this time and it may take a while to get to this one?  I recognize that this is a delicate balance.

Thanks, Kim.

TK,

Will you handle this?  

Thanks, KIm.

Planning and System Optimization have agreed that the effected throughput during the Station #4 overhaul outage should be 150 MMcf/d.  This should be posted and the firm transports can be adjusted up or down depending on the ability of the system after the first day.

	Looks good to me. 

All, 

Please review the attached interconnect agreement between Transwestern and Questar.  It is fully reimbursable by Questar.  This interconnect will be a delivery point to Questar in the Blanco Hub.  FYI, the section of pipe that we are connecting the interconnect to is owned by Transwestern and is not part of the jointly owned facilities of the Blanco Hub.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me to discuss.

Please reply back to me with any comments you may have.  I would like to send a draft to Questar on Tuesday morning, January 22, when we return from our holiday.

I wanted you to know that I am putting a "check in the mail" to you (and made out to you) in the amount of $50 to be used toward the gift for Rich.  The money is from:
	TK Lohman - $20
	Mark McConnell - $10
	Kim Watson - $20

I apologize I didn't get it in the mail earlier this week, but everyday seemed to be a Monday for me this week.  If you have Rich's home address, I would love to send him a note.

Thanks for coordinating this!

Kim

Definitely not me.  I would have charged a lot more than this!  Ha!  Thanks, Kim.

Kim, it was around $5 or $6.  It was definitely a personal charge.

FYI, Kim.

Just in case you didn't hear, both NNG and TW received approval to acquire third party capacity.  The orders came in last night approving the tariff sheets as we filed them.  If you would like to see the language that will be in the tariff, send me a note back and I can get it to you.  We specifically didn't limit ourselves to just interstate pipeline capacity in the wording that we used--in TW's tariff, we deleted any reference to limiting the amount of PNM capacity that could be purchased.  Thanks for your help with this.

Notes:  Nice quiet weekend

Dennis, can we talk about this?  Thanks, Kim.

Kim,  we have some units at Ivanhoe Station that have not operated in quite a long time.  We need to begin a process to abandon the units otherwise we are looking at a rather large expense to upgrade the station esd system.  Can you let us know how we can begin to move toward this end?
Fred Jordan or the Beaver Pipeline Team can provide more information about the specifics. 
Thanks for your help.

Dennis, 

What are your thoughts on this request?  I'm not even sure that our map department exists because of December 3.  If we respond to her request, we may want someone at an officer level at the Navajo Nation to request this data and then send it directly to the officer.  

Thanks, Kim.

I would caution you that we have not provided any maps since Sept. 11.  Kim, if you feel this is a reasonable request and legitimate, please handle appropriately.

Thanks, Gina

Can you please pass onto to the appropriate personnel?

Thanks,

Toby

Hello,

My name is Rachelle L. Silver and I'm a permanent employee of the Navajo
Nation Government.  I worked under the Division of Natural Resources in the
Navajo Land Department-GIS Section.  I would like to know if anyone there
does any pipeline mapping?  If so, I would like to have a copy of your
latest digital data where the your pipeline covers the Navajo Nation to Big
Boquillas Ranch area.  I would very much appreciate it.  I'll be looking
forward in hearing from you.  Thank you.

Sincerely,

Bruce and Dave,

For your review and input, here is the latest version of the LOI for Pemex.  Mark and I will come over this afternoon and spend just 15-20 minutes with you and walk you through some of our thoughts.  

Thanks, 

Kim and Mark

Attached for your review and comments is a revised version of the TransPecos LOI, which I believe reflects our discussions this morning.

 

Steve,

Well, TK celebrated 20 years with Enron on January 11.  I did talk with Fran about the status of service awards, and of course, they were suspended in December.  Fran said that they are having discussions about what to do in the future.  It may be a while before this program gets reinstated (if at all).  Until it does, may we go ahead and plan a lunch or something nice for TK?

Kim

 

Kevin, 

For Trans Pecos, we have a couple of slides with a fact sheet prepared that we used in the presentation with Stan a couple of weeks ago.  Would you like those or are you looking for a 2-3 page narrative?  I'd be happy to provide either.   What is the time frame - how quick?

Kim.

Eric and Kim:
I was hoping to send some information to a potential equity investor (ArcLight) regarding both the TransPecos and Sun Devil transactions.  I have a  very brief presentation or detailed model - nothing in between.  I'm looking for commercial overview, strategic rationale and summary economics.  Do you have anything like this already prepared? If not, is there anyone who could quickly pull this together? 
Kevin

I will send the fact sheet now.  However, I am happy to create whatever you need to help get this money.  I'll send it under separate cover.

Let's use the fact sheet for now - I was hoping to get something to them in the next 24 hours.

Per your request, here is some basic information on Trans Pecos.  Please let us know if you need additional information or prefer it in a different format.

Thanks, Kim.

   
                                                     

              

Ranelle,

Does this mean that we are no longer limited on the volume that we previously were limited to on PNM?

I'm very glad that this passed.  Thank you for your help!  Kim.

Just in case you didn't hear, both NNG and TW received approval to acquire third party capacity.  The orders came in last night approving the tariff sheets as we filed them.  If you would like to see the language that will be in the tariff, send me a note back and I can get it to you.  We specifically didn't limit ourselves to just interstate pipeline capacity in the wording that we used--in TW's tariff, we deleted any reference to limiting the amount of PNM capacity that could be purchased.  Thanks for your help with this.
Ranelle

Would you please send me your bullets by the end of today (before we leave for the Cirque show).  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim, Steve has a doctor's appt on tomorrow at noon.  I would like to have him review the bullets before he leaves at 11:00a.  Would you be able to forward the bullet items to me by 10:00a?

Thanks in advance,

Hi Bill,

Have you had a chance to review the OBA that Questar sent us?  If you have time later today, we could get together and discuss.

Thanks, Kim.

If you need assistance, please let me know.  I know Ruth, she actually worked in our group a couple of years ago.  Do you think we'll get an answer so we can sell before bid week ends for Feb business?

Kim.

Kim,

The responsibility for this has gone over to Ruth Concannon. I spoke with her yesterday and gave her some background information. I will talk with her again today.

Paul

Any luck connecting up with the ENA folks on the capacity release for February? 

Kim.

Please plan to attend a TW analysis meeting tomorrow morning, Friday, January 25 from 9:00am to 11:00am in EB1336.  Richard and Sean will share the results from their detailed analysis of TW.

Thanks, Kim.

All,

Please review and call your customers if they have not paid their invoice.  Keep Market Services plugged into your conversations with the customer. 

Thanks, Kim.

 

Bobby,

Thanks for your help on this.  Let's talk early next week to see where you are on this and whether or not you will have to implement the interim plan.

Thanks, 

Kim.

Kim,  This is to update you regarding the status of getting real-time Nymex pricing on the TW desktops on Level 13.  We are taking a quick hit approach and will be providing the data as it is fed from DTN and as it appears below.  Our next steps (once the feed is active) will include providing average price strips across seasons, remainder of seasons, and calendar years.  There are some contracting issues that exist which Mark Ferguson and I are addressing.  However, we will use interim steps if necessary to provide this data to you by next Wednesday before the NNG marketers leave the building.  I will continue to work with Paul Y'Barbo regarding the details of this request.  Paul and I are also working on getting both ICE and Dynegy Direct access for everyone in the TW commercial group.  If you have any questions please do not hesitate to call.

Thanks, Kim.

Greg and Maria,
 
FYI.  Here is a report for the July Capacity Releases on TW.  PG&E, Sempra and Texaco all released on an Index to Index spread and are above max rate.  Elizabeth has the history of TW Capacity Releases if you think it might help in the preparation of our strategy for negotiated rates.  
 
Thanks, Kim.
 
 
Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that provides billing information for July 2001 reservation invoices.  

Please be advised that the PG&E (Core) releases exceeded the maximum tariff rate as summarized below (the first three were special calculations based on index spreads and the last one was a fixed rate):

PG&E Energy Trading-Gas Corporation           60,000/day * 31 days * $0.7081 = $1,317,066.00 
Sempra Energy Trading Corp.                           15,000/day * 31 days * $1.9951 = $   927,721.50 
Texaco Natural Gas, Inc.                                  50,000/day * 31 days * $0.7468 = $1,157,540.00

Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, LLC        25,000/day * 31 days * $1.1600 = $  899,000.00

These amounts will be billed to the acquiring shippers and once payments are received, PG&E will subsequently receive reimbursement.

Feel free to contact me should you have any questions.

 

Thanks,

Elizabeth

 

 

 

Here they are:

 

FYI, Kim.

Team, please make arrangements with Darryl and Gallup to dry pig the lateral.  After dry pigging we would like to take another look at the lateral to insure eff.'s are still low before proceeding with spending the dollars to reapply the DRA.  You might also touch base with the contractor to check availability for the April/May time frame.  

Vera/Tim, we will keep you advised of the schedule to insure plan dollars remain in the appropriate month.

Ben, can you provide estimated volumes to Jerry for scheduling purposes assuming that like last time we have to pig between 5 to 7 mph to apply the DRA.  

As we move forward and following the dry pigging results we will set up a conf. call to better coordinate activities as necessary.

Questions or concerns????
Tiny,
The Ignacio line efficiencies are still unacceptably low. We've also seen about a 2-3 % decrease in line efficiencies on the Bloomfield to Gallup segment (particularly the Bloomfield-Bisti section) since we applied the DRA last spring. 
It will be a good idea to pig and re-apply  the Bloomfield-Gallup section again in April, and hopefully have the launcher and receiver installed for the Ignacio line in the fall (I understand the pipeline integrity group will cover this cost).

If there are no concerns or issues I suggest we go ahead and plan for these.
Ben

Ben, need to know how the San Juan Lateral eff. is holding up so that we can better estimate when O&M budgets may be impacted this year from pigging type activities.  I know you took a good look at this segment prior to moving into tariff last year and now as we approach the non tariff months this year we need you to take another look to insure no potential problems exist.  

Jerry, please correct me if I am wrong, but at this time no planned outage has been posted for this activity YTD. 

1:00pm today is fine.

I have checked the Outlook system for your availability today to try and set a meeting time today with Eric regarding the memo he sent on Friday.  It appears that each of you is available between 11:30 and 2:30 today to meet for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  I would suggest that we schedule this meeting for 1:00 p.m. today, Monday, January 28.  Please respond that you can attend or suggest another time today.

Thank you.

FYI, Kim.

Please see the attached.

Bruce and Dave,

Here are some of our comments to amend the KMI/TW letter agreement for dates listed in the agreement.  Please review and lets discuss tomorrow morning.  We are putting together a timeline for all of the various things that need to happen which will help us both determine the new dates to put in the letter.  We'll send this to you as soon as we are finish.  

Do you have any comments on the Pemex letter agreement?

Thanks, 

Kim and Mark.
 

Mansoor, I can make either time work, my preference would probably be Wed 1:30-3:00 if given a choice.  

Would you like for all of Marketing to be there or would you prefer to keep it small with just Michelle and me?

Yes, I can make myself availble for this meeting.  Can we discuss either later today or tomorrow for a  pre-meeting?

Thanks, Kim.

Eric/Kim/Danny:
Are you available Wednesday afternoon at 1:30 to talk with ArcLight Capital regarding (i) Sun Devil, (ii) TransPecos and (iii) NNG? We have provided them with various presentations and economics.  May make some sense to visit beforehand to discuss return profiles.
Kevin

Well, I spoke too soon.  I just got word of another meeting that I need to attend Wed at 1:30.  My preference now is Tuesday from 9:00-10:30.

See the attached spreadsheet.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 

Ramona,

Gosh, something always seems to come up every year that we want to make a change to our existing systems.  Lindy will be back tomorrow and I will discuss this with her.  We are evaluating how we currently administer and market pools.  If we decide to make a change I suspect that it may require a system change, but it is too early to make a decision just yet. I also think that we should think about how to link EOL transactions through the entire contracting process.  I know that NNG is probably a little further on this than we are, but it is reasonable to think we should have this ready for us next year.  

I will continue to ponder this and discuss this with Lindy upon her return tomorrow. 

Thanks, Kim.  

Kim or Lindy,
 Does TW have any items or system enhancements, new services that may be implemented in 2002 that we should budget for?
Can you send me a list. I am not sure how this process works. TW Marketing has specific items they need or plan to implement that relate to CAS, or TMS is fact in your budget or our budget?
If you can think of anything, please send me an email by COB Thursday, 8/2/01.
Thanks Ramona
Attached is the template to needs to be completed for each project.  

Alma, please set up an hour meeting no later than this Friday to discuss 2002 Captial Projects.  This e-mail distribution will be the invitees.    

Thanks. 

Brad

As everyone knows the 2002 budget planning process is in full swing.  We need to aggressively look at capital projects for 2002.  I have attached the Project Profile Template hat has to be completed and developed for each project.  It looks like we have been given the date of August 10th to get any discretionary project that has to have economic analysis done on to Denis Tu and August 16th is the deadline that I have to turn in all IT capital project request to the Program Office.  I think capital has to go to Rod Hayslett around the following week in August.  As you know, it can take several days to work with Denis so if we have discretionary projects those need to get moving quickly.  We also need to look at GISB and FERC and see if we have anything next year which is non-discretionary.

The Rates & Revenue System is well underway and in good shape, but we don't have much time to pull together remaining projects.  If you all have projects that you are thinking about for next year, please complete the attached description of the project and forward to me no later than August 1st so we can discuss and begin the estimating process.  Let me know if you have any questions or we need to get together to discuss.  Thanks.

Dear Transwestern Staff:
 
    I'm not certain where to direct this request, so I hope you will route same to appropriate group ASAP.
 
    I have some clients (munis in Southern California) who are interested in tradeable rights on SoCal's system and possibly obtaining their own transport on TWPL.  
 
    I have an old (1991) Transwestern system map, and I would like to get an up to date set of system maps (system & laterals, compressors, delivery points, etc) at your earliest.

Hi Dot,

Well, we've been talking about Italy again.  We are looking at leaving late May, like Friday, May 24 (so we can scoop in Memorial Day) and returning to Houston on Sunday, June 9.  We are pricing fares now.  Continental has them posted on their website at $1,100-$1,200.  I will also check with Alliance Travel Agency (formerly Travel Agency in the Park) to see what they may be able to do for us.

Can you and Tom swing these dates?

Let me know.

 Thanks, Kim.

How quickly?

Hey, Kim-
I tried to call you today (I was out sick yesterday - respiratory crud) but your voice mail didn't ever pick up.  I'm ok, just working myself out of a job pretty quickly.  Hope you are well.

Sam

Do you have your resume together?  Any leads?

No one has said for sure but probably in two to five weeks.

Rudy,

I am so glad that you have landed!  Thank you so much for the phone mail message you left me.  I would love to schedule lunch with you in the next couple of weeks to see how you are doing.  We'll grab Martha, too.

I wanted to send out a quick note to let people know that I've started a new job with Delinea.  The division I'll be working with  focuses on energy & energy trading companies and is located in Greenway Plaza (if you're in the neighborhood).  My new work phone # is 713-544-5305.  Also, while I have a new e-mail address here, you can always reach me at rudy@alumni.rice.edu.

Thank you everyone for your help, referrals, and support.

I work for Transwestern Pipeline at Enron and I would like to have an ID and password to use Clicktrip.  

Please advise.

Thanks,

Jeff,

I am looking for the person who paid for my wine last Friday evening.  Lorraine says it was not her, so I'm suspecting that it was you.  Needless to say, I left without paying and what is worse, I didn't even think of it until I got home that night after dinner with John.  Where you the kind and unknowing one that floated my loan?

Also, I've been thinking about Paris and London.  Would a week night or weekend night be better for you/Lisa and John/I to get together for a brain, map and book transfer session.  If you have a date that works for you guys over the next few weeks, throw it out and we'll get something on the calendar.  

Thanks, Kim.

P.S.  What is Lisa's email address?  I'd like to send her a note.

Michelle,

Audrey,

Here is another request for maps, however, I am thinking that I sent this person to you yesterday.  If this is repeat request, please disregard.  If not, please handle.  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim, T.K.,

The person below is asking for an updated TW map.

Linda, can you direct this person to the right source?  nb

Friday, 01/25/02
 
Dear Ms Bastida:
 
    I'm not certain where to direct  this request, so, if contract admin is not the right group, I hope you will  call me or route this request to appropriate group ASAP.
 
    I have some clients (munis in  Southern California) who are interested in tradeable rights on SoCal's system  and possibly obtaining their own transport on TWPL.  
 
    I have an old (1991)  Transwestern system map, and I would like to get an up to date set of  system maps (system & laterals, compressors, delivery points, etc) at your  earliest.
 
    Please do not hesitate to call  me should you wish to discuss this or if there is a charge.
My mailing address & phone (for charges for the  maps or questions) are as follows:
 
Best regards,

Do you want to pre-meet?  Are we still scheduled to meet tomorrow at 1:30?  Location?

Eric/Kim/Danny:
Are you available Wednesday afternoon at 1:30 to talk with ArcLight Capital regarding (i) Sun Devil, (ii) TransPecos and (iii) NNG? We have provided them with various presentations and economics.  May make some sense to visit beforehand to discuss return profiles.
Kevin

Jan, would you make 5 copies of the power point slide.  I'll print out the word documents.

Thanks, Kim.

Kevin, 

Per your request, here is some basic information on Trans Pecos.  Please let us know if you need additional information or prefer it in a different format.

Thanks, Kim.

Yes, this would be fine.  Please stop by and mark your day(s) on the calendar that is pinned up on my wall.

Thanks, Kim.

Hi Kim - Would it be alright if I take my 2002 floater day 2/14 pm and 2/15 am?  I've got to take my mother to the Treemont to sign the papers,etc. on Thursday afternoon and then help in the early morning on Friday when the movers come.  Thanks.

Lorraine 

Julie, it looks like a slip of the finger on Roger Hayes vs. Robert Hayes.  FYI, K. :>)

Please note there will be a meeting at 3:00 today in Danny's office regarding the floor plan.  We hope that everyone can accommodate their schedules to attend the meeting.  

If you have any questions, please call Julie at x33597.  Thanks.

I checked with our Travel Agency and they cannot secure cheaper tickets than what we are seeing on the internet.  It looks like $1,100 - $1,200 is about the price for the Houston to Rome roundtrip.

FYI, Kim.

James,

Would you please send Kevin Howard the email version of the economics for Trans Pecos and copy me.  Kevin is working with ArcLight as a potential equity investor for our portion of Trans Pecos.  Please let me know if you have additional questions.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim and Eric:
Could we send to ArcLight the models for TransPecos and Sun Devil that reflect what we had in today's presentation? You can either send directly to him (and cc me) or send to me and I will forward on to them.  Everyone did a great job today.  Thanks again.
Kevin

I have no off duty time to report.  I've been here.

FYI, Kim.

Everyone,

As stated below in Rich's memo, the quantities that will be posted in the new daily unsubscribed report are the same quantities that TW is currently sending in EDI files. As part of the permanent solution, the EDI process will need to be modied when the website is modified.

I would like to review messages that are sent in TW EDI files for unsubscribed capacity and operationally available capacity.

 TW currently sends a text message with each of the EDI unsubscribed capacity files that are sent to customers.  This message is:

	Capacity at these points is subject to the capacity available on the relevant path for the receipt and delivery point combination(s) requested. (2)  Please contact your Marketing Representative for information concerning point with capacity less than 5,000 Mcf/day. (3)  Transwestern is willing to consider expressions of interest concerning available capacity or requests for capacity.  Shipper interested in available capacity may either contact their Marketing Representative or submit a request for service to Transwestern Transportation Marketing, P.O.Box 1188, Houston, Texas 77251-1199 or by facsimile to (713)646-8000.

For operationally available capacity, TW currently sends the following text message with each EDI operationally available file:

	The below listed capacity is an estimate of the unutilized capacity that will be available on the effective date above, until further notice is posted.  The capacity is only an estimate and is subject to change without notice due to the transient nature of pipeline operations.  There are no guarantees expressed or implied that this capacity will be available.  Formal nominations to the pipeline will be processed in accordance witht he company's tariff provisions for scheduling of all available capacity.

Please review and let me know if any revisions need to be made to the above text messages.

Thanks,
Mary 
In a meeting to discuss a new FERC commission ruling, it was decided that TW needs to post daily unsubscribed capacity information to the web by August 10th.  Since the daily numbers will be the same as the monthly numbers for August through October, we will post the monthly numbers published through the new TW unsubscribed capacity system as if they were daily numbers.  The posting will be for two days in advance.  (i.e. on August 1, we will post numbers for August 3).  Since these will be the same numbers used by EDI, TW's unsubscribed capacity EDI will not need to change at this time.  To do this, TW's new unsubscribed capacity posting must be in production by the 10th.  We will do our best to be ready for testing the daily posting by Monday,  August 5. (Jeanne & Patty - is August 6th doable for testing and August 10th doable for production?)

This is only a temporary solution until further analysis can be done to design the correct solution.  The permanent solution must be in place before November 1.

Kevin,

Donna and I are working on the floor plan.  We have you slotted to move with us (although we don't know exactly where yet), but we were not sure if we needed to make space for anyone else that works for you.  An assistant?  Davis Thames?

Please advise.

Thanks,
Kim.

Steve,

Here is the pricing information on the DTN feed.  I recommend that we sign a 3 year agreement so the initial fee of $1,000 will be waived.

The minimum DTN fee is $500 monthly (for up to 25 users) plus $60 monthly for the 1st user and $12 monthly for users 2-25.  Do you want to see the real-time feeds?  It looks like the total monthly fee will be $620 for six users.  

Please let me know if you have any concerns, otherwise, we will implement ASAP.  Also, there will be no additional cost to have this on the 13 floor and move it to our final destination (there used to be a large fee for moving locations).

Kim.

Kim,

Below are the fees for the new DTN Nymex Price Feed for TW. Please let me know if you approve the fees and forward on to Mark Gigliotti for approval. He then will forward on to Steve Hotte and then Rod Hayslett. We then can cut a P.O. in iBuyit and faxed over to DTN to get the realtime feed started. 

One-Time Initiation Fee:		$1000 on a 2year agreement, waived on a 3 year agreement
DTN Fees:					$20/user with a monthly minimum of $500
NYMEX 1st User Fee:			$60
NYMEX secondary User Fee:		$12/user

Total Monthly Fees for 20 users: 	$788

Thanks,

Mark Ferguson

Thanks, we'll make room for the three of you.  We are looking at moving either to 39 or 44.  We have tentative floor plans for both.  When the floor decision has been made, we'll come to you for your consensus on the placement of your three slots.

We'll be back with you soon, I hope.  :>)

Thanks, Kim. 

Response number 2 - it would be for myself, Davis and my assistant Terri Bachand.

FYI, please see Elizabeth's note below for purposes of checking the invoices tomorrow.  

Thanks, Kim.

Attached is the file to be used for demand invoice verification for January 2002 capacity release transactions.  If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

FYI - Based on the flash invoices I generated this afternoon on the capacity release transactions and global settlement contracts, please note the following:
Citizens K #20822 Res - flowed alternate deliveries to Socal Needles of 32,145 dth and should be billed incremental fees [I have prepared a spreadsheet to calculate at the max applicable tariff rate for the alternate path]
ENA K #24924 Res - manual rate adjustment is needed for the 50/50 split of marketing fees for capacity released to Burlington
Conoco K #20835 Comm - delete authorized overrun line items and roll volumes up to the commodity charge type
Conoco K #20748 Res - delete the Thoreau to E. Thoreau line item

 

TK, 
This looks good to me, but I defer to you for further comments. 

Thanks, Kim.

Here is the TW Hot Line Spreadsheet. The phone numbers and the steps will change slightly. New phone number for TW customer will be forth coming. Please review the rest of the spreadsheet. If you have any changes to the sheet, please let me know. Thank you.

Terry Kowalke

 

Mark and Mark,

We approve the costs to get real-time DTN feeds.  We would like to sign up for a 3 year agreement so that the $1,000 fee is waived.  We will have seven primary users right now:

Harris, Steven 
Lohman, TK
Lindberg, Lorraine
Lokay, Michelle
McConnell, Mark
Y'barbo, Paul
Watson, Kimberly

Thanks for all of your help on this.  Please let me know when real-time pricing can be installed.

Hi Jeff, 
 
John and I are also good to go for tonight.  We are open on flavors of food.  Some things that come to mind off the top of my head are:  Raven Grill, Goode Company (Mexican or BBQ).....I'm trying to think of some place that we could have drinks, beer or wine....we are completely open.  Any thoughts on some place close to your neighborhood?
 
John and I were planning on meeting at the house to join up.  I'll bring the maps/books etc.  Does 6:00pm sound OK?
 
Kim.

Kim, 

Lisa and I are certainly up for it.  I haven't given much thought to location yet, so put on your thinking cap and let's come up with place/time.  We're looking forward to getting together with you guys.  By the way, I'm in the office the rest of today and tomorrow if you want to give me a ring.

Bullets, please.

Vince,

I'm so glad that you can recommend him for our commercial job.  He has some skill sets that our department is shy on.  In fact, I am bringing him back for my boss, Steve Harris, to interview.  I too, think that he would be a good fit.  

By the way, Krishna and Seksan have been very helpful in coordinating some technical analysis of California prices.  We appreciate the support and certainly enjoy working with your group.  Perhaps you, Krishna and I can book a lunch together in mid to late August and catch up on the business issues.  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,

I met Paul Y'barbo today (I have known him for ages)
and he mentioned an interview with you. 

He is a very bright and capable individual and he would
be a good fit to your group. 

Vince

P.S.  He looks better without the pony tail.

thanks for the heads up.  Please mention in Steve's staff meeting on Monday.  

No bullets just an FYI for you.

El Paso Field Services called this week to inquire whether TW?Enron would consider selling off any of its assets.  I spoke with Gina Tylor about who to refer this question to and she said Eric's group.  Kevin and I called EPFS back and they are interested specifically in buying the Atoka and Crawford laterals.  While such a sale of assests would have a big impact on TW, it's alittle too early to tell if EPFS is serious.  I'll keep you posted.

Bullets, please.

All of these sound great.  Why don't you pick one.  We like all of these places.
 
Kim.
[Watson, Kimberly]  -----Original Message-----
Kim, 

Those ideas sounded pretty good.  I got a list of places from Lisa also: 

Benjy's (on Dunstan by Ballys) 
Raven Grill (Bissonett) 
Goode Company Seafood 
Sierra Grill 
Floridita Seafood Grill (the place on Kirby/Richmond) 
Tony Mandola's Seafood River Oaks 

Any of these sound good to us.  I think Lisa's preference is to avoid "heavy" places, and go for either a place with variety or something that's more seafood oriented.  However, we're flexible.  By the way, 6:00 p.m. sounds perfect.

Whatdaya think?

This description will be useful to Kevin Howard as he proceeds to determine the best way to secure funds for this project.  Please send it to me and I will add the virtual capacity write up to it and forward on to Kevin.

We will write these up and send them to you ASAP.

Tiny,

Thank you so much for the reminder, sometimes I think my brain has slipped away.  Do you need all of the San Juan and West of Thoreau contracts?  If you know you have some of them, which ones do you have, I'll send you the rest.

My apologies,

Kim.

Kim, last year you provided me with a name/contact in your group that could help me obtain Operating Agreements for customers/interconnects in our area which we curretnly do not have on file.  Unfortunately, I procrastinated with all the happenings towards the end of the year and lost the name..  Could you please send me the name so that I can proceed with the plans of setting up a Regional master file with those agreements.. Thanks

Bod,

Please add Jan Moore to your distribution list.

Richard, 

Please make sure that Paul see's the invoice.  After Paul approves it, I can sign it too.

Thanks, Kim.

To all

Amy Mulligan and I will discuss payment procedures and Debbie Moseley and I will discuss coding.
However, before a payment or coding changes or etc are done,  I would like to have someone preapprove payments that TW will be sending to ENA.   

Richard,

What process needs to be followed in order to request a payment to be made to ENA per the terms of the agreement negotiated with Marketing when capacity is released on their behalf?  Please let everyone in the distribution know so they can follow these same procedures for next month as well.

Additionally, do we code the marketing fee revenues to a different account from the transportation revenues and how?

Thanks,
Elizabeth

FYI - When January 2002 invoices are run, please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ENA's contract 24924.  The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50  [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days]  (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??)

Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged.  However, we will need to discuss further.  The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release.  

We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Elizabeth

As promised, please find the attached TW Capacity Release Report which has been revised to include a release from ENA to Burlington effective 1/11/02 - 1/31/02.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 << File: TW0102P.XLS >> 

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Attached is the Transwestern Capacity Release Report that lists all capacity release transactions for the period effective 1/1/2002.  All transactions were awarded at 100% of the applicable maximum tariff rates.  

I have also been advised by Marketing that another posting may occur for January 2001 (partial month) but nothing has been finalized.  I will send an updated file if necessary.
  
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

 << File: TW0102P.XLS >> 

Thanks,
Elizabeth

Don't forget we have lunch scheduled tomorrow, Tuesday, February 5.  Let's meet downstairs at 11:30am.  

Any preference on flavors of food?

Kim.

Hi Kirk,

I got your "out of the office" message the other day when I emailed you, so I knew you would be busy when you got back in the office.  My schedule is a little hectic tomorrow, my afternoon looks a little better than the morning.  Next week looks wide open.  Would you mind waiting until next week?  I just want to make sure we are not holding you up.  Let me know your preference.  

By the way, how did your testimony go on Big Sandy?  

Thanks, Kim.

Kim-
Thanks for your recent message.
I spent the last couple of days in Phoenix testifying on Big Sandy
project and just picked up your message.
I would look forward to visiting with you sometime Friday AM.
Let me know if this works, or perhaps next week some time.
I will be in Denver M-W, and then returning to my office on Th/F of next
week.
Kirk

Steve,

FYI, I just talked with Jo and she will take a look at a 100,000 and 200,000 from Permian to TW/NNG Gray for a longer term.  She will need to look at how much capacity she will have to move to make room for us.  She (and probably Vernon) will get back to us.  I'll keep you posted on our conversations.  

Kim.

James, thanks!  Kim.

much better - even I can follow this one! thanks.  this will allow them to get up to speed much quicker.
Kevin

I trimmed down the model per your request.  Let me know if this is OK.

Thanks,
James

Mansoor, 

Here is a note from Gaylen at Questar.  We would like to have this interconnect in place by May 1.  The Interconnect Agreement is anticipated to be executed this week.  I will let you know when it is officially signed.  If it would help us meet our May 1 timeframe, please remember that Questar is more than willing to help order equipment (to our specifications) if our vendors cannot respond as quickly as we would like .  Please let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,
As we discussed and agreed, we continue to plan on having the Transwestern meter for the new interconnect into Southern Trails located on our property at Blanco.  Will are planning for Transwestern to tie into it's pipeline and extend piping over to our site where the meter will be located.  Transwestern may need to aquire a small length of right-of-way from El Paso that will connect the TW property to the site we are getting from El Paso.  TW personel will have unlimited acess to this site.
We will create a lease agreement to lease the footprint for the meter to TW. 
As we discussed, this facility must be in operation on May1, 2002. 
Thank you for all your help.
Let me know if I can be of further assistance.
Gaylen

ORDINARY LIFE - Thoughts and Ideas to Help You Live a Happier Life

======================================

Summary of February 3, 2002

======================================

Dear Folks -

   First of all thanks to all of you who responded to the need for
financial help in our medical work in Bolivia. I can't recall
experiencing such generosity. We are going to be able to give them more
than they requested. Plus, several people are already on the list to go
down with the next work crew and one person is going to help arrange
getting medical supplies to the clinic. Wow! Thanks.

   The material I offered focused on how our Western approach to "the
truth" and how modernity have had destructive effects on our religious
and spiritual well being. We have become "fact fundamentalists." I also
deal with the perplexing question of what Jesus might do in dealing
with terrorism. The lesson ends with a telling of an ancient story from
Ethiopia about the battle between Truth and Falsehood.

   What follows is a full text of the presentation.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Is The Story You're Telling With Your Life the Truth?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

   A boat docked in a tiny Mexican village. An American tourist
complimented the Mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked
how long it took him to catch them.

   "Not very long," answered the Mexican.

   "But then, why didn't you stay out longer and catch more?" asked the
American.

   The Mexican explained that his small catch was sufficient to meet
his needs and those of his family.

   The American asked, "But what do you do with the rest of your time?"

   "I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, and take a
siesta with my wife. In the evenings, I go into the village to see my
friends, have a few drinks, play the guitar, and sing a few songs. I
have a full life."

   The American interrupted, "I have an MBA from Harvard and I can help
you!

   "You should start by fishing longer every day. You can then sell the
extra fish you catch. With the extra revenue, you can buy a bigger
boat. With the extra money the larger boat will bring, you can buy a
second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of
trawlers.

   "Instead of selling your fish to a middleman, you can negotiate
directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant.
You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City, Los
Angeles, or even New York City! From there you can direct your huge
enterprise."

   "How long would that take?" asked the Mexican.

   "Twenty, perhaps twenty-five years," replied the American.

   "And after that?"

   "Afterwards? That's when it gets really interesting," answered the
American, laughing. "When your business gets really big, you can start
selling stocks and make millions!"

   "Millions? Really? And after that?"

   "After that you'll be able to retire, live in a tiny village near
the coast, sleep late, play with your children, catch a few fish, take
a siesta, and spend your evenings drinking and enjoying your friends!"

   Ordinary Life auditor Wayne Herbert sent me that and it is just a
wonderful story about the kinds of things I want us to be about.

   I sometimes refer to what wants to happen in here with the phrase
"Journey Into Wholeness." It is so easy for those of us in the West to
think that that journey is out there somewhere, in the outer world. The
goal of spiritual work is to become a "self." Or, to become aware of
the Self. I can't adequately explain to you what this self is. It is
the center and, at the same time, the circumference of the personality.
It embraces both consciousness and unconsciousness. The Self is known
as the Christ in Christianity.

   Journey into Wholeness. The root meaning of the word "holiness" is
this wholeness. Wholeness involves finding the missing parts or the
faculties that are lacking in our natures and restoring them to a
dignified place in our personality. Usually for those of us in the
Western world our need, as reflected in the story of the Mexican
fisherman, is relatedness; relatedness to ourselves as well as to
others. This is the principle of equality I've spoken to you about so
often. We who speak English are limited to one word for "love." In
Sanskrit there are ninety-six words for love. We are highly specialized
in technology yet quite primitive in terms of feelings.

   Jesus, and other Eastern spiritual teachers, saw the outer world to
be of little importance. The place where the kingdom of God was was
inside and among us. For us, however, reality is in the outer,
material, physical world. One of the ways this has affected Christian
theology is the emphasis on a belief that we are so unique, so
distinctive that even our bodies persist on the other side of death.
The religion out of which we came, Judaism, thought that after death
what happened to us was much like what happens to a dewdrop after the
sunrise. Yes, it has individuality while it exists as a separate
entity, but it is destined quite quickly to flow back into the great
primal ocean of existence and to lose all individuality. Does a drop of
water cease to exist when it falls back into the sea? Well, yes and no.
Nothing is lost but its individuality is no more. Jesus knew that the
ego was a great troublemaker for us.

   We cling to everything that we think defines us as individuals. To
threaten this notion of who we are is hell. We protect what we call our

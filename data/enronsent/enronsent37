Read the message.  I think we can help.  My question is, who is this
opinion going to be given on behalf of.  If it is from the City of
Glendale to Enron, the logical firm to give it is Glendale's "bond
counsel" since that is the outside law firm which 1) knows municipal
finance, 2) has an existing relationship with the City and 3) isn't
going to get into conflicts issues (which we probably would if we were
going to deliver an opinion on behalf of Glendale to Enron).

We think the Jones, Hall firm in San Francisco may be bond counsel to
Glendale, but perhaps not.  Let me know how we can help.

I would first talk to Pat Boylston at Stoel Rives 503-294-9116.  Stoel
Rives has recently opened a San Francisco office and Pat, who will know
about 90% of the stuff to give the opinion, can probably find a
California attorney from their office to finish it off. ----cgy

one of worst I've seen too...especially the last paragraph...
So far the worst article, I've seen yet.

Taken from this week's edition:
 
A financial black hole 
Houston, we have a problem
Nov 1st 2001 | HOUSTON, LONDON AND NEW YORK 
From The Economist print  edition

The troubles of Enron, a Texan  powerhouse in the energy markets, could result in a new financial  crisis

JUST last year, visitors  to Enron's glittering headquarters in Houston were greeted by a giant banner  that proclaimed the firm, "The world's leading energy company". That annoyed  Enron's smaller energy-trading rivals, many of which have offices only a stone's  throw away in Houston's Energy Alley, but not as much as what came next-a new  banner, declaring Enron "The world's leading company". In recent weeks, as the  company has been engulfed by a financial crisis, that banner has quietly been  removed. 
The heady mix of  audacity, ambition and arrogance revealed by the banners is as good a guide as  any to Enron's remarkable rise and fall. Forged in the 1980s by the merger of  two troubled gas-pipeline firms, Enron drove the development of the  sophisticated spot-and-derivatives markets in energy that it has come to  dominate. Indeed, such is the scale of its operations, and its dealings with  many of the world's financial institutions, that some observers see parallels  with Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), the hedge fund  that failed in 1998-and not just because seemingly brilliant financial  alchemists have been humbled. Were Enron to go bust-unlikely, but in the current  nervous climate, not impossible-might a crisis ensue?

Troubles in California's  politically crazed power market, an ill-advised foray into telecoms bandwidth  trading and concerns about management badly dented Enron's share price earlier  this year, prompting the departure of Jeffrey Skilling, the firm's newish chief  executive, in August. Kenneth Lay, an avid free-marketeer, friend of George Bush  and visionary chairman of the firm, was obliged to resume hands-on control.  
This has not slowed  Enron's decline. Day by day, it seems to be sinking deeper into a financial  quagmire that is largely of its own creation. Not least thanks to its lack of  transparency, the firm's credibility with the markets has eroded to the point  that talk of a possible takeover or even bankruptcy is widespread.
Enron's reputation for  financial wizardry has been turned from an asset to a liability since its  third-quarter results came out in mid-October, showing a $1 billion write-off on  water distribution, broadband trading and other investments. Worse, disclosed  only in passing by Mr Lay in a conference call with analysts, the firm suffered  a $1.2 billion reduction in capital, stemming from a hedging deal with a related  private-equity fund called LJM. The charge was due to  Enron's forced sale of 55m of its own shares when the partnership was unwound  this summer. Almost nobody outside Enron had been aware of the terms of the deal  with LJM, a "structured finance vehicle". 
Enron's failure to offer  details about the risks from other related partnerships have led many to fear  the worst about its huge balance sheet. Its shares plunged by 19% on October  30th alone (see chart), before recovering a bit the next day.

Andrew Fastow, who was  replaced as chief financial officer on October 24th, was a general partner in  LJM . Jeffrey McMahon, his successor, has much to do to  restore confidence. Questions abound. Were the trusts run at arm's length? What  did Mr Fastow earn from the partnership? Ominously, the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) has now launched a formal  inquiry.
Moody's, a rating  agency, last week cut its rating on the company's debt to barely above "junk"  level. Further downgrades might unleash claims from other off-balance-sheet  partnerships. Those known about, such as Atlantic Water and Marlin Water, do not  seem big enough to bankrupt Enron, but speculation is rife about what other  obligations might lurk secretly in other structured vehicles.
A lower credit rating  could destroy Enron's core franchise as the leading energy middleman, by scaring  away customers and freezing the wholesale energy markets. That might have nasty  consequences in other markets. Enron acknowledges that it is a large participant  in the derivatives market, holding a portfolio with a notional value of $21  billion. Rightly or wrongly, many traders believe that figure vastly understates  Enron's presence. If the firms on the other side of Enron's trades start to fear  that payment is not coming, they might curb their other trading, producing a  knock-on effect. Where this could end up is a subject of much  conjecture.
Utilities that trade  energy could be hit. So could the commodity and derivative operations of large  commercial and investment banks. The ties are notably tight between Enron and  J.P. Morgan Chase, according to Ventana Capital, a research firm. Not only does  J.P. Morgan provide innumerable separate credit arrangements for Enron; it also  has the largest derivative operation of any bank, as well as a large business  trading commodities. There is "no doubt" that Enron is on the other side of many  J.P. Morgan trades, says Ventana.
Were Enron to fail,  Ventana thinks "it has the potential to cause a major financial crisis", worse,  in some ways, than what occurred after LTCM . That merely  froze the debt markets temporarily, whereas Enron deals in the building-blocks  of the American economy. Imagine gridlock in the markets for gas, timber, coal,  metals, fertiliser, bandwidth or indeed any of the products Enron deals  in.
As yet, this all seems  unlikely. Many big traders were happy to deal with Enron this week, although at  shorter maturities and with less complex structures than in the past. Trading on  EnronOnline was reportedly strong. Jim Donnell of Duke Energy, a big energy trader,  described "a huge dichotomy" between the collapse in confidence in Enron in the  equity and credit markets and the "business as usual" attitude taken by big  commodity trading firms when considering Enron as a counterparty.
Yet as questions about  Enron's credit-standing spread this week, it began to have difficulty making  markets in some instruments. Few firms would accept Enron's name as guarantor of  a credit derivative. In its core energy markets some big trading counterparties  refused the Enron name. On the InterContinental Exchange (ICE), two houses reportedly specified that they would not take  Enron's credit. 
The biggest credit  exposure appeared to be with banks, whose $3 billion of back-up lines to Enron  were drawn down last week. J.P. Morgan arranged an additional $1 billion  emergency credit-line this week. This back-up, it is widely assumed, is needed  mainly to meet margin calls triggered by the ratings downgrade.

Too big to fail?
Is Enron too big and too  important to be allowed to fail? Philip Verleger, an energy economist, thinks  that Enron is so central to energy markets that it could not easily be replaced.  Enron's rivals mostly disagree, unsurprisingly.
But even Enron's worst  enemies do not (yet) expect the firm to die from its current crisis. Most  traders seem keen that it should live. "Nobody likes to see a wholesale trader  disappear," says one. They admire Enron's armies of traders and their ability to  do deals. EnronOnline is one of the Internet's few success stories, assuming its  huge trading volumes do indeed generate big profits, as the firm  claims.
Enron's, and the  financial system's, problems could worsen if doubts grow about its ability to  meet its obligations. On the surface it is rich in assets, if not cash. But its  lack of transparency leaves uncomfortable room for doubt. In June 2000, The  Economist challenged Mr Lay to reply to accusations of arrogance,  high-handedness and a propensity to push the limits of the law. His response was  revealing. To show that such charges were baseless, he pointed to another firm  unfairly maligned by critics: Drexel Burnham Lambert, an investment bank that  rose from obscurity to market prominence in the junk-bond boom of the 1980s.  Drexel was accused of arrogance, he groused, but it was only being "very  innovative and very aggressive". Drexel was not bailed out: Michael Milken, its  star, ended up in jail, and Drexel collapsed in a heap of bad debts and  ignominy.

Hi Sara
No one here seems to know anything about ERMT Corp.
Can you confirm it's not a regulated entity?  (Public Utility, etc.)
Can we get a copy of its Cert. of Incorporation (whatever you have in your

Anything else you can tell me about the activity of the entity would also be
helpful.

Thanks.

Christian:  What do you think about Pat's response?  Sara

I apologize for not getting back to you, Sara.  Things have gone a
little nuts here, as I am sure they have in Houston.

My basic question about whether I am the right guy for you is:  Do you
really want to sue this firm if things turn bad?  Wouldn't you rather
turn on a firm which doesn't have an ongoing relationship with Enron?

In other words, what good is an outside opinion to you really if its
contradicts the in-house opinion your receive.  What good is it if it
just confirms the in-house opinion but is wrong.

My suggestion would be to seek an opinion from Glendale's outside
financing counsel.  That should give you a clear signal whether outside
counsel with independent skin in the game is willing to back the City's
opinion.

Sorry I am not being more help on this.  Let me know if there is more to
talk about.

no - this should be for FIMAT USA, Inc. right?

can you fax their form of guaranty to Clement Abrams and I'll speak with him?  I don't think ENE will accept FIMAT's form.

Do you need a copy of this? 

Two things:

1.	Mary Cook, Mark Taylor, & Brent Hendry all have conflicts this Thursday and Mary Cook suggested cancelling this Thursday's meeting.  Okay to cancel?  I need to do it by 10 am on Wednesday. [Shackleton, Sara]   cancel 

2.	The best date for all concerned seems to be Tuesday--will you approve? [Shackleton, Sara]   sounds fine

Clem:

Attached is my proposed form of guaranty (format accepted by Societe Generale when ENE executed guaranty for credit arrangement to fund FIMAT USA, Inc.'s margin calls to ENA).  FIMAT will not trade without an ENE guaranty.

Sarah Wesner will fax the form of guaranty submitted to us (ENE) by FIMAT.  If that format is acceptable, we're done.

Please let me know what you think.

We are moving futures positions ASAP.

Marie:  I don't know what this is about.  Can you recall WHICH Bear guaranty?  Did we ever get the "lost guaranty" letter?  I guess we could use Clem's short form of guaranty amendment and we'll have to verify with credit.  SS

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Tanya may agree to allow this trade to margin under the agreement just like the confirm which terminated 9/12/01.

Sara/ Bob, 

Further to my discussions with Sara yesterday evening, and in the absence of any email from both of you to the contrary, I conclude that the confirms as they stand now should be OK from a legal perspective, subject to the credit approval of the entities. As I mentioned yesterday, Treasa's contact at CSFB here is trying to retain CSFB International as the counter-party as was the case for the 2000 transaction earlier. 

Thanks very much for your help.

Kim:  Attached are four "restated" confirms formerly in the name of ELFI and now in the name of ENA.  I have reviewed the legal language for conformity with the Master Energy Price Swap Agreement and the language is fine. I previously sent you the three ELFI trades that Beth Ng had originally faxed to me.

I am not familiar with one of trades below, No. 923614.  

If you can reconcile these trades, please have executed and faxed to Beth Ng per her message below.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Please read paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation.

It refers to the terminated transaction having "Reference number 1980816".

The confirmation that you  sent to me (for the terminated transaction) has a Reference number 1980815.  The termination confirmation is referenced as 1980816.

You need to correct paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation. Then the document can be executed.

To the best of my knowledge, please see the attached review of equity forward and swap deals which I have tracked for Enron Corp.  You should contact Clint Freeland (X57538) for further details.

This list does not include currency, rate or forward rate deals.

Sara

 

Other than rate or currency, what else do we use these Enron Corp masters for (I seem to recall used for Enron stock stuff)? Who would I contact and be able to get details on the transactions from? Someone in Corp? Thanks!!

Is there a way to find out what deals exist, if any, under Enron Corp ISDAs?

I just received a phone call from Bear Stearns inquiring about an Enron Corp. guaranty for the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. brokerage account.

Have you received approval from credit?  If so, what is the amount of the guaranty? 
 
Are we keeping the Enron Credit Inc. brokerage account or are we transferring all positions to the ECT Europe Finance, Inc. account?  If so, are we terminating the outstanding guaranty of the Enron Credit Inc. account which was amended to provide for a $100,000,000 cap?

Please advise me and credit of the status.

Thanks.

Sara

It was Mark wilson who is no longer here.  I am trying to get a new name from the London people. 

Assuming they approve this what is the turnaround you think?

Who is your credit approval person?  Please have that person email or call Marie and me.

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Thanks,

Tom

Rudwell:

You are handling this counterparty from a credit perspective.  Rich Friedman from Global Markets has called to inquire about the status of this ISDA request.  Please refer to Lotus Notes to review the last action taken by Russell in February, 2001.  Please determine whether we can eliminate the Credit Support Annex from this agreement before we send another version.  You will note that this counterparty wants to rely entirely on the form used by Aron.  Russell has a copy of this agreement.

Do you want to put this on the legal credit list for follow up?

How about changing the last sentence of Par. 8.1(b) to read as follows:

The above language would preserve each swap party obtaining a quote from an "Authorized Bank" [NOTE:  you need to amend the definition of to provide that ENA must have the ISDA with the bank and not ECTRI!] and properly authorize ENA to serve as calc agent [which you are].  There won't be other changes to the existing Sale and Purchase Agreement.

Tanya:  We have provided ENE guaranties in limited instances on brokerage accounts and futures accounts (with margin lines, e.g. most recently FIMAT USA, Inc).  The Bear Stearns Companies is an example of the use of corporate guaranties for the credit business.  Originally, Bear required a guaranty for an ENA account (holding credit positions); but that guaranty was terminated when the positions were transferred to an Enron Credit Inc. account at Bear with a new ENE guaranty.  There may be a few others but we'd have to conduct a file review.

ECT Europe Finance, Inc. is owned 100% by ENA. [Kate Cole is revising the corporate workbook to accurately reflect this ownership].

Tom:  Please respond to Tanya's question regarding the purpose of ECT Europe Finance, Inc.

Mark:  Which lawyers should be involved?  What is a reasonable timetable?  Let's talk and also talk about utility service companies.  Thx  ss

Sara:

I am following up with you regarding a timetable for the top 20 customers.  Per our conversation last Friday we had discussed that you would coordinate with the other lawyers to review the top 20 list and draft amendments for using CommodityLogic's ConfirmLogic module for the purpose of confirmations.  

The marketing team's goal for the timetable is to identify when the amendment can be ready for delivery to the customer.  Marketing will coordinate the actual delivery of the amendments to the customers at the appropriate time during the sales cycle.  Just to restate Tom Gros' goal, he would like the amendments to be drafted and ready to go so there will be no delays when the sales team reaches the point in the sales cycle to provide the documents to the customer.  The sales team's immediate focus is on the top 10 customers on this list and the amendments will need to be made available within the next couple of weeks for presenting to the customers.

If you could provide Jennifer, Kim and myself with your timetable that will help us set expectations with the sales team.  Jennifer will follow up with you on a weekly basis to get from you a status/update on the timetable to be incorporated in a marketing status report to Enron Networks senior management team.

Thanks, 
KC

Sara,
See attached spreadsheet which shows the legal entity names by counterparty for each commodity.  Name differences between the commodities are highlighted in Blue.

 << File: Top20 Legal Entity Names.xls >> 

Kim:

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

We just checked with Corp.  It may be later this evening but probably first thing in the morning.  Will you let Warren know?  Thanks.

Sara - I just talked to Warren and he asked me to do a status check on this because his New York people are asking him whether he will get this new guaranty tonight or tomorrow.

The Savings Plan Transition Period Ends Early!

We have been working closely with Hewitt Associates to get you access to your Savings Plan account before November 20 and are pleased to announce that the internet site went live as of 8:00 AM yesterday morning, November 13. 

Log on to benefits.enron.com and check out the new website - you will enjoy the new features.

Once again, we have appreciated your patience during the transition period.  

EnronBenefits . . . keeping pace with your lifestyle.

All:

I am trying to resolve a recurring issue in the financial power group.

In the past, we have withheld payment for all swaps with the same counterparty terminating during a calendar month until the fifth Business Day after the floating price is determinable at the end of a month.  As a practical matter, calculation of the payment of an aggregate of daily transactions would conceivably wait until the last Business Day of the month when a floating price was needed for one or more of the swaps.

How do you feel about payment for multiple trades with a party having varying termination dates throughout a given month?  Is this a cash flow issue?  Do I need to involve someone from Treasury or Settlements?

Please let me know.  Thanks.

 Here is the Pilates info.

Angela D. Davis
Hi Angela,

It was great seeing you in class this afternoon.  Keep
up the good work! Here is some information about my
Pilates studio as well as Pilates in general. Private
sessions in the studio are much different than the
mass mat class. At Powerhouse Pilates, I will design a
workout specifically for your body. We will focus on
your problem areas and we will increase your overall
strength and flexibility using all of the Pilates
equipment.

1. The benefits of Pilates

Pilates strengthens your abdominals, tightens your
buttocks, improves your posture, corrects your
alignment, reduces stress, alleviates lower back pain
and neck pain, strengthens and tones your muscles
without building bulk, and lengthens your body as a
whole. It helps you look and feel great, gives you a
sense of ease and confidence, and helps you feel
grounded and centered at all times.

2. Location

Powerhouse Pilates
1117 Omar St.
Houston, Texas 77009
Phone: 713-880-5307
Fax: 713-426-5466

Powerhouse is located in the Houston Heights, just 10
minutes from downtown Houston. From downtown, take
Allen Parkway to Studemont and turn right on
Studemont. Turn left on Omar and it's in the first
block on the left.

3. Hours of Operation:

Monday-Friday: 7am to 9pm
Saturday: 8am to 2pm

4. Cost:

Private session: $65 per session
Duet: $50 per person

Series cards are also available and can bring the cost
of a private session down to as low as $50 per
session. Duets are Pilates sessions with two students
and one instructor. If you know someone who is
interested in Pilates, you might consider bringing
them in so that you can work out together. If you buy
a duet series card, the price can be as low as $37.50
per person per session.

Series Cards:

Ten private sessions: $550 (save $100)
Fifteen private sessions: $800 (Save $175)
Twenty private sessions: $1000 (save $300)

Ten duet sessions: $425 (save $75)
Fifteen duet sessions: $600 (save $150)
Twenty duet sessions: $750 (save $250)

5. Payment methods:

We accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, checks,
and cash.

6. Scheduling

Appointments are scheduled on the hour and are fifty
minutes long. You will work on all of the Pilates
equipment and your instructor will develop a Pilates
routine specifically for your body.

7. Credentials

Powerhouse is owned and operated by Anne Walzel, a
certified Pilates instructor, dancer, member of the
Pilates Guild, and Pilates student of ten years. She
was certified through the Pilates Studio of New York
under the direction of Romana Kryzanowska, Joseph
Pilates' protege. Anne has taught Pilates at the
Pilates Studio at Atlanta ballet, the Pilates Studio
of New York, re:AB, and Tribeca Bodyworks, New York's
renowned Pilates studio. She danced at the Houston
Ballet Academy for 15 years as well as the School of
American Ballet, Martha Graham, the Paul Taylor
School, and the Jose Limon Institute, New York. She
has a bachelor's degree from Northwestern University
and is a graduate of St. John's School, Houston.

8. Pilates materials

I hope this information helps! Feel free to call me at
the studio (713-880-5307)to schedule your session or
to ask me any questions.

Sincerely,

Anne Walzel

Russell:  Please call - looks like we may have a problem.  Sara
Problem is that if Harvard does a deal with ENA and ENA back-to-backs it withe ECTRIC, we lose it from an exposure perspective. ENA probably never records the deal since it has a closed position. Then ECTRIC thinks it has a position with ENA so we lose the third party exposure.  The simple answer, I think, is if they want to trade Brent on EOL, then they probably need an ECTRIC ISDA since ENA cannot trade Brent on EOL, right?

Tanya

Tanya:

Apparantly, Presidents & Fellows of Harvard wants to trade on EOL.  They were given a long-term guest ID that has since been closed out.  However, they still want to do these Brent deals and have them booked back-to-back so that they are under the ISDA with ENA.  Two things:

1)	We do not show the ISDA in CAS
?	$20MM Threshold
?	Executed as of 11/20/00
2)	Shouldn't the Brent deals that were booked back-to-back with ECTRIC be showing up in CAS, given that the purpose of this action was to bring the exposure under the ISDA?
?	Deal #s:	QP4223 and VA0834

Are we still ok with doing this back-to-back booking?  Also, how do we feel about this entity trading Metals (or should they even be trading Metals)?

The below email is from Rod to Sara in relationship to this whole issue.  I will be out tomorrow, but I told Sara today that I would be running this by you to see what your thoughts were on the issue.  Thanks for your help!  Would you let me know of the outcome.

Regards,

Wendi LeBrocq

fyi

Hi Sara.  This issue comes up fairly often.  My understanding is that Brent deals are automatically booked to ECTRIC for tax reasons.  The Brent product stack is managed here in London by folks who live, work and eat in the UK.  Since they are in effect generating earnings for the firm 'in' the UK, the tax argument is that the Inland Revenue should collect tax on this amount.  We could book to ENA, but I here that this could cause double taxation (being taxed again by the IRS).  Perhaps ECTRIC could do a back-to-back trade with ENA at the Brent mid price - thus still managing the product in the UK but generating no UK earnings (Inland Revenue may call foul though).

Having said this, we have successfully re-booked in the past when trades were done on the phone (apparently without tax consequence).  No one has taken a hard stand on the above - that I know of anyway.  I would recommend just telling the book admin to rebook to ENA and see if we get any resistance.  Clearly, from a credit perspective we would much prefer to book both legs at ENA.

Hope all else is going well.

Rod

Hey, Rod (the "Dude"):

Mr. Jason Williams of the Houston office has directed me to you.
I spoke with Harvard (has an ENA ISDA Master Agreement (the "Master") in place) who is trading on EOL (and all ENA trades are confirmed under the existing Master).  Harvard executed a crude/Brent spread trade on EOL and discovered that the counterparty was ECTRIC (and not ENA).  Boy, were they surprised!  

Harvard's request is whether ECTRIC can assign the trade to ENA.  Then, all of Harvard's trades would be subject to the ENA Master and could be netted.

Is this a commercial issue?  Does ENA need a "Brent book" to receive this trade? 

An assignment from ECTRIC to ENA would be only an "accommodation" to Harvard.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

SS

P.S.  I never made it to London in June.  My boyfriend's mother was in the hospital then and she died two weeks later.  My mother died a few weeks ago.  It's been a bad summer.  But, I'm taking a vacation from August 23 - 31 and will be in London (staying at the Ritz).  Maybe we can have that drink!

No objections

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya

Tanya,
I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Sheila

Stephanie:

Scroll all the way down to Sheila's original message for contact person and the two Enron companies being guaranteed.  You will need to verify with London that ECTRIC has a futures agreement with Carr (maybe you can get a copy of it for our records).  Can you prepare a draft guaranty and ask Tanya for a cap.  Thanks.  Sara

I assume the parties are  ENA and ECTRIC with Carr Futures, Inc. I do not have any information about this though nor do I have a contact.  Sheila can you provide this information to Sara?

Tanya:  Just let us know the parties and guaranty cap.  I am not familiary with any Carr arrangements other than the ENA futures agreement.  Also, do you have a contact at Carr?

Thanks.  Sara

No objections

Are there any objections to issuing the gty? We just did the same thing last week for FIMAT Issuing seems the simplest rather than having to stop trading, although traditionally we have not issued corp gtys.  Please advise.

Tanya

Tanya,
I spoke with Gary this morning and he said that we could stop trading with them.  I said that others do trade with Carr.  He suggested then that the energy guys can proceed if they wish to continue trading with Carr.

Rick Farina, 312-441-4420, called me with Larry Anderson and Patty Chambers.

How do you want to proceed?

Nora:

Per our conversation, please let me know what you can about existing board resolution or bylaws.  We are trying to change the signature card for the Enron Corp. Morgan Stanley account to eliminate Fastow and Glisan and replace with others.  The request originally went to Sheila Glover from Tim DeSpain.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

I have reviewed the following documents from CSFBI:

(1) Cancellation letter for five (5) swaps (which were never confirmed)
(2) Equity Swap on 400,000 shares ENE
(3)  Two (2) Equity Forwards on 1,025,000 shares and 1,672,000 shares ENE, respectively

The forwards contain $40 price triggers which will be adjusted through either an amendment or put.  This will be documented after the swap and forwards are signed.

Please review the trade details for the swap and forwards, including share caps, floating amounts payable by ENE, spreads, etc.  You have an email version of the CSFBI documents.

The documents are in the format agreed to with CSFBI on October 2.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

Hi, Mark:

ECT Investments, Inc. is trying to finalize a "Terms of Business Letter" with Goldman Sachs International ("GSI") in London (for trading foreign listed equity options).  GSI is resisting the inclusion of any limitation of liability language in the agreement.  Our agreement is governed by English law.  I have requested the following simple statement:

	"Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special, punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss of damage."

Do you even use such a provision in your documents goverened under English law?  What language (if any) would you propose for use with an English party?

I'd appreciate your insight.

Sara

David:

Attached is a draft confirm for a natural gas EFS under the new NYMEX rules.  Please review the redlined language.

The new NYMEX amendment permitting EFS transactions was originally part of a pilot program for Brent Crude contracts (NYMEX Rule 6.21) effective September 5, 2001.

NYMEX Notice No. 01-372 effective November 1, 2001discusses the application of the EFS for natural gas futures contracts but I cannot find a specific reference to a NYMEX rule (I assume it is NYMEX Rule 6.21).  Thus, I didn't know whether it was necessary to cite a particular rule.

I also didn't know if I need to reference the number of NYMEX contracts in my "Special Provisions" section.

Further, if Rule 6.21 is applicable to the natural gas futures contracts, then I suppose that the confirm should (?) recite the information required of the Clearing Member by the Exchange.  On the other hand, maybe the Clearing Member's report should contain information such as appearing in Rule 6.21A(C), if applicable, and it need not be repeated in the confirmation.

Can you give this a quick review?  Trading in the nat gas contract terminates in a day or so.  Thanks.

Pursuant to the below email and our discussions today, pls find attached the list forward by Todd Delahoussaye, Financial Deal Compliance, which includes all the deals entered into with Morgan Stanley Capital Group. The deal no is QH4715. 

I am also forwarding you the confirms which we have executed with CSFB and MS, last year, which I had earlier forwarded to Bob last week. 

The contact person at CSFB is James Moran. His email address is james.moran@csfb.com

We still have to hear from CSFB whether they can provide a tax rep on their Cayman Islands entity. As per my understanding, that is the only relevant credit issue for this transaction. 

Looking forward to hearing from you on the confirms necessary for the roll-over. Could you give me a call sometime later today, when you have finished going through them. 

Thanks & Regards

Rajaram Jamadagni

 

 

Rob/ Sara, 

As indicated in the other email of today, Todd has sent me a separate list which Morgan Stanley sent to Enron. I have gone through the list and this particular deal is indeed there. The confirms for this particular deal were sent by me sometime last week (both the CSFB and the MS confirms). Will call today to discuss further. 

Thanks

Rajaram

 Todd,

The Deal number for the below deal is QH4715.  Can you tell me if it is included in the list Morgan sent back to you?

Raj,
Morgan does not actually sign and return documents per the Master Agreement.  They send a reply type of message which states that they agree to a certain deal number or numbers.  Todd will let us know if this particular deal has been agreed to in this manner.
FYI, today is my last day in this group.  Going forward you can contact Diane Anderson for anything related to Confirmations.

Thanks,
Joe

	
Hi Larry, 

You may have received a voicemail regarding the above. I am working with Treasa Kirby here in Global Finance and was wondering whether you have signed copies of the Morgan Stanley confirm for the above $150m oil prepay executed in Dec 2000/Jan 2001. We need to roll-over the oil prepay and need to discuss with the lawyers to understand whether any changes need to be made to the confirms. If you do have signed copies, kindly send both of us a copy of the same asap. 

Thanks & Regards

You MUST carve this transaction out of the CSFBI master. The margin does NO=
T flow around the structure.  If you read the confirms, you will see that E=
nron receives fixed 150MM from CSFBI day 1 and pays it back WTI basically a=
t the end of the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated).  Th=
us, this deal is out of the money to Enron 150MM and they can call us for t=
hat margin which we would have to post for the entire term of the deal.  Ou=
r swap with MSCG has us paying fixed, but we do not pay it until the end of=
 the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated). Thus, this swap=
 could allow for either party to margin based on WTI price movement - but i=
n essence, it is an at the money trade today. You will NOT be able to margi=
n MSCG.  Thus, the net effect is you have to post margin, but you do not re=
ceive any.  If you do not carve this deal out of the margin arrangements, y=
ou wil defeat the purpose of executing a prepay - you will have to post the=
 money they prepay you as collateral.  Hope it is clear - I am out of the o=
ffice tomorrow, but I will be back on Monday.

Tanya

Confirms as requested. Tanya, Raj and I will call you to discuss.

Christian:  What do you think about Pat's response?  Sara

I apologize for not getting back to you, Sara.  Things have gone a
little nuts here, as I am sure they have in Houston.

My basic question about whether I am the right guy for you is:  Do you
really want to sue this firm if things turn bad?  Wouldn't you rather
turn on a firm which doesn't have an ongoing relationship with Enron?

In other words, what good is an outside opinion to you really if its
contradicts the in-house opinion your receive.  What good is it if it
just confirms the in-house opinion but is wrong.

My suggestion would be to seek an opinion from Glendale's outside
financing counsel.  That should give you a clear signal whether outside
counsel with independent skin in the game is willing to back the City's
opinion.

Sorry I am not being more help on this.  Let me know if there is more to
talk about.

Pat:  I never received a response from you.  Are you the lawyer
available to assist me in this matter?  Thanks.  Sara

To all,
	We have expanded equity trading into the European Markets.  Along with that, you will see an increase of executing broker agreements that specialize in foreign equities.  We plan on executing a broker agreement with Metzler Capital Markets for the purposes of order flow and specialty in Italian equities.  Currently no documentation is required and we would still clear all transactions with our existing Primebrokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns.  In addition, Metzler clears their transactions through Paribas Milan.  

Thanks,
Theresa

front.  How about you?  The wife?  does she have any sisters or friends?

Jeff, I understand you've been getting pricing from our crude/diesel traders 
for some of your transportation work.  Please do not go directly to the 
traders, rather the structuring desk.  Also, please coordinate your activites 
with Dan Reck who is running Enron Freight, dealing with all trucking and 
rail issues.  We are acquiring a company that has relationships with many of 
the customers you've pitched.  In most cases, we have been covering many of 
these customers from the energy side already.

Thanks for your cooperation

Jeff

we need to proceed with pricing this, but let's help these guys understand.

you are interested.

Merritt,

Call me to hear the latest about the Northwest Shelf deal.  V V  left me a 
message saying that he would still let us "work on the pricing, structuring 
side", but that he's been kicking his bid around with Wayne, Clay and Rick 
and they're going to put together their own idea.  Gee, are you getting the 
impression that they don't get it?  They seem to want to go long on 
Australian cargoes by bidding at a price that would only make economic sense 
if it goes into India.  They're not going to go through us to get there.  
They didn't comprehend that to take a long position means that you are 
putting that position in a book.  I'm going to lose it.

John, he did well with the gas guys, so lets make him an offer.  Get with m=

Thanks for the note.   I have a spot for you in our fundamentals group, which 
there is a lot of interaction with tech, traders, and marketers, and good,

Jeff:

Do you have an interest in providing a recommendation letter for my 
application to the analyst program?

During my tenure of one year at Enron, I've assisted Errol and Dutch manage 
Mike Maggi and John
Arnold's positions including xpits/deliveries, etc. to effectively ensure 
that their positions (and risks) have
complete accuracy. As you know, I am responsible for this task for all groups.

Furthermore, I constantly seek new methods of creating value in the natural 
gas (and other) groups.
As you may know, I am working with John Arnold on a project to evaluate our 
existing brokers to utilize their credit lines
properly which are interest-free (most of them) so that we may reduce our 
interest costs associated with initial
margins.

I'd like to meet with you briefly to discuss your thoughts on the MG meeting 
last week and assist you in
any follow-up endeavors.  I'll contact Sheila Glover, if you wish, next week, 
to see if she has received the contact
list which you requested.

Representatives of Wharton's admissions group will be here on Monday, October 
16 for a presentation for prospective graduate
business school students which I will be attending.

Thanks.

David  3-3528

just swing by or call my asst Jennifer 39440 to set it up. 

David P Dupre
09/01/2000 04:52 PM
Hi,
May I arrange a brief meeting when your schedule permits?

As you know, I work closely with Dutch and Errol to ensure that the NG 
positions
are correct.

David

I think doing a EGM only prc is probably the right way to go.  We will need 
to do a good job (and have the ability to cross calibrate) understanding the 
other business units performance as well.

Jeff

   

I have been selected by Enron to attend a two week Global Consulting Alliance 
HR Leadership Program in Ann Arbor.  I'll be out of the office beginning 
Monday, October 2, returning on Monday, October 16.

In my absence, Shanna Funkhouser will be handling all EGM issues.  David 
Oxley has offered his assistance during this 2 week period as well.  I will 
be in touch with both Shanna and David while I'm gone to address any critical 
issues.  I have asked Shanna to attend the EGM OOC Staff Meetings in my 
absence.  

On another note, and I recognize there are signficant business issues you 
both are dealing with, but we need to start thinking about the PRC process.  
Specific questions that EGM business heads have asked are:

 With the exception of VP's and above, do we want to isolate EGM employees 
and review them only within EGM, regardless of location?

 Or, do we want to segregate those EGM employees below VP that were formerly 
EEL or ENA and review them separately with EEL or ENA?

  (ex., Europe, Singapore, Sydney, etc. employees review with EEL;  North 
American based employees review with ENA

 We'll have to integrate the former CALME employees as well.

 
Shawna and I have ascertained that your management team would prefer a 
separate EGM PRC so employees can be evaluated with peers in global emerging 
markets, rather than with mature (and high revenue generating) markets like 
North America gas and power.

Obviously, this is your call.  But time is growing near to plan for whatever 
direction we decide to go in.  The PRC system opens for feedback on approx. 
10/20/00.  PRC meetings need to be held between 11/20/00 and 12/15/00.

Thanks,

Cindy

Jeff,

I spoke with your assistant earlier this week to get a date where you would 
be available to meet with El Paso regarding current LNG opportunities.  
Unfortunately, Eisbrenner (Senior VP El Paso Merchant Energy Services) was 
only available on Friday October 13th.    

Please come back to me if you can juggle your schedule to join us.  I have 
not invited any of the initial team for the time being.

Thanks
Eric

Eric -

The agenda and date work well for El Paso.  I will attend the meeting along
with John Hattenberg, Senior VP, LNG & David Jenkins, VP, LNG.  We look
forward to our meeting.

Best regards,

6:30 to 8:30 p.m., Hotel Okura, Akebono Room, in Tokyo.

We are delighted to welcome the Prime Minister of Japan, Mr. Yoshiro Mori, 
who is currently scheduled to join Ken Lay in the traditional Japanese 
inauguration ceremony.  Dignitaries from Japanese government, key political 
figures and corporate leaders are invited to attend the event. 

You will receive an official invitation in due course, but in the meantime it 
would be very helpful if you could confirm by e-mail whether you expect to 
attend. Please respond to Mika.Watanabe@enron.com.

We look forward to welcoming you in Tokyo as we celebrate the grand opening 
of Enron Japan.

Dear Mr. Shankman,
? How are you doing? We met last week at the  undergraduate Enron 
presentation and discussed the possibility of an Enron/ESPN  deal that would 
enable television viewers to order old sporting events over the  television 
(similar to the Blockbuster deal). You told me to send you an email  around 
this time to follow up, so I can find out who to contact to get the ball  
rolling. Thanks again for taking the time to listen to my idea.

Purpose
To explain the EES strategy for 2001 and how they will deliver on their 
number.

Details
EES has 3 product lines: Global National Outsourcing - Bundled Services 
(Angela Swarz / Mike Mann), Fast Track (Craig Sutter) and Regional Commodity 
(Greg Sharpe / Greg Cordell)
 1. National Accounts
 Part A - Bundled Service
 * This is the full bundled product (DSM, Commodity and Risk Mgmt)
 * Angela Swarz is the team lead
 *They are targetting large commercials (i.e shopping centers, hotels etc). 
 *They are also going aftersome large industrials (i.e. they closed Quaker 
Oats on 1/25)
 Part  B: Midddle Marketing- - Industrial Origination
 * Mike Mann heads this up
 *They are targetting heavy industrials including the Refining, Petchem and 
Chemical industries
 * They sell Risk Mgmt, Commodity etc.......
 * They are making a concerted effort on Ags and Chems
 * Approaching customer at the executive Level
 * Already approached Farmland and IMC
 * Have a deal with Kerr McGee for outsourcing
 2. Fast Track "Boiler Room"
 *Run by Craig Sutter
 * ABC - always be closing-- They have written a script for originators to 
close a deal in 4 calls.
 *They have a computer that generates leads for their new marketing products 
( "ENvest" (Asset capex), ENpower "commodity swaps", Commodity sales  
"ENsomething" and "Entelligence" -
 3. Commodity Sales
 * Greg Sharp and Greg Cordell
 *Have big plans for power in TX
 *Do some gas commodity sales
 *Basically anythinmg smaller than the wholesale load

Impact on EGM
In August 1999, all NAICS (SIC) codes except Pulp and Paper and Steel 
reverted to EES in September 2000. This includes Refining, Petchems, 
Transport, Chemicals, Coal, Ags, etc...They a model "Value Enhancement" that  
shows an itemized account of a customer's VAR by commodity (metals, plastics, 
petchems,
products, gas, power, etc). They planon covering the whole universe of risk 
management. Obviously we need to manage the relationship with EES.

Next Steps:
Meet with Mike Mann. I have his target list. We probably need to see how we 
help them bring business to the EGM books, since they are cross-selling 
everything.

Let me know what you want to do.
JF

Thanks for your interest.  Of course I remember our conversation.  By now I'm 
sure you know you are on our interview list.  (If I told you prematurely, use 
it to your advantage somehow with your friends.)  I've contacted one of our 
head broadband marketers to set up an introduction, and see where this goes.  
It's a great idea, and you should hear back from me shortly, when David 
responds to me call.  

Best regards,

Jeff

P.S.  Please call me Jeff--I'm not some grey haired old dude, but I 
appreciated your being professional in your first email to me.

I'm not sure that thor understands dollars flowing with risk.  What should we

fyi - it doesn't sound like the weather piece of the Oslo long-term deals is 
going to have much value.  We are still trying to get that value from Oslo 
and ensure that the weather risk is captured appropriately in EGM risk 
books.  I will keep you updated.

This deal was done as a Power game and when we split it, the main value will 
be on the power book, so don't calc on anything substantial on this

Thor - We are going to meet with Jeff Shankman on Thursday to discuss 3rd

the weather piece of the Kotka deal it would be helpful.  Call me if you have 
any concerns regarding this request.  Thanks for your help.

Thor Lien

We haven't finalised the strip out of the remaining weather risk from the 
power book, but we will surely send that over as soon as we have done it

Bjarne and Thor,

Thanks for the confirmation and other information that you provided on this 
deal.  I still need the associated P&L and Weather Risk transferred from the 
Nordic Power books to the Weather book.

It is imperative that this be done immediately from a Risk controls 
standpoint not to mention the fact that Quarter-end is fast approaching.  
Please call or e-mail so as to update me of your progress.

Thanks,
Todd

Mike/Jeff:  you need to intervene on this at a higher level to make sure that 
we don't give up any important LNG rights when we selldown DPC
	enron india
	

Clay, we've been banging this drum so long in India that we've broken all our 
drumsticks. We've always maintained that access to the Metgas terminal and 
storage and pipeline is key to any plans Enron has in the LNG business. 
Personally, I have always thought Enron should just finance and build the 
pipeline itself and then sell it once it becomes operational, maintaining 
access to the terminal and pipeline capacity. Glad to see you're on board, 
because we can use the help. 

But this is going to require some Enron commitment. To meet Enron's 
objectives (no debt consolidation, cash flow and earnings), the current 
selldowns being considered are to industry and related players who want their 
share of the upsides of the business. So giving Enron any preferred rights is 
going to be tough with these players.

Let's discuss next week in India. I have requested the Metgas meetings with 
the EGM LNG team be on Wednesday.

Clay Harris
09/29/2000 03:41 AM
One of the keys to growing the LNG business is access to LNG terminals and 
fuel supply opportunities. We should insure that the sell down of DPC and 
Metgas be structured such that Enron/EGM retain terminal rights and fuel 
supply rights at Dabhol, if appropriate. The Metgas terminal/regas rights 
under the TARA and EFI's fuel management/fuel supply rights under the Fuel 
Management Agreement need to stay with Enron/EGM. Lets discuss next week in 
Mumbai.

Clay

we are working with the systems development group here in london to create 
for the global products trading group a curve spreadsheet and options
calculator (can do cracks spreads and asian options).  the aim is that we can 
have a central site that is accessible to other groups and all 
traders/marketers in this group to facilitate our ability to service customer 
business.  brian hudson is the person who developed this system for the gas 
and power groups here in europe and has been recommened to us by steven 
leppard who heads the IT research department.   Without going into the 
systems history story here I think we are inadequately prepared on this side 
and need to strengthen in this area.  We understand from Steve that in order 
for them to dedicate the resources required for what we are asking they would 
like to take on an additional person that would be partly for our and the 
coal group's acct.  Steve can keep this individual busy with other projects 
so it would not be a full time expense for Global Products.  our excel 
spreadsheets methodology is not stable enough given the increasing 
unreliability of the London servers which keep falling over and thus the 
traders without any pricing tools.  This is what brought about our 
discussions with the IT department to try and improve the present system.  

thanks for the email.  keep me updated on this.  Jeff

My guess is that we'll bring him back for another round of interviews, so we 
can have you talk to him them.

I would wait.  Otherwise if we bring him in now and he gets offer, then we 
would have to place him elsewhere for his first six months.  If you want him 
for a first rotation, it may make sense to wait until we get closer to 
February.

We will have a need for another associate in February and would be interested 
in evaluating Randall for that position.  Does that mean that we should wait 
a few months to interview him?  I don't think that Kevin has any immediate 
openings either.

We can bring him in for a round of interviews for the Associate Program.  If 
you have an immediate need and he passes interviews then its likely we can 
make offer now.  Confirm thats what you want and we will facilitate getting 
him in for interviews.

Celeste

The attached resume comes highly recommended to us and it looks like he's got 
some very relevant experience to some of the things going on in EBS.  Kevin 
Howard and I would both be interested in talking to him about positions in 
our group, but it seems to make the most sense to bring him into the 
Associate/Analyst Program.  He's been out of school for 2 years and was one 
of the founders of Network Oil, a Houston based startup.  What is the best 
way to proceed with this?

This would be as an associate in the EBS program.  I am full right now but 
seemed like someone we would want in the family.  Louie Fischer is very high 
on him and she is typically a tough critic.  If we could get him in for 
interviews, we could consider placement and timing.

Rick,

I understand that Ken Lay will officially open the Enron Japan office around 
the 1st of November. We should make sure that our key LNG contacts are 
invited to the ceremony, especially our joint venture partners in the Lakshmi 
and the builders of the Lakshmi. Other key companies we should consider would 
be Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas, and Mitsubishi.

print this and i need a folder titled ARA Coal Summary
Jez Peters
09/30/2000 09:41 AM
MKT SUMMARY

  Dust is settling after latest supply side incident to hit the market - 
namely the Drummond Force Majeure. What remains now is cif mkt
   which is in backwardisation for Q4 and Q1 01 versus the rest of 2001 but 
where stocks in Rotterdam are at near record highs at around
   2.5 million mt for the end of September. Indeed, utilities and traders 
alike have taken advantage of the weak spot mkt we experienced 
   during August and early September to buy up distressed parcels in ARA and 
play the cash / carry game. This has certainly paid
   dividends as any slack which was in the pipeline has certainly been 
swallowed due to a number of incidents which has restricted
   production/shipments from various geographies. While the whole curve has 
shifted north as a result of early buying interest for 2001
   the backwardisation in the frt curves coupled with above has seen Q4 and 
Q1 prices increase by some $4 over past 6 weeks to
   absolute values at $39 cif ARA - this represents a prm of between 
$0.75-$1.00 over Jan/Dec 01 run. Believe the front end will continue
   to remain tight due to supply squeeze we are feeling and high frt rates 
but going forward into next year we may see some price pressure
   from levels we are today as a consequence of lower frt rates, increase in 
prod'n, synfuel into Europe and weaker continental power prices 
   from the high levels they are today. Control of FOB origin prices through 
continued consolidation in the production side of the industry 
   could put ruin to this and hence we look for opportunities to spread our 
long FOB origin posn into as many geographies as possible.

EOL

We are just shy of reaching 500,000mt mark for total volume of tonnage traded 
via EOL with the activity that went on this week. There 
continues to be excellent interest from all sectors of the industry and we 
really need to focus on converting the increasing number
of guest user ID's we are giving out into actual transactions on the system - 
many are still afraid of the technology, many are still ignorant
of how they can utilise the system as a risk management tool and many simply  
don't have the authority - hence we continue to focus
on preaching the word to all and sundry!! Highlight this week was having 
Glencore trade on two occasions and not surprisingly they were 
propping the mkt up on the buy side. We are moving ahead with posting options 
on the SECA contract on EOL.

GAMEPLAN

Current mkt environment has generated healthy buying interest for 2001 and 
with the expectation that we will still see frt rates ease off for 2001
from the high levels today ($9.50 RBCT - ARA Cape) combined with a somewhat 
weaker tone in continental power prices for 01 we are fairly 
keen to hit some of this business at current price levels. We have benefited 
from the current price hike maintaining an overall long position 
but with the lions share of that long being placed in Drummond we must focus 
on securing physical commitments from Drummond for first half 01 
shipments in order to participate in any of this business with peace of mind. 
Hence we continue to look for opportunities to tie up tonnage from
other geographies such as South Africa, Australia, U.S and Russia that will 
allow us the flexibility which adds so much value to our book.

Have extended dlist this week - if you donot wish to receive then please let 
me know and likewise if you would like people
added.

Best Regards
Jez

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 38/2000

Highlight
Sold four capes to Preag for next year from Colombia to Rotterdam at $7.30 
and simultaneously bought four capes from Coeclerici at $ 7 to close out 
position at a $150,000 profit.  Fixed a Bocimar vessel for our October 
commitment to Electrabel from Puerto Bolivar to Hunterston at $8.10 and also 
fixed another Coeclerici vessel from Colombia to Rotterdam to cover our short 
to Preag in November.  Still have a late November short against Cargill from 
Richards Bay to Rotterdam to cover within the next couple weeks.

On the ABC front, met with Elcano ( largest Spanish shipping company ) to 
discuss a possible partnership to acquire ABC but quickly realised that they 
do not have the stomach for such a big deal.  However, did discover that they 
are quite active on the LNG side and are about to close on a LNG vessel 
purchase within the next couple weeks.  We are definitely going to stay in 
contact to potentially develop some alliances on the LNG side.

Late in the week heard that Bocimar had met with ABC not to purchase them but 
to discuss a pooling agreement.  From good sources were told that ABC had no 
interest in Bocimar's offer and therefore we are planning on meeting ABC to 
continue to express our interest in acquiring their fleet and more 
importantly to continue to frustrate Bocimars'attempt to control the cape 
fleet.     

We have completed our 'Enron Shipping' powerpoint presentation for EOL and we 
expect to have a shipping section within the EOL platform by mid next month 
in time for Coaltrans.  This new platform will allow our customers to log 
into EOL and go directly to our shipping web page to be able to trade with 
us.  Currently, customers have to access the international coal web page to 
access our shipping products which does not make sense to our customers

Also Pierre met in Paris with Usinor ( 3rd largest steel mill in the world ) 
to discuss some potential freight deals and also express our interest to sell 
them Synfuel next year to which they seemed quite interested.  Will revert to 
them with prices shortly.

Market
	Short term	Medium term	Long Term
Handy Max	Down	Flat	Flat
Panamax	Down	Down	Down
Cape Size	Flat	Flat	Flat

Panamax : Market fell all week long but not to a great extent due to some 
worry about delays in US grain shipping activity
Capes : After a furious rally last week the market was flat this week as 
owners and charters had fixed all their October requirements and were 
starting to discuss November business with neither side wanting to commit
Crude markets remaining still over $30 a barrel even with the US trying its 
hardest to make it deep into the mid twenties, has also continued to make 
owners unwilling to discount next years freight rates
Deals Done
Physical Freight
ECS freight 
Fixed  2+1 geared panamaxes from Indo to Hong Kong for November to January 
2001 at $6.35.

Third parties freight deals
As mentioned above fixed with Preag, Bocimar and Coeclerici on Capes

OTC 
FFA s
Bought 75,000 tons from SK Shipping  from Colombia to Rotterdam at $ 8.15 for 
October settlement

EOL
Traded with Bocimar twice and with Klaveness once this week.  Life to date 
total EOL trades are approaching 300,000 tons.  Legal late this week has 
finally authorised us to trade with NCSC on EOL so we expect to add another 
counterparty shortly.  Furthermore, we are planning a meeting with Calypso 
fund management and credit to come to a solution to allow the fund to trade 
with EOL

Deal Flow
Given the coal desk rates for Rustock, Mission, Spanish ports, Pier 9 to 
rotterdam  and also have sold to the coal desk a cape from Australia to 
Rotterdam for Feb/March 01 loading

09/30/2000 12:07 PM
Mike/Jeff:  per your instructions, we have taken a look at Enrion India's 
plans regarding selldown of DPC/.Metgas to determine what impact this could 
have on our LNG business.  The second paragraph of Wade's note below sums up 
the current situation.  Bottom  line, if Metgas is sold down by Enron India 
from 100% to 50%, we would lose the right to control unilaterally decisions 
related to the use of the Dabhol LNG terminal.  I don't know how much someone 
may be willing to pay for Metgas, but I suspect that at this time it is a 
relatively small number when compared to the strategic value of controlling 
this terminal

We will discuss next week when we are in India.  Please advise if youhave any 
thoughts or suggestions

Rick

	enron india
	

Rick, we can discuss this more at length in Mumbai this coming week. Metgas 
is the only company that has any access to DPC's terminal. As you know, DPC 
is owned today by Enron (65), MSEB (15), GE (10) and Bechtel (10). At year 
end, Enron's 65 will be split to Enron (50) and new investor (15). Any 
changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC, which is 
heavily influenced, but not controlled, by Enron.

The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA, and Enron has this through 
Metgas. Under the TARA, Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that 
Metgas delivers to DPC. In addition, Metgas has rights to increase size of 
terminal at its cost. So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real 
value here. Today, Metgas is 100% owned and controlled by Enron, so Enron has 
control. But in any sale of Metgas, Enron's control will be lessened. Under 
current plans to avoid debt consolidation, we will reduce Enron's equity 
position to 50% or less, which means we are at best sharing control with 
someone else, or maybe a group of someone else's. If Enron is uncomfortable 
with this because it views access to Metgas terminal as part of larger LNG 
role, we should discuss ASAP.

AG -- please allow time on Wednesday's agenda to discuss these issues with 
Rick and Clay.

Wade

Rick Bergsieker
09/30/2000 01:45 AM
Clay:  I suggest taht you meet with David Forbes asap.

Bill/Wade:  I would like to understand how DPC/Metgas selldown will impact 
Enron's ability to control acces to the DPC LNG terminal.  If an LNG 
competitor buys in (e.g., Total or British Gas or Shell) could they block our 
acces to the terminal?

Bill Gathmann
09/28/2000 01:15 PM
Clay,

As you know, we are selling portions of both Dabhol and Metgas.  For fuel 
supply, they can supply Nahptha to Dabhol and LNG to Metgas.  They will have 
BOD positions pro rata with their ownership.   Finally, in the case of 
Dabhol, there are significant minority shareholder protections given the way 
the the various voting procedures are designed.  I am not as familiar with 
the Metgas voting procedures, but there is certainly the opportunity to 
negotiated something there since it is still in development.  Also, there 
should be attractive commercial returns with each project.

I feel that these opportunities certainly meets their investment criteria.  
If they are interested, we need to get them up to speed quickly.

Call me or let me know how you want to proceed on this.

Bill

   
	enron india
	

Bill, please get back with Clay on this and let him know if you think there 
is a fit. It sounds like DPC meets their requirements, but as Bill is leading 
our selldown efforts, I'll let him respond.

Clay Harris

Based on the email below is IPIC worth pursuing??? Please advise.

Clay
David Forbes <forbesd@ipic.co.ae> on 09/28/2000 01:34:40 AM
Clay,
Thanks for the information on DPC. IPIC's current focus on India is to
identify investments with related crude, naphtha or gas supply needs which
could be filled by Adnoc or Adgas, with priority currently assigned to
Adnoc's naphtha. IPIC would also be looking for a commercial return, BOD
participation & strong minority shareholder protection. Does the DPC
opportunity fit this profile? If so IPIC could certainly look at it...

Best Regards

Dave Forbes

Rick,

As you recall we had previously decided to have E Power be the counterparty 
to BHP for formal arrangements in pursuing the terminal opportunity is Japan. 
Should we reconsider this approach given the new organization. E Power 
interest is in cheap fuel and not the terminal or pipelines. Please advise 
and I will handle with Carey. We have a meeting in Japan with BHP on Oct 16th 
to execute the CA.

Mike - 

Thanks for your voice mail of Friday regarding your trip to Tokyo.  As we 
have discussed we are in the process of identifying a strategy and forming a 
team to lead our Asian coal efforts.  

We view continental Europe and Japan / Asia as the next areas of growth for 
our group.  One of our greatest challenges has been identifying and 
attracting to our group the best "Enron" people, and strong industry 
players.  We have made some progress with the recent addition in Houston of 3 
- excellent mid-marketers with industry backgrounds.  However we are still in 
the process of building a strong European organization, and staffing Sydney 
with a core group of Enron traders and industry mid-marketers.  

Clearly Japan represents the single largest market for coal in Asia.  The 
other major markets are Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong and to a degree India.  The 
largest coal exporters in the region are Australia, Indonesia, China and 
Russia.  Our staffing strategy for Asia is to initially build a core trading 
and marketing group centered around 2 - 3 experienced "Enron" guys in Sydney, 
add  mid-marketers with industry experience in Sydney and Tokyo, and hire  2 
- locals in China to look after our deliveries from PRC suppliers.  

Our experience to date has shown that industry guys orphaned in a regional 
office face certain failure. As a result we are trying to avoid the mistake 
we have made in the past of hiring local industry players, and then failing 
to provide them with proper direction and support. 

We are on target to relocate at least 2 - "Enron" guys to Sydney by Jan - 
Feb.  We will continue to search for strong industry guys in Sydney, and make 
any necessary changes to our existing structure there.  We have not yet 
started to identify qualified people with industry experience in Tokyo - but 
will obviously do so.  I will get with Stu and Joe to discuss using a local 
head-hunter, and advertising in trade journals etc.

We share your views on our potential for growth in Asia and Japan, and are 
working to put a team in place that will be focused on developing a strongly 
competitive, sustainable  business in the region.  Our initial goal is to 
develop Asia to the point where Sydney is running it's own books for both 
coal and freight, and we are a major supplier in the region.

Stu and I will be in Hong Kong and Beijing Oct.  7 - 11 to meet with the 
Chairman of Shenua Coal, and senior management of Shanxi Coal, China Light & 
Power, and Hong Kong Electric.  The primary purpose of the trip is to 
encourage Shenua to perform in accordance with their obligations under our 
supply agreement; introduce ourselves to Shanxi; assure CLP that we will 
perform under our term sales agreement; and start negotiations with HKE for a 
term sales contract.

I will coordinate my schedule with Joe, and will spend a few days in Tokyo 
(Oct. 12 - 13) at the end of the PRC trip.  We can coordinate our efforts, 
put a time line in place for staffing the Tokyo office with qualified coal 
guys, and discuss our overall strategy for entering the Japanese market.

I will be in the office Mon. - Weds., and am available to meet with you and 
Jeff to discuss the above at your convenience. 

 Thanks,

George

I'll let my parents (Dr. and Mrs. Larry  (Carole) Goldberg) know.  Thanks 
very much.

Jeff

probably not, but thanks.  Jeff

   

Jeff,
Any chance you'll have time to review me?
Frank

Our analysts were covered during the summer, weren't they?  Why not use 
whomever was used then.  I thought you were going to change the A/A review 
process from mid year, since that was a disaster by most accounts.

   
	
	

Still have not heard from you regarding PRC Rep candidates.  Please advise.
	
	

Do you know to whom you submitted your PRC Reps?  I don't believe that any 
one in the Associate and Analyst Program has received that information.  We 
will be using the same format as mid-year and we are looking for 1 Director 
for the Analyst PRC and 1 VP for the Associate PRC from your EGM groups.  
Each would represent approximately 15 individuals.  Do you think you could 
forward me a copy of your submitted list so we can move forward?  I would 
greatly appreciate it. 

Just to let you know, I did forward an email to Shanna Funkhouser and Brent 
Price (on Oct. 3rd and 4th) to make sure that all Analysts and Associates in 
an EGM group go through a pre-rate meeting prior to the final A/A PRC which 
has been scheduled for December 12th and 13th.  We must have the pre-ratings 
loaded into the PEP system prior to these dates and hope they can be final by 
November 30th.  These results are imperative to a successful 
cross-calibration in the final PRC meeting.  We already have dates set for 
the EES and ESA meetings.  I will be glad to attend the Associate and Analyst 
piece of EGM's PRC meetings to assist in facilitation.  Please advise when 
the EGM pre-rating meeting is scheduled.  Thank you for your cooperation.

We had submitted a list of PRC reps already.  Who is currentlyreviewing, and 
are you using the same format as midyear, and how many people do you need? 

   
	
	

Jeff,
I am following up on the voicemail I left you on Thursday October 5th, 
requesting a recommendation for a Director and Vice President to represent 
Analyst and Associates in the final 2000 PRC.  Due to promotions and 
additions to the Associate and Analyst Programs, we have an additional slot 
for both the Associate PRC and Analyst PRC that we would like to fill with an 
EGM participant.  This will keep the distribution throughout the business 
units equitable.  

We would like to finalize this by Friday, October 13th in order to load the 
PEP system and communicate to the A/A pool members.  Please forward your 
choice for Global Markets representation to me by this date or contact me to 
discuss.  Thanks so much for your continued support.

Jeff,
Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always
recommend
buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
have fun in London.
Nat

Please expect a phone call from him.  He's in ny and a great guy.  Could you 
please do an informational interview in the office and see if there is 
anything EGM could have him do.  He is also going to speak with Jeff 
Donahue.  Thanks.  Jeff

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 08/2001

Highlight
Despite sharp movement in spot rates for both sectors week in general has 
been relatively quiet. Capes saw majority of strength in Pacific with Intra 
Pacific rates rising around $1800 since last week. Late surge in Japanese 
buying ahead of the close of their financial year is main reason attributed 
to this rise. Atlantic Capesize been pretty flat to marginally better, no 
exciting news. Outlook for coming week is that Far East strength will be 
maintained although pace definitely slowing. No change sentiment in Pacific.

Panamax has seen opposite effect, grain stems finally rolling from S America 
which has been the major driver of the Atlantic market, for March loaders. 
market was under impression that Pacific likely to come under downward 
pressure but once the demand has been strong enough epecially for modern 
tonnage and outlook for coming week is that reates are likely to maintain 
firmness. Atlantic expected continue run for next week.

Short term we have established small long for nearby Capes, but maintain 
overall perspective to sell forward curve on appreciable rallies. Panamax 
very similar approach.

Panamax we fixed timecharter tonnage to cover 14 / 26 Mch Dreyfus Ist 
nomination USG / Far East grain cargo. Have also taken option to extend 
period of vessel for short Trans-Pacific voyage if market maintains strength 
longer than we think.

All of your concerns are valid, and I too would like to work through them 
with you.  As info, Mike will be over in two weeks.  Organizationally, 
strategically, talent, and back office--we will get there.  Who particularly 
are you worried about.  As far as your situation, let's talk numbers.  I'd 
like you to believe that trading, and management, particularly your 
leadership, will pay off for you.

jeff,
when I came to Houston in late December there were, if you recall,  a number 
of issues that
I had hoped to discuss with you.  We only really scratched the surface with 
the reorganisation
announced today.  I would prioritise them as follows:

1) recruiting, training, and keeping talent.  
there is a lack of depth in the organisation.  to make matters worse most of 
the recruiting was
done by greg whalley and now all of those traders are on expiring or expired 
contracts.  the
fact that all of them on the international side received bonuses less than 
last year doesn't 
help.   also the industry is expansion mode so it is harder to recruit and 
keep talent.  we are
running the risk of getting left with the unhireable and losing the best.

2) vision.  
having worked for enron for three years i realise that the company seeks 
self-starters.  one of
the frustrations that I have in Europe, and is a problem with the group 
overall, is that too many of
the employees are on their heels waiting for direction from above.  that is 
one of the things I was
hoping we might address in a reorganisation that shrunk the business units.  
smaller teams would
be more focused on opportunities to grow the business, communicate better, 
and energise the
environment.   still we need as senior management to discuss in a more 
specific sense where we
need to improve the most.  you have identified customer business, eol, and 
research as the three
key areas.  I would like to discuss with you the priority of being able to 
sell physical fuels.  the easiest
thing to do is get long expensive oil and the hardest thing to do is develop 
a system.  this group has
made almost no progress in developing a physical system.  that is what I will 
be working on in the 
heating, diesel, and jet fuel markets.  I would have thought the greatest and 
first opportunity that we
need to be exploiting is fuel supply to utilities.  btu related shorts, that 
leverage upon our existing gas 
contacts, would seem to be our greatest inherent advantage vs our 
competition.  also it could focus
our fuel oil and middle distillate group on the opportunities between gas and 
liquids.  The relationships
have never been closer and this seems to be a situation that could remain for 
a long time.   the u.s. 
presents more opportunites but we are making good progress in developing 
financial hedging
business in europe with continental gas and I'm pushing the origination 
groups in Europe to look
into the physical supply opportunities.

3) systems.
I'm going to spend sometime with Brent Price tomorrow but my conclusion on 
doing the post-mortem
on Spain is that we need to resource the back office significantly before we 
can significantly grow
the business.  They are struggling to keep up at the moment and the process 
seems very bureaucratic
and inefficient.  This worries me because if you look at the problems that we 
have gotten into in the past
we don't seem to have made great progress in eliminating the probability of 
there reoccurance.

now in terms of the situation with myself.  please put yourself in my shoes 
for a minute.  I have had no
life for the last year sorting out the crap of others (q1 - helsinki/q4 - 
spain).  in the middle part of the year
I had to spend much time addressing the people issues and other problems 
created by the vacumn of 
no managment in London for over a year.  Was able to coordinate a good profit 
on the gasoil books that
was pissed away.  In addition, I have had to take back over the book because 
ross was not capable
of managing the short gamma position that was chopping him up.  the point 
being that managing didn't
pay.   I have to run but these I want to discuss.

Interesting.  Do you like this guy?  What about Crude and products 
origination working for Randy?  On the LNG front we should look at him if you 
like him but i don't think it is a no brainer.  Neal will be coming on in 2 
weeks, do we need him?  Maybe we do.

Just to put me over the edge, I got a phone call last week from one of the 
gas trading h.r. people with respect to robin menear.  she was listed as 
commercial support (still) and when I hired her last year, it was as a 
commercial manager.  Your boy Brad McSherry didn't fix her class, even though 
this was a problem at mid year as well.   Of course he told me it had been 
taken care of, but Hunter Shively showed up in my office last week to go over 
her history, and what my intent was when i hired her.  he too was involved in 
the hiring decision.

Shall i do brad's termination, or will you.

Jeff:
I believe you are aware the MetGas project has been suspended indefinitely, 
primarily due to the negative impact and uncertainty caused by the problems 
Dabhol Power is currently experiencing.  Enron  has suspended work to close 
project financing and we have significantly reduced the MetGas staff.  The 
Team will focus on completing the acquisition of all major permits and 
clearances over the next few weeks.  The go forward plan is to either package 
MetGas "as is" and sell it off or use it as leverage in the negotiation of 
the DPC workout with the Indian government.  

I will be relocating from India back to Houston  in the near future.  In 
anticipation of this relocation I am exploring possible job opportunities 
within the Enron family of companies.  

I believe I can add value to your team's efforts in developing the LNG 
projects in both Venezuela and the Bahamas.  I have experience related to 
both projects and I can hit the ground running.   In addition, I bring prior 
ECT experience and success as a deal maker / originator, extensive experience 
in LNG including the development of production facilities, regasification and 
related harbour facilities and experience negotiating LNG Sale & Purchase 
Agreements as both a buyer or seller. Coupled to this experience is my 
knowledge of what it takes to structure assets and the pertinent commercial 
documents such that the asset can be project financed.  I am confident I can 
be of help and add value to your Western hemisphere LNG Team.

I would appreciate you taking the time to review my resume and keeping me in 
mind when looking to fill any current or future positions. 

Thanks...

  

Let's get together on this in the next couple of days.  Thanks.  Jeff

Jeff,

We are reviewing the P+ spread option book.    One item of note is that the 
correlations used to book the spread options have dropped significantly from 
what was being used a year ago (see charts below).   I also remember that 
John Mee was using even higher correlations when he ran this book.  In fact 
he wanted to book options with a correlation of 1.0, but our model would not 
allow it, so he was using 0.999.

We are currently calculating historical correlations for you as well.   If 
you want, Vince and I can review this with you at the end of the day.   Just

SUMMARY

Atlantic

Over the last week we have really seen the consequences of the wet and warm 
winter in Europe with a total of some 1.7 million
tonnes being offered to us on the resell for delivery over the next couple of 
months. As a consequence spot/Q2 prices are now
trading at $2 discount to replacement from South Africa ($40.75 FOB ARA 
versus $42.75 replacement) - a concept which many are
struggling to get their head round. The Lion's share of the resell mkt is 
South African which makes sense as the strong U.S. mkt has 
taken what little slack there has been in the South American pipeline. In 
truth, while the U.S. mkt has been steaming, only very limited 
incremental tonnage from SAM has made it into the U.S. as the Utilities only 
pay up for spot spot material. If the steep backwardisation
in the U.S. rolls forward there may remain opportunities to bury spot SAM 
cargoes at high levels but one thing is for sure is that the
strong U.S domestic market will keep U.S. exports into Europe very low. 

Pacific

Very few Australian cargoes have found their way to the fair shores of Europe 
over the last few months and this has been a function of 
the strong Pacific market at the back end of 2000 and indeed in part due to 
the consolidation which has been going on, the latest 
development to be Rio Tinto's acquirement of Peabody's asset's in Oz. We are 
currently entering the period of negotiations between Oz 
producers and the JSM's for pricing of their long-term contracts. It is not a 
secret that the producer's plan to go for broke and are looking to 
lock in prices above $30 FOB Newcastle - currently wud call the mkt $28.50. 
JSM's are apparently holding tight citing world economic 
slowdown.  At $28 the oz producer is making some $13 a tonne, the chinese are 
due to export a further 6 million mt this year and steel 
production is forecast to be down some 10% year on year - while we may see 
some activity at higher prices in the short-term I think it 
will be difficult for the producers to realise the numbers which they are 
talking longer term. China is also talking prices of $30 which is
$3/4 higher than last year but have some $3 frt advantage versus Newcastle.

Gameplan

We are currently a total of 2.4 million mt short ARA (1 million API2 / 1.4 
million SECA) with the bulk being in back end of this year. We will
continue to sell the front end aggressively in the belief that the mkt has 
some further downside from where we are today - the mkt has merely 
sold off on rumour thus far but when these cargoes actually start arriving 
unsold into Europe there shud be some additional pressure on prices
if the stock situation does not improve in ARA - currently a 13 day lineup in 
Rotterdam. There are reports of Siberian type weather heading our
way which cud increase burn temporarily but I donot think this will have a 
significant impact. We are busy looking for any opportunity to sell
out of our South African long as Glencore tries to prop the mkt up and will 
then look to buy back our physical shorts into Europe from the
Armada of coal which is due to arrive. Psychology shud create downward 
pressure along the whole forward curve and we will be looking to 
buy in some our deferred short sub $30 RBCT equivalent. Meanwhile we are 
working to sell 3-5 year agreements with several utilities while
the mkt loiters in the higher regions of the historical range. We are also 
talking with several producers about securing longer term contracts 
which will give us a good supply base to work from going forward. In the 
Pacific we will look for an opportunity to cover our CLP short on the 
nearby but will look to the fundamentals to do their work bfor covering 
anything further forward.

the consolidation which has been going on, the latest 
development to be Rio Tinto's acquirement of Peabody's asset's in Oz. We are 
currently entering the period of negotiations between Oz 
producers and the JSM's for pricing of their long-term contracts. It is not a 
secret that the producer's plan to go for broke and are looking to 
lock in prices above $30 FOB Newcastle - currently wud call the mkt $28.50. 
JSM's are apparently holding tight citing world economic 
slowdown.  At $28 the oz producer is making some $13 a tonne, the chinese are 
due to export a further 6 million mt this year and steel 
production is forecast to be down some 10% year on year - while we may see 
some activity at higher prices in the short-term I think it 
will be difficult for the producers to realise the numbers which they are 
talking longer term. China is also talking prices of $30 which is
$3/4 higher than last year but have some $3 frt advantage versus Newcastle.

Gameplan

We are currently a total of 2.4 million mt short ARA (1 million API2 / 1.4 
million SECA) with the bulk being in back end of this year. We will
continue to sell the front end aggressively in the belief that the mkt has 
some further downside from where we are today - the mkt has merely 
sold off on rumour thus far but when these cargoes actually start arriving 
unsold into Europe there shud be some additional pressure on prices
if the stock situation does not improve in ARA - currently a 13 day lineup in 
Rotterdam. There are reports of Siberian type weather heading our
way which cud increase burn temporarily but I donot think this will have a 
significant impact. We are busy looking for any opportunity to sell
out of our South African long as Glencore tries to prop the mkt up and will 
then look to buy back our physical shorts into Europe from the
Armada of coal which is due to arrive. Psychology shud create downward 
pressure along the whole forward curve and we will be looking to 
buy in some our deferred short sub $30 RBCT equivalent. Meanwhile we are 
working to sell 3-5 year agreements with several utilities while
the mkt loiters in the higher regions of the historical range. We are also 
talking with several producers about securing longer term contracts 
which will give us a good supply base to work from going forward. In the 
Pacific we will look for an opportunity to cover our CLP short on the 
nearby but will look to the fundamentals to do their work bfor covering 
anything further forward.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 04/2001

Highlight

Cape market continues to fall but probably too fast and too early by most 
players  Asia will be back from holiday Monday and market is expecting rates 
to stabilise by end of next week.  We are currently evaluating taking another 
cape on short period or fixing a COA with a distressed owner for our Q2 
cargoes out of RBCT or Colombia or both.  The average earnings for a cape has 
fallen from a high of $25,000 in November to $18,500 today.  Pierre is in 
Japan next week and should get a good feel as to what the Japanese steel 
mills are up to and what kind of opportunities are out there for us to 
concentrate on.   

Panamaxes as anticipated are very difficult to read with close to zero Far 
East biz. Atlantic very short term has slight imbalance of tonnage but backed 
by very good USDA corn sales yesterday, the grain will start to role by end 
Feb. Paper rates have remained stagnant again lacking real physical input, 
nearbys marginally easier forwards flat neglected. Strategy will either be to 
bear spread where nearby premiums are good or bide our time and buy Q2 dips 
or calls.

The story out of Bocimar this week is that they view this year as being 
definitely weaker than last year and that they feel it should average around 
$15,000 to $17,000 for the year ( which is still a good market for shipping ) 
and at those levels, they are happy to sit back and watch.   Furthermore, 
last week CMB ( parent company of Bocimar ) released their earnings for cal 
00.  Their Dry bulk division made 60 million Euro and their tanker division 
made 60 million as well.  These are very good numbers for their dry bulk 
division taking into account the incredible rise in bunkers last year ( cost 
of fuelling the ships ) and the fact that their ships were often at anchor 
and not generating revenues.

On the funny side of things, Coeclerici is having their yearly audit by 
Arthur Anderson and AA has discovered that although Coeclerici makes money 
trading FFA's, they lack proper daily position reports and models to value 
options.  As a result, I got a call from Koert ( head shipping at Coaclerici 
) asking for our assistance as AA had mentioned to them that they should talk 
to us about our systems and procedures.  Being that Coeclerici is our biggest 
counterpart, we jumped on the opportunity to assist and Andy James is being 
sent to genoa Tuesday for a one day tutorial about risk controls and 
procedures while trying at the same time to better understand how Coeclerici 
values deals, which needless to say should help us in the future when 
negotiating with them.

FYI, attached is a very complete 4-page summary of the Dabhol situation.  No 
action needed on your part---information only
Daniel R Rogers
01/17/2001 04:24 PM
Wade, Bill & Neil,

Attached please find a summary compilation of the various issues and 
discussions that occured on the Dabhol project status update call that was 
presented to the LNG vessel interests.  I initially put this together as a 
way of organizing my notes, as well as communicating the latest status to 
Mark Haedicke and Alan Aronowitz in EWS/EGM Legal, who have asked to be kept 
advised of developments affecting the LNG contracts.  However, in discussions 
during this morning's Dabhol project lawyers' call, the issue was raised 
whether any written record of the discussions would be sent on to the 
shiplenders or the Greenfield sponsors.   I offered to make this summary 
available to the group if it would be of any assistance, my offer was 
promptly accepted, and that's why you see all the "cc" names in the address 
line above.
  
Of course, this summary is derived from my notes and somewhat contemporaneous 
recollections of the call, and as such I'm quite open to any suggested 
revisions to ensure the record is set as straight as possible.

Kind regards,
Dan

Dear Carrie,

first of all thanks for your patience and support ! 

Mark was "worldclass" ! After the meeting we collected feedback, where we
asked the participants for the presentations which exceeded the
expectations....and "Enron" was clearly number one !

So it was the subject itself, but also Mark as a speaker ! Your choice was
absolutely to the "point" !

Our company has agressive goals in terms of revenue growth...and all these
guys, who were in this room have somehow to do with it.
I think the Enron case just opened up a field of ideas and thinking to break
with our traditional business frame.

So it was exactly the right time.

Again, I can only say thank you for a great presentation and a great speaker
!

Please let Mark know, how well he did !

best regards

Rudi

Rudolf - I hope the Dow Chemical Operations Leadership Conference went
well.   Thank you for inviting Enron as a guest speaker.  Please let me
know if the presentation and Mark Palmer met your audience expectations.

Thank you for your feedback.

Tom Byargeon, Kevin Miller and Ken Loch in ENA are working with producers in 
the US involved in deep water offshore Louisiana/Texas oil and gas drilling 
projects. This financing activity was primarily started to help ENA secure 
long term well head and pipeline natural gas supplies to supplement the gas 
trading desk activities. Just like what happened in Enron's initial VPP 
program they are find more interest in oil drilling projects rather than 
natural gas projects. 

They are currently working on a bid (due 1/31) for the Medusa project which 
involves Murphy (operator), Agip and Callon in Mississippi Canyon Blocks #538 
and #582. The initial reservoir reports estimate reserves of 80-120 million 
barrels of sour crude and they estimate initial production to be 40,000 bpd 
starting in 1Q 2003. Quality is estimated to be a Mars type crude with 25-27 
API Gravity and 1.5-2.0% sulfur. Plans are to build a private pipeline to 
Equilon's West Delta #143 platform and then bring the oil onshore. Peggy is 
finding out where WD #143 pumps to onshore.

Tom's group would like to know if we have any interesting in buying the crude 
on either a fixed or floating basis. The floating could be tied to a Platt's 
index or the NYMEX. It is far too early to expect Murphy to enter into a 
physical or financial contract, but Tom hopes to get us first and/or last 
look from Murphy when the time is right. Another alternative is to give 
Murphy barrels at their 95,000 bpd Meraux, Louisiana refinery in exchange for 
the new production barrels. 

Could someone in your group please give me a notional non binding basis 
differential for this quality of crude for Cal 2003?

following up on our discussion yesterday; for these types of deals, i dont 
think its necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty's 
authorization to enter into the agreement.  these are short term transactions 
and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because 
competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements.

the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does 
a derivative deal with an open-ended downside, loses $50 million, and then 
claims that it was not a valid contract.  in our case, they are only 
hedging.  we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known 
up front.  therefore they will not attempt to make this claim.  even if they 
did, our risk is limited to the premium , not some big payout.

the risk of losing business is far greater than the risk of a counterparty 
trying to get their premium back.  seems like a 5 second decision to me.

is it possible to combine the standard isda and our confirm into a single 
long form?  by going away from the standard isda maybe we can eliminate these 
requirements because the payout liability is only 1-way.

Yikes!  That girl's mother sounds like a real problem.  I'm not sure how I 
would have handled it.  How's school going?  Any plans for the weekend?

	Alma Martinez@ENRON
	01/26/2001 11:36 AM
		
What happened?  

Here's a story...as I was waiting at the bus stop (7:35am) to go to school, a 
lady approached me and asked if I'd make sure her daughter got on a certain 
bus.  The mother was running late for work and could not wait.  I couldn't 
say no...so Nicki (the little girl-10 yrs. old) and I waited for the bus.  It 
was now, 8:15 and there was no sign of her bus.  

On top of  things, I had quiz at 8am.  Which I then realized I missed.  I 
decided that Nicki would just have to wait on her own.  I asked her if she 
had any relatives that  would want to know of her whereabouts.  I called her 
grandmother and explained things to her.  Pretty strange...aye. 

A bus that runs through UofH arrived and I almost got on without her, but I 
couldn't do it.  Finally, I told the little girl that she would have to 
accompany me to school (8:30am).  There were only 15 minutes left of class.  
I stayed for the remainder of the lecture. After class we went back to bus 
stop and within minutes her bus arrived.  I told the bus driver where to drop 
her off.  I notified her grandmother with the time of the departure.  And I 
was relieved when Nicki called to let me know she was home safe.

Please send the memo to the EGM business heads as well.  
Thanks.  Jeff

All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  

Thank you,

Dear Mr. Shankman,
     I obtained your name from the Penn Alum Network.  Sorry if this email is 
a bit long.  I came across a listing for a position with Enron in NY and am 
highly interested in applying for it. But, I would like to ask your advice 
regarding the approach I should take.
     When I was an undergraduate at Penn (Wharton & CAS), I started my own 
fertilizer trading company.  With zero capital and zero contacts in the 
industry, I built up a company with $ 15 mil in revenues and clients all over 
the world.  I personally developed relationships with clients like ConAgra, 
Transammonia, Mitsui and numerous others in Latin America and Europe.  
     Six years ago, outside factors forced me to join my family business, 
which is in the entertainment industry.  Now, I am at a point where I can, 
and want, to return to what I originally did.  The Enron position describes 
the exact objectives I faced in developing my own company - selling to large 
commercial and industrial customers.  That is exactly what I did and did 
well.  But, I am afraid that if I send my resume to the Human Resource dept.  
they will overlook my early experience and will be confused why a Broadway 
producer is applying for the job.
     Do you happen to have any suggestions ?  Perhaps you might know someone 
in the New York office that I can meet with.  I am very interested in working 
for Enron and know that I posses the right skills.  I would greatly 
appreciate your advice.
Thank you,
Rina Kirshner

apps is over!!!  In any event, I would like to take as active a role as

Thanks for the update on the sell weekend.  It certainly sounds like there 
were positives and negatives.  Going forward, I would like the commercial 
team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends, and similar 
recruiting functions.  I did not get Skilling to agree to a $1,000,000 
contribution to Wharton/Penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless 
weekend.  We all agree to the strategic importance of Univ of Penn, and we 
are not going to blow it, or appear to blow it.  I would like the Recruiting 
function and Commercial function to coordinate all logistics, etc., however, 
given this was one of the worst sell weekends I have seen Enron put together, 
we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be 
accountable for specific parts of the weekend.  If anyone was hanging out in 
their hotel rooms, we were not doing our jobs, and I will take all 
responsibility going forward. 

I appreciate everyone's support and cooperation.

Things are good.  I was suppose to go out with you and Lara Liebman a couple 
weeks ago but I had to go see my mother in law in the hospital.

Jeff, I tried to contact Jennifer Burn regarding Mark Fievert's availability
for April 27th and May 11th and I understand that she is out of the office .
I am meeting with Pedro Reinhard on monday around the planning for your trip
to midland and it would be good to know if Mark is joining you on the trip.
Thanks.

Something else you may consider as a topic for our April/May meeting:  have
you guys looked at outsourcing your entire energy needs (gas and power in
particular).  We have been very successful in helping customers save quite
a bit of money on their energy expense, and as you see in today's power and
gas markets, that can be extremely valuable...

Best,

Thanks for the update on the sell weekend.  It certainly sounds like there 
were positives and negatives.  Going forward, I would like the commercial 
team under my direction to plan all future sell weekends, and similar 
recruiting functions.  I did not get Skilling to agree to a $1,000,000 
contribution to Wharton/Penn for us to not have a perfectly seamless 
weekend.  We all agree to the strategic importance of Univ of Penn, and we 
are not going to blow it, or appear to blow it.  I would like the Recruiting 
function and Commercial function to coordinate all logistics, etc., however, 
given this was one of the worst sell weekends I have seen Enron put together, 
we all need to get together and come up with specific plans on who will be 
accountable for specific parts of the weekend.  If anyone was hanging out in 
their hotel rooms, we were not doing our jobs, and I will take all 
responsibility going forward. 

I appreciate everyone's support and cooperation.

Jeff,
Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always recommend
buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
have fun in London.

PS  has Doug Rottenburg been calling anyone over there?  We haven't heard a 
sound from him.....

i do not manage an eol stack.

The connection to EOL or other web applications will be as fast as it is now, 
as this is solely dependent on your network hardware (cables, network card, 
etc.)  The mgiration to Windows 2000 will not impact this in any way.  One 
thing I need to verify though, do you use Stack Manager with EOL?  I did not 
see any instances of it on your machine, but I just want to double-check, as 
this program will not work under Windows 2000.

Thanks

-Mike

i'm ready to go.  however, will this new system give a slower connect to eol, 
etc?

Jeff:

 During my assessment of your machine, I noted your current hardware 
configuration:
SP750 with Dual 800Mhz PIII processors
512MB RAM
Matrox Quad video card

We currently do not have hardware in stock that matches these 
specifications.  Our current practice is to prepare a machine that is like or 
better than the machine the customer has currently, then swap that hardware.  
The benefits here are minimal downtime and the ability to switch back to the 
old machine quickly if an application does not work correctly in Windows 
2000.  Because we do not have a machine of equal or greater speed in stock, 
here is what I propose:

Every machine we migrate is Ghosted.  By this, I mean we run a program called 
Ghost which takes a snapshot of the machine in its current state.  This image 
can then be put back on the machine or accessed to retrieve files or other 
data.  I propose we Ghost your existing machine, make a backup copy of that 
image (after verifying it works correctly), then re-use your current hardware 
with Windows 2000.  The risk here is that we cannot go back to Windows NT 
(your current system) as quickly if something does not work.  

If you would like to move ahead with this plan, please let me know.  
Otherwise, we will order a machine with the same specifications, but it will 
take some time to get here.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Guys

There has been tremendous interest expressed already by generators, 
developers, and utilities to just about every coal producer about locating 
plants at mines. Some are moving forward. The most advanced appear to be 
Peabody (into TVA in western KY) EnviroPower (permitting three sites in Ky 
and Indiana) and Anker (permitting a site in W.Va). All sites are near 
transmission.

We can help locating sites , reserves and producers near transmission if we 
knew where the power needs are.

Word from Israel is that the alert has been downgraded for the time being.

I'll call you if I can make it.  

Absolutely OK to send me a resume on any good person.  Also thanks for the 
update on the new car.  My dilemma is that I need a bigger car to carry 
anything, as you know the porsche isn't the most conducive car for such 
activity.  I'll probably be in before early 2002, as such.  
Best regards,

Jeff

Jeff,
I trust all is well with you at the office. 

New Range Rover - I want to relay that I am privately informed Ford wish to 
accelerate
the U.S launch of the new car. The UK launch is Sept. this year so reasonably 
may mean arrival here early 2002. Believing this to be accurate, this may 
relieve you of making any decision on Range Rover right now.

Given your continuous search for "good people" and assuming your firm remains 
on the look-out for such people, I wish your permission to submit a resume of 
a colleague.
This lady has excellent work-ethics, is an outstanding achiever with high 
energy and I believe, the suited attributes for the culture within Enron. 
I would hope this could be reviewed and sent onward to the relevant people 
who would invite her for an initial meeting in the near future. Please advise 
this is okay.

NOTICE:  CABC reports contain sensitive information and are not for general 
distribution

The Saudi oil minister is now saying that if Iraqi export volumes do not 
return to normal (as assumed in the recent OPEC production cut), OPEC might 
actually increase output at the March meeting.    This seems to reflect fresh 
doubts about Iraq's speedy return to the market.

Despite reports that loadings are resuming at Ceyhan, our sources believe 
that Iraqi export volumes are likely to remain below normal levels.  These 
sources assess that Iraq is continuing to insist on the surcharges.  Some 
companies will steer clear of any Iraqi oil; others will try to find a way to 
resume exports without being accused of paying a surcharge.  In any case, it 
will be difficult for Iraq to ramp up to 2 mb/d by Feb 1 as projected by a 
SOMO official at the OPEC meeting last week.

Bayoil has reportedly signalled that Iraqi exports are likely to resume 
normal levels by the end of the month.  However, sources advise that Bayoil 
is considered to be an unconventional player compared to the traditional 
major lifters of Iraqi crude, and it is an especially aggressive buyer of 
Iraqi oil.  It may be willing to do business with Iraq sooner than the more 
established players.  Therefore, it might be incorrect to assume that firms 
are ramping up Iraqi liftings across the board based solely on indications 
from Bayoil.

Iraq averaged around 600,000 b/d in December.  According to news reports, 13 
mb of Basra Light and 4 mb of Kirkuk have been exported so far in January.

the US on an L1 intracompany visa under the Blanklet L for Enron.  

Can you please let me have an email address for him so that I can send him 
the required visa questionnaire to begin the process.

Many thanks

Are the amounts below you've outlined (in tons) significant in this market, 
and in their local markets?  Jeff

INDONESIAN COFFEE- STRONG BEARISH- FUNDS LACKING FOR RETENTION

The Finance Minister, Prijadi Praptosuhardjo IS saying that the government 
has no
money to finance the retention plan.

According to a source close to AEKI, the government has not contacted the
association at all. Another possible sore point is the interest rates
charged by the banks for coffee retention. So far there has been no
indication that favorable interest rates will be extended to AEKI. Some are
concerned that the rate will be higher than that charged by the private
banks. Due to the tension which exists on these issues, AEKI has threatened
the government that if the money is not chanelled before April they will
release 10,500 tons of coffee in their retained stock from the warehouses in
Lampung and Medan.

There are people who believe that 10,500 tons is "just the tip of the
iceberg." There is more than 7,500 tons in stock in Lampung alone, according
to an important domestic farmer in Lampung,  who is close to our source. In
fact the farmer estimates that Lampung itself has more than 10,000 tons and
there are another 4,000 to 5,000 tons in Medan.

VIETNAM COFFEE- STRONG BEARISH- VIETNAMESE DUMPING "PHANTOM STOCKS" IN 
NEIGHBORING MARKETS

Our primary source comments that in his opinion, it may be true that there
are additional stocks over the 150,000 tons as reported. Cambodia has been
used as a dumping ground for Vietnam's extra quota sales.

Upon investigation, our source learned that it is true that there are some
excess stocks stored in Vietnam. He was informed by a source that the
Vietnamese plan to release the stocks into Cambodia and also China to sponge
up the excess supplies. They command a fixed price in the black markets of
those countries and provide much needed foreign exchange to the Vietnam
government. The secondary source said that this is common practice for
Vietnam and they have done this for other cash commodities like Cashewnuts.
The source does not know the exact figures, but estimates the excess to be
30,000 to 40,000 tons more than what has been acknowledged by the
government.

Cool.  They sell their music CD's at the front desk.  They may even have two 
out.  Would you mind picking them up for me?  I'll pay you back, I promise.  
If you have time, check out the gym/pool/message in the basement of the 
hotel--it's great.  Also try to get a room overlooking the interior 
courtyard, and don't change money at the hotel--they'll bend you as only the 
french can. 
Have a great time.....and definitely hang out in the lounge of the hotel.
Jeff.

PS, would you mind swinging over to the Hermes and pick me up a 
briefcase?--they're about $5,000 or so.  Great, thanks.

Hi Jeff-
Hope things are well with you.  Classes started here this week and I'm
still getting my schedule straigtened out.  Fortunately, I got into the
Speculative Markets course.  However, I still need to choose a second
finance class.

I have until friday at 3 PM EST to choose between FIXED INCOME (dealing
primarily with bond replication, fairly quantitative) and FUNDING
INVESTMENTS (a broad examination of how firms finance investment with
corporate securities).

Which of the two do you think would help me out the most at Enron Global
Markets?  Sorry for the short notice, but I just won the course permit
tonight!

Thanks,
Matthew

program in order to get a salary increase, but I'd also like to discuss the 
possibility of signing a contract.  I don't know if the trading track program 
is right for me since I'm already working on a  book right now and would not 
be rotating through different areas.  Please let me know when you might have 
some time to talk about this.  Thanks.

Good Morning,
Thank you very much for your reply on my questions regarding the rest of the 
winter season in Europe, 
it is very useful information for us to get a commentary from professionals.

It would be good to get such an extensive report from time to time, or 
whenever a major change in the weather pattern take place.
On a day to day basis, is it possible to get a short comment on your opinions 
on the weather situation in Europe.

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
Frank Lien
Enron Europe Weather Desk
Phone +47 23 10 25 62

   

Frank,

Here is an outline of what Mike, Jose and I put together today concerning the 
remainder of the winter across Europe:

The Bottom Line:

Much of the continent should feature temperatures, on average, cooler than 
the past few months.  Overall temperatures should be normal to below normal 
in the February and March timeframe.  An active sub-tropical jetstream will 
continue to provide a wet pattern near the Mediterranean keeping temperatures 
on the below side of normal.  Western Europe will also see the best chances 
for colder weather intrusions as the NAO trends positive.  Even with this 
cooler trend across Europe, there are no signs that the Arctic Pool of air in 
Siberia will move westward toward eastern Europe.  Overall no extreme 
deviations from normal are expected, only a slight trend toward cooler than 
normal.

Let me Know if there is more we can do:

Could you also include the following to all presenters: 

Also, as part of your presentations, Mike and I would like each of you to

should be.

No, I don't have that CD.  Can I crank it up so loud in my house, and piss 
off the neighbors?  I was out til about 11:30 last night.  (another two shift 
evening).  I'm pretty close  to the point where I can't drink after 10 ish on 
a school night.  Then, my neighbors house alarm went off for over 1/2 hour at 
2:30.  Of course i called the police.  So i didn't wag my butt out of bed til 
7:30.  
So first party may be feb 24.  any thoughts?
I'd forward an email that has gone around a few times about your dad's girly 
friend, only then letting her know she's invited.  maybe tell her the wrong 
time.

When are you off to san fran?  I have a wallet i'm trying to have made out

you.  I love it.  Beth called, and I am going to get the Palm.  She wanted me 
to get the Blackberry, which is the new awesome one, but of course it doesn't 
work on the Enron system.  
my dad just called and yelled at me again that he wants his bitch invited to 
my sister's shower.  he swore that she would not go, so the whole thing is so 
stupid.  I am out of invites.  can I send her an email about it?  this is the 
last thing that I have time to worry about.  

what is going on with you?  I am sure that you have another crazy day.  write 
back when you can!

Thanks for the updates.  They are great.  I have a question about 
confirmation process.  How many votes in the Senate are needed to confirm.  
The Dems are saying they may try to indefinitely delay hearings on Ashcroft.  
How so?

Thanks for participating in the first Traders' Roundtable.  If you have not 
read "When Genius Failed" by Roger Lowenstein about the rise and fall of Long 
Term Capital, I have copies--swing by and Jennifer will get you one.  It is a 
great read.  

You will get a memo this week about the next meeting.  

Jeff

P.S.  Phillip, no bid for the PAllen house.

No you may not.......

   

can i email you something that's a total HR violation?  you'll laugh . . .

Yes, we will ASSIST.

   

Before I call Don, I just want to confirm with you that your understanding is 
that we will assist EES in putting their publications on their own site.  In 
other words, Don would need to appoint his own people - an IT person to build 
the site (which we can assist with) and someone to research all their 
publications to see whether they're available electronically.  The EES Marcom 
group sent me 33 publications which they subscribe to and before I call Don 
to tell him he needs an EES person to take care of these, I want to make sure 
you and I have the same understanding.  We briefly talked about this before, 
but I want to be certain.  Thanks.

The Agenda from our meeting with Andy on Nov 7.

Doug
All-

Pursuant to our meeting yesterday, regarding the captioned matter, I have 
prepared a brief summary of the general issues, which are likely to be of 
interest to EOL and may be discussed in the meeting today with Andy Zipper.

Please feel free to add any points that you deem appropriate.

1.  The Links:

A link from Envera's site to EOL will be created.  The link would only be to 
the home page of EOL.   There would be no effect upon normal EOL vetting 
procedures for counterparties.

A link from Envera's site to Deal Bench will be created.  Again the link 
would only be to the home page of Deal Bench.  The Envera member companies 
would be required to follow normal Deal Bench registration of participants, 
however, such parties during 1Q 2000, would be permitted to engage in two 
free transactions on Deal Bench, with a maximum of 25 such free transactions 
in total. Presently, it is still under consideration as to whether such 
access would be to the auction area, or the collaboration area, or some 
variation thereof.  The fees to be charged post 1Q 2000 are under 
consideration.

2.  Trades

On a case-by-case basis, with no preexisting commitment, EGM would consider 
requests from Envera customers to make trades on a contingent basis on EOL.  
In the event that such trade is considered promising, then such pricing would 
be posted on EOL.  This would be free for the first 12 months, but thereafter 
such service would be provided for a fee.

3.  Envera Membership and Enron Services as Consideration for Envera Equity

EGM would pay between $300-500k for the ability to utilize the Envera hub to 
do deals for the period of [one year].

Some portion of the fee may also be considered as payment for equity in 
Envera LLC.  The Enron services provided (points 1. and 2. above, as well as 
access to Enron risk management and utility outsourcing ) will also be 
considered as payment for some portion of the Envera LLC equity.  The total 
equity received, is anticipated to be around five percent and the 
capitalization of the company is believed to be around $50,000,000.  The 
breakdown for the consideration for the equity still needs to be reviewed 
from the accounting side.

4.  Board Seat Considerations

Discussion regarding Enron obtaining an Envera Board seat has been 
discussed.  The fiduciary risks need to be considered, as we may be 
restricted in competing with Envera, unless certain steps are taken.  For 
example, if Commodity Logic were to be considered a competitor to Envera, 
unless we had the specific right to compete we could be subject to suit by 
Envera.  These risks may be negated through negotiation.  

The upside here would be the ability to have access to executives of certain 
petrochemical companies who are also shareholders in Envera and have Board 
seats.  It is believed that this type of access would likely lead to more 
deals for EGM and potentially for other Enron entities.

Unrelated to the Board seat, other promotional activities relating to Enron's 
services are foreseen through activities at Trade Shows and other networking 
venues.

5.  Building Connectivity Between Envera and Enron

It will be necessary to consider what activities, from the technical side, 
would be undertaken by Envera and what activities would be undertaken by 
Enron, to achieve the stated objectives, i.e. linking.

6.  Press Release

Envera is likely to want to make a public statement regarding this 
transaction with Enron.  The restrictions on the scope of such announcement 
must be considered.

I hope this is helpful.

With whom is this meeting?  I may be in London next week.  I'll keep you 
informed.

Jeff:

As Brian may have told you, I am now based in London.  I remain responsible 
for
all BNP Paribas commodity brokerage.

I am writing to inquire if Enron would be interested in comparing and 
discussing
its experience in commodity exchanges, electronic markets and related matters.
As you know, the exchange (IPE/NYMEX) business is on the verge of electronic
transformation, your views on this and associated issues would be invaluable 
to
us.  I have two objectives in mind for such a discussion.  Firstly, I wish to
insure that BNP Paribas continue to provide Enron with a useful service.
Secondly, perhaps there is potential of commercial collaboration in this area.
Please let me know if you would be interested in a meeting.

with best regards,

Jonathan Arginteanu

If the A/A program will pay, otherwise, get with my asst Jennifer, and she'll 
help you out with cost allocations.
I have your pitcher, and will bring it to the office.
I'll be happy to have you sit with some of the traders.  Any commodities in 
particular?
I'll try to go to dinner--I may end up with a conflict.

Jeff

Thanks again for hosting the BBQ on Saturday night.  Your house was Couple of 
things . . .

Where should we charge all of the expenses for the weekend?  Should we charge 
them to recruiting or to your cost center?  If we should charge your cost 
center, what is it?
I think that I left my glass pitcher at your house Saturday night - can I 
come pick it up one night this week?
A while back I mentioned to you that I wanted to spend a day with a gas or 
power trader to understand more about our trading business.  Could you help 
me set that up?  Also, are there any materials that I can look at in advance 
to help me get up to speed or understand what's going on?
Are you planning on going to the dinner Thursday night for the Tiger Teams?

closeness.  Do you want to be included on these daily updates?

01/15/2001 09:10 PM
As talks continued toward the Tuesday deadline markets have been focused on 
for the California electricity crisis, state officials around Governor Gray 
Davis have
  toughened up their rhetoric on a couple of fronts even as they confirmed 
they would be in the market as early as Tuesday taking bids for energy to be 
paid by the
  State of California. One problem on that front is still how much producers 
want to charge the state for electricity. As we reported last week, Davis and 
his aides
  want to pay around $50 to $55 dollars per megawatt hour and suppliers want 
about $75. Treasury Secretary Summers has suggested an auction as the best 
way to
  determine the price, but California officials are taking a less free market 
approach and still hope to set the price through negotiation over long-term 
contracts.

Our sources in Washington, Sacramento, and California are increasingly of the 
view that Governor Davis is positioning his government to establish long-term 
power contracts with the generators that could be passed through to the 
utilities following a bankruptcy in the near term.  This week's legislative 
activities
in Sacramento will create the vehicle to do so.   State credit backing 
purchases of power would obviate the need for super-priority borrowing to 
finance power 
purchases after utility bankruptcy.

1. Audit- Untangling Utility Relationships

California officials have also toughened their rhetoric on the debt repayment 
front as they say results from a preliminary audit show that 
half of the $9 to $12 billion  the utilities say they owe is actually owed to 
themselves for power they bought from their corporate relations

This strange situation is due to the fact that one holding company owns both 
the power-generating and power-distributing companies under a 
holding company umbrella. Of course, that means that some of the power PG&E 
and Southern California Edison bought at highly inflated prices 
was bought from themselves. 

  But it was not all bad news in the tense negotiations. Sources confirm that 
Davis increasingly understood that the state finance role was a crucial part 
of any 
potential solution. He told our sources this afternoon that he is willing to 
use state credit to eliminate the "risky debt" premium that PG&E 
and SCE are being charged by suppliers because of their shaky finances and 
that he is willing to extend the current 10% rate increase
 utility customers are paying far beyond the initial 90-day deadline. In 
return he is demanding that the companies prepare to "share the 
burden of debt reduction in return for state help and credit extension."

2. Debt Restructuring- Guarantees, but No Direct State Money

 Davis also told the videoconference that he believes the $12 billion in back 
debt owed by the utility companies can be cleared up
during a 90-day forbearance period (whether that period has been agreed to by 
all creditors is not something we are clear about right now). Davis' idea, as
he laid it out in the meeting, is to use the forbearance period to securitize 
the debts and sell them against the utilities' forward rate base or by 
establishing a
medium-term repayment plan backed by continued state guarantees. 

 In both cases the restructured debt would be resolved over a decade without 
direct use of taxpayer money as the utilities use their positive margins to
paydown their debt. One of the reasons Davis wants to stay close to the 
$50-$55 megawatt charge is that it maximizes the rate at which utilities can 
pay
down this debt. There is a strong chance that Davis will agree to use state 
guarantees to sweeten the pot at the end of these negotiations, but he remains
opposed to using direct state money. This frustrates both Clinton 
administration and utility creditors, but Davis has not yet shown much 
flexibility.

3. Eminent Domain/Reregulation

  Perhaps most frustrating to the Washington DC free market crowd at Treasury 
and the White House was the continued comfort Davis and his group of political
  advisers have with "non-market" solutions to the energy crisis. Although 
the Governor's aides actually believe the weapon is more a "way to force 
eventual
  agreement, than an actual solution," the talk returns frequently to these 
non-market mechanisms. "We have the ultimate weapon to enforce compliance by 
the
  Tuesday deadline. If we make no progress. If this thing looks like it will 
turn into a genuine crisis, then we will use our powers of condemnation and 
we will re-take
  the plants and equipment and run them ourselves," a close political aide to 
Davis said. "We will absorb the plants, the transmission lines and the 
reserved parking
  places of the executives. The legislature would agree in a second."

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 02/2001

Highlight

The cape market continues to slide ever southward with owners unable to 
repeat last done on rates obtained.  Richards bay to Rotterdam rates have 
fallen about $2 in 45 days ( key coal route )  and Brazil to China rates have 
fallen $3 in the same period ( key iron ore route ) which has owners running 
for cargo  coverage.  However charterers smell blood and are not willing to 
enter into freight contracts ( Edf trading and NCSC  are playing spot and so 
are we ).  Even the mighty Bocimar seems unable to turn the tide and are 
offering us cheap rates on the quiet as they keep playing their vessels spot 
and are  being run over.  The average cape rate has lost $ 4200 from its peak 
and hangs around $20,400 presently.  To get cargo contracts for the balance 
of the year an owner has to fix his vessel at around $16,000 to get 
charterers willing to agree.  The downward fall is the result of two 
concurrent market shifts 1- coal shipments into Europe have slowed 2- market 
is predicting that sometime in Q1 2001 , Japanese steel mills will cut back 
on production and reduce their raw material imports.  As a result, you have 
on one side, Japanese vessel owners panicking as they fear that their main 
account ( Japan ) will not need their vessels shortly and you have the 
European owners also worried as they are seeing their utilities postponing 
their coal requirements.  Furthermore, the holiday season in Asia is 
approaching and little activity is predicted for the next few weeks.

On the panamax front, the outlook is still very bleak as you now have about 
two new buildings being launched per week in a market which is currently well 
balanced.  In the spot market, the Atlantic is weak as the grain out of the 
US gulf is slow as the main rivers are frozen upstream and the vessels have 
little to load.  In the east the market is strong as there is a flurry of 
grain activity but in the paper market, February is already traded at a big 
discount to Jan as people predict a quick slowdown in the activity as Asia 
goes on holiday.

On the long term strucutred front, last week we agreed to charter a new cape 
building starting in late 2003 for 10 years with an option for an 11th, 12 
th, 13 th and 14 th year.  Furthermore, we have the option to buy the vessel 
after year 3 at a fixed agreed Japanese yen amount ( if currency goes our 
way, we buy the vessel dirt cheap !!!).  The counterparty in Mitsui, a big 
and financially strong Japanese company.  The deal is still subject a few 
details but we hope to be able to book this deal within the next 5 months 
when the ship building contract will be drawn up.

Also last week we had about 6 banks over a period of three days come to our 
office to discuss possible opportunities in the shipping world and to get 
them to trade on EOL.  Larry Lawyer and Simon Crowe organized the meetings 
and we expect a few of these leads to pay off sometime this year.

Hi Drew, hope the London digs are working out!  

I have a HR problem that we need to address immediately.  Today we let Britta 
Dinndahl go.  Her termination was a case study in how to screw up a 
termination.  She was let back onto the trading floor where she called and 
email people telling them about her termination.  I understand from Chris 
Mahoney that (neither Nigel nor) Yvonne Scoroer was ready to handle this 
today, even though they had been briefed many times about her upcoming 
termination.  It wasn't until early afternoon that I called Phillipe Bibi to 
tell him of her termination, when she was taken off system access.  

In addition Yvonne has had Erik Hansen's contract for over three weeks and 
has not produced paper for Erik to sign.  It was my hope to have him under 
contract before the bonus period.  Further Jen Fraser was trying to hire 
Andrew Hill as a new employee for the Fundamentals group in London, and on 
three occasions Yvonne told Jonny Palmer that she would get an offer letter 
to him "today".  It took three weeks.

Obviously these are extremely serious lapses, and I do not want Yvonne 
involved in any more Enron Global Markets.  Cindy and Shanna have done a 
heroic job for us in the U.S. and they have been extremely frustrated with 
their counterparts in London.

Thanks for addressing this issue.

Something else you may consider as a topic for our April/May meeting:  have 
you guys looked at outsourcing your entire energy needs (gas and power in 
particular).  We have been very successful in helping customers save quite a 
bit of money on their energy expense, and as you see in today's power and gas 
markets, that can be extremely valuable...

Mike and Jeff:

Every Wednesday, we have a team seminar where our group reviews topics of 
interest and relevance to our markets and our company. It is my goal to use 
these seminars as a learning and information exchange tool. The weekly topics 
range from instructional (basics of swaps and futures) to team-building 
exercises.  With this in mind, I was hoping that each of you could commit to 
a Wednesday seminar for 1 hour to review your careers at Enron and discuss 
what you did to become successful. The seminars are open to all analysts / 
associates in EGM/ ENA trading. I intend to ask each  EGM  business head to 
participate as well. I am hoping that your seminars will work as an informal 
mentoring exercise as providing guidance to our new people on how to have a 
successful career.

The seminars usually begin at 4 p.m. I hope each of you will participate. 
Please let me know your availability. There is no need to bring a 
presentation, as the meetings are very informal.

Thanks
Jen

Excellent work.  Thanks for the update.

Brazil=01,s Ministry of Agriculture (Embrapa) is expected to release an off=

The current dry weather impacts the 2001-2002 crop, not the 2000-2001 crop,=

which is largely harvested.  Crop receipts issued by cooperatives in Brazil=

are 11 percent greater than they were in 1999-2000.   Our top source in=20

market and that the focus should be on 2001-2002.

This is the crop that should be currently flowering in Brazil, but was=20

2001-2002 crop will run from April 2001 to November 2001 and will be export=

in the second half of 2001 and in the first half of 2002.  The Brazilian=20

44-46 million bags.  However, recent weather problems have caused a=20
significant downgrade of this forecast to between 33 and 40 million bags.

Other sources in contact with coffee growers in Brazil report the potential=

for even greater damage to the 2001-2002 crop, in the range of up to a 50=

long time no talk on lng shipping matters. during the xmas/new year period we 
discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to 
proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping. the 
best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co . they 
control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels. the lng shipping market is so 
inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under 
utilized. the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet 
at marginal cost plus small margin. this would enable us to ask them to give 
us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo : no capital outlay, no 
take or pay obligation, win /win situ as mosk would then make money (that s 
their incentive) out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships 
enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term 
comitment on the shipping front . 

mosk being japanese , in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax 
to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and 
myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details 
(at lower level in mosk the idea is known and accepted/tentative date already 
set last days of jan/early feb for the first meeting) . would you mind to 
send such a fax along the lines i propose herebelow asap  ?

 Dear Sir

Enron, through its newly formed Enron Global Market business unit, is 
targeting the LNG commodity and shipping markets as being key markets for the 
coming years mainly on account of their growth potential but as well because 
these markets are  ripe for a change in their very nature. 

MOSK , because of the sheer size of its LNG shipping fleet and Enron, because 
of its proven ability to make markets change, are uniquely positioned to team 
up and drive these changes rather than react to them.

Enron would like to explore with MOSK if and how both companies could 
cooperate in the lng field to achieve this.

Brad Hitch on the commodity front and Pierre Aury on the shipping front will 
be leading this efforts on the Enron side and you can expect to have them 
contacting you very shortly to start these discussions.

Randy- Emilio and I had a vigorous debate today over the content and 
conclusions of the CABC Group's analysis of the questions you asked about the 
political and regulatory situation in Venezuela.  He expressed a number of 
areas of concern, some pertaining to the tone of the paper and others to its 
accuracy.

I acknowledged his concerns and promised to do my best to improve the tone 
and clarify any inaccuracies.  We will revisit with our sources to clarify 
the following issues:

1. Will the new Hydrocarbons Law just address liquid hydrocarbons or will it 
address gas hydrocarbons?  What details are available on the proposed law?
2. If the new law does affect gas, will it in effect overturn the 1999 Gas 
Law?
3.  Will gas tariffs be separate for transportation, distribution, and 
upstream, or will there be a single unified tariff?  Is there a dispute 
between PDVSA and the  Ministry of Mines and Energy on how this should be 
handled?
4. What is the current royalty and tax structure on gas?  Will it be affected 
by the new HydroCarbons Law?
5. What are the current renegotiation dynamics of the Cristobal Colon project 
between the government and foreign operators?

Once we have revisited with sources, I told Emilio that we will be happy to 
correct any subsequent errors.  However, if we reconfirm the information in 
the paper then perhaps the three of us can confer on how to proceed.

This has been a difficult assignment because we are essentially dealing with 
areas that are subject to interpretation and forecasting.  Emilio and I 
disagreed in some areas about the Chavez agenda, while agreeing in others.  
Also, because the HydroCarbons Law has not yet been written, we can only go 
on what sources in country are saying.  Clearly, we have conflicting 
information and will work to clear up the contradictions ASAP.

I suggest we postpone our Thursday meeting until both Emilio and I have time 
to conduct further follow-ups.  As I have said to both you and Emilio, the 
CABC role here is not to take any position on the merits of the deal, but 
rather to answer the specific concerns brought up by RAC.  Hopefully, these 
next steps will resolve the situation in mutually satisfying manner.

long time no talk on lng shipping matters. during the xmas/new year period we 
discussed a lot with brad and have come up with some clear ideas on how to 
proceed to drive quickly a market change in the field of lng shipping. the 
best bet at this stage looks like mosk the big japanese shipping co . they 
control directly or indirectly 40 lng vessels. the lng shipping market is so 
inefficient that about 20 pct of that fleet is either iddle or under 
utilized. the idea is to team up with mosk to have access to their idle fleet 
at marginal cost plus small margin. this would enable us to ask them to give 
us a ship every time we can develop a spot lng cargo : no capital outlay, no 
take or pay obligation, win /win situ as mosk would then make money (that s 
their incentive) out of an iddle fleet and we would then gain access to ships 
enabling us to make money on lng spot cargoes without entering long term 
comitment on the shipping front . 

mosk being japanese , in order to jump start the entire thing we need a fax 
to be sent from high level in enron to high level in mosk prior brad and 
myself go and meet these guys in tokyo to discuss the idea in more details 
(at lower level in mosk the idea is known and accepted/tentative date already 
set last days of jan/early feb for the first meeting) . would you mind to 
send such a fax along the lines i propose herebelow asap  ? 

thanks in advance . any questions please feel free

 Dear Sir

Enron, through its newly formed Enron Global Market business unit, is 
targeting the LNG commodity and shipping markets as being key markets for the 
coming years mainly on account of their growth potential but as well because 
these markets are  ripe for a change in their very nature. 

MOSK , because of the sheer size of its LNG shipping fleet and Enron, because 
of its proven ability to make markets change, are uniquely positioned to team 
up and drive these changes rather than react to them.

Enron would like to explore with MOSK if and how both companies could 
cooperate in the lng field to achieve this.

Brad Hitch on the commodity front and Pierre Aury on the shipping front will 
be leading this efforts on the Enron side and you can expect to have them 
contacting you very shortly to start these discussions.

Yours faithfully

Can you please identify for me by return Email or phone (66474) the person on 
your staff to whom I can speak regarding the services your company provides 
for Enron customers?

I am putting together a short presentation on "Other Enron Services" for a 
conference our TECASO group is hosting to discuss/promote our planned on-line 
lender's engineer due diligence services amongst numerous major financial 
institutions in early February.  The purpose of this"Other Enron Services" 
agenda item is simply to take the opportunity to summarize the multitude of 
services offered by Enron for those in attendance who may not be familiar 
with some or all of these services.  Accordingly, I'm in the process of 
gathering information on the various services Enron has to offer and, in 
particular, slides/viewgraphs covering the services offered by your company 
which may already exist in order not to have to duplicate prior efforts. 

Thank you in advance for your attention to this request.

Ed Hlopak, Sr.

Jeff, we talked last week about Ozzie Pagan coming to the FPL meeting.  My 
thoughts are that the deals Ozzie are talking about it are great and could 
very well be a part of what we do with the LNG deal, but I doubt the meeting 
will get to that level of detail.  If we get the LNG deal and a possible gas 
transaction on to FPL's radar screen, then we will have accomplished alot.  
Having Ozzie there as Enron's Florida power project developer may be too 
distracting.  As part of the many follow-up  meetings we will hope to have 
with FPL, Ozzie can make his pitch to them.

If you concur, I'll let Ozzie know.

Thanks

A brief summary of stats from the month of December.  Volumes were off a bit 
from November, reflective of the seriousness with which members of the 
coal/shipping community take the holiday season - however, exponential growth 
from summer period continues.  This has exacerbated systems and back office 
problems we have been having for the past year, thus internal focus during Q1 
will be on this issue.

Please respond to Cheryl Blissitte <bliss@camh.org>
Dear Member of CAM Board of Trustees,

You may recall that several weeks ago we surveyed the Board members to 
determine preferences regarding Board meeting times. We did this because we 
have had several discussions with members who have great difficulty with the 
4 pm or 4:30 pm meeting time.

Since the Board appears to be fairly evenly split between a noon meeting time 
and a late afternoon meeting time (10 definitely prefer Noon; 10 definitely 
prefer late afternoon; and 20 have no strong preference), we have decided to 
try alternating the meetings.

Therefore, our next full board meeting, which is currently scheduled for 
Monday, January 22 at 4 pm, will instead take place Monday, January 22 at 
NOON (March meeting will take place at 4 pm).

Please note this change on your calendar and advise Cheryl Blissitte by 
email, phone (713.284.8253) or fax (713.284.8275), whether or not you will be 
attending. This is especially important as we will order sandwiches for this 
Noon meeting.

Thanks.

It's pretty neat.  I don't drive it in to work.  Parking is too expensive.

Here is the latest version of the presentation to banks.  I have incorporated 
the comments I have received so far (although I have deleted a bit on the 
shipping slide on the EGM portion because it was duplicative).  Because this 
needs to be printed/bound by early tomorrow morning, I would ask that all 
changes to this presentation be given to me by no later than 3:30 london 
time.  

The final presentation will have background graphics but i have removed them 
for now to enable easier emailing.

Thank you.

I reached Greg today and had a nice conversation. He encouraged me to call 
you.  

Having missed you today I wanted to make a few suggestions. 
With regard to your reservations about an investment in plant and equipment- 
I understand that any such investment would be: limited and subject to your 
being very attracted to the deal. I am confident that I can bring you deals 
that will sell themselves. 
-need to have an exit strategy that would allow an exit within 2-4years 

A trading strategy without investment in plant and equipment will yield 
attractive results. 

With regard to how that would look - I will draft a short business plan and 
send it to you next week basing it on a pure trading basis.  

Let me invite you and Greg to a breakfast (or any other meal) during the week 
of 16 Jan. That will give me a chance to get a few numbers in your hand 
prior. 

Regards for the New Year

meeting, Tuesday Jan at 1 pm. Cross Commodity products?

Please schedule a meeting about the Dhabol LNG contracts with the following

Thanks.  Jeff

I think Prebon is out of the business, largely.  Have you checked with John 
Nowlan regarding which brokers he would suggest?  I'm not sure PVM is the 
right broker for all of our crude needs.  What about United?

Thanks.

D & F Man (US Gas and US Power), GFI (global gas, power, coal and emissions),

would appreciate if you could give us the names of additional brokers we 
could talk to that are active in your products.

to initiate executions telephonically using website prices.  Enrons 
obligation to transact telephonically on website prices are good faith only.

they are trying to negotiate out of.

Word today is that the Saudis are committed to defending $25 OPEC basket/$28 
WTI.  They are likely to endorse a further reduction in the OPEC quota of up 
to 1 million b/d at the March meeting, if the data at that time supports such 
a move.

Jeff/Mike,

I understand there is some concern regarding the take-or-pay exposure under 
the LNG contracts between DPC and Oman LNG and Adgas. First, there is no 
direct Enron Corp exposure. Both contracts are between DPC and the related 
supplier. There are no Corp performance guarantees in either SPA. Attached is 
a memo sent to Jim Hughes last month outlining the contractural obligations 
and current discussions with the suppliers.

From a practical standpoint both suppliers will work with us to reschedule 
the start dates and to modify the fixed quantities. I  met with both 
suppliers before the holidays and they reconfirmed they will work with Enron 
as they understand the problems in India. We have delayed the contractural 
start date under  both contracts to the maximum extent possible: February 11, 
2002 for Oman and April 30, 2002 for Adgas. What this means contracturally is 
more than a year to work with the suppliers. Both suppliers expect an update 
on DPC when I return to the Middle East next week and both do not expect to 
discuss any contract matters until the situation in India is clearer. I will  
be in New Mexico through tomorrow if you want to discuss further. My phone 
number is 505/336-8400.

Clay

The V@R violation memo should state that the reason we had a violation was 
the additional trading positions relating to the EOL 24 hr. trading 
activity.  There is currently a memo requesting an additional $2mm of V@R on 
Greg Whalley's desk.  This addtional V@R will be temporary until there are 
Board approved limits for these trading positions.

I believe Greg W. is coming to talk to you today about this new business.  
Further to this, I'd like to ask again how I can get access to VAR  (I 
believe Lavorato and Sherriff have $5 million they each keep upstairs and 
allocate to their businesses as needed temporarily).  Is this a Board 
question, or do you have the authority to allocate this VAR to me?  

On another note, I've been helping Bill Bradford with PGE exposure issues.  
If you too need my help, let me know.

Thanks for your help...

Per conversation with Greg this morning, until we get board approval for new 
book with VAR have agreed to use discretionary VAR as required to negate VAR 
effects within global products. Position P/L will have to be reported within 
Global Products but we will pull it out as a separate line item at the bottom 
of the report. Positions at this time are not an issue but should it  become 
a concern between now and approval of a new book we will need to address it 
as we are the VAR with discretionary limits.  

yes me and mike.  thanks.

I was researching something on Eric and noticed that he is assigned to the

Sheriff which I think is incorrect. 

I have asked Kim to leave him on the expat payroll, but pointing 
organizationally to you and McConnell in EGM rather than Sheriff in EEL -- 
correct?

Very different hotels.  It is one of Paris' palace hotels right in the middle 
of of the city.  (near vendome and concorde area)  very central to all of 
paris.  costes is two minutes away, so both are great locations.  Big lobby, 
lots of gold, etc.  Great, but not as cool/hip as costes.

another note, Mike and I have discussed this $2 million issue with American 
Coal, and the interest rate hedge in the MPR.  Bottom line, we are not taking 
this hit.  It seems it was a problem with Treasury, so send it to them.  

Thanks. 

Jeff

sure.  is there anything specfic you'd like me to address.  what about a 
slide presentation--which I generally don't love, but we have some good ones 
around.

   
	
	

Jeff,

Below is the agenda for the meeting with Wells Fargo. 

I was hoping that you could participate during the introduction periods -- 
i.e. 10:00 am to 10:40 am (or longer if you have any interest) - would it be 
possible for you to follow Wells Fargo's introduction with a brief (15-20min) 
presentation/introduction explaining Enron Corp's and Enron Global Market's 
structure and "strategic vision".
You will see that I have slotted you in this time frame -- obviously, this 
conditional on your acceptance.

Please let me know if you are willing to participate in this way.

Thanks again,
George

What do you think of this:

As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering most of 
the markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross 
commodity education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and 
promote aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 9 at 4:00pm in room 3321.

As we begin our summer recruitment process, it is crucial that we continue to 
be aggressive in hiring all the best candidates.  As you know, Enron has 
committed over $1million during the next four years to University of 
Pennsylvania, and Wharton..  I want to make sure we don't limit ourselves in 
getting the Enron message out at Penn and Wharton by restriciting the number 
of summer employees.  I do not want to limit the number of people we hire for 
the summer.  In fact, I'd like to be as aggressive as possible.  I am 
operating under the notion that if we find 10 good people for which we have 
positions, we will offer all of them summer jobs.  I will not accept the 
notion of only 1 summer associate, and 1 or 2 summer ananlysts.

In addition, I'm concerned that the idea of giving associates $200 gift 
certificates is viewed as good one.  I'm not sure that is a good use of 
Enron's dollars, and would like to know what other events we are planning for 
the sell weekends.

Jeff

I met with Carlo (as did several other Enron employees) last week and we are 
talking to them about a number of ideas.  One of which is detailed below 
(from them) and has technology and paper/lubmer points.  I believe Carlo from

Jeff, thanks for agreeing to make the introduction with Philip and Ray. I
have attached below a summary of Buildscape(Driving to Liquidity) as well a
high level PowerPoint presentation on Buildscape.

As you are aware, we have had introductory meetings with Rob Scheuer from
the Industrial markets, Brandon Wax, John Pavetto and Rahil Jafry. There is
interest in Buildscape from the group and Rahil has offered a sweat equity
option. Rob advised that he would come back to us in the shortly on his
thoughts around a strategic relationship.

We see the possibility of a broader strategic opportunity combining
technology functionality from the Networks Division, risk and credit
management tools available through your market making initiatives, as well
using the Buildscape providing an efficient channel to market for Enron
products and services in the Building industry and the home. In order for
this opportunity to receive senior management attention and to talk through
the possibilities, we will contact Philip Bibi and Ray Bowen shortly as per
your recommendation.

Could you confirm back that you have passed on the information so that we
don't surprise either of them on the topic and we will aim to arrange a
meeting with them in Houston in the next couple of weeks. We may call on
your help to sponsor the meeting if required.

In the meantime, we will press on with confirming the Dow/Enron April 27th
meeting in midland to pursue Chemicals and Plastics opportunities and we
would be very pleased if Mark Fievert can attend as well. If we need to move
the date slightly to accommodate Mark, then lets talk through the options.
Thanks.

Janie,

Per our telephone conversation, I am attaching my resume for your review. As 
we discussed, I am seeking a permanent (Manager level) position where my 
finance and origination skills would be best leveraged.  I am very interested 
in a role in financing and/or orginating energy deals - wholesale or retail.  
If you or one of the groups interested in interviewing me require a 
reference, please contact my current supervisor, Rob Gay, or current and 
former colleagues Peter Anderson and Greg Blair, respectively. 

Thanks again for your help and advice.

Regards,
Tracee

Thanks for the update.  In the US we have a non conforming DASH  (Deas 
Approval SHeet) that has to be signed by either Mike or me regardless of 
commitment.  I'd like you, Brent and Alan to determine the best way to 
standardize US and Europe DASH processes.  Mike or I will sign all EGM 
business worldwide.  Thanks.

I am an Enron Europe lawyer dealing with Enron Global Markets business out of 
London. In Enron Europe we use what is known as a CACS form for approval of 
non-standard deals. I attach a copy of the current form together with an 
email from Mark Evans, General Counsel for Enron Europe. 

I wonder whether for EGM business you wd want to modify the CACS form; for 
example, under the standard European CACS if the deal involves a commitment 
of  GBP 3 million or more, either Michael Brown or John Sherriff needs to 
sign. It may be more appropriate for EGM deals for either of you to sign 
(unless you are happy to allow the European Office of the Chairman to sign) 
with a different (possibly USD denominated) threshold.

I would be grateful for your thoughts

Robert

 
Mark Evans
03/01/2001 15:13
The CACS form is becoming an ever more significant tool, not only to manage 
legal risk within Enron Europe, but also to enable our middle office 
departments to capture new transactions promptly and ensure adequate 
transactional information flow.
 
With this in mind, the CACS form has had further minor changes made to it and 
is to be found at: 

S:\legal\CACS form. 

Please ensure you use the form at this location at all times henceforth. Do 
not save it into your own directories, as further changes will be put through 
on this form only in future. No changes are to be made to this form please 
(in particular to the named signatories) without my agreement.

Please read the notes on the second page of the CACS form and then adhere to 
the process set out there. This is particularly important because many of the 
commercial teams are not reading these and then appear to be getting 
differing explanations of the process from us. Some of the support units in 
particular are unhappy that A1 is not being complied with, leaving them with 
inadequate time to review contracts. 

I am always happy to improve the form, especially if it simplifies, so 
suggestions are welcome.

Two things which will happen are: 

- adapted forms of the CACS will be produced for EES, Enron Global Markets 
and (until divested) Enron Wind. In the meantime if lawyers working on 
transactions within those divisions believe the proforma CACS needs to be 
changed to accomodate the needs of those divisions, please let me know. Mary 
Nell: I believe that EBS already has its own independent contract sign off 
process. Let me know if that is not correct.

- the CACS system will be automated - probably on the workflow system as per 
the new billing system. The idea is that at the earliest opportunity in the 
life of a contract, the CACS relating to that contract is put on the system 
which automatically alerts signatories that they should be looking out for 
drafts. Draft contracts will be able to be circulated through the system. The 
signing process will also be simplified.

Thanks for your attention.

Rick,

I was contacted by Petronas who requested a meeting
with Enron on risk  management. I have met with them
a few  years ago and they want to discuss with us 
their progress implementing risk management practices.

Can we arrange for them a standard presentation, like the one we have for 
banks
(you or David Port, Bill Bradford, research)?

Unfortunately, they gave us no choice as far as the timing is concerned
(given a very tight schedule). They want to visit on Thursday, Feb.  8,
at 10 a.m. I shall take them out to lunch after the meeting.

I shall also contact Jeff Shankman and John Nowlan
to arrange a short courtesy meeting with them.

I have had some discussions with Jonathan and recommended he takes the LNG

coming over (fully negotiated) so there is nothing to do on the HR side 
provided you are happy with the numbers.

sincerely appreciated your comments and support.
I hope your Holidays were safe, healthy, and happy.  Say when am I going to 
see that new home of yours?  You know it is hard to continue to live 
vicariously through you if I don't know what to picture!

I understand, however, each book you assign to a trader will have a line so 
you and I can follow the performance of each book/trader.  Ok if you want to 
take over arb books, but they (positions and p&l will be your responsibility 
and will be judged by performance--like any other book/trader) must be 
managed without the team approach of books prior.    The 1 million Var 
applies to the line next to Ross's name on the p&l sheets.  I don't know how 
many people trade that book, but I assume it is only ross.  If ross get's 
bulled up at every sign of snow in london, all the more reason to get a 
weather guy hired asap.  

Small positions, and taking profit frequently is the key to turning this boat 
around.  

Later,   Jeff

jeff - in the anticipation of moving to a global book I have had the back 
office set-up individual books for all of the
distillate traders.  I had asked the traders two weeks ago to clean-up the 
book as much as possible as we 
approached year end so that we could break-up the book easily in early 
january.  unfortunately, they have
not done this and I had instructed all of the london distillate traders 
(koller,o'brien,talvitie) today that if they 
wanted any positions they were to let me know by the cob today because I 
would be liquidating the book this 
week.  the only thing I insisted they take is the otc diff swaps that are 
traded for the physical bbls they are 
all assigned to trade.   in the case of ross these are large positions but 
the back office is making those changes
tonight and we can see what the var of those positions is tomorrow.   the 1 
million var limit for london distillates we
will need to calculate by the sum of their 3 positions.   in regards to the 
book presently under ross I will 
get that down to 1 mil var but ask that you give me weds and thurs to get 
this done.  I will try to get this all done
by tomorrow and had been reducing the positions today.  I would like to get a 
var for the global distillate
book and will assume for now that the 1 mil will be for the 3 london 
traders.   I will assume ownership
of all of those positions in the koller distillate book from now on so that 
these these guys, and ross specifically, 
can clear their heads and start over with as close as possible to a clean 
sheet of paper.  I made if very clear
to them that starting over was a question of rebuilding credability and they 
should take great efforts to ensure
that any positions they liked was put on at a low risk entry point and with 
small volumes.  to get some of the 
losses clawed back from friday though I would like to make you aware that 
this book has about a 3.5 million 
dollar climb to just get back to breakeven for 2001.  lastly, I will also 
take over all of the positions in the london/
singapore and us/uk arb books.  I would like this book to be renamed - 
mahoney physical.   the koller
distillate book will be renamed mahoney financial.  

   
	
	

Starting tomorrow, Jan 3, the London Distillates book run by Ross Koller will 
have a max var position of  $1 million.   Chris, please take care of this 
with Ross.  

Thanks

We are, of course, in need of a high level speaker from Enron who can speak

pipelines to financial products and beyond).  

Are you available?  A Wharton grad with your background would be a stand-out

Dear Jim,
?
I really enjoyed meeting you on Friday  night.
?
I am very interested in talking to you about a  career opportunity at Enron.? 
I would appreciate any advice or assistance  you could provide.? I do know 
Jeff Shankman.? However, he is very hard  to get in touch with.? You 
mentioned on Friday that you would not mind  giving him a call for me.
?
I know that my knowledge and experience would be a  great asset to the team 
at Enron.
?

I have attached my resume for your review.?  The resume?details my 
accomplishments in the  Natural Gas?business.? However, my marketing, trading 
and management  skills?are transferable to any commodity?in any industry.? 
Some  of my past accomplishments include:? proven track record in marketing 
of a commodity; established customer base  across a multi state region; 
successful in?achieving regional goals and  exceeding profit targets; utilize 
analytical skills in developing strategy for  meeting customer needs; 
experience in educating and providing?internal and  external customers with 
derivative and financial products to meet the customer  needs; customer base 
includes brokers, marketers, producers, utilities and end  users. 
?

I have?provided  some additional information about my background below:
?
I am a highly successful sales and marketing  professional.? I have over nine 
years  experience and a proven track record in the Natural Gas Industry.? My  
experience ranges from marketing, origination,?running a desk and profit  
center in trading, market making, and management.? Most recently I ran a  
regional trading desk and profit center?at TXU Energy Trading.? My  
responsibilities included managing both a financial and physical trading  
book.? I made nine million dollars in marked-to-market profits over the  last 
three years.? My experience includes extensive customer contact, the  
trading?of financial natural gas swaps, utilizing derivatives, and movement  
of physical gas.? I have demonstrated performance as a competent trader and  
desk head.? In addition, I have participated as part of the management team  
at TXU Energy Trading for the last three years.?With? electricity 
deregulation approaching, TXU made the decision to  redefine their business 
plan which included shutting down the proprietary  trading side of the 
business.? This meant the shutting down of the Houston  Office.??I?made the 
decision not to move to Dallas. 
?

This is a changing time for the Natural Gas  Industry and I believe that the 
consolidation of companies or trading  organizations will continue to 
consolidate.???My marketing and trading experience resides in Natural Gas?in 
the  east/gulf but feel that I could apply my financial and physical  
trading/marketing skills?to any region or  commodity.??I am  very good 
at?developing strategy for trading or marketing utilizing  historical 
analysis and current trends.? I?very interested in  a?career opportunity 
utilizing my marketing, trading,?and  business-to-business expertise.? I 
believe there is a need for marketers  and traders?that understand arbitrage 
and asset optimization utilizing  financial products.?

opportunities at Enron.?

Sincerely,
?

Jeff,

It is my understanding that you will be speaking with Simon Greenshields at 
Morgan Stanley ("MS") tomorrow.  I have outlined the facts as I know them in 
regards to our position with PG&E.

Enron Energy Marketing Corporation ("EEMC") has four outstanding purchases 
from PG&E Energy Trading - Power LP ("PG&E").  One of these transactions PG&E 
has backed with a purchase from MS.  We have not been disclosed exact terms 
of the transaction PG&E has with MS.  The terms of our transaction with PG&E 
are as follows:

EEMC purchases 100MW around the clock 1/1/2001 to 12/31/2002 from PG&E with 
delivery point of SP15 at price of $29/Mwh

This transaction is currently in-the-money $130mm.

We are proposing to assign EEMC's position to EPMI and then EPMI would agree 
to take assignment from PG&E its position with MS in return for unwinding 
EPMI's transaction with PG&E.  Our net book value would remain unchanged but 
we would transfer credit exposure to MS rather than PG&E.

It is my understanding that MS is currently posting margin to PG&E above some 
threshold within the Master contract between PG&E and MS.  With the 
assignment EPMI would assume the contract under its Master agreement.  The 
current agreement has no executed margining agreements but we have been 
exchanging margin above a $15mm bilateral threshold.  Enron would be willing 
to either not require collateral on the deal or take the collateral under the 
current terms negotiated but not yet documented.

If we choose to take collateral, MS can post either cash or letters of 
credit.  If they post cash, EPMI contractually can invest those funds as we 
see fit but will be required to pay interest at the Fed Funds interest rate.

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Bill

Do you guys get this?

my really good friend is Jarrod's wife.  we hosted bunco together last 
night!  I can find out more about her on the downlow.  

so who is this girl?  Your friend Laura (and Jarrod) (and Heather) all know 
her and I think this was Jarrod and Heather's idea.

you're doing a great job.  don't be rattled, I was going to ask you to assess

Jeff-
 When I was in your office you rattled me a quite a bit when you said you 
weren't ready to ask me a certain question.  I know that you and I have not 
had the chance to really talk lately and I've actually been in and out of the 
office in the late afternoons trying to get some health issues resolved.  I 
want to let you know I'm trying very hard to focus and work with Niamh in 
London, learn as much about reisd, and trade into what we think are solid 
positions.  So far I feel like its been going better than I even expected, 
but I know I have a lot more to learn.  I'm enjoying this product and working 
in EGM.  I'm trying to manage this Penn thing on the side and still help out 
Jenn and Fundamentals when they need it.  I'm begining to see what it means 
to be streched thin, something I'm sure you experience quite often.  I do 
want you to feel like you can ask me anything.  I'm here to express my ideas 
to you or if you feel like I'm not working hard enough, I'd like to know.  
I've really appreciated everything you've done.

Sarah

I have a book you should read--How to Raise a Puppy--by the Monks of New

Awesome.

Santa brought me a weimeraner!  He's so cute.  He has a silver coat with blue 
eyes.  As he gets older the eyes will change to hazel.  I took him to the vet 
yesterday.  He was not too happy about that. He was pretty upset with me.  I 
did find it hard leaving him home alone.  I was thinking of taking the rest 
of the day off to see him?  

Do you have any tips?

any thoughts on why the funds have their smallest nat gas positions on in 
over a year?
margins too high, don't like the risk/reward, i guess are the two most 
obvious thoughts but
perhaps you have something more insightful.  I thought the momentum funds
would be longer at least in some of the deferred contracts.

in addition to our unsecured debt and strategic stock risk we also have a mtm 
risk on the cargoes
that we have been importing under ectric. the arrangement was that we would 
import the cargoes 
(enron selling to ectric) and allow gmp to buy small volumes from us on an 
intank transfer basis.
this was working ok for the month of november but with their volumes falling 
dramatically in dec 
they have not been buying any material and in addition have given us a 
program for 3 dec cargoes
that at this stage they really didn't need.  that is not 100% correct because 
they did need these
volumes to meet their strategic stock requirements but clearly they are not 
going to be selling these
volumes for sometime if they cannot get some cash to  prepay for the oil.  
this mtm risk is conservatively
around 9 mil dollars.  this mtm risk reflects the fall off in flat price of 
oil over the month of december.  
this is somewhat of a hedge against gmp acknowledgement of the hedges that 
ectric was holding
against the strategic stocks but nonetheless we are in a situation where we 
should import no further
oil.  robert quick and myself are going to spain in the first week of january 
to clarify the veba oil pledges
and potential fraud.  we are getting several vsl on subs for lifting oil out 
of spain in 1h january to show
that unless gmp is seen putting money back into the business we will be 
removing our support from
them.  given the significant risks still present we can only hope that such 
actions on our behalf in ely
jan. will initiate a response from gmp management that hasn't happened 
previously.  i've enclosed
the spreadsheet that reflects the appx mtm risk on the oil ectric is holding 
in spain for the account of
gmp.  I don't believe we could have done this any other way or they would 
have folded already.
any hedging we did on their behalf would have added further to our risk (we 
already had the short
futures vs the strategic stocks) in an upmarket but cleary we need to 
consider this risk when we
evaluate how quickly we are prepared to take the actions that will close down 
gmp.
.  

Good luck in the new rotation.  Stay in touch.

Jeff,

It was a pleasure seeing you at the ENA party earlier this month. Thank you 
for your help and advice with regards to my new rotation. I am enjoying the 
new work immensely and have the opportunity to review all sort of new 
technologies and business plans. We recently  came up with the idea of 
creating a separate program aimed at the big energy companies in Houston 
whereby the generation of new ideas and technologies aimed at the energy 
industry could be outsourced to the Houston Technology Center and therefore 
benefit from a level of freedom and flexibility that is difficult to achieve 
within the hierarchical structures of most big energy players in town. These 
"idea labs" would be set up as separate companies and would only require 
funding from investors such as Shell, Exxon Mobil, and the likes. I assume 
that Enron would not be particularly interested  given its own internal 
entrepreneurial spirit although it could benefit from the exposure to such 
new  ventures and potentially find candidates with technologies it might 
want  to invest in. This idea was just recently floated and no real steps 
have been taken in any direction which is why I am wondering if I can ask you 
for your opinion. Please let me know of any questions you might have and have 
a wonderful holiday.

Again thank you and my best wishes for the New Year
Massimo

Please find below a summary of where we stand for the year.  AIG will not 
close this year.   Mike Beyer is in Kentucky today closing on the revised 
Panther deal with Cline.

Current Coal -            $15 mm
Current Emissions - $3 mm
New International -   $5 mm
New USA -                  $3 mm
Panther -                      $5 mm
Sempra -                     $24 mm

Total -                          $55 mm

Please note we will have to fight 2 - internal issues in early Jan.  The 
first is the  American Coal Co. senior note that has resided in Treasury the 
past year.  There is a $1.7 mm hit associated with the note.  Our position is 
that Treasury agreed to take the note a year ago and manage it.  Any lose is 
by definition theirs.  I will get with Joe Deffner on this.

The second issue is the $4 mm that John Lavorato owes us for taking the 
incorrectly marked emissions book.  ENA clearly owes us this money, I'll 
follow up with Lavorato to discuss.

Kevin McGowan will be in next week to ensure that all the deals are correctly 
booked.

Anthony,

 Here is what I can add:

1. Looks like the Conventional Steam Boilers used by producers in the field 
(average boiler: 50 Million Btu/hr, uses 1400 mmbtu/day of gas) that have 
been shut-in, use approx.. 100,000- 150,000 mmbtu/day of gas  (mainly, 
Texaco, Chevron, and independents).  This number can vary depending on which 
majors have firm transport on the pipelines and don't have to pay spot SOCAL 
Border prices.  This steam generation is used in either Steam Floods or 
Cyclic Steam Operations.
2. Crude production has probably not been affected, but if the injections 
stay down, you could see production start to fall off in 3 or 4 months.  
Crude prices in California are very weak right now (Kern River diffs are 
$10-13 under WTI when they normal run in the $5.80/$6.10 area).  Majors that 
have downstream facilities have outlets for their crude and probably have no 
plans to cut production.  Independents are seeing weakness on the buying side 
for the West Coast Independents and majors that normally buy their crude.  It 
might be 2-3 months before things clean up a bit out there on the crude side.
3. Gas injection-  The question here is due producers decide to risk the 
integrity of their reservoir's by reducing pressure and not injecting the 
gas.  This probably would only be done for a month or two.  Noone wants to 
damage any of their wells.  This volume is not well known, but in the overall 
picture really shouldn't affect prices that significantly.  Usually this gas 
is pretty sour and does not command a high price.  This would also be the 
cheapest source or gas for producers to use (if they bought any make-up gas 
for their process).
4. Referring to the question #2, the majority of EOR methods used in 
California are Steam Floods and Cyclic Steam Processes.  The oil is very 
heavy and needs HEAT in order to recover it out of the ground.  Just 
injecting gas would not accomplish this.  There are a lot of CO-GEN units 
that generate steam for most of the Majors and these are not being shut-in or 
slowed down.  Only sustain high gas prices for 6 months would probably start 
affecting Crude production.  Let's remember that in 1998-9 crude prices were 
extremely low and normal gas prices didn't change what most producers did, 
because if they shut-in too many wells, the production would never come back.

If you have anymore questions, please let me know.   Thanks

Mark

Hello, John.

Again, thanks for your cooperation.

Summary:
A West gas trader received news from Seneca Resources stating that California 
crude producers that use natural gas injection (or gas lifting?) for 
secondary and tertiary recovery methods may stop injection and - instead - 
sell the gas into the market to benefit from the record high natgas prices.  
That being so, one wonders how much natural gas will be put back into the 
market and how California crude yields will be affected.  

Here are some specific questions that may help us:
How often is natural gas used in California to enhance crude production 
(including gas injection/lifting, steam injection, and hot water injection)?  
Is this really a significant issue?
What is the law concerning onshore gas injection?  If the gas was bought (not 
produced) by the crude producer, is the crude producer obligated to recover 
the injected gas?  If yes, must 100% of the gas be proven to be recoverable?
On average, how much natgas volume is injected in an oil field to recover 
production?
What is an approximate number of producing oil fields in California and/or 
PADD 5
What is the average size of these crude reservoirs?
How many of these fields use natgas for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) - 
reiterating question #1?
Is there a unit estimate of approximately how many MMBtus/Mcfs of natgas is 
needed to produce 1 barrel of crude onshore?
How would stopping gas injection/lifting affect crude supply in California? 
Would crude wells be shut-in?  If so, how would that affect future efforts to 
produce from them?
Will a significant amount of crude be held from the market - especially in 
the PADD 5/Western region?
What commodities are substitutes for natgas in secondary/tertiary EOR and how 
liquid are they in the West?  How feasible, expeditious, and economical is it 
for any producing oil field to use another substance for EOR?

John, I really appreciate your willingness to help unearth this information.  
The priority on this matter is urgent, so we would be extra grateful for a 
prompt response.  Please do not hesitate to call me at 713-853-6304, Russell 
Dyk at 713-853-7332, or Ken Shulklapper at 713-853-7009 for any further 
questions or comments.

Sincerely,

Anthony

TITLE: CERA Monthly Oil Briefing: Fundamentals Update 
E-mail Category: CERA Monthly Briefing 
CERA Knowledge Area: World Oil 

In the past two weeks, oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength 
that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages 
this winter. The exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard 
to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil 
stock situation is at least stabilizing, even if stocks have not built 
substantially, and that, thus far, despite a few weeks of colder-than-normal 
temperatures, heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key 
US market. That has allayed some of the concerns that were driving 
speculative interest into the market. Furthermore, the potential for weakness 
in the US economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001. 

The change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that 
Iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide, yet, the Iraqi export 
cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals. If the cutoff lasts 
through December, the effect will be pronounced-it would turn a projected 
fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0.5 million barrels per day (mbd) into a 
stockdraw of 0.1 mbd. We expect Iraqi production levels to remain erratic 
because of its dispute with the UN Security Council over sanctions, and 
exports may again cease. At some point such a development would have a price 
supportive effect. 

CERA's price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the World Oil Watch 
released in late November. Assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or 
repeated shutdowns of Iraqi production, the projected average for first 
quarter 2001 is $29 per barrel for WTI. However, this outlook is based on 
OPEC's announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its 
production by the start of the second quarter. A failure to restrain output 
would result in a downward adjustment to an average of $27 WTI for the first 
quarter of 2001, with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in 
the first. The downward pressure results from the prospect of a 
larger-than-usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about 
3.0 mbd-with a cut in OPEC output.

Iraq in a Twilight Zone 
As anticipated, Iraq ceased exporting oil under the UN-controlled "oil for 
food" program as of December 1 in protest over the rejection by the Security 
Council's sanctions committee of its proposed December export price schedule.*

Iraq's pricing was judged by the UN overseers, who monitor the export program 
and advise the sanctions committee, to be about 60 cents per barrel below 
comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that 
Iraq was seeking from buyers.

Although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues, Iraq partially 
resumed exporting on December 13. Since then, about 1 mbd has been exported 
from the Mina al-Bakr terminal in the Persian Gulf. Prior to the shutdown, 
Iraqi exports under UN auspices were at a rate of 2.21 mbd for November, as 
compared with 2.08 mbd for the third quarter. Exports for November were about 
1.3 mbd from Mina al-Bakr and about 0.9 mbd from Ceyhan in the Mediterranean. 
Exports from Ceyhan have not resumed, owing to the surcharge dispute, with 
the result that about 1.2 mbd of Iraqi crude remains off the market.

Iraq's semi-shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its 
dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues. (In the midst of 
this dispute, the UN Security Council approved phase nine of the oil-for-food 
program at the last minute on December 5; it became effective on December 6 
and has been accepted by Iraq). As of December19, Iraq's revised export price 
for Ceyhan, proposed for the remainder of December, has again been judged too 
low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions 
committee. Additionally, the overseers have notified lifters of Iraqi crude 
that any oil payment made directly to Iraq rather than to the UN escrow 
account would be a violation of UN sanctions. Buyers of Iraqi oil from Mina 
al-Bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a 
surcharge to Iraq.

How long Iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear, but it continues 
to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at Ceyhan in an 
apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the UN financial controls that are 
the heart of the sanctions system. The distinction that Iraq has made between 
Mina al-Bakr and Ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at Mina al-Bakr by 
loading two cargoes for the India Oil Company. Iraq may have judged this 
accommodation to be in its interest, since it recently also signed an oil 
exploration contract with India under which payments would be made in oil. As 
currently structured, the deal would violate UN sanctions, but India is 
seeking an exception from the Security Council on grounds of economic 
hardship. The exception seems unlikely to be granted, which may lead Iraq to 
cease exports from Mina al-Bakr again.

There are many possible scenarios that Iraq could follow, but we expect 
uncertainty about Iraqi exports to continue as Iraq uses its oil exports as 
leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the Security 
Council to end all restraints. Consequently, the Iraq factor will remain an 
element in the oil price outlook. 

Iraq's antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the Iraq 
issue in Washington as the incoming Bush administration prepares to take 
office. Secretary of State-designate Colin Powell has already acknowledged a 
need to reassess Iraq policy and has said that he would work to "reenergize" 
sanctions. The Iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign 
policy-oriented think tank in Washington. A consensus seems to be emerging 
around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by 
retaining UN control over Iraq's oil revenue and strictly enforcing a 
prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general 
trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international 
irritant. There is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to 
destabilize or remove the Saddam Hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that 
the prospects for success are remote.

Demand Trends 
Record high US natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for 
gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so, 
and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas. Interruptible gas 
customers with resid or distillate fuel back-up have already switched to oil, 
so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the 
already high level of distillate demand. So far in December US distillate 
demand is running at a record high December level of 3.9 mbd. However, only a 
small portion of this demand is the result of economically based 
fuel-switching from gas to distillate. CERA estimates that the additional 
demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is 
relatively small, on the order of 0.1 to 0.2 mbd. In CERA's view it is likely 
that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short 
notice because in some cases, this theoretically switchable capacity has not 
been used in recent years, and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in 
uncertain condition. 

Switching by interruptible gas customers (such as utilities) to distillate 
began about a month or more ago, although the volumes involved are relatively 
small. Switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices 
started to surge in the summer. A portion of the US secondary and tertiary 
distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible 
gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage. Given the 
expectations of a tight gas market, regulators have been explicit about 
enforcing back-up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the 
current heating season. 

Other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching. 
Some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost 
of feedstock natural gas is high. Natural gas is also used in some enhanced 
oil recovery operations, and some of these producers have also opted to sell 
gas back to the grid rather than produce oil. 

Supply Trends 
Non-OPEC supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0.9 mbd over a 
year earlier at 46.4 mbd. Recent events include a shortfall in Mexican 
production, curtailed in October by about 300,000 bd owing to the effects of 
Hurricane Keith. Mexico's fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be 
3.64 mbd-about 95 percent of Mexican liquids capacity. Norway's output 
increased 200,000 bd from October to November as maintenance season ended. 
Norway's production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3.53 mbd.*

Growing Russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a 
recent surge in exports, in spite of higher export taxes. Russian exports of 
domestic oil production (excluding transit volumes) reached 2.5 mbd in 
November, after remaining fairly steady at about 2.35 mbd from July though 
October. Fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2.5 mbd, 0.3 mbd 
greater than in the fourth quarter 1999.

CERA estimates Iraqi oil production averaged 2.91 mbd in November-down 0.1 
mbd from the October level. The cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced 
Iraqi output for the first 12 days of December to roughly 0.8 mbd. Iraq 
resumed exports of about 1 mbd on December 13, which raised production to 
1.80 mbd. Assuming no change in Iraq's current production stance, Iraqi 
production would average 1.41 mbd for December. On a quarterly basis, the 
decline in Iraq output would lead to estimated OPEC output in the fourth 
quarter of 29.0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0.5 
mbd into a stockdraw of 0.1 mbd. These production estimates include 0.15 mbd 
of crude oil exports to Syria that began on November 20 without UN 
authorization and are continuing.

Oil Stocks 
US crude oil inventories (DOE data) have climbed intermittently from an 
annual low of 280 million barrels in September and reached 292 million 
barrels in mid-December (see Figure 1). Since prices weakened in late 
November, crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in September 
and the ranges seen in October to levels from 289-292 million barrels.

Primary inventories of US heating oil remain well below year-earlier levels; 
at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels, or 24 percent less, than 
those of a year ago, but there are indications of builds in secondary and 
tertiary inventories. We estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up 
5-10 million barrels since August and are actually higher than they were at 
the end of last year.

In Europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with 
those of the United States. In November stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels 
to 426 million barrels. At this level they are below the highs of 1999 but 
well above the low levels of early 1996 (see Figure 2). Japanese crude oil 
inventories at end-October were 107.6 million barrels, which is above the 
record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent 
years (see Figure 3).

Attached are the weekly IB reports.  Since I'm in London there will be no 
hard copies this week and hopefully it will be up on the EGM Website this 
afternoon.  If you'd like copies of the full reports themselves, please just 
email me and I'll figure out a way to get them to you.  Everyone have a great 
holiday.

Hey, 

We may have to get together after the Christmas holidays.  Are you in town 
for the holidays?

Santa might bring me a puppy....

I do not need to interview the person selected for the weather group.  This 
person will also support europe gas/power, and costs split as such between 
organizations. 

   
	
	

Folks:
We interviewed three candidates. One of the three (Tony Hamilton)  seems to 
be a very good fit within the Enron culture and values.
Recommended Next Steps
Vince, Mike and Jeff interview Tony via video conference or avistar

Tony Hamilton Key Strengths
Quick thinker
Good teams skills
Driven - will be able to get the project off the ground quickly
Has a commercial attitude
Sees "the big picture"

Tony Hamilton is available for follow up interviews the first week of January.
Thanks

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 07/2001

Highlight

The cape market is still rising, but very gently.  Owners are still quite 
concerned about the year as a whole and are actively seeking coverage.  We 
spend much of last week covering all our short positions thru to May.  Plan 
is to sit back for a couple weeks and then sell short again for Q2, Q3 and Q4 
if feasible.  

We struck a deal last Friday with Cetragpa ( Pierre's ex co. ) by which we 
agreed a collar on the RBCT/Rotterdam route for 2002/2003.  We bought a call 
at $7.80 and sold a put at $6.80 for 600,000 MT ( this could be valuable 
hedge for the first 2 years of the Gijon Business).

On the panamax front, Pacific market is still relatively active and strong 
while the Atlantic is soft with few grain cargoes from the US Gulf.  We fixed 
last week a contract to supply 3 panamax vessels of coal and Petcoke to 
Aceralia ( Spanish Steel Mill ).

We are also currently seeking freight for our first freight and coal business 
into the US east coast ( Thanks to the US coal guys ) on a Belted self 
discharge handy max to load in second half of this year.

Mr. Shankman,

I apologize for any inconvenience, however I just found out that Mrs. Fastow 
was aware that you guys would be unavailable.  There is also an artist from 
Spain in attendance, therefore the meeting will still be held in your 
absence.  I am assuming meeting notes will be provided for you at a later 
date.

Regards-Tiko

FYI,

I bot 30 lots/month of propane from Adam May-Sept at 51 cents, also I bot 
30/month May -Sept Nat gas from Arnold, and a couple of contracts/mo of socal 
basis to close the position out.  Please get the fill from arnold for gas, 
and make sure it shows up in my position 
report.  thanks.

Larry Gagliardi has been with us for 6 months marketing EOL crude/products 
for 6 months and has signed up well over 50 customers according to Nowlan.  
He came from the crude and products broker TCT and knows the traders in the

We have completed the preliminary Transammonia valuation analysis with an 
equity range of $70MM to $80MM (enterprise value of $250MM to $260MM).  The 
conditional and non-binding letter to the counterparty will be faxed today 
with an equity range of $60MM to $80MM.  I lowered the bottom end of the 
range to $60MM for negotiation purposes.

Attached is a presentation we've put together focusing on Transammonia's 
business, deal specifics, and our financial valuation.

As part of our process of developing a cohesive strategy for the crude & 
products origination group, we are hosting a "Strategy Session" on Wednesday, 
February 21 starting at 3:30 p.m.  It is expected to run about 3 hours.  The 
location has not yet been determined but my assistant, Beth Ryan (x57161) 
will confirm this next week.  This meeting replaces the prior meeting set up 
for Thursday, 2/22 from 8 am to noon.  Representatives from McKinsey will 
also participate/direct this meeting as facilitators to our strategic 
process.  We're finalizing an agenda which will be forwarded to you once it 
is complete.  (de la Roche/Terlip - please be sure this gets sent to all 
attendees asap).

This will be a very important process which we feel your input is critical 
and valuable.  I want to encourage everyone to not only attend but to be 
proactive in the process as well.  This will start as somewhat of a 
"brainstorming" session but our plan is to evolve into a definitive set of 
priorities, opportunities and action items which we hope will create value 
across both the trading and origination groups.  Given the size of the group, 
it has been very challenging finding a convenient time and place to 
accomodate everyone but I hope each of you will do what you can to attend.  
We've purposefully started the meeting late to try and accomodate the 
traders' schedule needs.

BETH:

WE NEED TO GET EITHER A CONF ROOM (preferably) OR RESERVE A MEETING ROOM AT 
THE DOUBLETREE, HYATT OR WEDGE TOWER, ETC... FOR THIS MEETING.
PLEASE CHECK THE DISTRIBUTION LIST ABOVE AND COMPARE AGAINST YOUR LIST OF 
ORIGINAL INVITES TO THIS MEETING.  IF I'VE MISSED SOMEONE, PLEASE BE SURE 
THEY ARE NOTIFIED OF THE CHANGE IN DATE, TIME AND PLACE.  ALSO, BE SURE TO 
LET MCKINSEY KNOW THE LOCATION AS WELL.

It doesn't seem my secluding myself from friends is helping my state of 
being.  I worked all weekend and played with the pups, but I'm not emailing 
you to tell you that.  Can I call you tonight?

I'm going to try to go to 50....day is packed, and still haven't decided when 
to go to NY.....How's your day?

We had one of our most successful days on Enron Online today.  In addition to 
the frontline NYMEX look-a-like trades, we did six jet swaps and two heat 
cracks online.  Although it is from a small base, this business continues to 
grow.  This business we are doing is also better than the NYMEX look-a-like 
business in that we are developing a mix of counterparties who are paying the 
bid/offer. Today's counterparties included Valero, Hess, Cargill and Bank of 
America. 

Next week we will launch our NYMEX heat and gas crack products.  Many of our 
counterparties have expressed interest in this product so we believe our 
volumes will continue to grow.

yes, mine.

Jeff:

As I am sure you are aware, we are facing some significant challenges with 
the Dabhol project.  The government is making noise about reviewing the 
project and our customer is facing significant financial stress.  The plant 
runs on LNG that is indexed to JCC, effectively giving our customer a 
significant crude oil exposure.  As we consider a workout proposal, one thing 
that I have considered is the possibility of embedding some crude oil 
protection into the workout structure.  I would greatly appreciate it if I 
could borrow a few minutes of your time to (i) get a sense of where we see 
forward pricing right now and (ii) share with you our thoughts on the workout.

Jim

How about the Lay's wednesday?

so did he accept the offer from enron?

John L Nowlan
12/18/2000 12:46 PM
Talked with Cameron today, he is the university of Chicago guy who has been 
made an offer. He is excited about coming to our group. I will reconfirm with 
JAna and Charlene that his first rotation will be with us. He also expressed 
an interest in ending up in crude and products but did want to see other 
parts of Enron. Told him to do a good job and it would not be a problem.

Jeff,
The main problem that our customers are identifying is that the products are 
randomly put on EnronOnline.  Unfortunately, this pushes our customers to 
other systems that are consistently showing numbers (such as Altrade's 
Chalkboard).  Here are some comments that Jennifer McQuade and Beth Cowan 
have received over the past two weeks:

NGL products (Jennifer McQuade):
Products that come on and off-line throughout the day (or sometimes are never 
put out all day): Natural Gasoline (physical only), Normal Butane, Purity 
Ethane and Physical Conway Propane (Craig Story).  These products are less 
liquid and the traders (Wade Hicks- physical, Adam Gross-financial) find it 
difficult  to keep the products out all day.  However, Chalkboard (which has 
the LPG on-line market share) consistently has 4-5 postings in each of these 
products.  Companies that have commented on this include Dynegy, Gulfsream 
Trading, Huntsman Petrochemicals, and Taylor Gas Liquids.
Lately, when one of the traders is out of the office, his products are not 
being posted (i.e. 12/14 Wade Hicks was out of the office and there were no 
physical Mt. Belvieu products).   
The product details say these market are open from 7:00 am to 4:00 pm, but 
the products often don't come on until 8/8:30 and are often gone shortly 
after 2:00 pm.

Crude/Products (Beth Cowan):
Beth spoke with Kirk Kinnear at Hess Energy Trading Company LLC (2nd largest 
crude counterparty).  Kirk commented that we are posting various products but 
the hours that they trade are not consistent - he compares EOL to other 
exchanges where the numbers are up all day long.  J
John Brewer at Occidental Energy Marketing said, "we are interested mostly in 
the PT market & West Texas but weren't seeing many quotes out there so I quit 
looking at it."
US WTI Cal swap - should be online until 3:30 central - Rob Fuller
US WTI Index products - should be onine until 3 - Rob Fuller
US WTI Basis Products - should be online until 6 - Rob Fuller

Crazy, but trying to chill.  I bet you're glad exams are over...how did you 
do?  Any plans for the holidays?

Thank you for your information and interest in this area.  Rick Bergsieker 
and Clay Harris are already in discussion with the Egyptian Energy Ministry 
for possible participation by Enron in a liquifaction project.  Please feel 
free to exchange ideas and thoughts with Rick and Clay directly.

However, in order to avoid creating any confusion with our Egyptian counter 
parts I strongly prefer to only have our current commercial team involved 
these discussions at this time.

Eric,

Hoping all is well,

Wanted to have a quick chat with you, when you are next in Houston, about the 
Egypt LNG opportunity.  I had a meeting with the minister and the deputy 
minister for technical affairs and both were intereseted in increased 
participation in the LNG field in Egypt.  They are interested in diverse 
off-takers, and are interested in investing in new facilities (EGPC would 
like to own 60% of such a new facility and local/Arab investors can be found 
for the remaining equity).  They know they don't know how to project finance 
such deals, and they know they need a strong international name as an (at 
least partial) off-take.  They alluded that the situation with Finosa, 
although progressing, is not as it appears in the press.

At any case, I believe we have enough elements to warrant a 
conversations--and I have good contacts in Egypt that could help push such a 
project forward.

Cheers'

Hamd

Jeff,
my name is Brando Hayden and I am a trader and second year Associate on the 
Weather Derivatives desk.  Mark Tawney, my supervisor, has made a few 
attempts to set up a meeting for the three of us to discuss a few issues 
involving my performance and status in the group.  I believe that I have 
applied myself over the last seventeen months to produce significant results 
in my book and for the group.   My portfolio is up $6.7M YTD (12/17/00) which 
represents a significant contribution to the group's total revenues this 
year.  The issue here is that despite this significant contribution among 
other contributions to the group my performance has been portrayed in the PRC 
process as sub-standard and worthy of demotion.  I do not believe that this 
is just and would like to get this issue addressed.  As a result I would like 
to set up an appointment to speak with you about this matter.

I have attached a report of my trading performance through 12/17/00 for your 
review.  I have done this only because I know your position as President/COO 
of Global Markets grants you access to this information.

Regards,
Brando

PS: Mark has just passed by to tell me you can meet in January.  However, I 
would still like you to have this message.

FYI.

My view on the discussions with Southern Co. is that it is one of several 
potential ways to get at some upside out of our rights at Elba Island.  It's 
also giving us a good indication of where the market is for gas sourced from 
LNG coming in to Elba.  Nothing will be committed to without considering all 
the alternatives at Elba and a full review within EGM and asumably ENA.  The 
discussions are still, in my view, exploratory.

Thanks

   
	
	

Before we sign ANYTHING with Southern about the Elba volumes, I'd like an 
update.  Also I want to make sure we aren't trading anything away at Elba 
that we could be talking about elsewhere.  Thanks. 

Jeff

Get with George Z. and get this on the calendar.  Thanks. 
	
	

Jeff K.,

Just a follow up to our prior conversations.

Representatives from Wells Fargo will be visiting Enron on Tuesday, January 
9, 2001.

As initially discussed, Wells is looking to learn more about Enron's overall 
risk management/trading capabilities and to explore potential areas of 
co-operation -- "areas where the two organisations may benefit from working 
together". Wells is incredibly interested in the breadth of markets that 
Enron is currently involved in. My sense is that, with a mandate to grow 
their capital market reach, Wells will be looking to us as a potential 
strategic partner in taking many of our capabilities to their immense 
corporate client base.

Based on my relationship with them, they have expressed special interest in 
EnronCredit. The form of this seems quite interesting. My sense is that they 
have explored building their own credit derivative capabilities and for 
various reasons feel that it may be more efficient/economical to build some 
sort of shared capabilities with our group -- I think that our focus on 
solutions for the corporate risk manager is attractive to them. In addition 
to this, their Chief Credit Officer will be joining on this date to explore 
our capabilities in assisting with management of the Bank's credit portfolio. 
Based on my discussions with them and my sense of their interest in exploring 
various types of working relationships with us, I would suggest that we have 
a senior presence at this meeting.

This being said, they also have a great deal of interest in speaking to the 
Heads of all our other risk management/commodity desks. My hope is that Jeff 
Shankman will be available to discuss/introduce Enron Global Markets which 
would then be followed with product presentations from all desks interested 
(Mark Tawney has already agreed to presenting our Weather Derivative 
capabilities). Also, our Global Finance Group has expressed their interest in 
participating during these discussions.

 It has been indicated to me that the following people will be attending from 
Wells Fargo:
Treasurer
Chief Credit Officer
Sr. VP, & Head of Product Development, Capital Markets
Head of Derivative Sales

My hope is to finalise an agenda by the end of the week. In order to 
accomplish this, I would like to discuss (as a group) the best format in 
which to present -- one which will ensure an accurate representation of our 
capabilities and of our interest in developing this relationship.

Thanks,
George

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 51/2000

Highlight

The cape market continues on its downward momentum with this time bunkers ( 
Fuel Oil ) helping the slide as they have lost approx. $30 in the last couple 
weeks and make the costs of running the ships significantly less.  Panamaxes 
have on the other hand, started a slow upward trend.  Most bundits think that 
this latest rise might be the 'dead cat bounce'.  The Japanese buyers and the 
US exporters of grain had stopped shipping grains over the last few weeks 
while arguing over 'starlink' which is basically genetically modified crops 
while all the panamaxes were getting stuck in the US gulf awaiting the news 
of resumed shipping.  When the US and Japan settled their dispute last week, 
Shipments of grain to Japan immediately resumed, and the panamax market 
quickly reversed trend and starting going up.  

With the Christmas season quickly approaching, we expect the market to slow 
down dramatically with owners and charterers wanting to fix their remaining 
positions quickly.   This is the last report in 2000.  Have a good holiday 
and see you next year !!!

about you this morn!  Dog's go on winter break Jan 5--so hopefully before 
then.  

Alexandra Saler@EES
12/18/2000 08:13 AM
your name looked great in eBiz this morning.  I am very prould of you!

I crashed last night.  When can I come back to play with Chloe?

Love the new place!  Hopefully you kept warm last night!  (You didn't have to 
sleep in your car, did you?) (Or did you have to drink the champagne to keep 
from freezing?)   Unfortunately I won't know about the Lay's party until 
tomorrow.  Hopefully it will work out.  
My first party--first week in Feb--Ali's planning it.
Aren't I cooler than Kenneth's brother Mark?  Just checking.

Later

CERA Alert: December 15, 2000 

Title: Refined Products Line--European Markets 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Refined Products 

Rotterdam Differentials 
* The fall in product prices that started in late October-after a brief surge 
during heightened market tensions over Middle East unrest-continued in 
November. Average differentials for all products over crude fell, with those 
for gasoline falling particularly strongly in line with very weak reported 
demand. FOB ARA barges for premium unleaded gasoline over Dated Brent 
averaged $1.51 per barrel, compared with $5.86 per barrel in October.

* Jet/kerosene barge premiums over Dated Brent slipped by over $2.00 per 
barrel in November from October's average, but because of current market 
sentiment favoring prompt production of heating oil, they remained high at an 
average of $10.98 per barrel. Jet values had enjoyed the largest increase of 
all products during October's Middle East-related price increases; 
consequently jet/kerosene's premium over heating oil narrowed in November 
following an easing of tensions, averaging the month at $2.53 per barrel, 
compared with $3.29 per barrel over heating oil in October. 

* Despite falling by $1.33 per barrel from October's level, average 0.2% 
sulfur gasoil barge values remained very strong in November, averaging $8.45 
per barrel over Dated Brent. High end-user prices for heating oil remain a 
strong deterrent to demand, however; provisional data for German heating oil 
demand in November show a fall of over 10 percent from November 1999 levels 
(to an average of 608,000 barrels per day [bd]).

* Discounts of low sulfur (1.0%) heavy fuel oil to Dated Brent widened again 
in November, averaging $6.74 per barrel. As was discussed last month, much of 
the reason for their improvement in October was because of concerns over the 
availability in Russian exports: toward the end of October and into November, 
however, such concerns subsided, leading to a widening of discounts. High 
sulfur (3.5%) fuel oil discounts widened by $3.26 per barrel to an average of 
$9.61 per barrel to Dated Brent.

Refinery Margins 
* Margins fell back considerably after the very high levels recorded in 
October, but still remained quite strong and reflect the current market 
sentiment of favoring maximum refinery production, especially of middle 
distillates. High jet/kerosene and gasoil/heating oil values kept margins 
buoyant, but falling gasoline premiums and widening heavy fuel oil discounts 
were the major downward influences. 

* Using CERA's illustrative yield patterns, gross margins for 
simple/hydroskimming refineries in the ARA region fell by $2.80 per barrel 
over Dated Brent from October's level, averaging $1.19 per barrel in 
November. The deterioration in heavy fuel oil discounts accounted for half of 
the decline, with the large drop in gasoline values contributing $0.87 per 
barrel to the fall.

* The drop in gasoline premiums was the principal reason for the fall in ARA 
complex/cracking refineries. Using CERA's illustrative yield patterns, gross 
margins averaged $3.30 per barrel in November; this is $2.93 per barrel lower 
than October's average, of which $1.74 is attributable to the poorer gasoline 
premiums, with the remainder of the difference attributable equally to the 
declines in middle distillates and residual fuel oil values. 

European Inventories and Refinery Operations* 

* EU and Norwegian refinery crude intakes rose by a further 168,000 bd in 
November, averaging 12.6 million barrels per day (mbd), again an indication 
of refiners seeking to maximizing runs given the current favorable margins. 
Output data for individual products are not yet available, but the high crude 
runs and middle distillate margins would indicate that November was another 
month of very high jet/kerosene and gasoil production.

* Despite the strong crude runs, primary EU plus Norway crude oil inventories 
did increase in November, ending the month 9 million barrels higher than 
October's level (which was revised downward) at 426.5 million barrels. There 
has been a small but consistent three-month contango in the Brent futures 
market, placing a small premium on forward months' values of crude to the 
current month's, which would help to encourage stockholding. These stocks 
represent about 31 days' forward supply of anticipated total demand in the 
first quarter of next year-less than 2 days' fewer supply compared with 
November levels for the past two years. 

* Primary gasoline inventories fell in November from 154 million barrels to 
150 million barrels, contrary to typical seasonal patterns. This may reflect 
the relatively low levels of gasoline production over the past few months, 
and certainly current gasoline differentials to crude are not encouraging 
high gasoline production levels. Nevertheless, this is a potential cause for 
concern as it may lead to significant market volatility during the first 
quarter of next year. 

* Primary middle distillate inventories, however, are continuing to improve. 
October's total was revised upward slightly to 333 million barrels, and 
November ended at 334 million barrels. In addition to record levels of 
refinery production, exports from Russia are proving to be plentiful, with 
November's total exports from the former Soviet Union averaging 460,000 bd. A 
strong transatlantic arbitrage, however, has been causing most of these 
cargoes to go direct to the United States rather than stay in Europe.

CERA Alert: December 15, 2000 

Title: Refined Products Line--North American Markets 
CERA Knowledge Areas: Refined Products 

US Margin Highlights 
* Responding to falling apparent demand and rising primary inventory levels, 
US Gulf Coast unleaded gasoline margins versus WTI fell by $2.26 per barrel 
to average $1.45 per barrel during November. Gasoline margins have returned 
to a historically normal range after spending the summer of 2000 at 
exceptionally high values. CERA expects gasoline margins to WTI to average 
$2.75 per barrel during the first quarter of the New Year, $1.16 per barrel 
lower than this year's first quarter average. 

* High sulfur No. 2 fuel oil differentials with WTI dropped slightly, 
averaging $5.97 per barrel in November. Despite the drop of $0.37 per barrel 
from October's average, fuel oil differentials remain at unprecedented 
values-$4.20 per barrel higher than a year ago and $3.46 per barrel greater 
that the previous five-year average. For the first quarter of 2001, CERA 
anticipates distillate margins to moderate somewhat but remain at a record 
high level of $4.75 per barrel in the first quarter.

* Jet/kerosene differentials versus WTI rose $0.63 per barrel from the 
October average, reaching a whopping $8.59 per barrel in November. In 
correspondence with the distillate market, jet/kerosene margins are at 
historically high levels and receiving support from relatively tight 
fundamentals. CERA expects jet/kerosene margins to moderate somewhat in the 
first quarter in response to seasonal weakening of demand following the 
holiday travel season but to remain exceptionally strong at an average of 
$5.75 per barrel.

* Margins for US Gulf Coast 1% sulfur residual fuel dropped by $2.15 per 
barrel, reaching $3.99 per barrel below WTI during November. Despite the 
recent widening of differentials, CERA expects soaring natural gas prices to 
support relatively narrow residual fuel differentials throughout the winter 
months. Residual fuel differentials are expected to average $2.50 per barrel 
below WTI during the first quarter of next year, at the high end of the 
historical range.

US Demand Highlights 
* Apparent demand for unleaded gasoline fell seasonally by about 0.5 million 
barrels per day (mbd) from the October level, reaching 8.36 mbd for the four 
weeks ending December 8. Demand is averaging less than 1 percent below last 
year largely because Y2K concerns helped inflate December demand a year ago. 
CERA anticipates gasoline demand to continue to decline seasonally as colder 
temperatures arrive, averaging 8.08 mbd during the first quarter of 2001.

* Reported distillate apparent demand remains exceptionally strong at 3.94 
mbd for the four weeks ending December 8, over 7 percent greater than this 
time last year. This represents a slight increase of about 0.05 million 
barrels (mb) from the end-October level of 3.90 mb, but still a record high 
level for early December. With support from low home heating oil inventories, 
particularly in the Northeast, distillate demand has been very strong during 
the fall of 2000. CERA expects demand to remain strong in the coming winter 
months, averaging 3.79 mb during the first quarter of next year. 

* Apparent demand for jet fuel declined by 5 percent from the October level 
to reach 1.68 mbd for the four weeks ending December 8. Despite the decline, 
apparent jet fuel demand is over 1 percent above the year-ago level. The 
relative strength of jet fuel reported demand continues to parallel 
distillate demand strength with support coming from the use of jet fuel to 
help mitigate the tight distillate market fundamentals. CERA expects the 
demand for jet fuel to average 1.81 mb during the fourth quarter. 

* Reported demand for residual fuel dropped to 0.87 mbd for the four weeks 
ending December 8, a decline of about 0.09 mbd from the October average and a 
slight increase over the November level. Demand for residual fuel is 
currently 11 percent greater than last year, and surging natural gas prices 
are expected to result in continued strong residual fuel demand throughout 
the winter. Residual fuel demand is expected to remain in the 0.85 to 0.9 mbd 
range during the first quarter of 2001.

US Inventory Highlights 
* Primary inventories of unleaded gasoline rose to 196.5 mb, increasing 
almost 10 mb from the end-October value. Responding to rising stock levels 
and declining apparent demand, forward supply coverage of gasoline climbed to 
23.5 days for the four weeks ending December 8. Forward supply is 2.5 percent 
below last year's level at this time of year and at its lowest level in the 
past eight years-although CERA still believes coverage is currently 
sufficient for the level of demand expected this winter. However, CERA is 
looking cautiously at the implications of high distillate refinery yields and 
production because of the possibility of low gasoline inventories at the 
start of the driving season in the second quarter of next year.

* Distillate inventory coverage has remained about level since the end of 
October at 29.2 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8. 
Despite record high apparent demand, strong refinery production levels helped 
boost primary distillate inventories slightly, to 115.3 mb for this period. 
Primary stocks are 16 percent below last year's level at this time and at 
their lowest historical level ever. Although stocks are low, CERA does not 
anticipate shortages to occur this winter. Assuming normally cold weather, 
refinery production and net imports are expected to be capable of meeting 
demand requirements-albeit at a high price. 

* Jet fuel inventory coverage crept upward by about 1 day of coverage, to 
reach 25.7 days of forward supply for the four weeks ending December 8. This 
moves jet fuel coverage above the 23.5 to 25 days' supply range that it had 
been in for the past four months. The rise of just under 1 day in forward 
supply was mainly a response to a decline in apparent demand. Jet inventories 
and coverage are expected to become tighter in the coming weeks as the pull 
from tight distillate markets strengthen, but supplies are expected to be 
adequate for the winter.

* Inventory coverage of residual fuel rose by almost 4 days of forward supply 
from October, reaching 41.7 days of forward supply during the four weeks 
ending December 8. The increase in coverage was a temporary response to a 
drop in demand and an increase in stocks. With demand expected to strengthen 
because of colder weather and high gas prices, CERA looks for inventories and 
coverage gradually to decline in the coming weeks.

Mike and Jeff,

The following is an update we sent out to Harvard and Ospraie regarding the 
status of our transaction pipeline.  I thought it would be of interest to 
both of you as well.

Gentlemen,

We have sent the final version of the CA to Hallwood to be signed, hopefully 
we will receive information either tomorrow or early next week and have a 
preliminary valuation and structure proposal by the end of next week.   We 
are negotiating a CA with Nuevo and they appear anxious to get started.  
Their general counsel told me they have prepared a box of due diligence items 
to be delivered as soon as we agree on certain terms.  The DevX CA should be 
finalized today as well and we will get started on that prospect hopefully 
next week also.  We are still waiting on information from Chesapeake, but I 
spoke with Marc Rowland last week and he is getting his new reserve report 
finalized and will send it to us when it ready.  Benton is progressing albeit 
slowly because of the complicated nature of the structure.  We are also 
analyzing a new transaction that another group within Enron has originated 
and structured a VPP around but they may not have favorable financing.  It 
could represent an opportunity for both of you to see if a small equity 
participation in the SPV is of interest.  That's it, call me if you have any 
questions or comments. 

Doug,

I just wanted to say that you handled Hallwood perfectly. Also if it is time
to move on other fronts -- Benton / Nuevo -- I am ready to go. I think Nuevo
will probably be under pressure in the next few weeks after missing 4q and
reducing reserves.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 51/2000

Highlight

The cape market continues on its downward momentum with this time bunkers ( 
Fuel Oil ) helping the slide as they have lost approx. $30 in the last couple 
weeks and make the costs of running the ships significantly less.  Panamaxes 
have on the other hand, started a slow upward trend.  Most bundits think that 
this latest rise might be the 'dead cat bounce'.  The Japanese buyers and the 
US exporters of grain had stopped shipping grains over the last few weeks 
while arguing over 'starlink' which is basically genetically modified crops 
while all the panamaxes were getting stuck in the US gulf awaiting the news 
of resumed shipping.  When the US and Japan settled their dispute last week, 
Shipments of grain to Japan immediately resumed, and the panamax market 
quickly reversed trend and starting going up.  

With the Christmas season quickly approaching, we expect the market to slow 
down dramatically with owners and charterers wanting to fix their remaining 
positions quickly.   This is the last report in 2000.  Have a good holiday 
and see you next year !!!

FYI
A Syrian, Egyptian and Lebanese memorandum of understanding to transport, 
market natural gas
Regional, Economics, 12/16/2000
In the presence of the Lebanese prime minister Rafik al- Hariri a memorandum 
of understanding was signed on Friday in Beirut between Syria, Egypt and 
Lebanon on the transportation and marketing of natural gas.

On the Syrian side the memo. Was signed by minister of oil Maher Jammal and 
minister of oil in Egypt Sameh Fahmi and the Lebanese side was attended by 
Muhammad Abdul hamid Beydoun, the minister of energy and waters, in the 
presence of the secretary general of the Syrian- Lebanese higher council Nasr 
al-Kouri.

The project aims at transporting Egyptian and Syrian gas prepared for 
exportation to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and European countries to market it to 
meet the local demands of gas in these countries.

In a statement to pressmen following the signing ceremony, the Egyptian 
minister said the pipeline worth US $ 1 billion and that it would start near 
al-Arish in Egypt in Northern Egypt and run under the waters of the 
Mediterranean to Lebanon and Turkey through Syria.

The Syrian minister stressed the importance of the project which constitutes 
a turning point in boosting joint regional Arab co-operation and which 
signifies a vivid example on integrated Arab economy.

For his part, the Lebanese minister said that this project will strengthen 
the economic potentials of the participating countries and have positive 
impact on their general conditions.

One for you, too.

Jeff
A friend sent me the following Q&A - it sums up the legal issues very
clearly.

Q: I'm not a lawyer and I don't understand the recent Supreme Court decision
in Bush v. Gore. Can you explain it to me?

A: Sure. I'm a lawyer. I read it. It says Bush wins, even if Gore got the
most votes.

Q: But wait a second. The US Supreme Court has to give a reason, right?

A: Right.

Q: So Bush wins because hand-counts are illegal?

A: Oh no. Six of the justices (two-thirds majority) believed the hand-counts
were legal and should be done.

Q: Oh. So the justices did not believe that the hand-counts would find any
legal ballots?

A. Nope. The five conservative justices clearly held (and all nine justices
agreed) "that punch card balloting machines can produce an unfortunate
number of ballots which are not punched in a clean, complete way by the
voter." So there are legal votes that should be counted but can't be.

Q: Oh. Does this have something to do with states' rights? Don't
conservatives love that?

A: Generally yes. These five justices have held that the federal government
has no business telling a sovereign state university it can't steal trade
secrets just because such stealing is prohibited by law. Nor does the
federal government have any business telling a state that it should bar guns
in schools. Nor can the federal government use the equal protection clause
to force states to take measures to stop violence against women.

Q: Is there an exception in this case?

A: Yes, the Gore exception. States have no rights to have their own state
elections when it can result in Gore being elected President. This decision
is limited to only this situation.

Q: C'mon. The Supremes didn't really say that. You're exaggerating.

A: Nope. They held "Our consideration is limited to the present
circumstances, or the problem of equal protection in election processes
generally presents many complexities."

Q: What complexities?

A: They don't say.

Q: I'll bet I know the reason. I heard Jim Baker say this. The votes can't
be counted because the Florida Supreme Court "changed the rules of the
election after it was held." Right?

A. Dead wrong. The US Supreme Court made clear that the Florida Supreme
Court did not change the rules of the election. But the US Supreme Court
found the failure of the Florida Court to change the rules was wrong.

Q: Huh?

A: The Legislature declared that the only legal standard for counting vote
is "clear intent of the voter." The Florida Court was condemned for not
adopting a clearer standard.

Q: I thought the Florida Court was not allowed to change the Legislature's
law after the election.

A: Right.

Q: So what's the problem?

A: They should have. The US Supreme Court said the Florida Supreme Court
should have "adopt[ed] adequate statewide standards for determining what is
a legal vote"

Q: I thought only the Legislature could "adopt" new law.

A: Right.

Q: So if the Court had adopted new standards, I thought it would have been
overturned.

A: Right. You're catching on.

Q: If the Court had adopted new standards, it would have been overturned for
changing the rules. And if it didn't, it's overturned for not changing the
rules. That means that no matter what the Florida Supreme Court did, legal
votes could never be counted.

A: Right. Next question.

Q: Wait, wait. I thought the problem was "equal protection," that some
counties counted votes differently from others. Isn't that a problem?

A: It sure is. Across the nation, we vote in a hodgepodge of systems. Some,
like the optical-scanners in largely Republican-leaning counties record
99.7% of the votes. Some, like the punchcard systems in largely
Democratic-leaning counties record only 97% of the votes. So approximately
3% of Democratic votes are thrown in the trash can.

Q: Aha! That's a severe equal-protection problem!!!

A: No it's not. The Supreme Court wasn't worried about the 3% of Democratic
ballots thrown in the trashcan in Florida. That "complexity" was not a
problem.

Q: Was it the butterfly ballots that violated Florida law and tricked more
than 20,000 Democrats to vote for Buchanan or Gore and Buchanan.

A: Nope. The Supreme Court has no problem believing that Buchanan got his
highest, best support in a precinct consisting of a Jewish old age home with
Holocaust survivors, who apparently have changed their mind about Hitler.

Q: Yikes. So what was the serious equal protection problem?

A: The problem was neither the butterfly ballot nor the 3% of Democrats
(largely African-American) disenfranchised. The problem is that somewhat
less than .005% of the ballots may have been determined under slightly
different standards because judges sworn to uphold the law and doing their
best to accomplish the legislative mandate of "clear intent of the voter"
may have a slightly opinion about the voter's intent.

Q: Hmmm. OK, so if those votes are thrown out, you can still count the votes
where everyone agrees the voter's intent is clear?

A: Nope.

Q: Why not?

A: No time.

Q: No time to count legal votes where everyone, even Republicans, agree the
intent is clear? Why not?

A: Because December 12 was yesterday.

Q: Is December 12 a deadline for counting votes?

A: No. January 6 is the deadline. In 1960, Hawaii's votes weren't counted
until January 4.

Q: So why is December 12 important?

A: December 12 is a deadline by which Congress can't challenge the results.

Q: What does the Congressional role have to do with the Supreme Court?

A: Nothing.

Q: But I thought ---

A: The Florida Supreme Court had earlier held it would like to complete its
work by December 12 to make things easier for Congress. The United States
Supreme Court is trying to help the Florida Supreme Court out by forcing the
Florida court to abide by a deadline that everyone agrees is not binding.

Q: But I thought the Florida Court was going to just barely have the votes
counted by December 12.

A: They would have made it, but the five conservative justices stopped the
recount last Saturday.

Q: Why?

A: Justice Scalia said some of the counts may not be legal.

Q: So why not separate the votes into piles, indentations for Gore, hanging
chads for Bush, votes that everyone agrees went to one candidate or the
other so that we know exactly how Florida voted before determining who won?
Then, if some ballots (say, indentations) have to be thrown out, the
American people will know right away who won Florida.

A. Great idea! The US Supreme Court rejected it. They held that such counts
would likely to produce election results showing Gore won and Gore's winning
would cause "public acceptance" and that would "cast[] a cloud" over Bush's
"legitimacy" that would harm "democratic stability."

Q: In other words, if America knows the truth that Gore won, they won't
accept the US Supreme Court overturning Gore's victory?

A: Yes.

Q: Is that a legal reason to stop recounts? or a political one?

A: Let's just say in all of American history and all of American law, this
reason has no basis in law. But that doesn't stop the five conservatives
from creating new law out of thin air.

Q: Aren't these conservative justices against judicial activism?

A: Yes, when liberal judges are perceived to have done it.

Q: Well, if the December 12 deadline is not binding, why not count the
votes?

A: The US Supreme Court, after admitting the December 12 deadline is not
binding, set December 12 as a binding deadline at 10 p.m. on December 12.

Q: Didn't the US Supreme Court condemn the Florida Supreme Court for
arbitrarily setting a deadline?

A: Yes.

Q: But, but --

A: Not to worry. The US Supreme Court does not have to follow laws it sets
for other courts.

Q: So who caused Florida to miss the December 12 deadline?

A: The Bush lawyers who first went to court to stop the recount, the
rent-a-mob in Miami that got paid Florida vacations for intimidating
officials, and the US Supreme Court for stopping the recount

Q: So who is punished for this behavior?

A: Gore, of course.

Q: Tell me this: Florida's laws are unconstitutional?

A: Yes

Q: And the laws of 50 states that allow votes to be cast or counted
differently are unconstitutional?

A: Yes. And 33 states have the "clear intent of the voter" standard that the
US Supreme Court found was illegal in Florida

Q: Then why aren't the results of 33 states thrown out?

A: Um. Because---um---..the Supreme Court doesn't say---

Q: But if Florida's certification includes counts expressly declared by the
US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional, we don't know who really won the
election there, right?

A: Right. Though a careful analysis by the Miami Herald shows Gore won
Florida by about 20,000 votes (excluding the butterfly ballot errors)

Q: So, what do we do, have a re-vote? throw out the entire state? count
under a single uniform standard?

A: No. We just don't count the votes that favor Gore.

Q: That's completely bizarre! That sounds like rank political favoritism!
Did the justices have any financial interest in the case?

A: Scalia's two sons are both lawyers working for Bush. Thomas's wife is
collecting applications for people who want to work in the Bush
administration.

Q: Why didn't they recuse themselves?

A: If either had recused himself, the vote would be 4-4, and the Florida
Supreme Court decision allowing recounts would have been affirmed.

Q: I can't believe the justices acted in such a blatantly political way.

A: Read the opinions for yourself:
http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/supremecourt/00-949_dec12.pdf (December 9
stay stopping the recount)
http://www.supremecourtus.gov/opinions/00pdf/00-949.pdf (December 12
opinion)

Q: So what are the consequences of this?

A: The guy who got the most votes in the US and in Florida and under our
Constitution (Al Gore) will lose to America's second choice who won the all
important 5-4 Supreme Court vote.

Q: I thought in a democracy, the guy with the most votes wins.

A: True, in a democracy. But America is not a democracy. In America in 2000,
the guy with the most US Supreme Court votes wins.

Q: So what will happen to the Supreme Court when Bush becomes President?

A: He will appoint more justices in the mode of Thomas and Scalia to ensure
that the will of the people is less and less respected. Soon lawless
justices may constitute 6-3 or even 7-2 on the court.

Q: Is there any way to stop this?

A: YES. No federal judge can be confirmed without a vote in the Senate. It
takes 60 votes to break a filibuster. If only 41 of the 50 Democratic
Senators stand up to Bush and his Supremes and say that they will not
approve a single judge appointed by him until a President can be
democratically elected in 2004, the judicial reign of terror can end....and
one day we can hope to return to the rule of law.

Q: What do I do now?

A: Email this to everyone you know, and write or call your senator,
reminding him that Gore beat Bush by several hundred thousand votes (three
times Kennedy's margin over Nixon) and that you believe that VOTERS rather
than JUDGES should determine who wins an election by counting every vote.
And to protect our judiciary from overturning the will of the people, you
want them to confirm NO NEW JUDGES until 2004 when a president is finally
chosen by most of the American people.

No problem!  In fact, it is likely I'll be in NY wed-sat next week--I'm sure 
I'll stop by the gallery.  Hope to see you...

Jeff

Sorry to hear that you won't be joining us. I will be sure to let Ben know
that you wanted to attend.  Please do me a favor - an obvious favor but one
that I will feel remiss if I do not ask...Please do not send him something
before tomorrow night as it is still a surprise. I only ask because you
mentioned that you would try to send him something tomorrow.  His actual
birthday is on the 22nd so he still has no idea.
Thank you and perhaps we can all get together on your next trip to NY.
Be well and have a happy holiday season.
Hillary

Hi Hillary, hope you are well.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it

thoughtful of you to invite me.  I hope you have a great time.....(I'll
send something to Ben in the gallery tomorrow)...

Best,

It was a pleasure meeting you on Saturday evening.  I hope that you will be

what??????????

oh.................my...............god..............

Since only I know I'm not trying to offend you, that's all I can say.  I'm 
not sure I'm worthy of your being concerned either  (I don't deserve it--I'd 
guess)  You know, after we talked the other day, I felt better for a while.  
I don't know what to say, and I'm sure I'm embarrassed by this whole 
thing--most particularly how I've handled our relationship.  I really want to 
see you, but I need some time to myself I guess.  I do know glen doesn't have 
all the answers, but I find him to be impartial and helpful--really the only 
one these days.  My mother suggested a trip home this weekend, and i may go.  
I wish this were easy.....I think part of my issue is I've always felt our 
friendship is one I wanted to keep always, and I feel I tend to jeopardize 
friendships....

I'm so confused by you.

Sorry about your week.  Hopefully, since it's the weekend your week will
only get better, but as for my part in it, if any, I'm losing patience.
I don't know whether to be concerned about you or offended by you.  It's
increasingly difficult to be both.  Since you don't call as much as to
check in with me or respond to my calls, clearly you don't want to bother
with me and aren't particularly concerned whether I'm ok or not, and I have
to resist the urge to call and check on you because you are unresponsive
and seemingly untruthful, so I feel foolish even trying.  As a result, I'm
leaning more and more toward the offended/annoyed side.

Maybe Glen will have "all the answers" for you, but I don't think that's
possible and I think you just need to accept it and move forward.   It will
all pass and you will be fine in the long run.

Jeff,

Happy Holidays!

I met with the Wharton Club of Houston yesterday. The president is
Jon E. Zagrodsky, assistant principal at McKinsey. They are trying 
to get the club "restarted" again. They are planning on having some
social events next year, as well as some speaker events. The club
is partially supported by the school. I will be providing them with
the email addresses of all wharton undergraduates here at Enron, 
as well as in other companies. Would you like to be in their distribution
list? The club is for undergrads as well as for grads.

Let me know what you think.

I'm here!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ( I have a meeting at 2 in my office for about 
30mins, then I may be out of here for the day!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)   Come by.  If 
you are still hungry we have some sausage pizza with canadian bacon with your

this weekend in so crazy.  We will have to do something really fun when you 
get back.  where are you going for so long?  I just got out of a three hour 
meeting.  It was so freaking boring that I wrote a long letter to my best 
friend from college.  About 15 minutes pertained to me.  To top it off, for 
lunch they had four sausage pizzas.  Yum.  Who the hell orders that?  
anyway...
write me.  I have to come pick u pa candy apple from the hyatt, but it is at 
Yolandas desk near you.  when will you be there?  I'll come say hi!

Emergency calls are great.  Used it, but dinner was quick.  So the kids 
singing wasn't as good as barbara streisand's singing prayer songs?  I'm sure 
it was fun, though.  

Jeff is the king.  Already left him a message.  
I'm out dec 19-28, so do you want to try to do something this weekend--FUN.  
(I have a party to go to sat eve for a little while)  
How's the day going?  Did you talk to Beth about Pinnacle?

Alexandra Saler@EES
12/13/2000 08:31 AM
Did you use the emergency call?  I almost called you on your cell phone in 
case you needed another out!  I didn't get anything else at Saks but after 
the singing I got the stuff an Neiman's that I needed.  I had a freak out 
attack though b/c I thought I lost the Saks bag with the $600 bracelet in it 
and was running around Neiman's like an idiot.  Then I remembered that I 
DROVE from Saks to Neiman's and it was in my car.  I think I was just a 
little bit on edge last night!  I met my friend at Barnaby's for dinner and 
then got under the covers and finished my book.  It was great.  By the way, I 
wish I dragged you to the singing b/c Sarah, the 10 month old cutest baby on 
the planet was there.  She was clapping and singing along the whole time 
which was the cutest thing especially b/c she was on my lap the entire time.  
It was worth sitting through a horrible rendition of every Hanukkah song you 
have ever heard! 

How about your buddy Jeff!!!!  Have you congratulated him yet?  That is great!

That glass of wine did the trick--I felt better  (more relaxed too!)  Dinner 
was boring--so I got home and had another glass of wine!  

What are the developments?  Let's start talking.

Jeff, I enjoyed visiting with you last week.  Subsequent to our meeting, I
did speak at greater length with our physical and derivatives traders.
There are developments which  may well provide for our examining ways to
work together on OTC, risk management and clearing collectively.  How would
you like to proceed?

not only in the previous 24 hours, but also ever.  Also, I want to know if 
products come down before they expire.  Thanks  Jeff

   

Jeff,

Steel has been removed and a second worksheet has been added which shows new 
products made available in the past 24 hours which were not available in the 
previous 24 hour period.  Let us know if this is sufficient or if you would 
like to see additional information added to the report.  

Thanks,
Pete

Jeffrey A Shankman@ECT

Steel is not part of global markets, and if you could take it off this 
report, I'd appreciate it.  Also, Please add a section that shows new 
products as we add them to the portfolio.  

Thanks.  Jeff

Dear Camille,
?
I appreciate any assistance or advice you could  give about?career 
opportunities at Enron.? Even though my experience  reside in Natural Gas, I 
am very interested in expanding my career into other  commodities.? I know 
that Enron leads the energy industry as far as  offering cutting edge 
products to the market place.
?
I have attached my resume?as we  discussed.
?
Also, I have provided some additional information  about my background below:
I am a highly successful sales and marketing  professional.? I have over nine 
years  experience and a proven track record in the Natural Gas Industry.? My  
experience ranges from marketing, origination,?running a desk and profit  
center in trading, market making, and management.? Most recently I ran a  
regional trading desk and profit center?at TXU Energy Trading.? My  
responsibilities included managing both a financial and physical trading  
book.? I made nine million dollars in marked-to-market profits over the  last 
three years.? My experience includes the trading?of financial  natural gas 
swaps, utilizing derivatives, and movement of physical gas.? I  have 
demonstrated performance as a competent trader and desk head.? In  addition, 
I have participated as part of the management team at TXU Energy  Trading for

(put rest here)

Dear Larry,

Thanks for the opportunity to discuss your risk management needs yesterday.  
Continental has been very successful in hedging fuel, and I think we can add 
even more value as we explore your basis risks.  I've asked Mark Tawney, 
Director of Weather Risk Management, to come up with some ideas possibly 
linking weather to fuel, and explore our insurance and tax opportunities.  
His organization is the best in the industry, and is doing cutting edge 
research.  

We didn't have the chance to talk about any V@R analysis needs you have, but 
I'd be happy to get our research team involved as we grow our corporate 
relationship.  If there is anything else I can do, please call. 

It's great to have a the best airline in the country be the local carrier.  
Again thanks for your time.

Regards,

 

Great....Looking forward to it.

Jeff- Hi- 

WE finally started trading with them- have done some Brent/ WTI and heating 
oil.

Jason Hotra- the younger trader is coming into the Houston office tomorrow 
all day with me- I was hoping he could come into the crude meeting-

Would this be OK? We'd have to announce him to all the traders- it would be a 
great forum for him to get a feel for what we are doing.

Sorry for last minute- 

Per probably told you they are very interested in the syndication deal he is 
working.

On other fund fronts: Tudor started trading Brent with us and is putting on a 
large position in nat gas/ heat.

We have documents signed with 3 other funds - ready to roll on Jan1

On funds and metals, I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes.

Thanks and Regards,
Caroline

kidding...but that would be really fun.  anyway, I have a situation to talk 
to you about later.  I need some good advice.

are you better today?  what are you doing for lunch?  did anything good get 
delivered???

Hi, thanks for the update.  Per was in Houston last week,  and I've asked
him to get with you soon.  Please call him (he should be expecting your

Quick update.  I called Jeff to see if is going to be in NY next week, his
sec. said that he's out of the office today and apparently not scheduled to
be in NY next week.  I am hoping that we will talk soon.  No call for Per
(sp?) in the NY office.  Hope you are well,

I saw him this morn, and asked if he called you.  call him tomorrow or
thurs, and i'll follow up......

Jeff,
Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always
recommend
buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.

Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
have fun in London.

Attached is a revised 4th Qtr. outlook schedule with potential write-offs 
included as discussed this morning.  We will be verifying these amounts over 
the next few days and I will let you know if there are any changes.  Let me 
know if you have any questions or comments

So timely to receive your email today.  I was just thinking about you this 
past weekend, hoping everything was going well.

Hi Jeff -

Hope all is well with you.  I wanted to send you a graphic depiction
of the Roadwave Glovebox Microwave.

All the best,

Yehuda

Please expect a call from Joe Hartsoe in the very near future.  His 
background lends itself to our businesses, and he is looking to add some 
commercial experience to his c.v.  Thanks for taking the time to meet with 
Joe.

Hey Jeff, could we set up a short meeting to talk about the status of the 
Elba off-take strategy? I'll have Christy set us up sometime this week. 
Thanks.

Janet,

I wanted to drop you a quick note.  Things have been progressing nicely 
between the LNG guys and Southern Company.  The LNG guys asked me if ENA 
needed to get some MTM from Elba, they would be willing to quicken the pace 
on putting a deal together.  Probably rushing is not in the best interest of 
Enron buy it could be done.  Anyhow, I have legal and structuring working on 
this and we may need you to help negotiate a transfer price between ENA and 
Enron Global at some point.

I think no matter what happens prospectvely at Elba, Southern Co has probably 
saved the LNG group up to $50MM of capital clean up their off spec gas along 
with provided a much better price of Hub +$.12 vs our current put option of 
Hub + $.02 with El Paso which is an additional $36.5 MM improvement.  Let me 
know what you thoughtsare.

Thanks.

 

So the impaler might not have been too dramatic!  Have fun tonight!

how was your weekend?  how was Philly?  I want to hear about the party.  I 
heard you got out of making a speech!  Emma's naming was really nice.  I am 
kind of overdosed on family, but my mom is here until tomorrow so guess what 
I am doing tonight????  Tomorrow night one of the little ones is singing at 
the Galleria, and Thursday another one has the staring role in Guys and 
Dolls.  She is actually a great little actress.  Am I the best cousin or 
what?  I schlep to all this stuff!  I really do love it though.  

What is new with you?

Thanks for the info.  I will give him a call.  

Rottenburg has not called me recently.  After reflection, that seems wierd.  
He used to call me pretty often.  If you want someone to go to lunch with him 
and pump him for info, let me know.  He lives around the corner from me.  It 
wouldn't be obvious.  

Joe

Joe,  

Saar Banin's work number in the UK at Goldman is 0207 774 6181.  He had been 
in metals for them for some time, and just moved over to gas and power (in 
the UK)  He's an aggressive, smart guy who I've known for 10 years.  Top 
notch.

Hope all is well

Jeff

PS  has Doug Rottenburg been calling anyone over there?  We haven't heard a

Apologies for not sending this sooner - wrote it a few days ago...but just 
some of my thoughts on the general marketing question for the group. May be 
useful background reading for you

When someone starts an email as you did, I think I have an idea of what you 
are going to say.  

We need to talk.  I have a dinner meeting tonight.  Should be home sometime
after 9pm.  (I may come back to the office afterward but probably won't.)

What do you mean funds are being told...?

   

	

According to sources, funds are being told this morning that OPEC is likely 
to cut production by 800,000 - 1 million b/d in Q1 2001, no later than the 
end of February.  Most likely scenario as of now is that OPEC will hold an 
extraordinary meeting in February to make the decision.  In the unlikely 
event that prices continue to slide significantly, the decision might be 
moved up to the January 17 meeting.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 49/2000

Highlight

The freight market for cape and panamax size vessels appear to be on the 
verge of a significant downward correction.  The news from Japan and the 
Asian economies as a whole is bleak with fear of more bankruptcies looming 
and low to flat growth projections. Furthermore, the US economy is showing 
strong signs that it has peaked.  As a result, ship owners are openly worried 
about demand for next year and are desperately seeking cargo contracts while 
rates are still attractive.  The cape time charter rate has lost more than $ 
3,000 over the last 3 weeks and Panamaxes have lost $ 1,500.  On the cape 
side, Bocimar is unable to prevent the index sliding even though they still 
control 60 ships ( on Friday index fell 33 pts, single biggest point drop 
ever recorded ) and other owners are fighting for the few spot cargoes still 
unfixed before the Christmas break. 

Of significance, we fixed on subs a four cargo contract with Bao Steel ( one 
of the biggest Chinese steel mills ) that runs into March 2002 from Brazil 
into China and also fixed a a four panamax contract with Adaro from Indonesia 
to Spain, which is on subs until or if Adaro sells the coal into Spain.

I have just received from Jeff Shankman's office under a cover letter dated 
November 9, 2000 a draft of a Gifting Agreement between The Wharton School 
and Enron, outlining a gift of $1,000,000 to Wharton for its eBusiness 
Initiative at the Corporate Partner level. The draft reflects that we would 
pay $250,000 for each of the next 4 years, commencing in December 2000.  My 
understanding is that Jeff Shankman and Jeff Skilling have approved of this 
gift.

Before we finalize this arrangement, are you aware of any 
issues/matters/provisions that Enron typically attempts to deal with in these 
types of gifting arrangements? I just want to make sure that we don't 
overlook anything material. If you would like to see a copy of the draft 
Agreement, I can have it delivered to you.

Your prompt reply is appreciated.Thanks.

Best Regards, Alan

Your thoughts are dead on.  Russel would be a great guy to cover those guys 
for EGM for crude and products.  Please mention to Caroline we are not trying 
to crowd her out, just get more depth on funds coverage.  Also, when we talk 
about other GRM products, it will help to have more fund coverage.  (We can 
also address her issue later--I agree with you on that.)  Proceed, but I'm 
not sure about the JV with ENA issue.  Let's not go down that road 
"officially".

By the way, rough is spelled roof.

Later.....

Jeff

I know you're busy so here are my thoughts.

The hedge fund business has expanded enough to warrant at least two people 
covering it. It makes sense that Enron has one person focussed on the natgas 
business since it is 90% of what we book right now. We're also about to get 
one of the funds trading power.  Caroline Abramo focusses on this and will 
continue to do so reporting to Fred. If for some reason that relationship 
doesn't work out, we can revisit it with her at that time.

To build up the crude oil and products trading we should have a similar 
person devoted to covering the hedge funds. That person should work for GM 
and work in partnership with ENA, kind of a JV between our groups, but with 
the origination for each product staying with the appropriate business unit, 
as you plan to do.  Given that, I would recommend putting Russell Dyk in that 
role, have him spend the next 2 months working on the crude desk to kick 
start the coverage and then move him to NY. He and Caroline would share the 
hedge fund client base and back each other up when busy or travelling. If we 
need more support, we can add an associate to work for them jointly in NY. 
Overall, we're leveraging our hedge fund relationships to generate more 
origination income for Enron.

This model also fits with the reality of hedge fund coverage at Enron, i.e. 
you need marketers with specific product knowledge close to the trading desks 
dealing direct with the fund traders. Enron Metals has their own people doing 
this today. We're simply expanding the concept to GM. Ultimately, when we get 
Enron under one rough in NY, the metals, oil and gas specialists woukld be 
able to jointly cover the clients, while providing market expertise as needed.

If you agree this makes sense, then I can tell Fred that we plan to put our 
own person in NY.

What do you think? I can stop by to discuss further any time today.

Per  

Yes.

Sorry it's been so hard.  Nothing meant by it.  To where are you moving?

Hey Jeff.  You're a tough date.  Call me when you have time to go out--lunch
or drinks.  I am moving from Houston next week, so hopefully it can be soon.
Just wanted to catch up with you.  Could also use your advice on possible
opportunities out there.

Thanks,

Liquids VaR for effective date Dec. 06 is $8.5MM, a seven percent violation 
of its limit.  The cause of the violation was due to the following factors.
Company wide crude position got shorter 6.3MM barrels
Short NG from Jan-Feb-01 of 1.2 BCF.  (EOL trade placed in error, position 
Nowlan intended for was 10 contracts/month instead of 10 contract/day.)

With component VaR attached below, it is clear that crude product resulted 
the most VaR increase.  Keeping everything constant, if Nowlan gets out of 
his NG position, VaR would be $7.8MM.

Thursday Dec 7, 2000 in room 8c1 from 3:30 to 5.

Thanks for the email.  Actually, you are completely wrong about my view of 
Joe.  He has tremedous integrity, and is a very strong team builder, and has 
added much value to our organization.  I was however a little surprised by 
your move to go from a trading position to an analysis position.  I would 
have been thrilled to have you help me design a position for you in that kind 
of capacity here, or in london, or elsewhere if you liked.  In addition, I 
could have talked to you about a junior trading spot in crude and products.  
(Which I will remind you about frequently)

I'm sure your decision will prove valuable to Joe, and hopefully to you as 
well.  Mike and I would like to see you back on the A-team though--we both 
respect your business sense.

As far as the guilt thing goes, I can't help you.  I'm Jewish and our people 
have suffered much longer than everyone else combined.

Jeff,
As you are aware, in Houston, there is a preferred distribution for the 
entire company.   That being said,  I am not involved in the  process for the 
Associates and Analysts in London.  We simply receive a copy of their 
results.  I am not sure how they are handling their process.  I suggest you 
contact John Sherriff, Drew Lynch or Sophie Kingsley in the London office.

   
	
	

What's the story with this
	
	

Gentlemen,

Attached is a memo from Shane (he runs my group in London) describing how the 
London AA representative conducted the PRC process.  They ranked everyone 
ordinally then simply applied  the distribution and --- end of process.  This 
is a forced distribution and two of my people fell one rank.  As you both 
know, I have a problem with this and I think you should as well.

Gary
 
Shane Dallmann
12/06/2000 01:29 PM
Gary,

The pre-ranking meeting was held on Friday. The analysts and Associates for 
our group were assessed with the Traders for the first time.
The process was that a piece of paper was handed out showing the number of 
analysts and associates for each different class i.e trading, origination, 
finance, tech support etc and the forced distribution of rankings that would 
be followed for each group (I will get a copy of the sheet and fax it to 
you). We were told to rank all the Analysts (then after the Associates) from 
top to bottom and these were fitted to the distribution according to the 
sheet we were given with no deviation from the distribution shown on the 
sheet. We were told the names of the categories meant nothing and were just 
groupings ie "Has Issues" did not mean this it just meant the bottom two or 
three people of the distribution.The electricity desks had already had 
pre-meetings in which they fitted their own people and they expected every 
other group to fit their people similiarly.

The three A&A people we have here in London were all allocated "Excellent" 
ratings prior to the meeting but due to forced ranking of people to the 
defined distribution two of these were moved down to "Strong".

I am sorry that I did not send this email on Monday.

Regards,
Shane  

Gary, 

That was a great presentation.  Thanks for the update.

   
	
	

Gentlemen,

 The meeting today with our equity traders should be an informal discussion.  
My intention is to encourage you to get to know them, to educate you about 
how they run their separate businesses and to discuss future prospects of the 
fund.  Although we will be touching on some heavy topics, such as accepting 
third party money, the tone of the meeting should be relaxed, informative and 
a good debate.  I will be sending you a presentation shortly.

Thanks,

Gary

Happy Valentines Day.  I was in New York this weekend for halley and
Michael's Valentines day brunch.  halley mentioned that she would try to
get in touch with you for me.  I received an email from her yesterday
suggesting that I call you in order to arrange a trip down to Houston to
meet some people at Enron.  However, I do not have your office number

requesting, if possible a reply containing a number at which you can be
reached.  I will call you and we can then work out plans for a visit.

They are looking at trading advertising time.  Ed Ondarza may be the guy.  
I'd be happy to introduce you to him, if you'd like.

Jeff

okay-i have a question-have you heard anything about a new group in Broadband 
that will be trading commercial air time?
I believe it involves Edward Andarza and some other guy named Ben Freeman. I 
thought it might be of interest to someone with 
a communications background, that purchased television air time.....

thanks-Kim

Dec.  7 & 8, in Philadelphia.  On Thursday night there is a cocktail 
reception for introduction of the panelists and networking with students.  It 
is from 7-10 at the Park Hyatt Bellevue (same hotel where we are staying).  
We have dinner reservations at 9pm to take the students who receive offers 
from us to dinner at Le Bec Fin.  On Friday the conference begins at 9am 
(breakfast/checkin is 8-9).  Your panel, Corporate Finance, is from 9-10:30.  
Other panelists are Riccardo Guglielmetti - Dresdner Kleinwort Benson Equity 
Capital, Brian Heese -  Merrill Lynch VP, Debt Capital Markets, Joel Van Duse 
- Bank of America Co-head Consumer Products and Retail Investment Banking and 
someone to be named from JP Morgan Chase.  Topics of discussion include the 
state of the industry and critical issues, the impact of technology on 
corporate finance, how capital markets and corporate finance interact with 
the rest of Enron and career paths and profiles of individuals choosing this 
sector.  For the last part I'll try to track down the career paths of a few 
people to talk about.  

I will be arriving in Philadelphia on Thursday afternoon.  We have already 
reserved a hotel room for you and will send you the confirmation 
information.  Will you be coming from Houston or Sao Paulo?

I look forward to meeting you next week.

I'm working on the Enron case study for Harvard B-school and Cindy
Derecskey mentioned that you could help me.

When we met with Rick Buy, he mentioned that in 1994, when he joined Enron,
there were about 10 people in the credit group.  I'd like to get a sense of
how fast that group grew, and, as I understand, metamorphosed into a
sophisticated risk management group.  How many people are in the risk
management group now?

If you prefer to answer this vie phone, please feel free to call me at
617-496-0802.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you!

The purpose of this email is to notify you and obtain your feedback and 
interest level on the above referenced visit. 

Dow Chemical has requested a visit to Enron on Jan. 23rd from 5:30 pm to 7:00 
pm.  Dow is looking at ways to speed up their supply chain manufacturing 
process.   Eighty of their global operations leaders want to visit Enron and 
learn how Enron has moved from an old economy business model to a new economy 
business model and the impact of that change on Enron's operations and 
organization.   The Dow operations people are in Houston for their annual 
Operational Leadership conference being held in the Woodlands.

Also, Jeff Skilling will be speaking to another Dow Chemical commercial group 
in late April as well as a having a one on one meeting with Dow's CEO to 
discuss how Enron and Dow can work closer together.   

At your earliest convenience, please let me know your feedback.  

Thank you

I'm not sure our plan is to collapse the LNG shipping group into coal (I 
presume you mean under Pierre).  However, we have to look at our internal and 
external options.  If you look at the structure of  the exmar vessell it is 
certainly far from ideal for enron.  In fact it appears to be quite 
one-sided.  First we must look at what we want this group to be, and examine 
what skills each of the internal players can bring to the table--(including 
Pierre and Wayne).  Second estabish internal procedure, and trading 
capabilities.  Third, execute.  I would agree that LNG shipping is a unique 
animal, but before we hire anyone externally, I'd like to get everyone 
together to discuss the most appropriate way forward.

Thanks.  Jeff

Further to my voicemail yesterday, I understand through Eric that 
consideration is being given to collapsing the LNG shipping responsibilities 
into the coal group.  I believe that this would be a mistake.  Eric and I 
have been talking about this for some time and have defined and are 
implementing an organizational plan that we both believe is a good one.  I 
would like the opportunity to talk this through with you before you make any 
irreversible decisions.

Great.  I'm sure in the new organization you'll do extremely well.  Mike and 
I have a lot of faith in your abilities.

Would like to talk again this week - I plan to get to Houston/London in the 
beginning of January and want to consider a path to start thinking on now - 
if I do make a change (or it is forced on me).

By the bye, a former analyst of mine says that you all might enter the 
fertilizer business...I tried to get Houston to enter it a year and a half 
ago - we ran the correlations and had a global market study done (Chem 
Systems - An IBM company).  The corr that Grant ran between ammonia/urea to 
corn was high (like above 92% if I recall)...we looked at investing in a 
plant here in Argentina (obviously significant supply/demand mix of 
agriculture and fert products in Arg/Brazil) at that time and were analyzing 
a potential hedge - I killed it because it was not competitive let alone the 
lack of interest in Houston...The market is on the way up...as long as you 
stick to the base products - pure fert futures never made a go from what I 
was told...take care...

Please let me know when you are available...

Thanks,
jf

Hi guys,

Shawn Cumberlan, the former head of the CALME region, is very interested in 
learning about the transportation businesses we are pursuing.  He will be in 
London end of next week or so and I'd like you guys to spend some time with 
him.  

Dan, expect a call from him before he heads to London.  Mark Frevert is 
having him explore opportunities within the wholesale businesses.

Later,

Jeff

I'd love to fly dan down (at our expense) to have him meet some appropriate 
people.  Let him know he should call me to figure out the best  time to get 
him down here....have to go now though.......hugs    Jeff

Jeff...Watch out for an e-mail from me or Michael called something like
"check out". Do not open. It's the horrible virus they have been talking
about in the news and unfortunately my assistant opened it so it is now
automatically sent to everyone in our address books...sorry!

Also, on Sunday at our Valentine's brunch, Dan Fuller asked that I speak
with you regarding summer position. I think he has e-mailed you in the
past couple of weeks.  He wants to firm us his plans for the summer and
was hoping Enron was still a possibility. Sorry to be a pain!

Missed you on Sunday but I hope we'll see you soon.    halley

I have McKinsey sending over another Glass Market presentation, and you 
should have it shortly....

Jeff

Hey, I'll be around this weekend, trying to get myself together.  I can't 
tell you how overwhelmed I've felt recently, and I think our conversation 
while I was awol (in NY for the day last weekend) really got to me.  I'll 
tell you this weekend about my meeting with my the shrink the other day.  
(The part where I'm NOT good at compartmentalizing).  I think that threw me 
for a loop too.  Oh, your message got to me this morn.  Please don't ever 
think you are bothering me.  I guess I'm a little less mature about my 
emotions than I thought.  (I know this is all personal, but email seems to be 
a little easier for me to communicate this to you right now).  I'm not sure 
that my home number is on yet, so the cell phone is where I'll be.  Thanks 
for checking up on me.

We are pleased to announce the following within EGM:

The Convertible Bond Arbitrage desk will be moving from EnronCredit.com to 
the Equity desk under Gary Hickerson, and will be managed by Mike Bradley.  
Billy Lemmons has joined Gary Hickerson's unit as well.  He is exploring the 
agriculture value chain and outlining our risk management, (What else here?)

Dan Reck will be transitioning out of the coal group and will be exploring 
our rail and trucking initiatives.  These markets together represent 
approximately $105 billion notionally, and we believe there are many 
synergies between our energy, coal, and freight trading businesses.  In 
addition, we have asked (Pierre Aury to run our worldwide vessel trading 
businesses.  Scott Moncrief will be responsible for all liquids vessel 
businesses reporting to Pierre)  (should we mention cement here under george 
mclellan?)

Our worldwide weather operations will continue to report to Mark Tawney in 
Houston, and he will have all V@R  allocation responsibility between Sydney, 
Tokyo, Oslo, and Houston.  In addition we will be forming a weather marketing 
desk in London.

Janelle Scheuer will be joining the Global Products from Enron America's East 
power origination group, and is responsible for developing a mid-market 
business specifically for our liquids businesses.  She will be reporting to 
John Nowlan.  Bill White will be coming over from EBS and has responsiblity 
for all U.S. financial crude trading.  Don Schroeder will continue to have 
oversight of our physical crude business.  

Anything else?

Let's get together and get this traders' roundtable going.  I propose:  You, 
me Lavo (if he's interested), Vince K, John Arnold, Phillip Allen, Mike 
Grigsby, (those three from US gas), Rogers Hearndon, and Fletch Sturm (East 
Power), Mike Bradley, John Nowlan,.  This list covers gas, power, 
crude/products, rates, and vince's economic views.  Any other 
people/groups/commodities we should have represented?

Jeff

How's it going?  I'm sure busy and great.  Good luck with the ice men--I 
still think you should cut something.  I'm excited to finish unpacking this 
weekend, and just relaxing a little.  If you're not completely wiped on

my house?  Great, thanks. 
Have fun!

information mentioned below.  Enron University Affairs, Ken Lay, Jeff 
Skilling, Andy Fastow and Gene Humphrey have been working with Harvard 
Business School, specifically Chris Bartlett and Meg Wozny of Harvard, on a 
case study of Enron.  This study is in its last phase and the only 
'roadblock' is gathering additional information.  In particular, Harvard 
would like information on the 'size and growth of the risk management group'. 
 

This information will help facilitate drawing an effective comparison of the 
'old' Enron and the 'new' Enron.

it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then customers. 
The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is 
questionable.  I vote to kill it.

Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with 
my partners.

Regards
Delainey

confidential info.

JS;
I think Clay should sit with my group and become more involved in our daily 
reports. I also believe his skills would be best used by developing some more 
detailed analyses
What do you think
JF

Thanks for the reminder.  Yes I'd like to be included in your jan 1, 2001 
contribution.  I will attend to this with the necessary paperwork in mid

Jeff,
A)   I hope you received the courier delivered envelope re:the Range Rover

meet tomorrow -
   I do fully recognize the many requests for your time and trust this will 
not preclude me    chatting with you again shortly.

Boy did I unpack last night.  I couldn't go to sleep so I went a little 
crazy.  Tuesday is good.  we could have a frasier marathon.  Which one of us 
is cooking at my house?  

Would it be crazy if I asked you to be my guest at the wholesale christmas 
party next sat?  (Nothing like email to ask that sort of question, and I 
certainly don't mean to be impersonal about it)

I have to head home to work out for a few hours....

Alexandra Saler@EES
11/29/2000 09:00 AM
This week is crazy...as you know.  Let's get together next week.  I have book 
club Monday and Wednesday, so probably Tuesday or Thursday would be better.  
Of course if it is Tuesday....we can watch Frasier!

You know Jeff, I was thinking this morning about what a great time I have 
with you.  I am so happy that we have gotten to know eachother.  Having guy 
friends is something that I have missed out on for the past two and a half 
years.  I am really happy to have that back in my life.  

My meeting at the crack of dawn went well this morning.  I got here before 
7.  Needless to say I am tired!  Of course, I stayed up reading my cheezy 
book last night.  Did you unpack when you got home?  

I had so much fun last night!  WHEN can we do it again?

PLEASE call me Jeff.  When I'm old, grey, and heavier, then you call use a 
more formal salutation.  
Great to meet you too, and I'll be in touch shortly.

Jeff

Thanks for the email.  I'm not in love with this deal, and Nowlan is not 
inclined to do it, but we will have Pierre look at it.  By the way, it was 72 
and sunny at my new house.  That is the forecast forever there.

Hey - have you made a decision on this product tanker thing?  I returned 
today to three Joe King emails in my inbox.  

Proposed rate structure from Trader Nav is $13,750 year 1 + an additional 
$250/day for each subsequent year.

Rate increase explained as such:  "As anticipated, due to the pressure on the 
yards for the berth availability, prices have increased somewhat, but still 
they are within a range that, in
our opinion, are very competitive when considering the market conditions."

Joe also sent along a Poten&Partners study about the proposed acceleration of 
vessel phase-outs due to the Erika disaster.

If you're still looking at this, I suppose I'm not saying that I don't have 
time to take another look at this, but...

M

ps. London is nice and rainy today.  I just thought you might like to know 
what you are missing here!
 

I had so much fun last night!  WHEN can we do it again?

fyi

I'm not happy today.  Going back to last night, I got home, fell asleep on 
the couch in the new house, went upstairs at 4, and slept til 830.  Late all 
day, and just had a pretty crappy meeting with one of my direct reports and 
Jeff Skilling.  I can't describe the weight of the world feeling I have, and 
I'm not good at not being in control.  I wish I had the answers.

How are you?

How's it going?

please get on distribution and put on web site.   thanks.  Jeff

SUMMARY

ATLANTIC

Mixed signals coming from the market at present with Billiton approaching us 
to buy FOB stem at RBCT for a cargo each Q2/Q3 and were active for the first 
time in a while in the SECA market buying up 2nd half 2001 material. 
Meanwhile there remains to be South African resell tonnage coming our way - 
predominantly appearing by way of the Spanish utilities who continue to have 
excellent hydro levels and ourability to source South African Call Options on 
FOB RBCT level with strike of $32.50 seems to question the recent information 
that Billitonsold tonnage at $33.25 equivalent into European consumers for 
the rest of the year Furthermore for the first time this year we begin to see 
Colombian resell material appearing on the market both on a CIF and FOB basis 
- probably no coincidence that this comes at a time when some of the steam 
seems to have come off the U.S. spot market. Overall the tone seems to be 
firmer but with very few new fundamental inputs to fuel this but rather 
producer sentiment  After weeks of tentatively drifting south the SECA market 
traded up a dollar along the whole curve last week. This was really a 
consequence of a few looking to buy into a market void of sellers which was 
itself is directly a function of peoples unwillingness to further sponsor a 
market which has come down some $5 from it's high's. The spot market is now 
trading at $40.50 Fob barge Rotterdam, 2nd half of the year at $40.25 and 
then 2002 at $39.50.

PACIFIC

Despite the extensive coverage which the Far East seems to be attracting with 
regards to economic slowdowns/weakness the Pacificmarket continues to be 
tight. The JSM/Producers continue their annual negotiations, but expect to 
see few conclusions from these in theshort term as the JSM's continue to 
exercise all the options they have to keep the drip feed going and most have 
clauses in their contractswhich allow them to carry on shipping material 
despite any agreement until September time. Both KEPCO and Lafarge have come 
out with tenders for the delivery of coal for prompt shipment - it is 
definitely a sign of progress that we are being invited to bid but without 
any length with which to play with, going short in front of Glencore and Rio 
could be expensive - the plan will be to participate without winning the 
business. The Chinese Annual Coal Fair took place over the last cuppla weeks 
where contracts for 2001 are negotiated and various sectors lobbyfor their 
allocation on infrastructure. The major takeaway's from the meeting were that 
total production is estimated at 950 million mt for 2001with exports targeted 
at 63 million mt - up 5 million mt from last year. Despite increased export 
targets, the sentiment remains bullish with most producers asking between $29 
and $31 representing a $3/$4 increase versus 2000 prices. Strong domestic 
prices will limit any downside in the export market and while the government 
is keen to keep pushing exports there is a general  scepticism over the 
ability of the rail to move the projected tonnage. We have signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding with a producer based in Inner Mongolia (ZCIC)to 
market upto 1 million mt per year into the export market - all going well 
this will provide us with the necessary length to be able to target business 
in the region more aggressively.

GAMEPLAN

We continue to try and take advantage of this mismatch between the origin 
markets and the European market by selling out of origin lengthand using the 
resell market to pick up tonnage to service our commitments at destination. 
We are working several bits of long-term destinationbusiness in the Atlantic 
which if successful will serve as a melting pot for any length we have 
remaining in that basin and more. We will alsolook to sell into any further 
rally in the destination SECA mkt. Despite fundamentals in Asia pointing to a 
slowdown in demand the consolidation we are seeing in Australia will 
certainly prevent any collapse in prices and short-term expect prices to head 
higher than the $30 I wud call FOB Newcastle today. It will be very difficult 
for us to get any ammunition for the near-term but we are looking at various 
projects which will again give us access to coal further out in the curve and 
at the same time are exploring any opportunity to own some optionality to 
give us some protection against a continued squeeze further out in the curve.

Jez

I have tried to reach all of you by phone or left a voice mail to schedule an 
appointment with Fred Kelly before the final PRC on Dec. 13.  He feels it is 
very important that he meet with you and your supervisor before Dec 13.  
Please call me at X66157 to schedule a time .  Attached is a "cheat sheet" 
that Fred would like you to fill out and email or bring to him.

If you have already set up a meeting please disregard this email.

Thank you.

let's set up a video call and check this out.  what are your thoughts?

I think we will see many exchanges with weather contracts in Europe next 
year. I've heard about 6 different ones so far.  One of the problems we will 
run into is that they all look into different way of setting up contracts.  
That can create a situation where we don't get anyone to concentrate about 
any "standard" solution.  By cooperating with them can we probably control 
the development, but we can also try to keep them in the "dark" so we get 
people to use EOL more.  I would tend to lean to the last option right now, 
and see how it goes

Thor

Thanks for the update.  I think it shows how starved for new products these 
exchanges are.  I'm not a fan of teaming up with these kinds of entities.  
It's unclear what they bring, and how does this help us?  what do you think?

What's your general opinion about linking EOL to other Exchanges when it 
comes to Weather contracts?

Meeting with the Helsinki Stock Exchange (HEX) went well and the future 
opportunities for both parties were discussed. They were very eager to list 
HDD swaps (and options at the Exchange) and this should be done by this 
coming spring. 

Below some bullet points from the meeting:

"deadline is spring
Enron as one of the market makers
They would need our help in formulating the product descriptions for the 
local authorities in Finland
They are looking at listing a few points in Finland to start with and then 
maybe adding other Nordic / European points 
They will provide clearing services for the products 
They will also market the products and give training to institutions as well 
as private investors/hedgers

Next steps:

They will contact other players regarding the weather derivatives. However, 
it seems that they see us as "the one" in this market and therefore would 
like us to help them out in the beginning. 

They will get back to us during this month to give us an update and outline 
the future process in more detail.

How do you feel about this? Are we interested in becoming a market maker? 
I feel that it would a great opportunity for us i.e. increased liquidity and 
they would do most of the marketing and training. They are also in a co-op 
with Eurex, which could open more doors for us in the continental market.

great.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 46/2000

Highlight

The panamax market has fallen about $1,000 over the last two weeks on basis 
of time charter rates.  For next year, owners have turned on average quite 
bearish and several are calling us directly to offer us their vessels at 
discounted numbers.  Interestingly, cape vessel owners have been watching the 
falling panamax market with trepidation.  Currently, the spread between the 
two sectors is about $13,000.  Over the last three days, time charter rates 
for cape size vessel for 12 months starting in January 2001 have dropped by 
approximately $1200 and brokers attribute the rapid decline to the 
unsustainable spread between the two vessel types.

Of significant interest this week, Bocimar called us to price put options for 
them.  They told us that they wanted some protection for next year but could 
not buy puts or sell swaps in the market place for fear of creating a panic 
selling mode from owners.  We offered them some prices which they told us 
were too expensive but we are still in discussion.  Our problem is that we do 
not want to diminish our short position for next year so in offering put 
options to Bocimar, we also want to keep selling the underlying - and that 
might be challenging as the market is very illiquid and there are not too 
many bids for next year at good selling numbers.

We are currently continuing to build a short position on panamaxes and are 
offering rates to AK Steel from Brazil to US gulf for their iron ore 
contracts and also offering Sidmar ( the Belgian steel mill ) some rates from 
Brazil into Gent.  We might join forces with Coeclerici on several of these 
tenders to mitigate the risk and also to share market information.

last but not least, we are studying the idea of taking a cape new building 
delivery 2003/2004 on time charter for 8 years with ability to extend for 
three additional years and the ability to buy the vessel after year three in 
Japanese yen.  The time charter rate is very attractive when compared to the 
average time charter rate of this size vessel over the last 5 and 10 years.  
Will keep you posted.

Good afternoon Ida  (better name for you than me).  EC was uneventful, given 
that I wore no crazy hat.  At the right time though.  I know the party will 
be great--try not to stress too much, besides your plans sounded great and 
I'm sure everyone will have a great time.  I'm leaving in a little while to 
go to the closing ( and collect some cash!), and am out the rest of the 
afternoon--cruising in the ida-mobile!  In case you were wondering, I used 
almost  a half mile of bubble wrap yesterday moving my art to the new house 
and will recycle it if there are some cool kid things to do with it.  Ideas? 

Later.

11/27/2000 11:35 AM
how was the EC meeting this morning?  did you wear funky shoes or a hat?  I 
have had a crazy morning.  so much is going on for this weekend.  
I trying not to stress, but I already have some butterflies.  I know 
everything is going to be great, there are just so many pieces to keep track 
of.  I have a meeting this afternoon with about 10 people on my event team, 
so I'll feel better when that is over.

I am glad that you brought the Ida mobile b/c it is going to be gorgeous 
today!  what time is your closing?  good luck with that.

Shanna,

I have two personnel that we need to place on contract.

Ted Noble was promoted to manager at year-end.  I need to put him on a one 
year contract.

Eric Scott is an analyst.  You know the story.  I need a one year contract 
for him too.  Is the "Trader Track" available for Eric?

Thanks,

Gary

tried, but no can do.  call me, though.  

Jeff:
Any chance you can hook me up through your friend with 4 Saturday Night Live
tickets for Dec. 2?  I'm surprising Samantha with a trip to New York that
weekend.  (She's never been, and I have decided to stop being the shame of
my family for not taking her).

You have been nominated to participate in a video which will be shown during 
the Houston analyst meeting. The objective of the video is to demonstrate the 
depth, diversity and transferability of Enron people. The video will be shown 
early in the day's presentations and will also help set up the theme for the 
day which is Execute and Extend.

I am attaching a briefing note which outlines the questions that we would 
like you to answer on video. In addition I would be grateful if you could 
supply me with a map of your career - ie a list of all the business units and 
associated groups in which you have held positions at  Enron.   

Laura Valencia  - Houston ( Ext 3-6785)  or Fiona Grant - London (Ext 5308)  
will be calling you to  schedule a specific date and time for the shoot.

Many thanks for your help with this video.
If you have any questions please call me on 3-4785.

Jeff,

Last week we discussed looking at your cost of people in the Singapore 
office.  If you could check out the cost for lower-level manager types I 
would be most appreciative.  I have already discussed this with Lilian Low of 
HR Singapore so if this was your planned course of action I've already 
covered that base - she told me managers are about the same US$ amount as in 
Houston.

Thanks,

Bob

PS - That was a most evil joke you played on Lavorato......I enjoyed it 
immensely.

I'm not sure I'm going to make it to Phila because of PRC.  I will advise 
next week.  Also, can you tell me Paula's last name that we rode with the

on that the LNG group is trying to trade with El Paso for LNG space around 
the country, as well.

Hey guys, no real need to read all of this. I just want to be sure your team 
and our team are closely coordinating on the Elba Island tolling agreements 
(your team) and gas sales agreements (our team). These discussions have been 
going on for about eight months now and I want to be sure this is all 
worthwhile. Phil Demoes is spending a considerable amount of time 
coordinating and negotiating with Southern Co. and other sales customers for 
the LNG offtake agreements. I'm assuming Doug Arnell is your lead on deciding 
and executing on the strategy at Elba. There is a CONSIDERABLE amount of 
money  to be made depending on your view of the long-term supply curve for 
LNG. 

Question: Are the right people involved here on both sides to develop and 
execute on the strategy at Elba? What is our specific strategy at Elba and 
can we accelerate our negotiations on the various contracts here? Please 
advise. Thanks. 
Phil DeMoes@ENRON
11/20/2000 07:58 AM
Janet, Gil and Ed,

Please note Les' latest summary of Elba.  Things seem to be coming to a head 
there.  Southern Co. was in town last Thursday to visit us and Les agreed to 
start working on a letter of intent with Southern Co for the sale of gas from 
the terminal.   We have been asked to work up a good price for gas at Elba by 
Les.  I have started working with John Hodge and John Griffith on this.

So. Co.'s latest offer was Hub + $.12 for all 160,000 dt/d.  So. Co. wants 
100,000 dt/d at Elba and will give us the option of selling to them the 
remaining 60,000 dt/d at Elba or Destin at our option.  We have not discussed 
what a price at Destin should be.  So. Co. has some leverage with El Paso 
that can be instrumental in helping Les with his negotiations below.  
Additionally, they may be the only party that can burn the high btu gas and 
significantly improve the btu issue at Elba.

We should be better prepared to talk about this by Wednesday.  Let me know if 
you have any questions.

Les Webber @ ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

GREETINGS:

On November 17, 2000 Southern LNG advised the FERC that it "has determined to 
withdraw the Btu stabilization options from the instant certificate 
application", such application being the one seeking to amend the certificate 
issued by the FERC in March, 2000 authorizing Southern LNG to reactivate the 
LNG terminal at Elba Island.

With this withdrawal, the El Paso organization has drawn its line in the 
sand.  We plan to vigorously protest this withdrawal at the FERC within the 
15 day period allowed by FERC procedures.  This gives us until December 2, 
2000 to file which, presumably, would be extended until Monday, December 4, 
2000.

Our filing will be of an adversarial nature, so the Enron organization needs 
to be on board with our intended filing, which we will commence drafting on 
November 20, 2000.  Drafts will be circulated to the appropriate personnel, 
so please advise us re any additions in that regard.

At the same time, this decision by Southern LNG will focus our resolve to 
complete the commercial transaction with El Paso Merchant Energy.  We have 
come to accept some of the less desirable features of the Letter 
Agreement/Term Sheet signed with El Paso Merchant Energy on October 13, 1999, 
inasmuch as the more important aspects are very much in our favor, including 
several that Southern LNG found rather unsettling.  We will discuss the path 
forward with El Paso Merchant Energy on November 21-22, 2000.

While we remain open to a solution to the quality issue that leaves our 
commercial flexibility and optionality intact, we must be positioned to move 
forward resolutely and in a timely manner with both El Paso Merchant Energy 
and Southern LNG.  We cannot afford to stop these processes while we discuss 
alternative solutions.

On Wednesday, November 15, 2000, we gave both Mike Varagona and David Jenkins 
of El Paso Merchant Energy a "heads-up" regarding our likely response to 
Southern LNG's proposed letter agreement dated November 1, 2000.  We 
indicated we would be asking Southern LNG to bifurcate the FERC proceeding 
into the Vaporizer Project, that could proceed quickly and on an independent 
path to certification, and the Stabilization Project, that required 
considerably more technical analyses before it could proceed.  When I 
contacted Mike Varagona on Friday, November 17, 2000, after we received a 
copy of Southern LNG's letter to the FERC, he stated that he had not been 
advised by Southern LNG regarding its decision, hence, had not been 
positioned to return the favor.

Mr. Varagona will be in Houston on November 21 and 22, and he wants to meet 
with us.  He is still pushing for a commercial solution that sees El Paso 
"take on the quality risk" in return for our firming up our volumes to El 
Paso Merchant Energy at an improved price of Henry Hub plus approx. $0.08 per 
MMBtu.  Let there be no doubt that El Paso and Southern LNG will find a 
solution to the quality issue at little or no cost.  He said he would like to 
prepare us an outline of an offer. to which I responded that he had nothing 
to lose by doing so.  The usual practice has been for Enron to do this and 
for El Paso to respond with "I don't think that will work".

Mr. Varagona also indicated that he did not see how the Letter Agreement/Term 
Sheet could form the basis of the commercial arrangement between our 
respective companies - "It just won't work!".  As a consequence, he stated 
that Clarke Smith, head of El Paso Merchant Energy, has already contacted or 
will shortly contact our Mike McConnell to see if they can work to resolve 
this matter. Apparently, these gentlemen have developed a good working 
relationship over the years.  He also alluded to the possibility that Mr. 
Smith may have also contacted our Stan Horton (for less than obvious reasons 
to me).  

Mr. Varagona further advised me that a Duke/Williams joint venture had just 
acquired the rights to the Gulfstream Pipeline Project from Coastal 
(divestment of this asset was required, I understand, as part of the El 
Paso/Coastal merger).  "This situation gives added impetus to development of 
the Cypress Pipeline project by Enron and El Paso."

There is considerable merit in Enron retaining the right to market its own 
gas out of the Elba Island LNG Terminal.  However, we may find it desirable 
to reach some commercial resolution with El Paso Merchant Energy for a 
portion of our volumes that also makes the quality issue disappear.  However, 
should we decide to so compromise, we must either fully engage Southern LNG 
in that solution or totally eliminate them from all aspects of our agreement 
with El Paso.  In the case of Southern LNG, we are dealing with one or more 
individuals who see only one way to do things. namely their way, and who are 
totally opposed to working with Enron.  I would recommend any compromise with 
El Paso Merchant Energy be conditioned on first reaching agreement with 
Southern LNG on explicit terms acceptable to us (and checking it twice).

I would appreciate receiving your comments, if any, before Thanksgiving.

Regards.
Les Webber

Below please see response from Chris Talbot regarding portability of system.  
To clarify my discussion with you last week, while Gary's oversight is a key 
part of the deal I am uncomfortable with Gary's comments to Chris that I have 
simply introduced the deal and that Gary will make the sole decision on this 
deal.

Jeff, these guys have been introduced to me on a personal basis and the 
discussions are based on a large element of trust.  I see the strongest 
potential for this project working under the SPV structure outlined in our 
discussions.  More importantly, I see a unique opportunity to develop the 
trading technology in a setting  removed from the typical structure (but not 
from controls).  To this end, I do not see the SPV reporting directly to Gary 
nor do I see viability of this project residing solely with Gary.

I will call you Monday to discuss the way forward including the final due 
diligence required to move forward or kill this project.

Paul

Hi Paul,

First, it is good news that the deal is not dead.

I have already asked (as part of my own due diligence) if CSFB would 
cooperate (without mentioning names) and the answer was a clear yes.

We have a new file server and some software fixes in place and the 
system 
platform makes the one you saw look like horse and buggy speed - it is 
very 
fast now. Pity Gary did not see it - it would have 
completely 
knocked his socks off.

Hope the Texas pow-wow was enjoyable.

I look forward to talking on Monday. Electricity got more expensive 
last 
week!

Chris

Get with me on tuesday.  we'll address then, but I'm ok with this in general. 

   
	
	

JS:
I just met with Chris Gaskill and Kevin McGowan. We are in dire need of 
analysts. I proposed the following and would like your buy-in:
1- A return trip to Wharton to get more finance and engineering grads.
2- An off cycle super Saturday based on the resumes we pull from the 
collection Ted Bland put together.

Thanks

Would like to touch base with you on John's contract.  He has countered our 
bid;

for now.

ARGENTINA:THE UNPALATABLE CHOICE AMONG DEFLATING, DEFAULTING OR DEVALUING

Executive Summary
The recession in Argentina is deepening and the government faces painful=20
choices in addressing it
While the current strategy of deflation is unpopular, default or devaluatio=
n=20
could be even more painful
Deflation will remain the strategy of choice so long as De la Rua survives;=
=20
if his government falls, both default
      and devaluation become likely
Mexico and Brazil are in a stronger position to face the fallout from a=20
devaluation than they were in 1998

November 16, 2000

1. Argentina Recession

The question haunting observers of Argentina is whether the De la R?a=20
administration will succeed
in stabilizing the country=01,s economy and pulling it out of its second=20
recession in five years. Indeed,
the 11-month old administration has not lived up to expectations and is=20
quickly losing market
confidence. Although the country has so far maintained the support of the I=
MF=20
and Washington,
the outcome of the unfolding crisis is by no means certain. Argentina is=20
trapped in a fixed
exchange regime that succeeded in taming inflation but is now impairing its=
=20
competitiveness and
long-term prospects.

2. Deflate, Default, or Devalue?

The administration faces a number of unenviable choices as it tries to redu=
ce=20
the difference
between internal and external prices. It can continue with its present cour=
se=20
of action, attempting
to cut its fiscal deficit amid a deepening recession and a growing debt=20
crisis. The adjustment of
relative prices would thus be accomplished through continued deflation. A=
=20
variant of this scenario
would be to renegotiate part of its external debt, in order to reduce the=
=20
increasingly onerous interest
payments, or default on its sovereign bonds. This, however, would destroy t=
he=20
last shred of
confidence, jeopardize Argentina=01,s future access to international capita=
l=20
markets, and ruin the
country=01,s relations with major industrialized countries. Finally, the co=
untry=20
could opt to devalue.
Arguably, the financial and social cost of this action would be high, but t=
he=20
country could recover
relatively quickly, as the cases of Mexico and Brazil suggest.

3. Recession Threatens De la Rua Survival

The outcome will depend on whether the De la R?a administration remains in=
=20
power. The
government is committed to pursuing a deflationary adjustment, hoping that =
it=20
will pay off by next
year, provided that the US dollar weakens and that its access to=20
international markets is
maintained. However, if the deflation is more prolonged and the economic=20
recession becomes
socially and politically untenable, the ruling coalition could disintegrate=
=20
and the president could be
forced to resign. In that case, the new government would probably decide to=
=20
devalue immediately
after taking power.

4. Brazil and Mexico Less Vulnerable to Contagion than in 1998

The Argentine crisis has raised the specter of emerging market financial=20
instability, notably in
Brazil and Mexico. However, these fears may be unfounded given the progress=
=20
made by the latter
countries in improving their fundamentals. Indeed, both Brazil and Mexico n=
ow=20
feature a floating
exchange rate regime and have gone a long way in terms of balancing their=
=20
fiscal accounts. Thus,
in the event of an escalation of Argentina=01,s difficulties, both countrie=
s are=20
well equipped to
overcome temporary financial turmoil.

My views are as follows:
We have lost business on what I am doing (dated brent vs frontline IPE) to 
ICE. For the future we need something more to combat ICE and other systems. 
Getting the brokers on our side could be the answer. The benefits I can see 
are:
a. We will reach a wider crowd using the brokers. Today there are companies 
who will not turn on our system despite personal visits and other marketing. 
They seem to prefer speaking to brokers.
b. We could gain neutrality if the broker could transact on EOL on behalf of 
the customer. The biggest problem when I speak to customers seems to be that 
by dealing with Enron on EOL the customer is afraid of giving us to much of 
information of what they are doing.
c. The brokers are scared for the future. They think they are about to die 
out due to electronic trading. Enron should be able to strike a good deal 
with the broker. Maybe even get paid ?
d. Enron would gain a free marketing force thru the brokers.

Get with Nowlan and talk to Andy Zipper on this.  There are a number of 
options for us with brokers, and Andy has been involved in this aspect of our 
business for some time.   I'd like to hear your views.  Thanks.

I have been contacted by ICAP and Man regarding different co-ops between EOL 
and the services provided by these brokers. Icap wants Enron to be the market 
maker for the ICAP electronic system (swap-net) , MAN wants to represent EOL 
to the market and act as a principal between Enron and Man customers.

There are benefits and draw-backs using the brokers. I have my views on the 
matter.  

Jeff, what is our policy for EOL regarding working with the brokers?

Hi guys.  

I wanted to let you know that I am extremely concerned about the 
Associate/Analyst program, so much so that I feel all the work I have done, 
and all the time I have spent on the program has had little impact outside 
Wharton/Penn recruiting.  In fact we won't get more than 1 associate from 
Wharton this year for a variety of internal and external reasons.  This 
program has brought incredible talent into the organization, but we have lost 
a lot of momentum over the last two years.

In as much as I would like to continue to support the program, I can't  in 
its current form, and don't have time to fix what I thought we had been 
addressing.  The entire program is disfunctional, and the commercial teams 
are not lending support to the program.  I'd be very happy to spend a few 
minutes of your time (rather than blather on in an email) to give you both my 
overview of the program, and suggest changes and improvements.  

You know you have my support, but the current state of affairs down there has 
gotten me to my rope's end with the program.

I'm writing from houston (TX) and I cannot find anyone here who shows your 
furniture.  Can you direct me to some one in this part of the country?  I 
have large outdoor spaces that I'd like to furnish with Brown Jordan.  

Thanks for your help.

Jeff

We would be happy to explore the full range of products we offer, including 
Jere's insurance products.  I suspect you and Mark can begin the process with 
great capability.  If you'd like my help, please let me know as you develop 
this relationship.  Thanks for the update.  Jeff

   
	
	

Jeff,

To continue on an email I sent to you and Mark Tawney a couple of weeks ago.

As indicated then, over the past couple of months I have been building a 
relationship the Sr. VP /Head of Product Development of Wells Fargo Capital 
Markets Group in SF. His mandate is to broaden the bank's capital markets 
capabilities.

In the hopes of achieving this,  he has asked me to explore (with him) 
potential areas where Wells and Enron could benefit from some sort of 
strategic relationship with Enron i.e. bringing commodity, weather, credit, 
etc.  risk management capabilities to their broad corporate client base.

Mark has suggested to me that he would welcome the opportunity to join me 
(EnronCredit.com) in representing the weather desk to Wells Fargo and 
exploring any potential strategic relationship with them.

Do you have any interest in presenting Wells with Enron Global Market's full 
trading/risk management capabilities?
If you do not on any organised basis, would you just I speak to the desk 
heads on an individual basis to explore their interest?

Understanding you are incredibly busy, please let me know of your thoughts 
regarding your interest in this as soon as possible.

Thanks,
George Zivic

To be clear, those employees in Oslo and elsewhere that spend 100% of their

Hi Chris- thanks for getting on the horn with Harvard last week- because we 
know they are already long the spreads, we will have to work on them amending 
the position or putting more on longer term.

Below is feedback from another fund- Tudor, who we trade a lot with- same 
thing- we will have to work on other ideas.  I am getting a bit more 
comfortable with the flow of crude and appreciate your help on ideas.

These guys generally look at us as nat gas/ power only but are very willing 
to trade crude/ products- just need to build credibility.

Talk to you later,
CA
Dwight Anderson <Dwight.Anderson@tudor.com> on 11/15/2000 08:05:02 AM
Is a great idea.  (cuz we put it on in the low 1.20s....)  thx for the idea.
almost too bad we have it on already.....

Dwight/Jason-

We have done some analysis on the Brent / WTI spread- we would recommend
buying WTI/ selling Brent for 2Q01 (as well as 02 and 03).

We looked back to 1995 to see how each 2Q of these years traded 1 year
prior to it being prompt.  The graph attached gives the raw data and the
word doc some risk/ reward analysis (1995 was a weird year).

(See attached file: Brent_TI Analysis.xls)(See attached file:
Brent_WTI-Trade.doc)

The spread is pretty constant at 1.25- 1.40 up until the contracts are
prompt- then the average is more like 1.80.  2000 was particularly striking
because of the gasoline shortage in the Mid West which put pressure on WTI
at Cushing (and in general kept cracks high)- we got out to 2.70.  We are
looking for a repeat this year.  The Arb has generally moved to 2.70
minimum (to bring Brent to Cushing) because of higher freight rates this
year- this looks to continue.

The spread has moved out the last few days as Dec Brent is getting tight
(due to UK tax affect)- now 1.52 at 1.57

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this.

CA

Jeff,
I'm the researcher who works with Ted Bland and has been surfacing 
Associate/Analyst type resumes for you and Lavorato (the binders we gave you 
guys).  Attached is the resume of a personal friend of mine, Robert Brown 
(Bobby), who may be a good fit for your group.  He is a '97 University of 
Pennsylvania graduate (3.1 GPA) with a degree in Economics and an 
International Finance concentration.  Additionally, he holds Series 7, 63, 65 
licenses.  

Bobby had expressed an interest in Enron to me some time ago, but didn't want 
to pursue anything at the time as he was going to be traveling for quite a 
while.  He contacted me last week, ready to explore opportunities at Enron.  
Upon reading his resume, I felt it is very much in line with many of the 
other resumes I'd surfaced for you and Lavorato to you last month (given to 
you by Ted Bland).  He's very bright, ambitious and I feel would fit very 
well into the Enron environment.

Let me know what you think and don't hesitate to call if you have any 
questions!

Thanks for the clarifications.

Jeff - Jupiter is in doubt as a fourth quarter deal due to Massey's inability 
to focus on the deal.  They are still trying to solve their waste coal spill, 
and are working on the reverse spinoff from Fluor.  I talked with Don 
Blakenship today, and he says they are still trying to do the deal this 
quarter - I obviously have my doubts, and moved it to Q1.

British Energy is being pushed to Q1 as well.  BE has declared their option 
tons and are delaying deliveries under our existing contract through April.  
They are hoping to miss the current bullish market by waiting to begin 
serious negotiations until early next year.

Jeff,
 This weekend while I was at Penn I spent some time with Gary (he interned 
with us last summer) and found out that he has received an offer from JP 
Morgan for Trading.  It is a pretty good offer overall but I still think that 
Enron is a better opportunity and we just need to convince him of that.  I 
was hoping you could take a few minutes out to call him and talk to him about 
it.  I really thought we would be able to have him sign full-time but now 
this throws a little curveball into things.  His home number is 215-386-4251 
and his cell phone number is 215-432-5635.  This is a really bright, great 
guy that I think would end up becoming a major asset to Enron.  If there is 
anything I can do please let me know, but I'm sure hearing from you will make 
a difference.

Sarah

 Saturday is looking better right now.  I hope that is still ok.  Let me

Your party sounds great!!!  You are so funny.  I will fill you in on my 
events.  Dan's was fabulous.  Vikki's was pretty low key.  I want to hear 
about your first being meeting!  You are such a superstar.  You have to admit 
that you felt pretty cool.  I'd be dissapointed if you didn't.  
let me know when you are free.  my only plans so far are for sat day.  I am 
walking with Julia, and spending the day with my little cousin.  for all my 
little cousins' birthdays I take them to do something fun for their present.  
who knows what I'll be roped into doing!  I am trying to convince her to go 
for manicures, but she is nine so she probably wants to go make a teddy bear 
or something.  Anyway...let me know when you are free.  We could go for a 
really fun dinner or something.  I am also dying to see the house, so that is 
a must!

Of course I want to get together next (this?) weekend.  In fact, the house 
should be almost done, and I'd love to show it to you, too.  I'm pretty open 
also, but am doing super saturday again, and am not sure what my deal is 
friday evening (if anything, and will know by tomorrow).  

Last night on A&E was a special about Palm Beach, and the good life, charity 
balls, social scene, etc.  So I had a Palm Beach Party--bought caviar, fruit 
tarts, champagne and sat around watching the show.  I made everyone wear 
Lacoste shirts, loafters (no socks) and not put down their glass full of 
champagne (as much as possible!)  Fun, casual, and last minute.  For not 
being in your biz, I liked the idea and we had fun.   

Went to my first exec committee meeting.  Pretty interesting.  But can't wait 
to hear about your parties for Vicki and Dan....

11/13/2000 09:21 AM
I hope that Super Saturday went well.  Are you kidding....I am most excited 
for your parties!  We will think of some really different things to do.  I am 
really open next weekend so let me know if you want to get together.  We can 
do something fun to let you blow off steam from the Managment Conference.  

Super Saturday is super early---7:15 sat. morn. and I'm at my desk.   Sounds 
like all your events will be fun.  I'm counting on your helping me with my 
parties, too!
Sounds like this week is busy, but I'm around next weekend.  We'll figure it 
out this week.  No message yesterday, so I rescheduled it for late afternoon 
today, can wait.  

Later--Jeff

that it is over.  I started another one last night that is a little bit 
lighter.  Three generations of Jewish women in the south kind of thing.  tell 
me if yours is good.  I haven't read it.  I am going to the chronicle book 
dinner on sunday and I am totally psyched.  if you want me to get any of the 
books signed for you let me know.  Ted Coppel will be there with his new 
book.  I am running out so leave me a message if you want it.  Have a great 
weekend!  I am bummed you can't make next thursday, so we will have to plan 
something fun soon.

Everything was ok, just busy.  Good book?  I just started "When the sons of 
heaven meet the daughters of earth"  have you heard of it?  I'd absolutely

conference.  I'm on a panel (with Jeremy) early Friday a.m.

so if you want to talk I'll be on my cell phone 256-5582.
Big....small....it is still the Enron Executive Committee and you should feel 
extremely proud.  I am so happy for you!
I hope that you have a great lunch and that your speech went will this 
morning.

Great!  Sorry YOU weren't there...
I'm on my way out  for a lunch.  I'll call you later.   (I'm excited about

it isn't dead, but things are moving slowly.

the deal was initiated and is still being headed by jarek astramovicz (sp?)  
head of the warsaw office.  he says he is getting the green light from 
sheriff to proceed, despite the potential headlines.  however, the lead 
finance/origination guy here in london, michael mills, has resigned.  i 
talked to paul chivers about the deal yesterday and he will take mills' spot 
temporarily.  

in the meantime the polish govt has also ruled that pkn (owners of other 
polish ref) will not be allowed to bid, as jarek predicted, and which puts us 
in a good position.

we have not done anything yet, because i did not want to start working on 
something that did not get official backing, and support from finance.
what we will need to do as soon as everybody has gotten over the 
ramifications, is put together the various curves (fob basis) for the main 
products for 3-5 years out (length of our potential put option).  so far our 
attitude is that we treat this as an export ref and we will deal with the 
products as such.  any money made from the internal market will be gravy.

if we get management sign-off, this deal has a high potential of happening, 
and we will be handed 25pct of a refinery, and probably control over the 
products execution and hedging.
will keep you posted.   

   
	
	

Any updates on the Gdansk refinery, or should I assume that the deal is dead?

Jeff

Any updates on the Gdansk refinery, or should I assume that the deal is dead?

Jeff

The reason for the memo before was because the India guys still don't 
understand.  Hopefully this clears up their ideas about a separate marketing 
and trading shop in India.  

Have you had time to think about Russell Dyke?

for your parties!  We will think of some really different things to do.  I am 
really open next weekend so let me know if you want to get together.  We can 
do something fun to let you blow off steam from the Managment Conference.  

Super Saturday is super early---7:15 sat. morn. and I'm at my desk.   Sounds 
like all your events will be fun.  I'm counting on your helping me with my 
parties, too!
Sounds like this week is busy, but I'm around next weekend.  We'll figure it 
out this week.  No message yesterday, so I rescheduled it for late afternoon 
today, can wait.  

Later--Jeff

this was the wierdest book I have ever read.  It was called The Story of O, 
and it about this sex cult in Paris and it totally freaked me out.  I am glad 
that it is over.  I started another one last night that is a little bit 
lighter.  Three generations of Jewish women in the south kind of thing.  tell 
me if yours is good.  I haven't read it.  I am going to the chronicle book 
dinner on sunday and I am totally psyched.  if you want me to get any of the 
books signed for you let me know.  Ted Coppel will be there with his new 
book.  I am running out so leave me a message if you want it.  Have a great 
weekend!  I am bummed you can't make next thursday, so we will have to plan 
something fun soon.

Everything was ok, just busy.  Good book?  I just started "When the sons of

Hi John

Things are heating up for year end keeping us all pretty busy.  As we go 
forward in many of our businesses, it's clear several need fine tuning.  One 
of which is weather worldwide.  Mark Tawney and I have spent quite a bit of 
time during the last several weeks working on a plan for next year and 
forward.  We've come to the conclusion that it will be most effective to add 
a London operation that will allow for quick and beneficial marketer 
interaction, immediate scalability, and more portfolio diversification.  I 
would structure the business around the continent with someone managing that 
portion of the operation, and continue to have Thor manage Scandinavia.  Mark 
and I will get together to structure the London based group and keep you 
advised.  

Mark has some great ideas, and I'd like to talk to you about this rather than 
go on in an email.  I'll give you a ring first thing in the morning.  

Best--

Jeff

Per our conversation this morning, the graph below shows the combined VaR for 
the last 30 days on just the long-dated deals.  Unfortunately, there is some 
intra-day trading and long term strategic trading for Energy Trend and 
JBlock.  The Risk Management group have started breaking out intra-day 
trading for FGH  and PAN-NAT, and they are currently in the process of 
breaking-out Energy Trend and JBlock.   This process requires setting up new 
books and re-booking new deals.  However, the graph below should give you an 
idea of how much VaR these deals are eating up.  I will send an updated graph 
once all books are successfully setup.

Good morning team,

First,  I want to thank you for helping with on campus interviews last week 
at Wharton.  

To conclude the process I have scheduled a meeting for Tuesday November 14th 
at 9am in room 11C2 to discuss candidate invites for Super Saturday.  It is 
imperative that we meet to discuss who you will be passing on to the final 
round of interviews.  With the holidays coming up the sooner we get letters 
out for invites the better our results might be for attendance.  If you can 
not make this meeting please call me as soon as possible at extension 53214.  
Otherwise I will see you tomorrow.

Natalie if you can please respond with a call in number we will patch you 
into the meeting.

Thank you,

Kristin Gandy

Doug Leach call me  this morning and told me that the offer that he made to 
the LNG group 6 months ago is now off the table. He said that this has also 
been transmitted to Mike McConnell in writing. His reason was that he had 
bent over backwards to make the proposal originally and the LNG group has 
been slow to respond. I reminded him that we were delayed in getting back 
because of some legal issues but now that we were all part of EGM that this 
was no longer an issue. He went on to say that he will not turn over any of 
the fees until phase 2 kicks in, some time next year (Marc de La Roche said 
something to me the other day about Jan.01). That the LNG group will have to 
bear all expenses until that time just like EFI had to for liquid fuels. He 
did say that in their case India did reimburse them on their previous 
expenses as a reduction/credit to the fee. He also went on to say that he was 
not happy with India's attempt to get a piece of EFI's fee.
Please advise how you would like me to proceed.

SUMMARY

The market has definitely come under pressure since the dizzy heights of of a 
fortnight ago where producers were still standing firmly 
behind $33 per metric on a FOB Richards Bay equivalent and claiming it was 
heading swiftly to $35. While there had been some nervous
short covering by utilities in the month prior to coaltrans which had  
fuelled the mkt somewhat the buyers have remained disciplined and
in general have refused to commit to these numbers. The lack of business at 
these numbers has definitely moved the mkt south and of
course mkt psychology with it. While producers are still playing lip service 
to abve numbers they are actively putting up offers which 
reflect levels of $31 FOB Richards Bay and wud trade down to $30.50. Several 
sources have confirmed in the last cuppla days that
negotiations between Kepco and South African producers for price fixing 2001 
tonnage fell apart which ultimately means there will be
an additional 3 million mt which the South Africans have to find a home for - 
destination Europe most likely. On the flip side Kepco will
be looking towards Indonesia and China to substitute this tonnage and this 
combined with rumours that Formosa Plastic will be looking
for some 3 million tonnes of additional material from China cud serve to 
tighten the Pacific mkt over the next months for first half 2001.
There is definitely an intent within the consuming community to make a stand 
against the cartel and there has been a lot of activity over 
last three weeks with business being booked out of the U.S, Indonesia and 
Australia at numbers close to what was achievable from
S.A. into Europe. This can only serve to strengthen our opportunities in this 
mktplace and indeed German utilities who have been held to 
ransom by similar minded producers in Poland are now exploring every end to 
do business with other suppliers - namely ourselves 
in order to avoid being captive to one supplier. Weglekoks incidentally are 
currently in the mkt buying Russian material to cover sales 
made against Polish to Bewag - we don't want to be short Polish in the near 
term!

Mkt now trading at $41.25 Fob barge ARA for Jan/Dec 2001and $42.15 level for 
the Jan/Mar 2001. We still see couple dollars on the
downside although the latest incident (guerrilla attack on rail line last 
week) has Gary Drummond threatening to cut production down
in Colombia by half for first few months of 2001 to make a point to the 
unions. We are still trying to ascertain how much this wud bull 
the mkt short-term but we wud certainly take the opportunity to sell any 
spike.

EOL Update

Total EOL trades for November stand at 1.95 million mt out of a running total 
of 3.67 million from it's inception. As the figures suggest 
there is increasing activity/liquidity in the market with the arrival of 
several new players in recent weeks - most notably AEP. Increased 
volume in EOL has also been mirrored by an increase in the volume of SECA's 
traded in the OTC market with more and  more utilities
who have upto now remained on the fringes deciding to join the party - RWE 
has been the latest SECA virgin to lose it's cherry closing
a deal with ourselves early last week on Q1 through TFS. We are now offering 
our products in Euros aswell the good old green back
much to the confusion of one or two of our clients! At current pace we shud 
have surpassed all our expectations by passing the 5 mill
mark by the end of the year.

GAMEPLAN 

We are currently long to the tune of 1.5 mil mt but this is essentially all 
through optionality at origin which runs through to 2004.
Strip these out and effectively we are running a short ARA position of some 
1.5 mill mt  weighted pretty evenly across Q2, Q3 and Q4
2001 backed by some implied longs at origin through options and firm tonnage 
out of both Richards Bay and Drummond. We are 
very comfortable with this as we hold enuff bullets at reasonable numbers to 
go after the term Cal 01 business while running a European
short pos'n which shud capture the weakness which we are anticipating in both 
the frt mkts and in the Atlantic coal mkt. Shud the the 
European mkt gain some momentum then we have own some slightly out of the 
money options which we wud utilise to execute any
physical shorts in ARA and to keep mkt capped. 

Best Regards
Jez

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:    we need 100% full time 
dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather 
business.  All identified employees in the weather business will now become 
full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney. Accordingly Mark and I 
will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by 
this transition and the need to hire additional employees.  It is important 
that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be 
in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will begin adding to the 
weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations 
and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide 
powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.  

Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new 
structure.

Speak with Nowlan.  Thanks...Jeff

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 44/2000

Highlight

The cape market is starting to show signs of weakening in the spot market as 
the Panamax market is trading at a discount to most major cape routes and 
charterers have started to split cape stems into two panamax stems.  As for 
next year, the cape market is still trading at robust numbers but the 
sentiment on the panamax market has definitely turned bearish as the massive 
new order of vessels and the lack of grain cargoes from the US is front page 
news everywhere.  We are now starting to see big grain houses really starting 
to sell the panamax freight market for next year.  We are also having several 
large owners calling us directly over the last few days to try to convince us 
to take their tonnage for next year or fix COA's.  We are short approximatly 
45 pananamx cargoes world wide next year.

The long term Coeclerici deal was finally concluded this week and booked for 
$1.3 Million.  We have another smaller deal with Coeclerici which we will put 
into the books within next week and are looking currently at repeating the 
same strategy on a smaller panamax vessel to be delivered in 2003/2004 with a 
purchase option included in the deal.  
Last week we added to our short panamax position for next year by agreeing to 
sell an additional 6 panamax cargoes to National Power ( now called Innogy 
).  In total we now have sold 12 panamax cargoes to Innogy from RBCT to the 
UK for 2001.  Further, we are in discussion with Intercore to sell them an 
additional 3 capes for Q4 2001 from Puerto Bolivar to Rotterdam ( we have 
already sold them 4 capes for next year ) and also discussing selling 3 capes 
or 6 panamax cargoes ( our option ) to Glencore for Q1 01 from RBCT to the UK.

On the EOL front, last week was an active week as we traded with EDF trading 
a total of 375,000 tons of sea freight and then on Friday, just before going 
home, Louis Dreyfus transacted 5 times on our new grain panamax route ( U.S 
Gulf/Japan ) for a total of 270,000 tons.

Jeff,
 This weekend while I was at Penn I spent some time with Gary (he interned 
with us last summer) and found out that he has received an offer from JP 
Morgan for Trading.  It is a pretty good offer overall but I still think that 
Enron is a better opportunity and we just need to convince him of that.  I 
was hoping you could take a few minutes out to call him and talk to him about 
it.  I really thought we would be able to have him sign full-time but now 
this throws a little curveball into things.  His home number is 215-386-4251 
and his cell phone number is 215-432-5635.  This is a really bright, great 
guy that I think would end up becoming a major asset to Enron.  If there is 
anything I can do please let me know, but I'm sure hearing from you will make 
a difference.

Sarah

As we move forward with our global LNG strategy, it is obvious that the best 
way to capture value for Enron is to bring the same merchant activity to this 
business unit.  This merchant philosophy allows aggressive book and position 
management from a worldwide perspective.  Our ability to gather data and to 
show only one Enron face in the market is crucial to our success.  As 
important is one pricing desk.  Many of you know, Eric Groves in Houston is 
running our pricing desk, Larry Lawyer is working on all finance type 
business for us, and Jen Fraser is running our fundamentals group.  

To bring full merchant capabilities to our worldwide LNG business, Mike and I 
wanted to clearly outline a point that seems to need attention.  ALL LNG 
contacts, negotiations, and contracts, (physical, financial, buys, sales, 
etc.), with external counterparties must and will be managed through our 
commercial LNG group headed by Eric Gonzales, and Rick Bergsieker.  

It is crucial to manage market perspective, appearance, and informantion.  We 
all know how important each project (Metgas, and other initiatives in India) 
could be, but a coordinated front will help us better grow all of our 
businesses.

Regards

Jeff

I'd like to know how we purchased the Katz.  Was that outside our budget, and 
in Ken's dining room budget?  Mike and I will get together and address the 
points you bring up below.  Looking forward to our meeting.  

Regards.....Jeff

Mike,
As you know, I have arranged for a meeting on December 6th among the Art
Committee and Jeff Skilling.  I feel that you should run this meeting.  I
would like to accomplish the following:

1) Discuss our Vision for the collection
2) Introduce Ned and Barry
3) Describe art locations in/outside the buildings
4) Discuss progress made to date and timetable
5) Discuss the process:  To what extent Jeff wants to be part of the
decision process going forward (i.e. is he comfortable approving our Vision
and having us implement? ...Or does he want veto power on each piece?)  The
latter would be cumbersome, and I personally would prefer the former, but we
definitely need clarification on this before we can proceed.
Questions right now for you:
1)   Would you like to invite Ken to join us in the meeting?
2) Ned cannot make it that day (first available day is Dec. 18th) so should
we postpone?  Barry is a "maybe".  Remember they are there to help us shape
a high quality collection and to make sure that we do not make any
purchasing "mistakes".
3) I have a first draft of the presentation, when can we meet to discuss it?
Following on our last meeting with Gensler, I am assembling a detailed list
of potential art locations by floor (including dimensions when possible) so
that we have a Master from which to work.  I will run it by Bonnie McCloud
and Bill Donovan to assure its accuracy.
Lastly, I have asked Bill Viola (the video artist for the work we are
considering) to come down to Houston to meet with us and with Gensler to
discuss where his piece might fit in the new building.  I have also placed a
call  Rob and Gregg at Pelli to let them know that I would like for them to
meet with a wonderful up and coming artist (Olafur Eliasson) who would like
to propose a "water piece" for the circular drive.  You will recall that
Pelli would very much like to have a water piece there.  Eliasson is very
well respected and innovative: He's created waterfalls that flow "up" and
wonderful minimal installation pieces that are quite beautiful.  I've asked
his gallery to let us know if he could meet with Pelli in Connecticut or in
Houston on their next trip.
Lastly, Enron has purchased the Alex Katz painting that is currently hanging
in 50M.  Please call me so I can brief you on how that happened.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

The Story of O, and almost fell over.  I knew I had heard of that book--I

Please expect a phone call from Andrew Makk, currently in the Mid East group, 
who is interested in exploring opportunities in each of your areas.  He is a 
very qualified individual who would be a tremendous resource in any of your 
groups.  Thanks.  Jeff

You got it.  Jeff

I spoke to my AWOL pal, Joe, today and sort of finalised a leaving date - 
I'll probably fly directly to London after Thanksgiving in Boston, so pencil 
me in for drinks or something before then...

Have a good weekend.

Merritt

Super Saturday is super early---7:15 sat. morn. and I'm at my desk.   Sounds 
like all your events will be fun.  I'm counting on your helping me with my 
parties, too!
Sounds like this week is busy, but I'm around next weekend.  We'll figure it 
out this week.  No message yesterday, so I rescheduled it for late afternoon 
today, can wait.  

Later--Jeff

this was the wierdest book I have ever read.  It was called The Story of O, 
and it about this sex cult in Paris and it totally freaked me out.  I am glad 
that it is over.  I started another one last night that is a little bit 
lighter.  Three generations of Jewish women in the south kind of thing.  tell 
me if yours is good.  I haven't read it.  I am going to the chronicle book 
dinner on sunday and I am totally psyched.  if you want me to get any of the 
books signed for you let me know.  Ted Coppel will be there with his new 
book.  I am running out so leave me a message if you want it.  Have a great 
weekend!  I am bummed you can't make next thursday, so we will have to plan 
something fun soon.
ALI

Everything was ok, just busy.  Good book?  I just started "When the sons of 
heaven meet the daughters of earth"  have you heard of it?  I'd absolutely 
love to go the the Anne Frank thing, but I can't get back from the management 
conference.  I'm on a panel (with Jeremy) early Friday a.m.

I went to talk to Steve Horn this morning and he seemed happy with the idea 
of me going over to HTC. I will now work on settling a date for me to 
transfer. I am very happy about this experience and want to express my 
gratitude for all your help and suggestions. I will definitely let you know 
how it is once I move over there.

Again, thank you.

Attached for your review are the fundamental operating standards and controls 
that have been developed by the Wholesale Services group.  These standards 
are to be met by all Enron offices and by each functional group within the 
operations process.  Qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic 
measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity.  
Statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored 
on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately.

As business unit heads, you play a critical role in working with Operations 
to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively.  Please 
review this document and let me know if you have any questions or wish to 
discuss further.

Brent

Hi, hope you are doing great.  I was wondering if you've met Russell Dyke, 
who is in Lagrasta's group, and who I told could get into the LNG before you 
came over.  He has great international experience, and LNG experience.  He 
might be a great match with the Jose team, since I'm uncomfortable with their 
understanding of MTM, and their overall appreciation of the Enron way of 
doing business.  (Today, Russel (assoc/mgr at year end) closed a deal with 
CSFB worth 19 million to us.)  Overall a solid guy.   Let me know what you 
think.  (Merritt and Russell know each other well, and have worked on 
projects together)

Also, I mentioned to Merritt that I was excited about her opportunity to 
trade dutch power, but was very interested in staying in touch with her, 
possibly to trade freight, etc.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 06/2001

Highlight

Cape market is bouncing back after having fallen for the best part of two 
months.  The bounce is expected to be gentle and not long lasting.  Owners 
are raising their rates for March cargoes as there appears to be a few more 
cargoes around mostly attributed to the fact that Japanese steel mills expect 
coal and Iron Ore prices for this year to increase and are therefore 
maximising their current contracts.  Furthermore, Bunkers have risen sharply 
over the last 10 days to over $130 in Rotterdam which was not expected by the 
market.  Of interest, Bocimar is redelivering ships it had taken on short 
period last year back to the head owner earlier than their contract allows 
for which has a few owners thinking about suing Bocimar for damages.  

The panamax atlantic market has been falling hard over the last week with 
little grain movement from the US gulf and fresh Japanese concerns of GM 
crops imports from the US.  However, the Plate season is expected to start in 
March and market anticipates a return to healthy rates then.   The pacific is 
also falling from incredibly strong rates seen three weeks ago before the 
Chinese new year.

On the long term time charter with Mitsui, Mitsui has officially lifted their 
board of approval subjects and we are working through the internal 
documentation/proper sign off at this stage.  

We have offered some competitive freight rates to the US steel group to 
import steel slabs from Turkey to US in the hope of providing the freight for 
this business when it happens.  Pierre is meeting with the pulp and paper 
guys while in Houston at the end of Feb and also going through NYC to meet up 
with the Enron metals shipping guy to discuss joint efforts in shipping to 
maximise synergy's and cost savings.  Furthermore, we are currently 
discussing with the US weather group the possibility of offering protection 
to ship owners for days lost at seas due to severe weather.

I spoke with Tom Piazze at Wharton again this morning, about a reduction in 
the financial commit. from us.  He was not receptive, and in the past, I've 
suggested energy outsourcing for the University, and more recently discussing 
their broadband needs.  Others here have thought about this at Enron (like 
the California University system).  Jeremy Blachman and I are going to run 
with this in a more direct approach and see what happends.  (Tom P.  was open 
to all of this, of course).

i wanted to follow up on our earlier phone conversation regarding a marketing 
quote. i spoke with troy about the product he was looking for, a strip of 
flat price quotes for 7 months, and the reason for the time delay. in order 
to give an accurate fixed priced quote on a month by month basis i needed to 
update the merc quotes on each front to back for the 7 months. this was going 
to take approx 5 minutes, the time needed to get spreads from the floor, and 
this was the amt of time i told troy i needed. i also explained i could quote 
it as a strip package vs settle live.( i believe this all took place Friday.)

if memory serves me, early Monday the customer asked for the quote as a strip 
package. we quoted it live, but i don't believe they liked the offer. 
considering that i quoted the mkt on both the bid and ask, which was a good 
25-30pts tighter than the floor i am not sure what the problem was. as i see 
it, if they did not like the offer i provided they were free to take me out 
of the bid i showed them on the two way.

kind regards,

Phil Clifford

Doug - I was out on paternity leave and did not get this message until now.  
The DC lobbyist for NYMEX is Mark Seetin, however I think the problem is 
Rappaport himself (see e-mail to Capitol Hill below).  Call after you get a 
chance to review.

____________________Forward Header_____________________
I'm forwarding a communication sent at the direction of NYMEX regarding
the CEA legislation.  This truly is an unbelievable process.

Mark Seetin

NYMEX Chairman Dan Rappaport has asked me to convey, on behalf of the
Board of Directors, our strong opposition to the passage of H.R. 4541
with the current energy exemption provision.

This provision is anti-competitive, anti-consumer and is bad for the
marketplace.  If the proponents of this provision were truly in favor of
competition, at the very least, they would not have opposed extending
the same regulatory treatment to open outcry markets.  Their opposition
to such regulatory equity speaks volume about what may be the true
intent--use government and legislation in a perverse way to thwart
competition and allow them a government sanctioned license to hijack a
market, without even having to compete for it.

Please do not allow this bill to go forward without a closer examination
and discussion of this unwise provision.

If you have any questions, Chairman Rappaport may be reached at (212)
299-2250, My telephone number is (202) 662-8770.

Would you please update us on the status of your discussion on behalf of
Senator Gramm, and the overall status of the bill?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Chris,

I was in a meeting today with Jeff Shankman and he was interested in who in 
the NYMEX was behind their efforts in DC to cause EOL problems. I told him 
the Enron DC office was pleased with the initial federal government comments 
regarding protection for EOL from the NYMEX's stance. He still wanted to know 
who at the NYMEX was causing Enron grief. You may respond directly to him if 
you wish, but please let me know that you have responded to Jeff so I can 
consider my request closed. 

Thanks,
Doug

Dear Ms. Fraser,

I am writing after having heard from a contact at Enron that you are seeking 
a number of people to fill various vacancies at your Houston office.  If this 
is the case I would very much like to be considered for one of these 
vacancies.

As you will notice from the attached Curriculum Vitae I am currently employed 
as an Energy Markets Consultant at Wood Mackenzie in Edinburgh, the energy 
consultancy arm of Deutsche Bank.  My prior work experience includes two 
years as a Gas Markets Analyst for a Management Consultancy firm in London, 
time as an Energy Journalist covering the European gas and electricity 
markets and a year long spell as an academic Research Assistant.

Prior to these positions I read for an MSc in Energy Studies at the Centre 
for Energy, Petroleum and Mineral Law and Policy at the University of Dundee, 
Scotland.  Whilst reading for the MSc I elected to specialise in oil and gas 
industry economics and law.

Before undertaking the MSc I read for a B.A. (Hons) Business Administration 
degree.  This allowed me to build, develop and hone to a high standard the 
essential skills of financial, strategic, business and economic analysis.  
Having majored in Management Accountancy I am well versed in undertaking 
analysis tasks of this type at both a micro and macro level, from both a 
qualitative and quantitative approach.

Given the opportunity, I feel confident I could make an immediately tangible 
contribution to the work of Enron.  I have attached my CV in Word 97 format.  
If this is incompatible with your systems please do not hesitate to contact 
me and I will send it in a different format.

I apologise in advance for this unsolicited approach.  If you feel that there 
is a likelihood that my skills and background could potentially be of 
interest to Enron I look forward hopefully to hearing from you in due course.

Yours faithfully,

Andrew Hill B.A. (Hons) MSc  M. Inst. Pet.

One of the tranport dot coms has asked if we could post diesel hedges on 
their site.  I know we don't (maybe no one does) trade diesel.  But there is 
a huge a need for this product in the transport world.  Any thoughts on how 
to do this?  

--Dan 

Thanks.  

   

	
	                           
	

I will call them today to get a separate id for you.  EGM is covered in the 
ENA agreement, so you guys are fine.  It should take them about a day to get 
a new id for you.  I will push them to get this to me by tomorrow.  I will 
give you a call as soon as I get it.

I'd like access for me.  I think the crude and products guys are looking at 
it, so I don't understand that we haven't signed a participant agreement.  
Thanks. 

   

	
	                           
	

In order to manage the enrollment of users onto this system, all users must 
enroll via eRequest.  The approval process will mimic that of EnronOnline.  
The requester will go to our internal security application (eRequest) and 
search on ICE.  They must select the products they want to trade - ICE offers 
gas, power, oil and metals.  This will then generate a message to the 
applicable desk head for approval, and generate the appropriate message to 
security to install the application needed to run the ICE.  Once this is 
approved, Stephanie Sever (x33465) will coordinate getting user ids from the 
ICE.  This normally takes a couple of days.  As soon as we get user ids and 
passwords, we will notify the applicable individual.  

To date, the entities that have signed Participant Agreements are ENA, EPMI 
and ECC.  The cost is $500 per month per user on the ICE.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Given year end issues, we really need to be trading close to the vest now.  I 
was a little surprised how big the prompt few months position in crude was 
two days ago, and we need to scale them back.  

I need the component var for those four structural trades we have today.  
thanks.... Jeff

fyi,  what is the purpose of this email.....

FYI

Today EnronCredit completed a deal for Cargill.  Cargill sold to us a 1yr 
Bankruptcy Swap on Farmland credit .
Two months ago, European Freight traders completed financial freight trades 
with grain cargos originating in 
the states for EU and Japanese destinations (Cargill, Dreyfus).  Over the 
past two months, MG Structured Finance 
(NY) has been working on an export finance deal with ConAgra for grains of 
South American origin (US destination 
presumably).  Continuing client discussions continue to surface more than a 
passing interest for weather products 
in the softs (and other agricultural markets from previous discussions).

I'd like access for me.  I think the crude and products guys are looking at 
it, so I don't understand that we haven't signed a participant agreement.  
Thanks.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 43/2000

Highlight
The cape market continues to rise almost daily with RBCT to Rotterdam at 
$11.40 and Quennsland to Rotterdam at $15.5 in the spot market.  The driving 
factor has not been coal as of late, but an unexpected rush of Iron Ore 
cargoes.  On the panamax front, rates have been easing for the last few 
weeks, as the expected strong grain activity in the US gulf as not yet 
materialised.  The average time charter rate on capes is now in excess of 
$25,000 daily and close to $11,000 on panamaxes.  The general view in the 
market is that prices for both capes and panamaxes will remain strong though 
to April/May 2001 by which time steel mills will have reduced raw material 
imports and adversely affected cape rates and the shear number of 
newbuildings on the panamax front will drag earnings down as well.  Our group 
tends to believe that the balance of the year will see yet firmer rates but 
we expect a slow down and a decrease in rates to take effect towards the 
first two months of next year as we already are seeing some owners 
desperately seeking to cover themselves for next year at very aggressive 
numbers ( Hadeed contract ) and we are getting the feeling that Bocimar is 
keenly interested to cover their long position even tough their length is 
mainly through March/April next year.  Furthernore, the asian owners seem 
more and more agressive with rates for next year as their countries are 
hitting some rough patches currently, as evidenced by their stock markets and 
strong comments against continued strong crude oil prices.

On the ABC front, it appears as if Zodiac and P&O have agreed in principal to 
a deal by which Zodiac buys 50% of ABC but gets full control of the company.  
Details are still patchy and we are keeping a close eye on the possibility of 
Zodiac putting their newly acquired vessels into the Bocimar pool as that 
would have a drastic bullish effect on rates for some months to come.  We 
have proposed to Bocimar a 5 year collar deal by which we get access to 5 
million tons of freight each year with ability to settle the collar deal 
against an index and have the ability to call upon physical tonnage each 
year.  Furthermore, we would have ability to have a washout clause for each 
year by which we would pay a fix lump sum cash amount.   We have also built 
in several other options and we are waiting for an answer from Bocimar 
sometime next week.  This deal would offer us access to modern vessels at a 
price similar to that of the cape index of the last 10 years and with enough 
built in options to take advantage of any sudden market changes.

On the logistics front, Coeclerici is coming in next week to make a 
presentation on their port handling operations in India/ Indonesia and 
Venezuela with the idea of teaming up with us on forthcoming tenders where we 
would offer the long term coal contracts into or out of certain ports, as the 
case maybe, and they would build and manage the port operations.  They 
currently have some interesting contracts in Indonesian ports which should 
have special interest to us vis a vis CLP.  

Our two cape deals with Coeclerici are still not finalised as we are still 
having a few issues with credit language but expect the deals to close within 
the next 10 days.

On the EOL front, Andy James has been able to get EDFtrading to trade 225,000 
tons of freight via EOL this week and he has added Louis Dreyfus grain and 
Billiton and RWE trading to the list of customers that have trading authority 
on our system.

Regarding the lighter side of business, Enron dry bulk shipping was featured 
in tradewinds, a weekly shipping  newspaper, with 3 pages dedicated to our 
rapid growth and clever insights.

Visited with a ship owner this week who has 2 vessel's they are looking at 
taking ownership and would like us to work with them on a 5 year time 
charter. Both vessels are clean products vessels and we can go over the 
opportunity in more detail. My questions, are this something 1) we are 
looking to pursue? 2) is it being coordinated at some level? The opportunity 
we are looking at would have some MTM value and some forward risk but the 
vessels do handle all the products we trade so we can keep the active and we 
also could use the space to market online. I like the structure and believe 
it is worth a good look.

HTC got back to me saying that they are interested in having me rotate to

him know that I will be the next Enron person over there. My only concern is 
that they would like me to get there a bit earlier than scheduled (probably 
around 15 to 30 days before). I am extremely interested in this rotation but  
hope that transferring early does not create any problems. Do you have any 
suggestions on how I might tackle this issue?

Thank you so much for everything

Crude: Stocks have risen during this week over the last five years by an 
average of 7 mbbls, the smallest increase being last year's 3 mbbls. One 
reason the trend is likely to be repeated is that the SPR shipped 2.45 mbbls 
last week, and this should again show up in PADD 3, while the drop in PADD 5 
stocks (led by a sharp drop in imports) which offset the PADD 3 rise last 
week is unlikely to occur a second week. Overall imports remain high, and 
additional October barrels might just have found their way to the US from its 
closer OPEC neghbours. On the other hand, we have the Capline shutdown (due 
to lack of crude) which took place last week, and an increase in refinery 
runs out of turnaround, but I don't believe that will offset the factors 
pointing to a large build in crude stocks. (Consensus forecast up 2.5 mbbls. 
API still lower than the DOE by 2.4 mbbls)

Distillate: After rising steadily since mid July, demand finally turned south 
last week, with a 640 kbd drop. This is the first evidence that borrowed 
demand is now being paid back. A second week of stats would confirm this, but 
the weakening sentiment on cracks lends some support to the theory. The build 
last week occurred despite a strong drop in imports - providing demand stays 
low, higher runs and high distillate yields should see a build, perhaps in 
excess of 1 mbbls. (Consensus forecast up 1 mbbls)

Mogas: Gasoline demand has been sluggish for most of the year, but October 
sales were relatively strong, especially last week, which topped 8.7 mbd (8.9 
in the DOEs), not far off the year's highs. October deliveries are invariably 
higher than both Sep and Nov, so the most likely direction for demand is 
down. Imports from Canada and Europe are said to be on the way, but may take 
some time before they show up in the stats - although some improvement should 
be seen after last week's miserly 212 kbd which accounted for much of the 
draw. However, the gasoline tanker stuck in NYH may skew the stats. PADD 1 
again bore the lion's share of last week's draw, bringing stocks down to 
their lowest level since at least 1976 - it has lost 7 mbbls in four weeks. 
For RFG too, the region is looking short. This week is hard to call, but may 
point to a build, on the basis that strong demand and weak imports aren't 
sustained. (Consensus forecast down 1.5 mbbls. API still higher than DOE by 
2.6 mbbls.)

Friday, December 1 in Philadelphia.  We are the platinum sponsors of the 
conference and really want to have a panelist like you, who exemplifies the 
innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities at Enron.  The timing of the 
panel is essential to recruiting - later that day candidates will be coming 
to Houston for Super Saturday.  The panel topic is Intrapreneurship, Being an 
Entrepreneur within a Corporation.  Other panelists include Dan Powers, 
Director of IBM Early Stage Internet
Technology along with someone from American Express' Strategy/Business 
Development side.  Jonathan Seelig, founder and Sr. VP Strategy of Akamai is 
the keynote speaker of the conference.  Speaking on the panel would entail 
flying up to Philadelphia on the afternoon of Thursday, Nov. 30 and attending 
the opening cocktail reception from 7-8:30pm.  They keynote address is from 
6-7pm, if you would like to attend that as well.  The panel itself is from 10 
- 11:15 am on Friday, December 1, so you could be back in Houston as early as 
4:45.  If you would like additional information, Their website is 
www.wec2000.net.  Could you please give me a call to let me know if you would

Now I know why God made lawyers!  Below is Kevin Liss' latest analysis.  His 
main thesis is that there is a huge return available to the company that will 
take the tax risk.  We just have to find that company.

--Dan

Kevin Liss@ENRON

Dan, in response to your question yesterday, it should still be possible to 
get a structural ruling from the IRS along the lines that Deutschebank (DB) 
had contemplated.  In that respect, last week's IRS announcement leaves 
things unchanged.

That's the good news.  However, in light of last week's IRS announcement, DB 
is unlikely to be able to get the new ruling that they desired confirming 
Pacificorp's existing letter rulings, which they have told us was critical to 
them.  It would appear then that the Pacificorp deal is a non-starter from 
their perspective, at least based upon the present plan of operations.  Tim, 
is it at all possible that DB would be willing to drop their demand about 
going back for a confirming letter ruling as long as the Pacificorp 
facilities are processing at least some percentage of coal fines with their 
run-of-mine coal, consistently with their existing rulings?  I doubt it, but 
if not, we need to know so that we can move on and think about other ways to 
do a coal deal with Pacificorp.  I believe that Pacificorp still needs to 
unload their facilities, and they may still be able to leverage off of their 
existing rulings, which are still valid and have not been revoked by the IRS. 

Without a deal with DB, what are our options now?   

First, it is important to recognize that we still have options.  The IRS has 
not killed synfuel.  There has not been any change in the substantive law.  
Last week's announcement was just that -- an announcement of the IRS's point 
of view.  The news is that the IRS is getting out of the business of issuing 
private letter rulings to private taxpayers in the synfuel business, which 
has been an important source of comfort to many investors, but not 
necessarily vital.  Deals get done all the time without the benefit of having 
a private letter ruling from the IRS (generally in reliance on an opinion of 
outside counsel).  We just need to think in terms of what the landscape looks 
like in the absence of getting a new ruling.

One approach would be to follow through with our plans for Pacificorp's 
facilties, meaning we would relocate them, and continue running run-of-mine 
coal, the IRS be damned, and just find an equity player with a greater risk 
profile than Pacificorp.  In short, we would need companies who are willing 
to rely on Pacificorp's existing rulings, period (along with an appropriate 
indemnity).   It seems to me that if the price is right, someone ought to be 
willing to step up.   While the risk is now greater, the potential returns 
are potentially mind-blowing, and an equity player ought to be able to get an 
opinion of outside counsel vouching for the viability of the credits, 
notwithstanding the IRS' current view of the law.  It seems to me that this 
is the only approach that makes sense.

Alternatively, Pacificorp's facilities could revert back to being a pure coal 
fine processing facilities in an atttempt to conform with the IRS's recent 
announcement.  The IRS announcement implicitly endorses facilities that 
process "waste coal fines," so such facilities could still qualify for new 
private letter rulings.  The IRS announcement defines the term "waste coal 
fines" very vaguely, not specifying either the coal size, or what it is that 
makes coal fines properly viewed as "waste" coal fines.  If you think in 
lawyerly terms and try to deconstruct the literal language they use in their 
announcement, I can envision that Enron could synthetically create "waste" 
coal fines by rewriting some of our coal supply contracts with utility 
customers to provide for the sale of only coal of 3/4 inches or greater, 
resulting in a residual category of "unwanted" coal that we could separately 
market to synfuel plants as "waste" coal fines.  In other words, they could 
be fairly described as "waste" insofar as another coal customer specifically 
excluded it from their contract.  In addition, the IRS announcement does not 
require a waste coal fine processing facility to pelletize its output, as 
some commontators had feared, which is a helpful development because the 
pelletizing process would be a tremendous drag on capacity.  

However, there are real difficulties with this approach.  First, the relevant 
language in the IRS announcement defining "waste coal fines" is not real 
statutory law.  It is basically just an IRS policy statement, meaning that we 
cannot bind the IRS to it.  So the opportunity for gamesmanship over the 
IRS's choice of language is much more limited than it would be if this were 
statutory law.  Also, Price Manford has reported to me that what the IRS 
really has in mind in terms of what is acceptable to them as bonafide waste 
fines is fines from true waste ponds.  Even if the taxpayer can argue over 
the meaning of the term "waste" fines, the IRS can stick to their 
understanding of the term, at least for the sake of deciding whether to issue 
a new ruling.  In short, the IRS may not be willing to give a new ruling 
based on a coal fines facility that does not process the truly 3 or 4% waste 
fines incidental to mining operations.  If you are not going to be able to 
get a new ruling anyway, what's the point of going back to being a coal fine 
processing facility?

But there is another more fundamental problem to the latter approach.  
Pacificorp already has good private letter rulings that bless coal fines 
generally (i.e., not merely "waste" coal fines) as well as run-of-mine coal.  
Why would anyone want to go back to the IRS to get a new ruling that is more 
restrictive than the ones that they already have?  That is truly putting 
value at risk.  

In my view, the best deal for Pacificorp would be to market their existing 
rulings as essentially "above market" rulings, insofar as they go farther 
than the IRS currently allows, giving them a competitive advantage over other 
synfuel operators who never got a ruling.  It seems to me that if they can be 
persuaded to lower their price expectations in light of the new landscape, 
since a new equity player is going to have to bear real risk, then we may 
still have an opportunity to do a synfuel deal.

Mr. Shankman,

I hope all is well with you. Currently I am a second year analyst faced with 
the dilemma of which career path to pursue.  Although there are several 
options, I'm primarily interested in developing a deeper understanding of 
Enron's market philosophy. Trading, risk management, and commodity 
structuring all sound interesting to me at this point, but I want to go into 
my next rotation with a clear sense of direction.

Brad Hitch, who I worked with over at Enron International, suggested I 
contact you to discuss your needs as well as new developments in your group.  
He thought you would be in an excellent position to assist me with my 
decision.

My resume' is attached for your consideration. As you will see, I have a 
significant amount of Investment Banking, and financial industry experience. 
I know how busy you must be during this time of year, but I would appreciate 
a few minutes of your time.

I shall call you during the week of November 14th to schedule a time for us 
to meet. In the meantime, if you need to contact me, my number is 
713-853-6818. Please leave a message if I'm not in, and I'll return your call 
the next day.

I look forward to  speaking with you.

Sincerely,

Damon Harvey

Thanks for the update.  If any of them would  like to contact me, that would 
be fine.  I've already talked to Nigel.  Thanks.  Hope you are well.....Jeff

Jeff- a couple of weeks ago, BT decided to close the Houston office and move 
the 6 people they have to New York - only 1 or 2 will go up there.  I just 
thought I'd tell you my thoughts of the Houston people - I worked with most 
for 4 years.  I know you probably know most of them.

Nigel Patterson- basically trained me - he is the NYMEX trader- worked for BT 
almost 13 years in London, NY, and Houston .  Andy Zipper trained him.  He's 
a good trader - traded currencies, commods (metals, energy).  He could trade 
any of our products- would be especially good at new businesses.  He has been 
in Houston for 4 years and is originally from New Zealand- has a wife and 2 
girls.  Vice President.

Calvin Schlenker- ran Calgary office for 2 years before we shut it in 1997- 
he then took on head of marketing role in Houston - his successes have been 
with producers - being able to exploit lending and hedging.  Most recently, 
he's been trading the nat gas options book.  Very smart guy with good ideas- 
analytical and conceptual- he'd be VERY good with Per's syndication efforts 
or credit derivative initiative.  Knows gas and crude.  He is Canadian- 
ex-wife and 2 kids.  Director.

Steve Provenzano - basis trader - very good contacts in the industry.  Worked 
for MG before BT. He did a lot of marketing with me.  Because he's done both 
trading and marketing, he's got a good edge with customers.  Only has gas 
experience.  He is likely to go to New York but recently got married and has 
a kid on the way.  Director.

Also, Deutsche's two head oil traders in London just quit- but I am not sure 
what they are doing yet- will find out.  That is Janelle Matharoo and Jason 
Thiel (MD and Director)- both been with BT almost 15 years- very good 
traders- always in London.  Jason used to be BT's head gold trader: Janelle 
has also traded metals.

Looks like Deutsche is crumbling on energy- I know they have added a few 
crude traders in NY to service their hedge fund clients (our prospective 
clients) but they have not been able to pull everything together- they are 
loosing all the key people in the business.

I'd like to help in the process of pulling some of these people in if we have 
the desire.

Kind Regards,
Caroline

Marti asked me to poll the Board to see if there is a strong preference for

would like to keep the meeting at 4 pm or possibly change it to Noon:

I would prefer that Board meetings be scheduled for Noon

I would prefer that Board meetings be scheduled for 4 pm

Jeff,

I apologize, because I realise that I had not introduced myself to you.  I 
work with John Ambler as Director for International Marketing and Public 
Relations.  The original release was drafted by Envera and since our PR 
department provides support for the Crude and Liquids Product group, as part 
of our PR responsibilities for EGM, it was sent to us to revise and run 
through the approval process.  The copy I sent to you is the revised version 
that we completed.  We now will send it through the Corp. PR approval 
process, which includes a review by Investor Relations.

Again, thank you for your kind cooperation.
Habiba

Thank you for your response.  Attached is the revised draft, please let me 
know if it meets with your approval.

I'd like to leave out mention of our equity participation in the first and 
third paragraphs, and reword the second paragraph to state that envera's 
customers will have access to enron's products.  (leave out the qualifier 
"many"  which I read as "partial")

	Habiba Bayi@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

Attached for your review and approval is the press release that Envera wishes 
to issue immediately announcing the participation of Enron Global Markets as 
an equity partner and trading member.  We already have sent it to John Nowlan 
and John Viverito and secured their approval.  Please let me know your 
comments.

You have been selected to participate in an interactive panel at next week's 
Enron Management Conference.  The panel, which is scheduled to take place at 
10:30 a.m. on Friday, November 17, will be the last session of the conference 
and will last approximately an hour and fifteen minutes.

You don't have to do any significant preparation.  All I ask is that you 1.) 
review an article, 2.) give some thought to your experiences at Enron, and
3.) come willing to talk.  Peter Skarzynski, founder and CEO of Strategos, 
will moderate the panel.  With Gary Hamel as its chairman, Strategos is a 
leading innovation consulting company. Gary will be presenting at the 
conference on Thursday.  His presentation will revolve around his latest 
book, Leading the Revolution.  In it, Gary outlines ten rules for designing a 
culture that fosters innovation.  We will focus the panel discussion around 
seven of the ten rules:

Set Unreasonable Expectations
Stretch Your Business Definition
Design an Open Market for Ideas
Offer an Open Market for Capital
Open up the Market for Talent
Lower the Risks of Experimentation
Make Like a Cell - Divide and Divide

To familiarize yourself with these rules, I will be sending you a Fortune 
magazine article (June 12) that provides an overview.  (You'll notice that 
Enron is used as an example for several of the rules.)  During the course of 
discussion, you will be asked to talk about your own experiences with 
innovation within Enron.  In sharing examples of innovation, Peter will ask 
you to address the following questions:

How did you do it?  (Were one or more of the rules applied?)
What were the hurdles? 
Where did you stumble?
What, if anything, was surprising?

Outside of discussing specific examples of innovation, the discussion might 
also include conversation around how to maintain a focus on innovation while 
running the day to day business or how to spot a good idea.

You'll notice I referred to this as an interactive panel.  Another element to 
this panel will be audience participation.  At this year's conference, for 
the first time  we will be utilizing an electronic audience response system 
(ARS).  Through the ARS, presenters will be able to pose yes/no, true/false, 
or multiple choice questions to the audience.  During the course of the panel 
discussion, Peter will solicit feedback from the audience on certain topics.  
The audience will be able to respond to questions immediately by simply 
pressing a button on an electronic keypad.  Responses will be instantaneously 
recorded and graphically displayed on the screen.

I want your participation in this panel to be as easy and painless as 
possible.  I will not be scheduling any meetings to discuss this further.  I 
will merely ask that you forego the scheduled break at 10:15 a.m. on Friday, 
and come to the front of the meeting room to speak briefly with Peter and to 
be equipped with a microphone.  If you wish to speak with Peter prior to 
November 17, he has assured me that he will make himself available to talk 
with any of you.  I will be happy to arrange a call for you.

If you will not be at the conference and therefore not able to participate, 
please contact me at your earliest convenience so we can consider a 
replacement for you.  Feel free to contact me with any other additional 
questions or concerns.  

I'm looking forward to working with each of you on this endeavor,

APP Risk Profile:

APP=01,s only immediate hope of meeting its debt payments is through asset =
sales=20
or a sell-off of pulp and paper inventory. Neither has much chance of=20
success. APP=01,s current strategy is to muscle its bond-holders into a=20
restructuring agreement as soon as possible, most likely before an early=20
March deadline for its next coupon payment falls due. There are significant=
=20
obstacles to evaluation of assets in a restructuring, from cross-guarantees=
=20
of bond issues that range across classes of bond holders and various=20
jurisdictions, to inter-company transfers that present a false picture of=
=20
financial health in some of its operating companies. Such obstacles ensure=
=20
that a restructuring exercise will be lengthy. APP is the fifth largest=20
issuer of junk bonds in the world, and has been regarded as a benchmark bon=
d=20
for Indonesia. Until the last few months, it was the only bond in the world=
=20
that traded at a premium to its own government=01,s bonds, and was the only=
=20
Indonesian issuer to raise funds successfully from capital markets in the=
=20
depth of the Asian crisis. A pronounced ripple effect is likely on Asian=20
bonds in the event of a default, as investors wait to see what happens to=

$12=20
billion in debt. At the moment, systemic fallout seems likely to be limited=
=20
to the Asian region, as investors revert to the hostile stance adopted duri=
ng=20
the Asian financial crisis.=20

APP Key Decision Makers:

The key decision makers at APP are CFO Hendrik Tse and CEO Teguh Ganda=20
Wijaya. No others in the company are privy to all the Group=01,s Affairs, o=
r to=20
corporate strategy. Information is extremely closely held. Sources say that=
=20
the APP situation is so complex that no one individual has a comprehensive=
=20
understanding of all the potential ramifications of a decision on any one o=
f=20
the assets of APP or its subsidiaries, so complex are the cross guarantees=
=20
and trigger clauses in the debt paper issued over the last few years.

Tee and Teguh Wijaya are to a large extent playing a bluff game, engaging i=
n=20
brinkmanship with their bond holders. It signaled the market that it could=
=20
move into a default situation on February 1 when its paper making subsidiar=
y,=20
Pabrik Kertas Tjiwi Kimiah, failed to make payments on two different bond=
=20
issues worth $43 million. On February 6, APP finally paid the coupon on one=
=20
of the bonds, a US$600 million note issued by Tjiwi Kimia Finance Mauritius=
,=20
just within a grace period of five business days. If Tjiwi Kimia had failed=
=20
to meet the deadline, it would have triggered cross default clauses on a=20
series of other bonds. The second coupon payment, of $13.5 million, for a=
=20
US$200 million issue of guaranteed senior notes due in 2001, is now late. W=
e=20
expect APP to wait until the last possible moment to make the payment. The=
=20
group is husbanding its cash in advance of an expected restructuring. The=
=20
better its cash position is, the more APP will be able to operate from a=20
position of strength in a restructuring negotiation.=20

According to one source: APP is =01&signaling the market and its bond holde=
rs=20
that it is in their best interest to help with a restructuring before=20
everything collapse. The idea is to squeeze the bondholders now, while they=
=20
still have some negotiating leverage rather than wait until there is nothin=
g=20
left.=018 APP is trying to play off one set of bond holders against another=
=20
because the interests of the bond holders in the operating companies, some =
of=20
which have significant cash flow, is different from those in the parent. Th=
is=20
is obviously a dangerous game, but one in which APP feels it has no choice=
=20
but to engage. The earlier it can restructure the better of it will be, and=
=20
the greater its chances of survival in some form. Trying to keep control of=
=20
the situation so that it doesn=01,t unravel is the name of the game at this=
=20
point. Tee and Widjaja are thinking quite far ahead and have targeted their=
=20
non-core subsidiaries for disposal in a debt restructuring. They have been=
=20
actively shopping their China assets for several months, and sources indica=
te=20
that their packaging assets will also go on the block. APP is still hopeful=
,=20
however, of engineering a debt restructuring so that it is on their terms.

One of the issues that adds greatly to the complexity of the situation is=
=20
that much of the sales from both companies come from within the group, and=
=20
often these go via another APP company or Sinar Mas. Another source said,=
=20
=01&This is a vertically integrated group and one of the worries is that if=
 you=20
start messing with the structure, let=01,s say one group of bond holders wa=
nts=20
to wind up one of the subsidiaries that is a primary customer, you could=20
threaten the whole group.=018=20

The Wijayas are well regarded by foreign investors, and are not in the=20
category of Suharto cronies such as forestry magnate Bob Hassan, who was=20
sentenced this past week to two years in jail for financial wrongdoings and=
=20
corruption. They are not saints =01) the Indonesian government removed the=
=20
Wijayas from the board of Bank Internasional Indonesia after it was=20
nationalized in 1999, based on evidence that they exceeded the 30 percent c=
ap=20
for lending to affiliates. However, they depend heavily on international=20
capital markets for funding and cannot afford significant steps that would=
=20
bar future access. At the moment, they have few alternatives to raise cash =
to=20
meet their debt payments other than through asset and inventory sales. The=
=20
company has built up substantial paper inventory, and according to one=20
source, it could use inventory sales to meet current cash obligations if it=
=20
could find a buyer. This is a big if, however, since current prices are=20
depressed and releasing further inventory to the market would only make=20
matters worse.

Asset Sales and Other Alternatives to Meet Debt Repayments:

An executive from a major international pulp and paper company confirmed th=
at=20
APP was actively trying to sell its Chinese assets.  These assets include:

o PT Ekamas Fortuna
o PT Purinusa Ekapersada
o Ningbo Zhonghua Paper
o Gold Hongye Paper
o Gold Hai Paper (Kunshan) Co.
o Jin Yu (Qingyuan) Tissue Paper Industry

The executive said that his company had looked at attractive parts of the=
=20
assets on offer, but had held back because of the impenetrable cross=20
guarantees between companies and reluctance of their bankers to finance an=
=20
acquisition at a discount that would offer no cover for their equity. The=
=20
executive believed that all the banks would have to agree to asset sales in=
=20
the context of a general restructuring before any individual bank would=20
finance an acquisition. Yet another issue is that the financing of the Chin=
a=20
factories was based on access to Indonesian pulp at intra-company prices.=
=20
Once the company is broken up into pieces, it will have to rely on the worl=
d=20
market and will no longer be able to produce at a profit. =20

Stora Enso made a formal bid for the assets last year but was rejected. It =
is=20
said to remain interested although the price it is willing to pay will be=
=20
considerably less. One of the problems with APP=01,s brinkmanship strategy =
is=20
that it is lowering the value of its assets. Companies will not be willing =
to=20
pay book value when it comes time for the company to sell off its non-core=
=20
assets.=20

Restructuring is imminent, creating opportunities for investors:

o A restructuring of the company in the near term seems inevitable and will=
=20
produce returns for existing bond holders if they bought at low enough pric=
es=20
and if their debt is secured by APP assets outside Indonesia
o A restructuring will release some of APP=01,s assets, which are considere=
d=20
attractive except for those in Indonesia. APP is the world=01,s low cost=20
producer of pulp and paper, with substantial assets in Indonesia, China, an=
d=20
India. Its Chinese factories are attractive despite current over-capacity i=

MKT SUMMARY

The producers did not dissapoint at Coaltrans with evidence as early as 
Monday afternoon that they had managed to whip up
a bullish frenzy amongst most of the industry participants. However the fact 
remains that fundamentals have changed little 
in the past month with the same supply issues which served to tighten this 
mkt over the last eight weeks continuing to keep a 
firm hold on the market throughout Q4 and Q1 2001. Indeed with the ocean frt 
market still steeply inverted for the winter versus
the rest of the year ( $11 versus $9.50 RBCT/ARA) and with the U.S mkt 
experiencing a massive squeeze front end (east coast
trading $35 fob barge) there is little sign of relief in the short term - Q1 
2001 Fob ARA is now trading close to $44 with Jan/Dec
2001 around $43.25. Producers will of course lead us to believe that the 
origin markets are structured in a steep contango for
the remainder of the year, however leaving the issue of mkt consolidation 
aside there is little in the mkt to justify this - if anything
demand in the Far East looks a little shakier with steel orders slowing down 
and the financial markets under pressure and forecasts
for European demand estimate unchanged demand year on year. While a marked 
sell off for second half of the year is unlikely we
see the forward curve on the fob origin side flat going forward rather than 
contango. This said we cannot preclude a shift higher
of absolute prices for the whole curve from where we are today at around $33 
Fob South Africa equivalent to $35 - there is still
plenty of business to be done for 2001 and my feeling is that consumers will 
end up buying into it rather than risk the wait and
see game - we cannot underestimate the influence on international prices that 
the cartel hold and even if this is exaggerated
it's implication is enuff to create a bullish psychology.

SPOT TRADES 

150,000mt of Pinang quality from KPC for Dec shipment at $27.60 Fob Indo 
basis 6000 kcal/kg
160,000mt of Prima  quality from KPC for Nov shipment at $30.15 Fob Indo 
basis 6400 kcal/kg
150,000mt option of Prima quality from KPC - to be shipped latest end June at 
$30.65 Fob Indo basis 6400 kcal/kg.
2 x 150,000mt Put Options from TXU for April/Sep and Oct/Mar 02 respectively. 
Strike price  is $40.50 basis Amsterdam/
Rotterdam and expiry is Feb 15 and Aug 15. Premium - $0.50 cents.

SELLING SIDE

British Energy - pitching a 1,3 and 5 year deal to them as an extension to 
current contract we have with them which runs out
end March.
Scotts Power - looking to turn present Feb cape commitment from CIF to  FOR 
deal and sell incremental cape for March 
arrival.
H Del C - offering them a 9 year put option basis the SECA.
Endessa - we have offered them 4 plus 1 cape business  for 2001 based on $31 
Fob South Africa.
NCSC - looking at doing various geographical swaps and they will be utilising 
EOL in the next week to hedge some of their 
implied short position.
Heidelberger - offered them a hdymax of South African material CNF Turkey for 
November delivery at $47.50.
Bremen - shud sign within the month an eight year deal with Stadtwerke Bremen 
supplying them some 850,000mt of generic
quality coal on an annual basis.
Bewag - currently working an offer to supply 1 million mt for 2001 on 
delivered stockpile basis
ENBW/Neckarverke/Preag - offering Oz material for Nov/Dec just shy of $43 fob 
ARA.
Braunschweig - offered them 3 x 60,000mt for Mar/Jun/Jly delivery into 
Nordenham at $43.75 cif.
 Dyckerhoff - offered 4 x 15,000mt of generic South Africa material for 
April/November delivery at $43.50 fob barge.

BUYING SIDE

Duiker - Have put various structures in front of Duiker which involves us 
buying a cape a quarter for 2001 - they are due to get
back to us within the next few days.
Drummond - offered us a 5 year deal staring in 2002 at $35 Fob Colombia - 
thanks!!
Krutrade - working numbers to put an aggressive multi-year offer in front of 
Krutrade as they seem to be the movers in the Russian
mkt at present - we must establish a decent source of Russian coal within our 
portfolio to service our Bremen and Bewag business
going forward.
Anker - talking with them re securing south african stem out of Maputo for 
2001 - they are looking at somewhere around the $27 fob
Maputo level.
Masefield - currently in talks with them to secure some tonnage out of Santa 
Marta for 2001.
Coal Procurement - talking about securing a hdymax shipment per quarter out 
of Durban for 2001
Currently working with U.S. on finalising numbers for Synfuel supplies for 
2001 but currently remain $0.75 - $1.00 apart.

We currently have some 50mmt of Colombian coal sitting on the ground in 
Amsterdan/Rotterdam to sell as fillers into backend
of the year and we have the M.V. Cleopatra Dream arriving in Rotterdam on Nov 
26 with 143mmt of Australian coal to sell into
the mkt.

EOL

Much of the talk at Coaltrans centred around the press release from 
GlobalCoal of the intention of the Cartel plus Rio to launch 
an e-platform which will provide mkts against 3 Fob origin points and an ARA 
delivery point. Details of operational functionality
are scarce and increasingly it looks like this is explained by fact that they 
themselves do not know but general consensus reckons
it will be operational end of first quarter 01. Rather than see this as 
competition, if successful it could provide us with more access
to markets than we have previously had and there shud be some fun and games 
to be had with the various producers.  

Total volumes for EOL to date are at 1,700,000mt. We have seen a lot of 
interest in our options which in not surprising given current mkt 
conditions as consumers look to hedge themselves with cheap out of the money 
options. As volatility increases other non-traditional coal 
players are also entering the mkt to utilise the opportunities which 
increasingly volatility presents. Next project is to get quotes in Euros and
after that we will begin to look at spark spreads via EOL.

GAMEPLAN

We had a major cuppla weeks on the buying side prior to Coaltrans - 75% of 
which is owned through optionality out of RBCT at between
$30 and $31.50. Additional avenues into South Africa through Maputo and 
Durban now means that we have a decent portfolio of South
African material to add to our Colombian long. Overall our position is some 
2.5 million mt long including the latest Indonesian purchases -
our efforts now are focused on securing some of the term business which is 
out there at current numbers - it is difficult to call this mkt
in either direction with any certainty and hence we are busy covering any 
downside potential with a host of put options which the utilities
are keen to mkt in this bullish enviroment. After weeks of writing that we 
need to add other origins to our long portfolio we look in far better
shape today with good prospects to add further flexibility in terms of 
diversity of origins which ultimately reduces our reliance on Drummond.
While the mkt in general is still seemingly unable to grasp the true value of 
an option we will continue to exploit this chink by owning as
much flexibility as possible thru physical put and call options.

Best Regards
Jez

Latest overview from our regular Tokyo source...

RJ

1. Mori=01,s (eventual) resignation shouldn=01,t have much impact on the Ja=
panese=20
economy or
yen-dollar beyond a brief knee-jerk reaction. Regardless of the new=20
government,=20
it seems clear Miyazawa and his surrogates will continue to control economi=
c=20
policy=20
and the figurehead nominally in charge of things doesn=01,t really matter.=
=20

2. The bottom line is the Japanese are itching for another joint interventi=
on.
The weak euro is hurting Japanese export sales in the euro zone and beyond
and they would like to draw a line in the sand near 85 euros to the dollar
and 92 yen to the euro. Problem is, the United States =01) in the person of
Larry Summers =01) wants intervention used only as a tool of last resort, a=
nd
only when central banks can use the element of surprise to spook market
players into euro buying and maximize the bang for their buck.

3. Will the Bank of Japan participate in another round of massive euro buyi=
ng?
Yes, but only when the U.S. participates in full measure. At what level wil=
l
that multilateral intervention next occur? Very difficult to say. If the
Japanese and some in Europe had their druthers they would have been in ther=
e
this week. Most analysts say the market has drawn a line in the sand at 80
euros to the dollar and if the central banks let the euro sink below that
level they=01,ll have a devil of a time getting it back up.

Our judgement is that they have to act above 80. To try to narrow our
prediction beyond that would, I think, be foolhardy.

4. As to yen-dollar, we see some further yen weakness ahead for several=20
reasons.
The wave of bankruptcies  in Japan shows no sign of abating. And they=01,re
getting bigger, with Kyoei Life=01,s demise the largest yet (4.5 trillion y=
en).
While big bankruptcies are inevitable and some see a silver lining because
Japan is finally trimming the dead wood from its economy, the effect on
market sentiment has been grim. The Nikkei remains lost in a dark, dark woo=
d
for that reason, and in sympathy with the NASDAQ.

Oil prices and the events in the middle east are also dollar positive on
balance, because of the flight to quality and the fact that much of the
world=01,s oil is denominated in dollars. And the Japanese first half repor=
ting
season ended Sept. 30, taking away a big incentive for exporters to
repatriate dollars.

So we see a somewhat weaker range for the yen over the near term =01) let=
=01,s
call it 108-112, with a bias towards the bottom of that range. There=01,s s=
ome
heavy resistance to the dollar  around 111.73, this year=01,s peak. So whil=
e the
dollar might poke through 110 some time soon, the bulk of trading should be
in the 108-109 range.

Longer term, rising profits on the export and high-tech sectors and continu=
ed
strong capital investment will pull the economy slowly out of the woods. An=
d
we continue to look for a stronger yen next year.

5. On BOJ policy, don=01,t look for another rate increase any time soon. Th=
e BOJ
took a lot of flack for the timing of its August increase and they made the=
ir
political point about independence. Our outlook is for an even keel on
monetary policy near term. No change at least through the end of this year.

6. Technology notes: Japanese semiconductor makers are set to announce stro=
ng
earnings growth in the year ended Sept. 30. NEC, Toshiba, Fujitsu, Hitachi
and Mitsubishi Electric chip divisions will all report operating profits up
between 20 percent and 60 percent. =01(

And you may have seen where four Japanese companies =01) Matsushita Electri=
c,
Toshiba, Sony and Hitachi are entering into another venture to create
interactive broadcasting and storage datacasting =01) eventually producing
advanced TV set- top boxes (STBs). These are the next generation boxes that

No thoughts on Skilling's speech.  He just needs to emphasize we are a great 
productive entrepreneurial company.  Any we're are largest energy trading and 
risk management house in the world.  It would be ok if he mentioned that I am 
a Wharton '89 undergrad and run a large part of our trading group.  Students 
like to see where successful wharton alum are in the world.  (By the way, I'm 
the lead for wharton grad and wharton/penn undergrad).  This speech he is 
giving is a great opportunity for us to recruit...

On another note, I have an idea for you.  Get on my calendar for early part 
of week after next  (I'm going to the Japan office opening, then to sydney 
and will be in the office nov. 6)  Keep a low profile on the xcelerator for a 
week.

The French are pushing for the $10B conversion because they view it as a 
"free intervention."  If the Iraqis converted the account all at once, it 
would be 2X bigger than the September G7 intervention.  Not clear yet if they 
will do a conversion of the account, or if they will just do oil contracts 
going forward in euros.

We continue to monitor the oil/Euro on two fronts.  With respect to Iraq, the 
US has dropped its opposition to allowing Baghdad to receive its oil revenues 
from the UN oil-for-food program in euros rather than dollars.  This means 
that the estimated 10 billion $US in Iraq's BNP account could be converted to 
euros in the next 30 days, perhaps all at once.  We are looking into the 
exact timing and process for this conversion.

Per our report on Wednesday about Welteke lobbying the Saudis to convert 
their oil trading to euros, we await further information  We will keep you 
posted as new information comes in.

No doubt about drinks with you being more fun!  (My haircut is perfect, 
you'll be pleased to know)  I did go out with my neighbors last night--I 
needed to because the guy who is buying my house on woodhead st.  came over 
last night and backed out of his contract.  Boy was I annoyed.  And still am, 
but the good news is he loses his earnest money to me.  So I'm going to take 
out a bunch of friends to dinner when i get back.  Want to go?  I'm thinking 
Tony's or something else fun/festive.  To be determined...but fun.

I had a lunch meeting today.  I love lunch meetings.  I am leaving early 
too.  yeah!  I have to go to the invitation store for work, then I have a new 
book I want to get (I love to read), and I have some other random stuff to 
do.  are you leaving early for fun or work?  dinner was great.  thanks for 
asking.  I hope that your drinks were fun and that your haircut is just how 
you like it.  I still think that drinks with me would have been much more fun 
than your haircut!

Have you been outside?  I have to leave early today!  Hope your dinner was 
great....

Jeff,

I visited the Networks-sponsored Houston Technology Center and had a chance 
to interview with all the people working there. I believe that a rotation 
there could give me the opportunity to learn a great deal about the 
entrepreneurial/technology circles and at the same be a good tie-back to 
enron for my third stage. I would appreciate any suggestions or comments you 
might have. Again, thank you for your help.

Massimo  

it seems the cnn/usa today poll always shows bush up be the widest margin.  
do they have a motive here?

Robert Johnston
10/27/2000 12:27 PM
FYI -- the CNN/USA Today poll today will likely  show Bush up by 13 points 
over Gore.
?
Recall that this is the wildly volatile poll,  however, and could, as it has 
in recent weeks, flip back just a  quickly.

let's get it to stop the hemorrhaging in is dist. portfolio as well.

no these are not . 

I'd like to leave out mention of our equity participation in the first and 
third paragraphs, and reword the second paragraph to state that envera's 
customers will have access to enron's products.  (leave out the qualifier 
"many"  which I read as "partial")

Attached for your review and approval is the press release that Envera wishes 
to issue immediately announcing the participation of Enron Global Markets as 
an equity partner and trading member.  We already have sent it to John Nowlan

I am not sure what the fee is but yes there has already been a firm 
commitment to speak at the meeting (Haug days).  I tried to get out of it but 
too late.  We are turning our presentation into an EOL push for electronic 
trading for LPG and LNG.  

I will run down if we actually have to pay 200 grand as well.  Brochures - 
yes there is a draft floating around but I have told these guys that I do not 
want anything put together specifically for the meeting.  I thought we could 
wait till we start making some cash and have a better handle on who we want 
to focus on in terms of customers

We are tracking the poll numbers and trends heading into the election.  Still 
too close to call, but momentum may be swinging back to Gore.

The major tracking polls: Bush Leading in 4, Gore in 1.

       ABC    CNN    MSNBC  Voter  W.Post
Bush   48     49     43     44     47
Gore   46     42     45     40     45

Note that Bush is leading in West Virginia and Louisiana, what should be Gore 
states, but Gore is leading in Florida and Ohio, two "must-win" Bush states.  
Gore is trending favorably in large vote-rich states including not only 
Florida and Ohio, but also New Jersey and Pennsylvania as well as traditional 
Democratic strongholds such as Minnesota and Wisconsin.  One caveat is that 
today's NYT Florida poll is the flip of yesterday's Florida Sun Sentinel 
Florida poll that showed Bush leading (46-41).  Bush has changed his schedule 
and is on his way to Ohio tonight. 
 
Latest State Polls: "Bad News" for  Both

Please let Nina know which of these days is best for your schedules ASAP and
we will get back to you with the final decision.

Mike/Jeff,

I met with Jim Bernhard, Chairman, President and CEO of the Shaw Group, who 
owns Stone & Webster (see below) on Monday and he gave his blessing to move 
forward asap with a crude supply and/or product off take JV at the Orion 
refinery in Norco, La. I am going to NYC in early November to meet with First 
Boston and see how real this opportunity could be and whether we want to 
enter into an MOU with Shaw. I have been keeping Larry Lawyer advised and he 
is willing to help the process any way possible. 

Doug
	
	

Larry,

I am working with Stone & Webster, a large EPC company who wants Enron Global 
Fuels to work with them regarding the crude oil supply and refined products 
offtake at a refinery in Norco, La. This is a 200,000 barrel per day refinery 
capable of using heavy crude oil and has a 75,000 barrel a day coker unit. 
They own a 12.5% interest in the Orion refinery (formerly called Goodhope) 
and Credit Suisse and First Boston own a combined 68% equity share. Jack 
Stanley, who was involved in this refinery in the past has no current or 
future ownership or involvement in the refinery. I told S&W that it was a 
prerequisite that Mr. Stanley not be involved in any way before I would send 
them a standard ENA confidentiality agreement and start preliminary 
discussions about our role with the refinery. So far they have neither 
offered, nor asked Enron for any equity involvement, but rather are focused 
on us proposing physical liquid fuels and risk management structures. 

I am waiting for S&W to schedule a meeting in Baton Rouge with their top 
management to discuss their plans and how we can assist. Hopefully, this will 
lead to something tangible and I will bring you into the picture so we can do 
some kind of financial structure or equity along with, or in lieu of, the 
supply/offtake angle. I realize refineries have been a non-starter with Mr. 
Skilling, but with good crack spreads and new management within EGM maybe 
there is a possibility here. 

Please keep this very confidential. 

Regards,
Doug

Sources assess that the US will not confront Iraq over its demand to switch 
its oil transactions from dollars to euros, and therefore no major disruption 
in Iraqi exports is expected on the November 1 deadline set by Iraq for the 
switch.  The worst-case scenario now seen is a very brief "hiccup" in exports 
for a period of 1-3 days as the euro account is created and the letters of 
credit are arranged for November liftings.

Sources report that Saudi Arabia has reconciled its internal differences and 
now favors an OPEC production increase of 500,000 b/d according to the 
"trigger mechanism."  It is expected that the decision to increase output 
will be announced on Friday October 27 or Monday October 30.

Is this a violation, or are we just shifting portfolios around.  Jeff

trading energy  for last six months to an year. I know him some, and he seems 
to have good trader sense. He is pretty hungry.  Just in case the

Good afternoon Harry,

Thank you very much for returning my phone call so promptly.  I have
attached my CV for your review.  I am quite excited to meet with you and any
of your colleagues to discuss where I can best contribute to Enron.  Please
feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions.  I am leaving
slightly early this afternoon for Austin (Go Longhorns) but will obviously
be back in the office Monday.  Have a super weekend.

Best regards,

Regarding market development opportunities for EOL, I believe there is a huge 
market possibility for a Light Louisiana Sweet (LLS) to become a or the 
benchmark. LLS should be the price discovery market for the Atlantic basin 
crude oils. Wti should not be the market and neither should Dated brent. I 
think there is a unique opportunity at present to pursue this. Most market 
participants are not content to used dated as a benchmark, particularly after 
the latest squeeze  by Arcadia.. Wti is perceived to be too manipulated by 
B.P. I would like to set up a meeting soon to discuss my thoughts. Please let 
me know when everyone would be available. How about tomorrow @ lunch?

John, Please look into this.  Thanks.  Jeff
	
	

Jeff - Franz Klem of EVN is a good friend of mine - and most recently our 
best customer for coal in Austria.  He is real pissed at the way our LPG team 
has handled the Sinopec Jingling Petchem business, and made it clear to me 
that he is looking for us to hop in and lend a hand.   EVN has done business 
with the project, and apparently have had positive results to date.

The "Manfred" mentioned in his email is Manfred Ungetheum of our office in 
Germany.  I would appreciate your checking into what is going on, and why we 
are not paying proper attention to these guys. 

I will be in on Monday.  Thanks.

Dear George,

I was pleased to see you in Madrid unfortunately we had to less time for
some beers or wodkas. At the moment I am out of office for another two days,
today we have a state holiday and tomorrow I will take one day off. I have
to keep up my golfing a little bit.

George, you promised me to have a look at the LPG deliveries to China, the
situation again is as follows:

My very good friend Wolfgang Hofer has good contacts to the SINOPEC JINGLING
PETROCHEMICAL Corp., Najing, China. They plan the retrofitting and enlarging
of their polypropylen capacities for about 120.000 mtons/year. As a raw
material they need LPG and the production should start at the beginning of
2001. They want a longterm contract for 300.000 mt/y with increasing option
to 400.000 mt/y. Further they are looking for a delivery already this year
50 to 60.000 mt.
Mr. Cheng Zu Shan, the chief of planning and finance dept. was already in
Vienna and met Wolfgang Hofer. Manfred introduced Wolfgang to Tracy Wallace
and than to Eric Hanson and now we are waiting for any answer from ENRON
since weeks.

May be it is interesting for ENRON because there will be a second trading
option when Jingling offers you the products.

Please George have an eye on that business because Wolfgang has to answer
his Chinese partners very soon.

Herewith I send the name and address from Wolfgang, for the direct contact
to him:

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists 
today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the 
weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to 
Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees 
in the weather business.  Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with 
each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition.  It is 
important that both business units work together to determine which 
individuals will be in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will 
begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious 
that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the 
synergies will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power 
businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.

Hi Michele

I am writing to confirm that Enron will be participating in the
Sales/Trading
panel.

I have some great news. We have decided to give Enron the Sponsorship
spot for the Sales and Trading panel.

Key benifits of being a Panel Sponsor

- A big Enron Banner can be displayed indicating that you are the official
sponsor of the entire Sales/Trading panel
- Mention in the program guide and all other conference material
- In addition to the panelist spot on the Sales/Trading panel, Enron
gets to open the panel session with a 15-20min presentation on general
trends in the sales and trading industry, an excellent opportunity
for a senior person from Enron to address the audience.

Also for folks from Enron coming to the conference we have hotel rooms
blocked at a discount price at the Park Hyatt.

I will be getting you a lot of the details with regards to logistics for the
panel and Enrons participation in the conference in the coming weeks..

Once again, I would like to thank you for the sponsorship and presence at
The finance conference.

Looking forward to it..

be surprised if i were your only friend who learns lessons from weekday 
comedies--is to be happy!...if you're free, let's go out tomorrow eve and

for me.  If that doesn't work, Thursday may work, but on the later side.  I 
think I have to have a drink with a consultant coming into town, but I am not 
sure.  

Have a safe trip and I can't wait to hear all about it.  If you decide that 
Australia is to amazing to leave, I will completely understand and we can 
reschedule.  I wouldn't blame you a bit!  In fact, we could have drinks

With regards to the situation in Iraq, we have close contacts with Bayoil, 
who is the largest lifter to the US. They remain very bearish the market 
,though they are sold out on their november arrivals they have a lot of 
barrels available in december. They feel the Euro situation will be of small 
impact and they are seeing business as usual for november loading. As a side 
note they are normally right about the Iraqi situation but last year they did 
have vessels waiting at Mina al Bakr when the Iraqis cancelled loadings. I'll 
let you know if they change their tune.

Can't get bigger with lousy IT support in London.  This has been an issue for 
some time.  Lot's of people look concerned -but not too much improvement.

as usual we were the first group in london to spot that the enron server in 
houston was having some problems and a big back log of messages (for good 
reasons as we were anxiously awaiting  an incoming message which never came 
on one of our ship which is in a delicate situation).
why on earth is it that we don t get a warning that there is a problem so 
that we can tell our customers, suppliers to use direct fax line s or other 
means of communications  . in this instance the long awaited message was 
worth 60 000 usd but could have been much more .

thanks for the update.

Jeff,

The LNG group currently has 4 development engineers where their reporting was 
previously into Haug.  I was wondering if within EGM, we had any other 
engineers that we could group these resources with in terms of reporting.  

If not, I would suggest that we make the most senior one group lead (Dave 
Glessner) and have them report directly to you or Mike.  Although these guys 
are currently focused on LNG activities, I know from experience with a couple 
of them they also have generalists capabilities.  In Europe, Brian Stanley 
leads this develop engineering effort where he represents the owner (Enron 
Europe).  He has dual reporting into Sherriff and Larry Reynolds (one of 
Izzo's guys).  

If you could come back to me on this quickly it would be very helpful as this 
is the last thing we need to finalise in our group structure.

Thanks
Eric
Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes.

Fyi.  Put this on the calendar.

Mike/Jeff:  

Each year at about this time I hold an LNG Offsite meeting to review the 
progress of the year and to set direction for the next year.  This year's 
offsite has been scheduled for 20/21 November at the woodlands.  We picked 
these dates and reserved (and paid for) the Woodlands earlier this year 
because almost all members of the worldwide LNG team will be in the US at 
this time for either the San Antonio conference or Gastech.

Given the recent reorganization and changes in Enron's international 
direction, I feel that this meeting is more vital than usual.

I assume that some members of the group will want to take vacation later in 
the week because of Thanksgiving---therefore, I plan to compress the offsite 
into a one-day meeting on 20 November and leave 21 Nov for ad-hoc team 
meetings and/or golf for those who want to stay another day.

This would be a perfect opportunity to educate the entire team on "mark to 
market" mechanics, the LNG "book", enron online and any other similar topics 
that may be appropriate.  To that end, we are working on the following agenda:

Overview of EGM/Enron Corp direction:  Mick Mcconnell/Jeff Shankman

LNG organization and strategic objectives:  Rick Bergsieker/Eric Gonzales

LNG risk book:     Presented by Merritt Thomas/Brad Hitch??

Enron Online demonstration and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brad Hitch

Mark to Market fundamentals and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brent 
Price

2000 review/objectives for 2001:

Eastern Hemisphere:  Clay Harris

Atlantic Basin:  Doug Arnell/Emilio Vicens

Shipping, terminalling and Fuel Management:   Wayne Perry

Legal:  Dan Rogers

Several questions:

Mike/Jeff:  would either or both of you be available to participate,at least 
for an hour or so to get us started?

Eric:  can you be there at least for Monday?

Jeff:  have I picked the right people for risk book and online presentations?

Brent:  can you be there to conduct a seminar on Mark-to-Market (including 
key contractual provisions required)?

FYI, Wayne Perry and his assistant Cindy Long are coordinating arrangements 
for this offsite.

This is the proposed invite list to the LNG offsite that has been scheduled 
for the Woodlands on Monday, Nov. 20. Please send me the names of any 
additions you suggest. I would like to get out a note to people on this ASAP.

We plan an all day meeting on Monday and Golf, etc for those that want to do 
so on Tuesday. That way those that need to travel or work are only tied down 
one day. I would also appreciate any agenda ideas you may want to include. 

Thanks

Wayne
Wayne -

I heard back from Emilio and he said to go ahead and leave Margaret's name 
(she might be gone by the time of the offsite) but he would advise of her 
replacement.  He does not have a replacement as this time.

Wayne -  Below is the revised list, please note I am waiting on information 
regarding Margaret Rhee and/or replacement.

Looks good.  Coordinate with Chris and John and let's move on this.

1.  Brent-Dubai calendar swap differential.  Idea would be to trade this 
differential on a quarterly basis.
2.  WTI-Brent calendar swap differential.  Same timing idea, Nymex v IPE..
3.  WTI-Dated Brent calendar swap differential.  Nymex v Platts Dated Brent.
4.  WTI-Brent  futures differential.  Issue would be settlement dates given 
the time lag between expiry.

I'll look for him on my calendar.

10/24/2000 08:32 PM
Jeff,

Let me know what you think of this guy.  Wade Cline and Tim Det. are both 
high on him.  Jeff Donahue is not so sure but will meet with him on Friday.  
During my lunch with Jeff, we discussed that we need a Corp. Dev guy 
dedicated to us full time but if he reported to him, that would be great.  I 
think we could use that co-ordination with his group as long as we didn't get 
a part time guy in the process.  He could also report to us obviously (like 
Larry) but i think in this case a dual role makes a  lot of sense.  What do 
you think?

If you like Don, he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our Corp 
Dev work, but that is of course not the best reason.  I thought he was all 
right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an 
innovative thinker.  He has also worked as a trader and although it doesn't 
seem possible by his personality, having some background is a plus.  

Mike

I was planning on changing the morning meeting as you indicated.  

The problem with the P&L loss is one of time.  We have given back 25 million 
this quarter, and very few traders took profits at any time.  I expect 
traders to lose money at times, but we have other constraints.  I'd be happy 
to have a call with you once we finish our budget process about how we will 
get to our numbers next year. Of course spread trading is a good idea, but 
when I look at the portfolio in aggregate, the position story I'm being told 
doesn't make sense.  
We'll get there.  

Chris Mahoney
10/24/2000 07:21 PM
The issue of making the morning meetings more inspiring is a challege we need 
to take up.  I would suggest we move to traders
telling what the main positions are in their books (3 max) and then give a 
bullish (max +2) to bearish (max -2) view of their mkt.  If we
moved more quickly through this we might have time for more meaningful 
discussion at the end.  I think that the discussion at the
end we can keep flexible but for instance when we have major issues like spr 
sales or an opec meeting we should delegate somebody
to do a review of that.  In terms of the wed meeting, unless there is 
something special, I would recommend letting the new research
analyst we have hired in London do a quick API review.

The issue of high volatility in the markets makes a good argument for 
lowering position sizes but the issue of not having
any money to lose won't ever go away.  I base that statement on the premise 
that with the budget for next year set at 175 million
we will always be under pressure to meet budget and not give back any 
profits.  The books that have historically made the most
money in enron global products have been more spread trading/view oriented 
rather then flat price/momentum oriented.  I know
you would prefer we move away from this and become more the latter but I 
would encourage you to consider the fact that we have
little edge in forecasting short term price movements but hopefully have 
enough staying power and experience to position ourselves
correctly for the big moves.         

   
	
	

It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the 
following:  Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed 
tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy  (?),  and no 
real weather anywhere in the world.  I think it would be most prudent to play 
the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more 
aggressively.  I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US. 
electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature.  Given that, 
and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a 
problem, let's be as flat as possible. I'm ok with spread risk  (not front to 
backs, but commodity spreads).  

The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for 
everyone's passion with respect to the markets.  As such, I'd like to ask 
John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon. and Wed.  

Thanks.   Jeff

Thanks for the thought.  We are trying to get more fund business already 
through Per in the NY office.  Do you have any funds you'd like to sign up.  
In terms of products, I was thinking more depth in products we feel 
comfortable managing.  Maybe different spreads/cracks, whatever.  You can 
control product launch, not the funds.  Can you give a some ideas of more/new 
products we trade or more/new products you'd like to get on eol.  What more 
products will your customers want?  

Jeff

Chris Mahoney
10/24/2000 06:30 PM
Jeff,
One thought that will take some work with the credit department is to try and 
get more of the fund and small trading companies to do
their day trading with us.  I would think getting the small specs on our 
system would give us much greater daily deal flow.  On the oil
side, our main counterparties are the large speculative trading shops and 
this reflects that it is mainly proprietary traders that we
are attracting at this stage.  Not sure how realistic this is from a credit 
perspective but if we could create some type of margin account
for the smaller players, similiar to the futures exchange clearing houses,  
we might be able to significantly increase our volumes with 
the existing instruments that we are presently offering.   

   
	
	

FYI.  I'd like to be number 2 behind ENA.  And a close 2nd that is. This 
should be a priority for us. I'd like to set up a meeting shortly to put 
together a strategy on how we can get there.  More to follow.

Can you try to use your amazing persuasion skills on Mauricio - he has an 
Associate offer and came to sell weekend.  He's trying to decide between us 
and ABN Amro (also had a JP Morgan offer, but decided not to take it).  His 
concern is the $10k differential on our signing bonus and $20k differential 
in the guaranteed year end bonus because he wants to pay down his loans.  He 
wants to see if there is anything that we can do.  He feels like Enron is the 
better long term choice, but banking is a better short term choice.

Can you give him a call - 215.732.9989 (home) or 215.432.0183 (cell).

I'll call you later today to talk about Bob Rose at Bank America.  He's been 
trading crude with them for a while, and I believe he's well respected in the 
market.  He might be in the market for a job, but wants to keep a low 
profile.

Jeff,

Occidental and I have developed significant philosophical differences on how
to run our gas and liquids business.  I am committed to making a career
change shortly after the first of the year.  I know that you are busy, but I
would appreciate you taking a brief look at my resume and giving me a heads
up on the best way to approach Enron.  Thanks.

Ahead of tonight's stats, I've gone through last week's numbers (note - DOE, 
not API) and a few things leap out as worth noting and looking for this week.

Despite the API numbers, and the Mexican hurricane, crude imports were down 
just 150 kb/d, just 40 of which was in PADD 3 (Gulf Coast). Although imports 
are down from the peak in August, they still lie at least 500 kb/d above 
recent years' levels.
Bizarrely, the SPR rose by 0.5 mbbls last week, and 70kb/d of imports were 
specifically allocated to SPR - partly offsetting the 4.5 mbbl commercial 
stock draw.
There is no sign yet of distillate demand slowing, rather it continues to 
climb, and is well into winter levels.
Distillate output is strong, due to very high yields, rather than high 
throughput.

What does this mean for stocks?

The refinery runs show we are well into the maintenance season, and crude 
stocks almost always rise this time of year. But if the weather disruptions 
did not show up in last week's DOEs, they may appear tomorrow. DOE crude 
stocks are 2.5mbbls above API.
With distillate demand still storming, and runs falling, we could be in for 
another week or two of distillate draws.
As a result of the yield and the runs, gasoline stocks will likely follow the 
seasonal pattern and fall once more. DOE mogas stocks are 3.5 mbbls below API.

The consensus appears to be for builds across the board, but some of these 
factors might argue otherwise. Some charts are attached illustrating the 
points.

Thanks for the invite, but I will be unable to attend.   Jeff

was asked into a meeting yesterday regarding the eventual purchase of 15-25% 
of the gdansk refinery.
enron has been approached by the polish govt (and the main russian crude 
supplier JNS) to participate in this privatisation.  i have copies of the 
brief for all of you.  further background is that JNS (a smaller russian 
crude supplier) has 85% of the contracts into that refinery (and the Plock 
refinery), and controls the Druzbha pipeline.  they want us to b involved as 
the headline western company.  (the Plock ref people and the JNS people wud 
like to buy the thing but for political reasons cannot until about 5 years 
down the road.)   Therefore, we can structure our deal w/ a put option for a 
later date.
We can view this as a long crack position, with an eventual put in place 
if/when we don't like the deal.
There are other optionality benefits that need to be assessed.  (so far i 
have told them to count the trading angle as 0 profit, so that they don't 
load us up w/ a lot of bs).  We can use the facilities as a terminal.  We can 
just use the infrastructure to re-sell the crude that they get on the 
pipeline.  We can sell the ulsd they make and replace w/ regular diesel.  
Given their power needs they have their own plant but are still short 300 MW, 
so the power people like it.  etc etc.
I have already told them that we did not really want to waste our time 
thinking about this project if the specter of a reuters headline blaring that 
'Enron Buys Polish Refinery' is going to kill the deal from Skilling's 
perspective.  they assure me that they have run it by sheriff and he likes 
the power aspect and the higher profile this wud give us in poland so he is 
favorable towards it, for the moment.  rac will be looking for 20-25% roi, 
which may kill the whole thing anyway.  they have already gotten toxic waste 
indemnity from the govt.

we need to ask questions/poke holes and get as much information as possible 
out of the govt and JNS, because either they will do the deal and throw this 
in our laps, or they might pass on something that wud actually turn out to be 
interesting.  
if everybody wud please read the brief and come up w/ issues to be clarified 
by wednesday next week, i would appreciate it. thx    

I had to cancel my trip to Phila today--bummer.  Nov 7 is fine.  (I'm out of

for me.  If that doesn't work, Thursday may work, but on the later side.  I 
think I have to have a drink with a consultant coming into town, but I am not 
sure.  

Have a safe trip and I can't wait to hear all about it.  If you decide that 
Australia is to amazing to leave, I will completely understand and we can 
reschedule.  I wouldn't blame you a bit!  In fact, we could have drinks 
there....I've never been!

The most significant aspect of the syncrude production problem is the unique 
blending qualities of the sweet crude produced by the plant. The synthetic 
crude produced by this plant has no bottoms. All other crude oils have at 
least some bottoms, therefore the demand on the replacement blending barrel 
will be higher than the volume of barrels lost. With the plant production 
down approximately 3.5 to 4.0 millions barrels, the impact ultimately will be 
an increase of wti demand during the Oct. 15-nov 15  approaching 130,000 b/d. 
Given the tightness of light sweet crude oil in padd 2, I believe this is 
significant. I think it was the main reason for x/z strengthening and the 
recent strength in z/f may also be attributed to this recent supply 
disruption. Until there are additional sweet barrels arbed into padd 2 from 
padd 3, I think we will see strength in the prompt spreads.

Yes, there is a formalized process.  After Credit and Legal, and in most 
cases RAC, look at transactions, a VP or higher will sign the Dash.  For Doug 
to sign the Bahamas option contract, I need to know the premium.  Please 
contact Brent Price for our DASH.  (Deal approval sheet)

Jeff

   Merritt Thomas                10/23/2000 04:51 PM

Jeff,

I'm sorry to bother you with this, but I can't seem to get a straight answer 
from anyone - when one is signing a contract around here, is there a form you 
fill out for approval?  In London, everyone fills out a CACS form (Contract A
uthorisation Control Sheet), and if the deal is > $0.5m, then a DASH is 
required as well.  Brad seems to think that if a DASH is not required, then 
the business unit head signs off on the expenditure?  Is there a formalised 
global-markets process for this, or is this a product-by-product thing?  (in 
which case, I'll assume LNG has no process, and I'll direct Eric to implement 
one...)  (Doug Arnell needs to purchase his option for the Bahamas land 
thing, thus the reason for the question).

fyi, attached is European CACS form. 

Thanks,
Merritt  

I'll defer to you.  How does this supplement your reports now?

Mike and Jeff:

I am rethinking the legal reports.  Alan and I am preparing a monthly trading 
and transactional summary, a litigation report and the TOP TEN legal risk 
report.  To me the last two are the most important.  On a conceptual basis, 
is that what you need or want to see?

Mark

Do you have an answer for me regarding the simulation I asked you to run?
jeff,we have bought approx. 2.75mmbbls. of dec crude and reduced heat cracks 
300mb. This means we should be close to our var limits
but not sure if under. Secondly,products has var coming from heat cracks (we 
got hit on EOL for 975 mb  on friday),jet swaps  (also EOL earlier
last week  of about 1mm bbl.),and some gasoline cracks in 2002.Otherwise our 
products positions on both dides of the Atlantic are as small
as anytime in recent history.

   
	
	

John, you guys have to be under Var tonight before we leave for the evening.  
That means buying on access if necessary.  

Thanks for the update.  What you point out in your email is exactly what we

when you are ready.

I am pleased that Jason Fischer is doing a fine job as he took my place in 
the role of checking out NYMEX trades and formulating new
relationships with brokers.

One of the key aspects of this job was moving trades to brokerage houses with 
credit financing available at no cost.  Basically,
the brokerage houses want to capture the brokerage fees, in volume, and 
believe that they are able to not worry about charging
for the credit lines.

I'd like to meet you with about this.  An contact of mine in accounting and I 
developed a spreadsheet (see attached: Xpit analysis) to measure
how much we are able to save by these movements.  Also, according to the 
accomplishments list, you'll notice that because of our actions on Fri Oct
13 directed by John Wilson in Products, only for CL, HO, and HU, we were able 
to see an instantaneous change from paying out millions each day to 
the numerous brokers to having millions of dollars wired to us by the brokers.

One of the critical functions of my former job was to manage the positions of 
all futures and options
for all commodities.  From my experience in working closely with the traders, 
we discovered, especially on
Friday, October 13, that moving positions to brokerage houses with credit 
financing dramatically 
reduced our margin expenses thus increasing our daily cashflow in our wired 
brokerage 
accounts. 

Most of September and the week of Oct 9 had negative cashflows.

In addition, I worked with our global finance group, (Sarah Wesner) , to 
increase existing lines and open
other lines of credit at other brokerage houses.

This action, provided we monitor this vigilantly and remind the traders on a 
frequent basis to stay
focused on clearing trades with houses that have financing, will save Enron 
millions of dollars everyday.

Our treasury group, (Mary Perkins), is pleased with this type of financing 
approach as we
are using the additional money to reduce Enron's short term debt.
 
I have informed my former group (esp. Jason Fischer) of the tremendous value 
which my prior
function may add to Enron's financial well-being. 

It is this type of proactive thinking and creative financing that I hope to 
generate in my next rotations. Currently, I am in 
EnronCredit.com.

Furthermore, now that I am in the analyst program, I'd like to discuss with 
you in the late summer/early fall for rotation opportunities.

Thanks

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists 
today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the 
weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to 
Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees 
in the weather business.  Accordingly Mark and I will be looking at, with 
each of you, the employees that may be affected by this transition.  It is 
important that both business units work together to determine which 
individuals will be in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will 
begin adding to the weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious 
that the organizations and product lines can lever each other and the 
synergies will provide powerful results in our regional gas and power 
businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.  

Thanks for the clarification.  Get it listed if you like.

Regarding MTBE we all are aware it will likely phase out over the next 2/3 
years BUT we are a producer of 15,000 bpd from our company owned gulf coast 
plant. We also have several years left on our MTBE marketing agreement with 
Dubai Natural Gas Company. As a producer we are in an Ideal position to make 
markets in gulf coast MTBE. While the production facility was not a good 
business for Enron (and has been mostly written off) MTBE Trading has been 
and continues to be a good business. I would assume that the plant is also 
now making profits with the capital expense written off.

Great.  Thanks.   Jeff

   
	
	

Jeff:

About a month ago, we asked EOL to create three new products for the 
financial petrochemical and plastics desk.  They are:

1.  propylene (polymer grade), 
2.  a polypropylene to propylene spread, and
3.  a polyethylene to ethylene spread.

We expect to have these rolled out this week.

Doug

John Nowlan is concerned that this var number isn't right.  According to 
john, the group significantly reduced postions (on the whole).  What about 
the forward forward vol?  Have we looked at that?  My instinct is that 
something is not accurate with this var number today if you look at the 
resulting position as of Friday evening's postion report.  I'd like someone 
to be dedicated to the crude and products group full time who can help us 
with "what if" scenarios throughout the trading day, and who can work with 
Pavel on the crude desk on the forward forward vol issue.  Also, I'd like to 
isolate first gas holdings since that is taking up approx 2 million in var 
each day.  

Jeff

Risk Ops. had problems loading the ERAC crude options spreadsheet  and VaR 
had to be recalc. twice to confirm the $12.7MM violation.  Furthermore, we 
had to scrub and confirm all positions with risk ops. before limits report 
can be published.

Hi Lea, 

What are you thinking about with Jeff (Koons)?  

Jeff

FYI.  I sent this monday 4pm if you hear any rumblings.  Jeff
	
	

It seems to me we are in the middle of no man's land with respect to the 
following:  Opec production speculation, Mid east crisis and renewed 
tensions, US elections and what looks like a slowing economy  (?),  and no 
real weather anywhere in the world.  I think it would be most prudent to play 
the markets from a very flat price position and try to day trade more 
aggressively.  I have no intentions of outguessing Mr. Greenspan, the US. 
electorate, the Opec ministers and their new important roles, The Israeli and 
Palestinian leaders, and somewhat importantly, Mother Nature.  Given that, 
and that we cannot afford to lose any more money, and that Var seems to be a 
problem, let's be as flat as possible. I'm ok with spread risk  (not front to 
backs, but commodity spreads).  

The morning meetings are not inspiring, and I don't have a real feel for 
everyone's passion with respect to the markets.  As such, I'd like to ask 
John N. to run the morning meetings on Mon. and Wed.  

Thanks.   Jeff

Following are my sugestions for the next three EOL gasoline products;

1. 2nd month NYMEX UNL
2. MTBE front month swap, U S Gulf fixed price.
3. Cal 02 UNL gasoline crack spread (this one probably requires VAR increase)
4. WTI swaps that match the timing of our gasoline and HO cracks. This gives 
customers the option to convert crack spread positions to fixed price 
gasoline and HO swaps through EOL.

Regarding long dated gasoline positions we are long 75 kb per month cal 02 
gulf coast gas cracks which probably won't move much in value until 
march/April 01. I view this position as very low risk and good profit 
potential but this position does tie up VAR. If marketing can sell at $3.80 
or better happy to get out of this for now. This is the only long dated 
position in my book.

Thanks.  This is helpful.  I like all the products you've mentioned below, 
except for the MTBE one.  Is there a real market need for this?  Please 
proceed and get the others on EOL asap.  Also please pass the trade idea you

John, you guys have to be under Var tonight before we leave for the evening.  
That means buying on access if necessary.  

I don't know why I got a new P&L DPR at 2:30 today showing a change in P&L 
and a big VAR violation--most likely due to shroeder's getting shorter 2186 
contracts of crude and Botchlett's getting shorter 2141 heat contracts.  
Don's Var went up 2.8 million to 9.7 million, and Dave's Var went down only 
687 thousand to 3.1 million.  Where is Dave's var coming from?

We need to be under our Var tonight.  Dave and Don--please take care of 
this.

Chris Mahoney
10/23/2000 11:43 AM
we ran out of time in the meeting....my thoughts fwiw

short-term this market is going to continue to be sideways and choppy.  
weather fundamentals don't exist and nothing else will be fundamentally
bullish or bearish enough to lead the market for the next several weeks.

 Most people (including the majority of our shop) are getting bearish on the 
back of the builds we should have based upon iea supply/demand predictions.  
One concern here is that they have materialized yet over q3.  If we look at 
the poor reaction to bullish news last week
(api stats/unrest in the middle east) I think it is safe to say that the 
sentiment in the market has turned bearish.  
In general I want to go with the majority of the mkt but the rally that 
resulted when the violence erupted in the middle east two weeks ago shows
the surprises will still be on the upside.   the way that we gave back all 
that ground reflects how little confidence there is in the mkt at the moment
that these fundamentals last too much longer.  How many reports have you read 
lately about borrowed heating oil demand?  my back of the
evelope calculations suggest that although this is somewhat true it only true 
for 150kbd in the winter vs an underlying demand of 4000kbd so
maybe not such a big disappointment to come.

we still like being bullish distillate in europe for the winter but think 
that the mkt will be range bound on spreads and vs the complex until the need
for winter coats comes along.

First--Ted your voicemail isn't working.

I would like to get active in recruiting products traders, in a real attempt 
to high grade the group.  Can we, and how do we make a full court press with 
the headhunters out there?  Also, what do you guys think of putting a big ad 
in the Chronicle, and the WSJ?  We could also look for originators and 
marketers.  

Thanks.  Jeff

fyi,

Hats off to Larry Gagliardi and the Unleaded desk. They have done another 
large crack-spread, this time for 100,000 barrels per month for calendar 
2001. This trade notionally values out at over $40 million and is the second 
largest transaction conducted to date on EOL.

Hi Andy, 

I would like access to the ICEX--1 terminal per office.  (Houston, London, 
Singapore).  Please coordinate with John Nowlan, Chris Mahoney, and John 
Chismar respectively.  Thanks very much.

We are pleased to confirm today's launch of the following products via EOL:

Ethylene Contract (NW Europe)
Propylene Contract (NW Europe)
HD Polyethylene (German Film)
Polypropylene (German Inj)
Polystyrene (German General Purpose)

In a 2nd roll-out (timing TBC) we are looking to add:

PVC (German Pipe)
LD Polyethylene (German Film)
LLD Polyethylene (German C4)

We are initially offering 6 month and 12 month swaps for each product.

SUMMATION OF EUROPEAN MKT

- market is very conservative and tunnel-visioned, with derivatives as very 
new concept to all players (case of tail trying to wag the dog)

- even though no OTC trades have been done we are looking for the launch to 
act as a magnet for potential counterparties to at least start looking at our 
numbers on a regular basis (personalised letters + PR in industry mags is 
underway).

- Shell / BP are talking of launching similar platform 2001, but Enron only 
company aggressively marketing in Europe (look at 
http://www.eyeforchemicals.com/chem/presentations/hurley.pdf for Shell 
perspective).

- Enron brand is not known to converters/consumers  - profile awareness / 
promotion is continuous process.

- 6mo and 12mo prices are offered, as shorter term we are exposed due to the 
fact we are not in physical mkt.

- spreads are reasonably aggressive, but for hedging purposes all products 
show close correlation to each other and US equivalents.

regards
Rob Brewis

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 41/2000

Highlight
The freight market keeps inching upwards, with a consensus that the freight 
market will have some upward momentum until early next year, when it is 
expected that the steel makers will significantly reduce their raw material 
imports and reduce their freight requirements.  We are still trying to 
conclude our two structured deals with Coeclerici, but have run into problems 
as counterpart is not keen on agreeing our credit terms.  We are meeting with 
Coeclerici during Coaltrans to try and sort out a compromise and will also 
try to get our credit department to be more flexible with our terms as we 
need to adapt our terms to the shipping industry or face the possibility that 
no one will want to transact on our strict terms.  

This week the liquids group launched their tanker route on EOL and asked Andy 
( our EOL freight trader ) to manage it full time.  Within the first two 
days, 400,000 tons had been traded.

We have tendered for a contract covering two years to ship iron ore from 
Basil to Saudi Arabia starting in Jan next year for the account of Hadeed.  
If we were to win the contract, it would fit very well with our short 
position out of Richards Bay as it would allow us to fix a vessel on time 
charter from Europe to Brasil, then go to Saudi arabia to discharge and then 
continue onto Richards bay to load coal.  The net result of having the hadeed 
contract would be to save 15 days ballast sailing which in terms of dollars 
would equate to $250.000 saving per trip 

Market
	Short term	Medium term	Long Term
Handy Max	Up	Flat	Flat
Panamax	Up	Down	Down
Cape Size	Up	Up	Flat

Deals Done
Physical Freight
ECS freight 
Fixed a panamax for early November loading from Puerto bolivar to Immingham

Third parties freight deals
Fixed a cape for late november loading out of RBCT to Rotterdam at $11.17 for 
Preag.

OTC 
FFA s
Bought a Us gulf/Japan contract for November from Conagra and a 4 TC contract 
from Andre for Q4 & Q1 01.  Our view is that the panamax market will rise in 
the short term and we are therefore going long with the intention of selling 
our lenght in a couple weeks and then build a significant panamax short 
position for next year when we expect a massive correction.

In addition to this business below there is a very good chance that we are 
going to get a short of 1.4 mil bbls per year
of low sulfur fuel oil barges for 2001-2004.  We think this will be a good 
deal for us to get on the books since the bulk of the
hedging interest that the continental gas desk is bringing to us is customers 
looking to buy fuel to hedge natural gas prices. 
Continental gas are anxious to close this deal because the gas contract is 
well in the money and would like to book this
deal for this quarter.  There are var issues that need to be considered 
though so we need to address this at the beginning
of the week.

Thanks

Chris.

corporate finance in London (primarily Chris Harris) has been looking for 
about 6 months into approaching the small north sea 
producers to do pre-pay purchase contracts that would enable the producers to 
significantly reduce their tax liability to the uk 
government.  These producers (talisman, kerr mcgee, lasmo, hess, enterprise, 
and a couple of others) are
currently paying some 65-70% of the value of crude oil back to the government 
and they feel the cost savings to the producers is 
something on the line of 25% after financing costs for the pre-pay.  I have 
asked them to do a presentation to you, as if you were one
of the producers, for how this structure would work.  Can you advise when you 
would be free for this?  The volumes could be large
(potentially upto 25 million bbls) and there is considerable basis risk in 
hedging these physical volumes.  we are looking into the
price that we could bid them for their physical oil that covers the basis 
risk.  It would be nice to try to combine this with some long-
term gas supply contract on the continent that would require us to be buying 
fuel and gasoil as the hedge and we are approaching
some of the large natural gas buyers in continental europe to see if the 
recent spike in oil prices has encouraged more hedging.
please let me know your thoughts on this and when/if you could be free for a 
presentation from chris harris.  

thanks,

chris.     

thanks.  I was wondering....

Jeff,

The LNG group currently has 4 development engineers where their reporting was 
previously into Haug.  I was wondering if within EGM, we had any other 
engineers that we could group these resources with in terms of reporting.  

If not, I would suggest that we make the most senior one group lead (Dave 
Glessner) and have them report directly to you or Mike.  Although these guys 
are currently focused on LNG activities, I know from experience with a couple 
of them they also have generalists capabilities.  In Europe, Brian Stanley 
leads this develop engineering effort where he represents the owner (Enron 
Europe).  He has dual reporting into Sherriff and Larry Reynolds (one of 
Izzo's guys).  

If you could come back to me on this quickly it would be very helpful as this 
is the last thing we need to finalise in our group structure.

Thanks
Eric
Changes in Enron's business require us to reevaluate how we approach the 
engineering and construction function within Enron.  Specifically,  Enron 
Energy Services' (EES) business has grown dramatically and that requires 
considerable additional engineering and construction resources both to 
develop solutions for customers and to deliver those solutions to customers.  
Additionally, in light of Enron's continued emphasis on increasing our return 
on invested capital, we have been engaged in fewer large scale construction 
projects around the world.  Historically, these projects have been a primary 
focus of EECC's activities.  Consequently we are making the following 
organizational changes concerning EECC:

EECC's pipeline construction group, led by Jerry Martin, will become part of 
Enron Transportation Services.  
NEPCO will continue to operate as a stand alone entity focused on power plant 
construction services to Enron entities and third parties.
The remainder of EECC will become part of EES.  Larry Izzo will report to the 
EES Office of the Chairman.
 
 These changes will better align our intellectual capital with the growth 
opportunities within Enron and provide new and exciting opportunities for our 
employees.  Please join us in supporting and implementing these changes.

The Asian Pulp & Paper debt situation is once again becoming critical to 
Asian growth prospects.  AP & P is the most popular Asian bond holding among 
foreign investors.  AP & P narrowly met a Feb.1 deadline for a debt payment 
and has a 30 day grace period on another which runs out at the end of 
February.  Depressed pulp and paper prices and a high risk premium for 
Indonesian debt raise serious doubts about AP & P's ability to meet this 
payment.

The ripple effect of an AP &P default or government-imposed restructuring 
would be significant for Asian credit and equity markets, with possible 
contagion effects for other emerging markets.  We will continue to update 
this issue in the days ahead.

Notes for this Week's Report:

* The average daily number of Enron Metals trades done via EOL has risen 
eleven-fold since September, from a daily average of 11 to an average-to-date 
for October of 121 trades per day. This upward trend has also been increasing 
significantly as Enron Metals has averaged better nearly 212 transactions per 
day on EOL for the last three trading days (16th, 17th and 18th of October).

* Average daily volumes for Austrian Power have dropped off considerably 
since September due to the inclusion last month of several very large OTC 
physical transactions, including a forward done with Slovenske Elektrarne 
A.S. which alone accounted for over 1,890,000 MWH.

* The average daily deal count and volumes for Swiss Power have returned to 
the levels seen prior to August.  Both the months of August and September 
included several very large OTC physical transactions which have not been 
seen so far this month.

* Average daily volumes for ENA - Canada East Gas have increased considerably 
since September due to the inclusion of a few very large OTC physical 
transactions, including a forward done with the Westcourt Group, Inc. which 
alone accounted for over 33,167,715 MMBtu's.  At the same time, the average 
daily  deal count has decreased slightly.

* Average daily volumes for Central Gas have decreased considerably since 
September due to the inclusion of a few very large OTC physical transactions, 
including three spot transactions done with the Trailblazer Pipeline Company 
and J. M. Huber Corporation.  Each of the three transactions alone accounted 
for over 140,630,000 MMBtu's.

I know you guys have been working to secure supply for the H. Galleon.  I 
wonder if we should do some sort of tender for fob princing, allowing us 
whatever freedom we want with the ship.  I'm not sure we should kill 
ourselves for a few pennies--I'd even let the ship stay empty and maybe force 
some of our will on the LNG market if possible, in effect creating more of a 
spot market.  Maybe EOL.   Any thoughts?

Looks like they've got good participation from IBs.  The fact that they are 
having it at one of the most expensive places in the city leads me to believe 
that they are putting a lot of effort into strong attendance and putting 
together a good conference.  Of course that is also why sponsorship is so 
expensive.  Do you want me to take care of signing us up?  Jeff, any ideas

Hi Michele

thanks for getting back to me with regards to the finance conference.
I am in the process of collecting the committed speaker list. Just
wanted to give you a flavor for kind of people that we are targeting.

The major committed sponsors so far are some of the top investment banks
(Chase, Merrill
Goldman, MSDW) and we are lining up the either heads of investment banking,
asset management or some well know research analysts from these firms to
adress the panelists and the conference attendees.

I will have specific names for you in a couple of days are we are still in
the
process of confirming speakers.

The conference will be at the Park Hyatt in Center City along with the
Bullish
on Finance reception the previous day.

This conference will be a good platform for Enron to talk about its unique
position in trading and can utilize the Sales and Trading panel to expose
the
students and the conference attendees to Enrons capabilities and the firm in
general.

I will provide you with more information in the coming days and I sincerely
hope
you will choose to sponsor one of the panels and have a strong presence at
the finance conference this year.

Mark, Thor, and Todd,

Thanks for the video conference this morning.  Mike and I are convinced 
weather can and will be an extremely profitable business.  One issue I would 
like to address is EnergyDesk.com.  It seems like an interesting idea, but 
I'd like to find out more about it, and in relation to the work Tom Gros in 
doing in NetWorks.  I'd also like to understand more about the scalability of 
this model, and our relationship with Kiodex.  

To that end, I do not want any proprietary data, product interface, and or 
other weather related matter and material to be part of EnergyDesk.com.  I 
will keep you updated as I learn more about these and other issues.  

Regards

Jeff

Hi John, hope things are well...Hickerson and I were talking yesterday about 
the convert bond desk, and he mentioned to me that it make sense for it to 
come to his group.  I understand you have had prelim discussions about this, 
and wanted to catch up with you on this matter.  I'll give you a ring by 
week's end if we want to proceed.  My initial reaction is that it probably 
makes sense....

Jeff

fine

Will do.  With regard to storage, we will proceed on the assumption that you 
will not want to query any period longer than the previous calendar month and 
thus will not store any data that is more than 45 days old.

-Bob

Jeffrey A Shankman
10/18/2000 10:27 AM
proceed with your recommendation.  Also, we do not need to store any data 
once I see report. 

   
	
	

Jeff:

If further conversations with our technical folks, they have a suggestion 
which I believe increases the flexibility of this report and a key question 
which helps determine the resources required to support it.

First the suggestion.  If the report is designed to run with a Start date and 
End date, you will be able to pick the reporting period.  For example a 
particular week, a calendar month, the latest four weeks, etc.  This would be 
in lieu of the more structured (hard coded) format in my e-mail of 
yesterday.  I recommend this option.

Second the question.  How far back in time do you want to query?   60 days?  
90 days?

There is an extensive data capture requirement to prepare this report.  Each 
product will be queried a minimum of 24 times each day to capture the time, 
bid price, bid volume, offer price, offer volume.  All of this data will need 
to be stored for as long as you want to be able to query.   By limiting the 
amount of time the data is kept, we can minimize the amount of data storage 
resources required to support this report.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!

-Bob

John, I need your help again.  Jeff Kinneman's group on level 30 is wanting 
to move to level 14.  There are several problems with this move.

1.  This group utilizes the IPC turrets and the 14th floor is not wired to 
support them.
 a.  The cabling for each station is very costly ($1000 per desk).
 b.  Our Telecom Room does not have enough rack space to handle any more 
cabling for the turrets.
  There is simply not enough closet space for additional 12 pair cabling
 c.  AMP, the vender that makes the 12 pair connectors, are no longer 
manufacturing the connectors needed for the 12 pair cables.
  The vender will be making a special run to make more of them for Enron in 
late December.
  Hopefully, they will make enough to last until June of 2001.

2.  This group also utilizes the Stentofon and Amtel Systems.
 a.  Again this floor is not wired to support these devices.

3.  The Response Time would be affected.
 a.  The Trading Floor Support Team is located on level 31, near the ENA 
trading floors.
  A team of only three supports all Enron's IPC phones, Recording channels, 
Stentofons and Amtels on the Trading Floors.
  Team members would have to use two elevator banks, instead of the stairs 
for one or two floors, before they could be on site for this group.
 b.  We now have three other Trading Floors that we support that are not on 
Levels 30, 31 or 32 and one more would hurt us even more.
  The groups are EBS, EES and Bridgeline.

4.  There is no UPS power for that floor; so their computer systems would be 
susceptible to power outages.

I am not sure what the reason(s) are behind this business unit wanting to 
move to level 14, but I have an alternative plan.  Level 29 has been 
completely cabled out with 12-pair cables for the IPC Tradenet phones and is 
also cabled for Stentofons and Amtels.  This floor has been built out with 
Trading Desk furniture as well.

My suggestion is to have this group relocate to level 29 instead of level 14; 
this will save the company both money and time.  Your help is needed to 
convince Jeff's group to move to level 29 instead of 14.

Any help that you can provide would be appreciated.

Thanks,

in lieu of the more structured (hard coded) format in my e-mail of 
yesterday.  I recommend this option.

Second the question.  How far back in time do you want to query?   60 days?  
90 days?

There is an extensive data capture requirement to prepare this report.  Each 
product will be queried a minimum of 24 times each day to capture the time, 
bid price, bid volume, offer price, offer volume.  All of this data will need 
to be stored for as long as you want to be able to query.   By limiting the 
amount of time the data is kept, we can minimize the amount of data storage 
resources required to support this report.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!

-Bob

some of this number is just due to the ipe gasoil mkt closing before the 
brent.

I will highlight what is coming back in and where the money is lost by doing 
an appx m-t-m where the mkt is at this moment.

ipegasoil  +1.4
physical gasoil      .90
heat      -.20
brent      -.30
dubai     - .50
pnl clawback      +1.3

we have been reducing the risk in the book on a daily basis as you can tell 
from the var changes.  I need to go thru
with the person who does our book in houston how he arrived at last night 
numbers.  the losses on physical gasoil
seem to great to me so hopefully the money coming back in will be greater 
than my above estimate.

We would like to thank you for your time yesterday allowing us to make you
aware of the Buildscape initiative and potential opportunities for Enron,
Dow and Buildscape to partner and develop the web based services for the
residential building industry in NA that would lead to a tremendous market
offering for the users/customers of the web solution as well as the market
access and services that could be made available through this new business
entity.

The potential synergy of the Buildscape market rollout and web based
technology platform with the Enron capabilities and market making
functionality and Dow's position in the Building industry as a major
manufacturer/supplier would be a powerful combination and I would like to
recommend a follow up meeting to discuss the options around strategic
investment interests and alliance after you have had a chance to regroup
after yesterday's meetings. The possibilities exist today for Enron to join
Dow as a major investor/partner in Buildscape.

Rob, you mentioned that you will be visiting the NAHB show this weekend. Dow
and Buildscape are also participating and our VP for Building Products
Business - John Schaw who was on the original conference call will be there
as well and we would like to arrange a meeting between John and yourself. I
will ask his assistant Marcy Putt to try to contact you and see whether a
meeting can be setup possibly for Saturday.

Jeff,  James Mason and I were also pleased to meet with you to discuss
global market opportunities on a broader sense between Enron and Dow and we
will follow with a meeting between yourself and Pedro Reinhard( CFO) in
Midland at the earliest convenience.

I have attached the Buildscape presentation from yesterday for your review
and follow up to complement the documents previously sent.

What do we need to do to be involved.  Kristin, can you call Tom Piazze and 
ask him what he thinks

Looks like they've got good participation from IBs.  The fact that they are 
having it at one of the most expensive places in the city leads me to believe 
that they are putting a lot of effort into strong attendance and putting 
together a good conference.  Of course that is also why sponsorship is so 
expensive.  Do you want me to take care of signing us up?  Jeff, any ideas 
for panelists?

Hi Michele

thanks for getting back to me with regards to the finance conference.
I am in the process of collecting the committed speaker list. Just
wanted to give you a flavor for kind of people that we are targeting.

The major committed sponsors so far are some of the top investment banks
(Chase, Merrill
Goldman, MSDW) and we are lining up the either heads of investment banking,
asset management or some well know research analysts from these firms to
adress the panelists and the conference attendees.

I will have specific names for you in a couple of days are we are still in
the
process of confirming speakers.

The conference will be at the Park Hyatt in Center City along with the
Bullish
on Finance reception the previous day.

This conference will be a good platform for Enron to talk about its unique
position in trading and can utilize the Sales and Trading panel to expose
the
students and the conference attendees to Enrons capabilities and the firm in
general.

I will provide you with more information in the coming days and I sincerely
hope
you will choose to sponsor one of the panels and have a strong presence at
the finance conference this year.

No problem.  Doug is a good guy that I want to put under contract.  What's 
the status with his immigration?  Could we be in a scenario that he has to 
work our of canada for a while?

Jeff,

Jane Allen and I met with Doug today to discuss the green card procedure for 
he and his wife.  We will start this process immediately, but it's a long 
road - approx 2.5 years.

Doug asked if we would be willing to cover immigration attorney fees for his 
wife should she find an employer willing to file for a work permit, but is 
unable to pay legal fees of  $2-3,000.  It is fairly common that Enron would 
cover legal fees for the spouse in this situation, but I will need your ok.

I agree.  We do not need anyone speaking at this. 

Jeffrey Keeler@ENRON
10/17/2000 02:03 PM
I received the message below from you, forwarded from Steve Kean severral 
weeks ago asking if we wanted to send anyone to speak at this conference, 
which John Palmisano previously spoke at.

They have suggested that Jeff speak on the topic of "Joint Implementation 
(JI) and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) as a business opportunity."   
While Palmisano was focused on these issues in the past, it seems to me that 
the current Enron strategy does not really include pursuing "business 
opportunities" related to these mechanisms, as they involve investment of 
capital in power projects in developing countries.  I don't think it would be 
a good fit for us at all right now.

While emissions traders in EGM are looking at the Kyoto process and the 
potential for global carbon trading, we are still a long way from there being 
any viable trading market whatsoever.  EES is interested in following the JI 
and CDM issues for potential opportunities related to energy efficiency.   
Our role has been to participate in the process and monitor the development 
of these issues and see if there are effects on our markets or 
opportunities.   I may have someone attend or may see if someone in Mark 
Schroeder's group in London can attend, but I would not recommend our 
speaking at this time.  

Please let me know if you have any questions,

Jeff Keeler

What's the story here? 
	
	

John:
 I want to bring a matter to your attention. Last week I went to see Canadian 
Steamship Lines. Prior to my visit I asked Vikas, the middle marketing 
associate, to contact Singapore and get quarterly offers for IFO 180. Vikas 
emailed Hans Wong three times.  He also called twice. I also asked  Sarah 
Mulholland to call Singapore on Friday prior to start of my meeting. She 
could not reach Hans either in the office or on his cell phone. We finally 
received some numbers Monday morning, obviously too late for our client 
meeting.

I understand that you have been working very hard to increase responsiveness 
and market development for crude and products.  With this in mind, I  believe 
have a partial solution  that will prove beneficial to all. On the EGM 
fundamentals page I intend to include a section where the mids of all 
products will be posted based on the day's close. I think this would help 
everyone stay on top of the various markets and products around the world.

Thanks for your attention to this matter.

Jen

As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best alligned as this business exists 
today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:  all employees in the 
weather business will now become full time employees of EGM and report to 
Mark Tawney.  We need 100% full time dedication from each of these employees 
in the weather business.  It is obvious that the organizations and product 
lines can lever each other and the synergies will provide powerful results in 
our regional gas and power businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.  

here's a good one.

Guys - We need representation at a senior level from your groups.  Please get 
your Directors and VP's to "volunteer" to help the AA Program out with 
interviewers.  For example, the November 4 Super Saturday has only 13 Manager 
and above level interviewers and there are 38 candidates from UT alone.  
These candidates will become our next crop of AA's.  We control that with the 
Super Saturday process.  Be represented - have your people sign up now 
on-line (see below).  Thanks.  Ted

Thanks for your support!

Thanks for the note.   We are still looking at the value chain, but think we 
may have an idea.  I think Mike and I learned a lot from you guys when we 
were in London.  Nobody thinks our speculating in the grain markets does much 
for us, and is probably the wrong way to run that group.  Interestingly, the 
cargill CEO hasn't met with us yet.  We have been trading softs, but very 
small.  Next time Gary Hickerson is in London, which should be soon, I'll 
have him give you guys the story, and ask for more of your input.

I will schedule you for Nov. 11th.  If you are around on Dec. 9th we will use 
you but I will also make sure we have someone else.  We don't generally do a 
spring Super Saturday.  We ask the teams to bring back their best two or 
three candidates and then we get together informally to decide.  I will let 
you know when that begins to take place.  I would like to get a small group 
of commercial people for that process as we did with the summer offer 
process.    It generally takes place in February and March.
I will keep you informed.
Thanks Charlene

Nov 11 is great, and I'll try to help out Dec 9.  (I'll be out of town Nov 
4).  I'd also be happy to look now at the spring schedule.

Jeff thanks alot.  I really appreciate it.  Here are the schedule of schools:

November4th (Analysts)
Rice, UT, Baylor, Texas A&M, OU, Florida, LSU and Univ. of Houston

November 11th (Associates)
Columbia, NYU Stern, UCLA, UVA (Darden), Cornell and Vanderbilt

December 9th 
Wellesley, overflow and re-schedules from previous Super Saturdays

If you don't have a preference. I would prefer that you do either November 
4th or 11th.  I think that would be most beneficial.  You are certainly 
welcome to do both but I didn't want to push my luck (smile). Please let me 
know as soon as possible so that I can get someone else for the ones you 
can't attend.

Again, thanks alot.

Jeff,
To ensure that the business units are involved in the recruiting of top 
quality candidates I am requesting your assistance in the Super Saturday that 
is scheduled for either Saturday, November 4th, November 11th or December 
9th.  We would like for you to participate as follows:

Be the speaker at breakfast
Interview candidates 
Facilitate the decision making meeting

The breakfast is from 7:30 AM until 8:30 AM.  The speech would begin at 
approximately 8:00 AM and need not be more than 15 to 20 minutes.  You would 
interview approximately 4-6 candidates.  A vital part of the process is 
determining which candidates will receive offers to join the Program.  We 
would like for you to facilitate the decision making meeting.  The meeting 
will be held in 5C2 beginning at 1:30 PM. and conclude by 3:30 PM.  We will 
provide the administrative assistance.
Your assistance and input would be greatly appreciated.  Please let me know 
as soon as possible of your availability.
Thanks in advance.

By the way thanks for the help you have provided with Penn at both the 
graduate and undergraduate level.  It is very much appreciated.

I'll get on it.  With the Texaco Chevron merger, I'd like to get some insight 
into their organizations.  Particularly Texaco, since they have two trading 
offices, one in Whit Plains, the other here.  This set up for them has never 
worked well, and I'd like to talk to some of the better Texaco traders, if 
there are any.  Jeff

*********************************************************

The nervousness driving the gas market that had settled just below the=20
surface during
the relative calm of late September and early October reemerged in force la=
st=20
week.
From mid-September through early October it appeared that a lucky combinati=
on=20
of
mild weather, storage injections above 10 billion cubic feet (Bcf) per day,=
=20
and a lack
of storms in producing areas of the Gulf of Mexico had calmed the market
somewhat. Henry Hub prices settled near $5.00 in the cash market, less than=

Henry Hub prices up by more than $0.50 in two days, to above $5.60.

Mild weather may still soften prices from current levels, but CERA does not=

expect
the relative calm of late September and early October to return to the gas=

market.
Turmoil in the oil market has raised the floor for gas prices, as nearly 1.=

Time is running out before the heating season begins, and the market remain=

mid-$5.00s, averaging $5.50 at the Henry Hub during November (see Table 1).=
=20
More
luck--a great deal more--would be required to restore a measure of calm to=
=20
the gas
market.

Gas Storage--The Final Push
October storage injections have varied historically from 4.0 Bcf to=20
approximately 8.5
Bcf per day in the United States, and this year CERA expects them to averag=
e=20
5.5
Bcf per day, a moderate level for the month (see Table 2). The reporting of=
=20
injections
of 62 Bcf during the week ending October 6 precipitated a $0.37 increase in=
=20
futures
prices, but this rate is actually above average for the first full week of=
=20
October. With
the beginning of consistent heating load late this month CERA expects a=20
slowing of
injections, resulting in an end-of-October inventory of 2,707 Bcf--more tha=
n=20
100
Bcf below the previous record low for the end of October.

CERA expects that many storage holders--having begun the winter with record=
=20
low
inventories--will preserve inventories to the extent possible during Novemb=
er.
However, normal weather this year would drive a substantial rebound in=20
heating load
from last year=01,s level and would require added storage withdrawals, whic=
h CERA
estimates will average 5.0 Bcf per day this year. Withdrawals at that pace,=
=20
or even
substantially slower (as occurred during 1998 and 1999), will keep=20
inventories on a
trajectory to hit record lows by the end of March. Low storage inventories=
=20
will
remain a major source of price support, requiring that demand continue to b=
e=20
priced
out of the gas market, and keeping gas prices above those of residual fuel=
=20
oil.
Regional Markets-Winter Rules

The transition to winter pricing relationships is under way, and the start =
of=20
winter
heating demand in the West has narrowed differentials between the supply-ri=
ch
Rocky Mountains and the Henry Hub. Local demand for Rockies supply has also
eased pressure on San Juan Basin prices, and CERA expects differentials=20
between
both regions and the Henry Hub to continue to narrow through November. In t=
he
Northeast differentials will begin to widen with the onset of winter, with =
the
magnitude of the differentials depending on early winter weather. The onset=
=20
of flows
on Alliance will limit increases in the Chicago differential during Novembe=
r=20
(see
Table 3).

CERA=01,=01,s outlook by region follows:

* Rockies. Early-season cold has narrowed Rockies to Henry
Hub differentials so far this month. Ample supplies within the
Rockies will mean volatile pricing relationships through the
end of October and early November depending on heating load,
but in general strong regional demand will keep differentials
well below the ($1.00) per MMBtu summer level. CERA
expects a ($0.45) per MMBtu differential to the Henry Hub
during November.

* San Juan. The increase in local heating demand in the Rockies
will continue to ease pressure on San Juan prices by limiting
flows south out of the Rockies. San Juan differentials should
follow the same relationships as Rockies prices, with general
narrowing but continued volatility through November. CERA
expects an average San Juan differential of ($0.38) per MMBtu
for November.

* Permian and Mid-Continent. Tight relationships between the
Permian Basin and Mid-Continent and the Henry Hub should
continue through November, with some slight widening in the
Mid-Continent basis differential expected when Alliance flows
commence. CERA expects differentials of ($0.11) per MMBtu
and ($0.08) per MMBtu, respectively.

* Chicago. The beginning of service via the Alliance Pipeline
during November is the focus of most attention in the Chicago
citygate market. However, the demand rebound that would
result from normal November weather this year would offset
most of the added supplies. As a result, Chicago differentials
will average in the $0.08-$0.20 per MMBtu range even when
Alliance flows commence, although delay of the Vector
Pipeline will keep much of the new gas in the Midwest. CERA
expects average November Chicago differentials of $0.13 per
MMBtu.

* Northeast markets. Normal weather would drive a substantial
rebound in New York citygate prices from year-earlier levels,
but there is little added delivery capacity into that market.
CERA expects New York to price $0.66 above the Henry Hub
during November, well above the current low o mid-$0.30s.

Canadian Markets--Supply Growth Still Uncertain
The supply build is uncertain at this time because flows on Alliance are=20
uncertain. A
line pack of between 5 and 6 Bcf has been established, and modest flows of=
=20
200-300
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day have been initiated to test and commissio=
n=20
the
pipeline. The start-up is still slated for November 1, but the unknown=20
quantities of
gas that are flowing on a day-to-day basis are making it difficult to asses=
s=20
precisely
the volume of supply being produced. At this time, it appears that October =
is=20
on par
with 1999. The current expectation is for over 15,500 well completions in=
=20
2000,
approximately 8,500 of which are expected to be gas wells. Even if the=20
shallow trend
does not change substantially, the sheer number of wells is still expected =
to=20
produce
a supply build by year-end and into 2001. For 2000, the total western suppl=
y=20
build is
expected to be flat with 1999 to slightly negative, increasing to positive=
=20
growth of
350 MMcf per day in 2001.

Demand Slow but Exports Up
TransCanada flows are still down, averaging about 350 MMcf per day less in
October than the year-earlier levels. Storage injections in the East have=
=20
accelerated;
eastern inventories are expected to be above last year=01,s levels at the e=
nd of=20
October.
Storage injections in the West, however, have dwindled, revising the expect=
ed
storage inventories to be even with the five-year average but below 1999=20
levels.
PG&E GT-NW volumes have declined in October and are expected to be slightly
below 1999 levels by 50-100 MMcf per day in November as well. Northern Bord=
er
Pipeline is running about 50 MMcf per day above October 1999 but is expecte=
d=20
to be
slightly below 1999 levels in November. Cooler-than-normal weather has push=
ed
western Canadian demand up slightly but does not offset the lower eastern=
=20
Canadian
demand.

High Prices, Wide Differentials
The AECO-Henry differential has leveled off in the upper US$0.50s to low
US$0.60s and is expected to remain in that range through the balance of=20
October.
For November the differential is expected to average US$0.50, for a resulti=
ng=20
AECO
average of C$6.97 per gigajoule (US$5.00 per MMBtu).

As you know, we are preparing a new LNG brochure that will be rolled out at 
the Gastech Conference in Houston mid November.  Many of you have submitted 
comments that are hopefullyincluded herein.  Attached is the latest draft of 
the brochure text.  Please review this very carefully and submit your 
comments to Henry Means/Zdenek Gerych by Tuesday noon.  

I have scanned this and have noted at least several typos and some 
numerical/statistical errors.  AG, please check in particular the DPC/Metgas 
stuff.

Henry/Z, the purpose of this brochure is to communicate that the market is 
changing and that Enron is leading the transformation of this industry.  
However, there is a negative tone in parts of this that is a slap in the face 
to the major oil companies and the government companies particularly in the 
Mid east and Far East.  I want to get all negatives out---anything that a 
supplier could read as an insult will come back to bite us.  The message 
should be bold but positive, with no implied insults.

I look forward to reading the next draft Tuesday evening

Attached is the draft as promised. This reflects input from several members 
of the team. It is easy to read and flows well. Please review and share you 
feedback by Wed before noon ( no later, sorry). Once complete, we will 
circulate the final with your comments. I do need the name of the lawyer that 
would approve the final draft for the LNG team. 

Hope you had a good trip back.

There ae meetings scheduled in Singapore starting early next week to disclose 
key information to potential buyers of Metgas, including BP and presumably 
other competitors.  Disclosures will include the terms of the Metgas Malaysia 
Sales contract and will quickly get into our concept for EGM to sign a master 
supply agreement with Metgas.

Have you talked with Baxter/Sanjay about this?  I still believe that selldown 
of Metgas is a mistake that will cost Enron dearly down the road.

I am getting increasingly concerned about the MetGas equity sale and the pace 
at which it is proceeding.  We discussed this last week and I thought the 
consensus was to slow this process down and exclude partners who could impede 
our strategic global LNG interests -- for example Petronas and BP Amoco.   I 
now understand that we are making presentatations on the equity sale to 
potential investors next week in Singapore (BP, Petronas, CEPA, Mitsubishi, 
etc).   

I don't like the notion that we must disclose our TIGA to SPA to potential 
investors.  There are several aspects of that SPA which gives us strategic 
advantage over other competitors - for example the diversion clause of 0.5 
MMTA.  I like even less the thought that one of our partners will see the 
Master Supply Agreement (MSA) to MetGas.  Once a competitor sees the MSA they 
will have some insight on how to undermine our supply aggregation efforts and 
how Enron manages its Global LNG risk book.  This is a serious concern and we 
must ensure that it doesn't happen -- first by exclusion and then by 
negotiation (i.e. in the shareholders agreement we don't give investors with 
less than 10% equity the right to see contracts -- by the way Petronas does 
this routinely with its partners in MLNG TIGA).

Your thoughts??

This is a matter of principle. Sheila was an analyst in our group this past 
summer. She clearly outperformed her peers. I  have attempted to have her 
brought onto the AA radar screensince last May .  Several of my atttempts to 
have her involved in the summer program were rebuffed. I think she should get 
an offer on principle, since we extend them to all high-performing summer 
analysts. Fred also agrees with me that she was a great asset. Dan Diamond 
and the rest of the EOL people would also concur.  I have no doubt she will 
sail through Super Saturday.

There are my thoughts on the matter.  I am happy to go along with your 
suggestions. However, for the record, I think the AA program has long way to 
go in its responsiveness and its ability to think outside the box.

JF

I'd like to have a few people meet her, but am confident in Jennifer's 
ability to evaluate analysts.

Jeff

   
	
	

Jeff,
Please see the notes below regarding Sheila Chang who was a summer intern 
brought in from the Rice Leadership Program.  Interns that came in through 
this Rice program did not go through the normal campus interviews by the A/A 
Program.  The A/A Program would recommend that Sheila go through a round of 
Super Saturday interviews just like all other Analyst off-cycle candidates.  
This would allow other top Enron people to review Sheila and evaluate her 
skill level.  

With that said, I believe that Jennifer thinks highly of this individual and 
the A/A Program could forgo the interviews it you agree to take Sheila in 
your group for the first rotation.  Please confirm that you would like Sheila 
to be made an offer from the A/A Program and that you will accept her in one 
of the EGM groups upon graduation.  Thanks so much and if you have any 
questions, please let me know.  

Shelly and Shelly:
I believe that Sheila should receive an offer now. She was one of the most 
exceptional summer analysts. Based on this, I think she should get an offer 
just any other top intern would have received one.
Thanks
Jen

   
	
	

Shelly,

Below is the information on Sheila as was described in my email this 
morning.  I understand she will have to go through the Super Saturday process 
just as any other Analyst would.  Will you please advise Jennifer on the 
process and when Sheila will be participating?  Thanks so much for assisting 
Jennifer in this effort.

Jennifer,

Shelly Jones is the Recruiting Manager for the Analyst Program and is 
managing the current Super Saturday process.  She can provide more 
information on hiring processes.

Thank you,
Shelly
	
	

Shelly:
 Per our conversation this morning, I have attached Sheila Chang's resume. 
Sheila was a summer analysts in the Middle Marketing group. She was part of 
the Rice Leadership Program. I have served as Sheila's mentor in this 
program, which seeks to provide business internships for non-business majors. 
I believe that programs such as this and their candidates are essential to 
Enron as they provide a pool of academically diverse, bright individuals who 
can think outside the box.

Sheila managed our EnronOnline Top 200 Natural Gas Users Project. She was 
instrumental in ensuring the success of this project. By the time Sheila 
left, we had signed up over 70% of the top US industrial natural gas 
consumers. Sheila is an exceptionally quick study, as evidenced by her rapid 
grasp of key derivative concepts and structures. Every week Sheila priced the 
swaps and options for our customer newsletters. She also priced and helped 
develop several customized structures for our clients. Finally, Sheila 
demonstrated and exceptional work ethic that combined with all her other 
attributes places her among the top summer analysts at Enron. I believe 
Sheila should receive a full-time job offer from the program. She graduates 
in May 2001. I am also prepared to offer Sheila a rotation in my group in 
Global Markets upon her graduation.

If you need any further information, please let me know.

Thank you for your assistance with this matter.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 40/2000

Highlight
Relatively quiet week with Panamax rates drifting until Friday when rates 
seemed to stabilise.  In the cape market, rates continue to increase across 
the board with a rush of new cargoes being quoted in the market ( EDF trading 
leading the pack ).  Glencore and Anglo came into the market this week 
looking for 1 year freight rates into the UK for the BE tender with more 
mines expected to look for rates next week.  We had another visit from 
Bocimar this week as they wanted to meet the guys from MG to discuss hedging 
some of their freight exposure with aluminium which has a 75% correlation 
with the cape freight market.  Furthermore, they wanted to start trading coal 
in ARA and tanker freight which should be going live next week on EOL .

On the ABC front, we are hearing that they are in negotiations with Zodiac, 
another cape owner, but do not know the time frame of any potential deal.  We 
had this week a call from Coeclerici asking us if we were interested in 
joining forces in buying ABC so this makes a total of 4 companies having 
approached us asking to team up and as a result, we plan on exploring the

Hi Ben,

No problem if you want to invoice me.  I'm not ready for you to ship the 
goods to me, though, and probably won't be for a few weeks, as I move into 
the new digs.  Still thinking about the lamp and desk.....

Best,

Jeff

the dragonfly table (I already sold the other one), the pair of Guimard
pots, and the Robalbhen ceramic apple.  Also on the list:
1. Galle "saggitaire" tri-cornered table, which has been sold (blame my dad)
2. the Tiffany lotus bell lamp, which was 59,000 and we told you 52.
3. The very tall Rozenburg iris vase, which was 14,000 and we told you 12.
4. The Rozenburg with 2 butterflies that looks like Gustav Klimt, $6,500 to
$5,750.
5. The Mougin ceramic of 3 mice and a bug, 1,950-1,700
6. The Galle desk that has waited for you 95-79 and that's a lot of love.

what do you think?
love to catch up tomorrow.  What did I buy from you in this most recent
batch?  (I remember the table and the guillmard pots).....

Jeff

Dear Jeff:

Hello! I wanted to make a bill for you for  the table and ceramic pieces,
is that ok?

Can you be in Washington on October 28?   There's a great day-long
symposium in conjunction with the Art Nouveau show  (which I saw on Friday,
and which is, incidentally, much bigger and better than  the one in London
was) which I'm going to, and I would love to be able to tour  around the
show with you. Also, Macklowe Gallery is having a cocktail  party that
night for our clients, friends, experts, and assorted fabulous  hangers-on.
You'll get an invite in the mail, but I wanted to give  you advance notice
since I know how hectic your schedule is.

I hope it was an easy and meaningful fast for you,  and that this year
brings you happiness beyond your wildest  imagination.
Tell me what's up
love.
ben

congrats on the upcoming 10th....we have ours in december....still trying to 
figure out what we're going to do....

how are things in networks ? i understand from greg w. thats where you 
are.....

I know we've made good progress with respect to morning reports for EGM.  
However, I continue to receive most reports after 9:00 a.m., which is too 
late into the trading day.  Please let me know if there are resources you 
need, so this aspect of EGM can run as smoothly as ENA gas.  

Thanks.

Jeff

 Give me a C
    Give me an N
 Give me an R
 Give me an S

What do you have?  A Quarter!

Did you have any doubt that the best logistics school is  Wharton?  (I think 
they call it transportation sciences, no really).  I'll call up there this 
morn and get back with you....

Daniel Reck
10/12/2000 06:56 PM
I spoke with Geoff Pollock (Stacey Rosen's cousin) who is the logistics mgr 
at Frigidaire.  He's helping me identify candidates for the transportation 
group.  He said that the best Logistics school is Wharton.  Can you help me 
get into their placement office.  Do they have alumni job boards?

Thanks,

Dan

yes, send me his resume,etc

Brad Hitch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 10/12/2000 04:41:54 PM
Jeff,

I know a bright, hard working analyst that would like to start on a trading 
career path.  Are you interested in bringing in guys like this to EGM, and to 
whom should I direct him if so?

Thanks,
Brad

Jeff, 
My brother had this guy call him and he forwarded his resume.  Do you know 
him?  Any interest?
If you do, please forward on.
Thanks,
mike
Mike attached is Mark Evans' resume.  He worked at Duke and I believe he 
managed their NE gas book.

No special consideration needed.  I just promised him that I would get it to 
someone in your group.

Thanks,

Fine.  Coordinate with Jennifer

   
	
	

Jeff,
With this note, I am assuming that you would like to have Sheila go through 
the scheduled Super Saturday for Rice on November 3rd-4th.  This will allow 
several people to meet with her through interviews and she will also be able 
to participate in the Friday night dinner with other Enron Executives.  I 
agree that this is the best solution for Sheila.  If you have any additional 
questions, please let me know.  Thanks so much.

Shelly Jones,
I understand from Shelly Butler that you have already set Sheila up in the 
Rice Super Saturday in November.  Thanks.

I'd like to have a few people meet her, but am confident in Jennifer's 
ability to evaluate analysts.

Jeff

   
	
	

Jeff,
Please see the notes below regarding Sheila Chang who was a summer intern 
brought in from the Rice Leadership Program.  Interns that came in through 
this Rice program did not go through the normal campus interviews by the A/A 
Program.  The A/A Program would recommend that Sheila go through a round of 
Super Saturday interviews just like all other Analyst off-cycle candidates.  
This would allow other top Enron people to review Sheila and evaluate her 
skill level.  

With that said, I believe that Jennifer thinks highly of this individual and 
the A/A Program could forgo the interviews it you agree to take Sheila in 
your group for the first rotation.  Please confirm that you would like Sheila 
to be made an offer from the A/A Program and that you will accept her in one 
of the EGM groups upon graduation.  Thanks so much and if you have any 
questions, please let me know.  

Shelly and Shelly:
I believe that Sheila should receive an offer now. She was one of the most 
exceptional summer analysts. Based on this, I think she should get an offer 
just any other top intern would have received one.
Thanks
Jen

   
	
	

Shelly,

Below is the information on Sheila as was described in my email this 
morning.  I understand she will have to go through the Super Saturday process 
just as any other Analyst would.  Will you please advise Jennifer on the 
process and when Sheila will be participating?  Thanks so much for assisting 
Jennifer in this effort.

Jennifer,

Shelly Jones is the Recruiting Manager for the Analyst Program and is 
managing the current Super Saturday process.  She can provide more 
information on hiring processes.

Thank you,
Shelly
	
	

Shelly:
 Per our conversation this morning, I have attached Sheila Chang's resume. 
Sheila was a summer analysts in the Middle Marketing group. She was part of 
the Rice Leadership Program. I have served as Sheila's mentor in this 
program, which seeks to provide business internships for non-business majors. 
I believe that programs such as this and their candidates are essential to 
Enron as they provide a pool of academically diverse, bright individuals who 
can think outside the box.

Sheila managed our EnronOnline Top 200 Natural Gas Users Project. She was 
instrumental in ensuring the success of this project. By the time Sheila 
left, we had signed up over 70% of the top US industrial natural gas 
consumers. Sheila is an exceptionally quick study, as evidenced by her rapid 
grasp of key derivative concepts and structures. Every week Sheila priced the 
swaps and options for our customer newsletters. She also priced and helped 
develop several customized structures for our clients. Finally, Sheila 
demonstrated and exceptional work ethic that combined with all her other 
attributes places her among the top summer analysts at Enron. I believe 
Sheila should receive a full-time job offer from the program. She graduates 
in May 2001. I am also prepared to offer Sheila a rotation in my group in 
Global Markets upon her graduation.

If you need any further information, please let me know.

Thank you for your assistance with this matter.

Jen Fraser

ok.

Jeff,Eric   Platt's just reporting what Euell said so they really have no 
reason to aplogize, other than to us for running a story with our name with 
no confirmation as to the validity of what was said. I do not think it a good 
idea for us to be saying too much about this publically and being too 
defensive as it may be interpreted wrongly. I agree with Eric' s decision 
which will be confirmed by  Mark Palmer that we keep our reply to the WSJ 
where we can have some comfort that the facts will be properly reported. 

I haven't heard from either of you regarding the Wharton Analyst I 
mentioned.  Any interest in speaking with him?

Jeff

I want Platts, etc. to apologize and retract their story.

Jeff

Eric Thode@ENRON
10/12/2000 01:00 PM
I have fielded two calls regarding the Euell Energy issue.  They are from 
Beth Evans at Platt's and Robert Givens at Bridge News.  They have both 
spoken with Renard Euell and asked for our side of the story.  Primary points 
made are as follows:

9/28 or 29 - Mr. Euell contacted Enron through an employee in another 
division of Enron
  - This contact was forwarded to John Nowlan through a second employee
9/29  - Nowlan contacted Mr. Euell and told him that if Euell receives part 
of the oil that Enron would talk to him about a possible deal
  - Euell said he felt he would win part (NOTE: This was said in response to 
Beth's comment that Euell claimed Enron contacted him with    apparent inside 
knowledge that Euell was going to win part of the bid.)
10/3 or 4 - Euell called us regarding the SPR oil he won
  - We asked for the particulars of his bid and he stated them to us
10/4  - Enron received from Euell a copy of his letter to the DOE
  - The details were different than Euell had told us, but conversations 
continued
10/5  - Enron faxed a draft Novation Agreement to Euell.  This was never 
executed.  In fact, it has never left draft form.
10/5 thru 9 - Various conversations with Euell
  - He claimed to be in conversations with Nigeria, Shell, Mobil, BP, 
Equilon, Koch and Phillips
10/10  - Enron spoke with Euell around noon and suggested he take another 
deal that Euell claimed to have
  - Euell called Enron around 4:30 pm...Enron reiterated belief that Euell 
should take the bid he claimed to have
  - Interestingly, Euell was in Houston supposedly having meetings with 
various companies, but never requested a meeting with Enron, nor    did he 
ever have a meeting with Enron

Both reporters, prior to their conversation with me, are convinced the guy is 
a flake.  And lay most of the blame for the SPR debacle on the back of the 
DOE.  Palmer plans to contact John Fialka at Wall Street Journal later 
today.  If you have any questions, call me at ext. 3-9053.

Eric

Thanks for the email.  You do know that Networks and our Broadband businesses 
are different, I trust.  If you have and questions, please let me know, and 
I'll be happy to help you get to the next group that most interests you.

Jeff

Massimo Marolo@ENRON

Jeff,

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to work on the Gas Trading Floor. I 
believe I have learned a great deal not only about the technical aspects of 
the business but also about the less tangible but as important sides of Gas 
Trading such as teamwork, open communication, and freedom of thought. In all 
honesty, the overall environment and rhythm of the floor are the things I 
have enjoyed most and I can now better understand how these elements have 
been successfully applied to new ventures. 
I will be due for rotation in about 2 months and have started to attend 
brownbag lunches hosted by the various ENRON divisions. The one I enjoyed 
most was given by the ENRON Networks' E-Commerce group and its relationship 
with the Houston Technology Center. This group was initially signalled to me 
by an associate friend of mine working there as an ENRON loaned executive who 
is also due for rotation in December.  From what I gathered, the group's goal 
to bring together entrepreneurs, new technologies, and venture capitalists 
could be a good match with my skills and interests.
I recall you mentioning Networks to me as a possible rotation and would be 
very grateful if I could benefit from your feedback and advice on the matter. 
I thank you again for your assistance and hope all is well in Global Markets.

Massimo    

thanks for the update.  Please keep me updated today.....

Jeff

   

	

Just to reiterate:  Yes the Saudis are against $40 oil or above.  However, if 
the Israel thing gets bad and a lot of people die or it turns into a 
religious war over al-Aqsa mosque, the rulers will come under serious 
pressure to not help the West by producing more oil.

Arab leaders are holding a summit Oct 21 in Cairo.

Why am I such a worrier.  It was fine......

executives are speaking or moderating panels at the conference, including 
David Haug, Bill Gathmann, Doug Arnell and Dr Lay.  

On Wednesday, November 15, Ken Lay will serve as a keynote speaker at an 
Enron Sponsored luncheon at 12:30 P.M. and we would like to invite you to sit

Hi Mike,

Amanda Martin asked that I forward my resume to you for your consideration.  
I am interested in a position in origination, risk management or structuring 
within Enron.  I graduated from Rice University and Stanford University in 
engineering and have advanced into a commercial role at Azurix.  I am hoping 
to build on my commercial skills at Enron Global Markets.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my plans with you.  I am 
available to meet at your convenience.  You may reach me at 713-646-7902.  
Amanda will also follow up with a telephone call to you next week.

Thank you for your help.

Michelle, If you run into problems with finding mgr or above interviewers, 
you should consider assoc. to interview analysts.  I would also like to put 
Kevin McGowan (who went to MBA but isn't on the list, as an interviewer for 
wharton, in Phila if possible),  I'll leave it to you for interviewers.

In preparation for upcoming interviews and other events, we'd like to get the 
Wharton Recruiting team together on Friday, October 13 at 1pm in 44C1.  It 
looks like this could be a huge year for Enron on campus because start-ups 
are no longer hiring MBAs by the dozen and investment banking is facing a lot 
of uncertainty as a result of all of the recently mergers.  To take advantage 
of this, we really want to get all of you involved in some aspect of 
recruiting, whether it be sitting on a conference panel, interviewing on 
campus or helping out here in Houston.  Please plan on attending the 
meeting.  If you can't make the meeting, please let me know what area of 
recruiting you are interested in participating in.  Our biggest need right 
now is for interviewers for on campus interviews on November 9 and 10.  We 
need 12 interviewers (Manager and above) for the 9th and 6 (VP and above) for 
the 10th.  

See you Friday,  

Michele Nezi Marvin
Manager

Are you also coordinating this with hunter and his available analysts who you 
think are good?
	
	

Jana - Jennifer Fraser is in need of ten analysts to rotate into her group 
(Fundamentals which is a core training area) in EGM over the next few 
months.  Her greatest need is for two analysts, one in November and one in 
December with the remainder being spread out in early 2001.  Could you send 
her resumes of potential analysts who would fall into that category?  
Thanks.  Ted

Rick, fyi, we are contemplating signing a simple expression of interest 
letter with the Tampa Bay Port Authority for a potential site for an LNG 
Terminal to supply S. Florida markets.

Our development efforts to date have not been as focussed on T.B. as they 
have been on the Bahamas proposal.  However, we came across a potential site 
in the Tampa Bay port which meets many of our criteria for a terminal site  
(e.g. existing deep water port, sufficient acreage adjacent to the port, 
industrial zoning).  We have yet to test the rationale of injecting 
significant quantities of gas into that market location, but the port is 
willing to commit to exclusivity on their part until the end of the year.  In 
this period of time we can easily determine if the project makes sense.

I believe its a good defense against others making a similar move and we are 
committing to nothing and paying no dollars.

Please let me know if you concur.  The draft letter is attached below (I've 
got legal sign-off on it already).

Thanks

hey there.  freak show central here.  this week is bad, unfortunately.  
florida was awsome...and it put me in the mood to get back on the diet, and 
exercise.  did you buy that watch?  you should leave the office now and get 
it if you didn't, and on your way back, you should stop for a tennis lesson!  

	Alexandra Saler@EES
	02/05/2001 09:09 AM
		 
how are you?  it must have been a little bit easier to come back to such 
beautiful weather.  I can't wait to hear about the rest of your trip!  I had 
a great weekend.  I relaxed and spent a lot of time outside which was great.  
I had my best tennis lesson yesterday!  I just wish that I could play more.  

let me know if you have any free time this week to get together with Mish and 
I.  we could grab dinner after a run again!  I'd love to exercise if you 
can.  let me know!
I think that Wednesday is good for both of us if it works for you.

Draft:

We are please to announce the following within Enron Global Markets:

Larry Lawyer will be joining EGM effective immediately to start our new 
finance origination activities.  In this role, he will work with all 
commodity products, assets,  and teams and lever our existing businesses with 
new this new focus.  (Do you want to put in his background--which you 
probably now more than I?)  He will be reporting to the Office of the 
Chairman.

Eric Gonzales will be joining the LNG team and co-head this effort with Rick 
Bergsieker.  We believe there is significant opportunity in the worldwide LNG 
markets, and Eric will direct all merchant activity.  (Do you want to put in 
his background?)  Rick will be relocating to Dubai, and bring his martket 
relationships and  industry knowledge to the region focussing on Project 
Dolphin (do we want to say this?) and other related Mideast projects.  Eric 
and Rick will report to the Office of the Chairman.  

Jen Fraser will come over and develop our market fundamentals group for all 
products in EGM, much like ENA natural gas and power fudamentals and intranet 
pages exist today.  Previously, Jen was working in the Mid Market origination 
group.  Heather Purcell will be joining this group developing the commercial 
interface for our intranet page.  Heather was with Azurix, where she worked 
on the platform interface for the ebusiness initiatives. 

Gary Hickerson will be chairing our Trader's Roundtable.  This group will be 
comprised of traders across Enron's wholesale trading and risk management 
businesses.  This forum will give traders the opportunity to discuss topics 
important to their individual markets, and discuss other  markets in a macro 
sense.  We will be also forming a Cross Commidity trading group.  In this 
group, traders who have shown extremely strong and consistent profitability 
will have the opportunity to exploit cross commodity opportunities with a 
bias toward structural shifts in markets.  This group will not be involved in 
customer activity, and will execute through our principal desks.   Gary will 
manage this new group, as well as continuing with his current F/X, Rates, 
Equity, and Agriculture initiatives. 

(anything else?)

I'd like to talk to him, but isn't merlin's credit low?  

   

	
	                           
	

A friend of mine, formerly with Bankers Trust, called to see if we are 
interested in hearing a story about a floating LNG facility. He is with 
Merlin Production, a small producer, that thinks there is a large market for 
accessing stranded gas in offshore fields.  If you have an interest let me 
know and I'll arrange a meeting. I owe this guy nothing other that a call 
back so if you have no interest say so. Rick

Thor,

A quick note.  I don't believe I ever followed up with you on your weather 
business plan.  I looked at it several times primarily in pieces while 
traveling overseas.  I read it again today and wanted to give you some 
feedback.  I thought it was excellent work and very well presented.  Thank 
you for all your effort. 

 I am in town this week, I canceled being out of the office an additional 3

our other businesses.  I'll give you a call toward the end of the week to 
discuss some of the ideas you presented.

Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 39/2000

Highlight
Had a meeting with Bocimar in our offices this week as they were interested 
in knowing our plans with ABC.  From meeting it became very clear that they 
were out of the running for ABC as they were unwilling to purchase that 
company without a significant discount to current market levels.  Few days 
later, met with CEO of ABC as he had just received a bid from a rival 
shipping company ( Zodiac ) and he was basically begging us to join the 
bidding as he really did not want his company  to fall in the hands of 
Zodiac.  Pierre and I continued to express our interest in ABC but told him 
that we needed more time to evaluate their assets and could not counter on 
such short notice.  Told ABC that we would continue to follow with interest 
and that if buy out by Zodiac failed, we would come back to discuss.  Our 
goal all along was to make sure that Bocimar were not going to get their 
hands on ABC or they would have effectively controlled 50 % of the spot cape 
fleet and made our short position into next year look worrisome.  Having 
shown interest we not only were kept well advised as to what Bocimar was up 
to but it could have reacted quickly to protect our position.  We are 
relatively pleased with the potential of Zodiac buying ABC. 

Also, this week we fixed another Coeclerici cape for period.  We fixed the 
cape Asia build in 1990 for minimum 4-6 months to allow us to use the vessel 
to load out of Australia for CLP in December and hedge ourselves against a 
late winter surge in cape rates but we have the added advantage of having an 
option for a further two years to be declared mid January 2001.  We bought 
ourselves a very cheap call option with an exercise date in three months time 
in a very volatile market.  Further, Coeclerici gave us a put in year two to 
cap our downside and gave us a call option to extend the deal into an 
additional third year .  We are currently discussing with Bocimar the idea of 
putting that cape into their pool if they secure us a floor for year one and 
a share in any upside.  Will keep you posted  !!!

Fixed a 6 panamax contract as vessel owner with National power from South 
Africa to Bristol with option Immingham to give us a very useful short 
position into next year in the panamax sector.  This deal will add to our 
already significant business in South Africa for next year and will allow us 
to arbitrage between cape and panamax vessels as we hold contracts in both 
sectors.  

Furthermore, Intercore has asked us to offer them 6 capes from Bolivar into 
ARA from next March till September which if we were to win the contract would 
make us a definite market maker in the two busiest coal routes ( RBCT/ARA and 
COLOMBIA/ARA ).  

Market
	Short term	Medium term	Long Term
Handy Max	Down	Flat	Flat
Panamax	Down	Down	Down
Cape Size	Flat	Flat	Flat

Panamax : Market continues to fall for balance of the year as China/Asia was 
on holiday this week and fixings were relatively few 
Capes : Market is steady but few expect a fall in rates for balance of 2000.  
Owners and charterers waiting for coal trans to fix for next year.

Deals Done
Physical Freight
ECS freight 
Fixed  2+1 geared panamaxes from Indo to Hong Kong for November to January 
2001 at $6.35.
Agreed window of 12-21 November with MOSK for Drummond-Redcar lifting
Fixed a panamax for late October loading from Drummond to LBT at $9.80 with 
Bell ships
Sold a cape to the coal desk from Bolivar to Rotterdam at $6.85 for q3 next 
year

Third parties freight deals
As mentioned above structuring a deal with Coeclerici and Bocimar
Fixed 6 panamaxes from RBCT to UK ports for National Power for all of 2001 at 
around $10
Trying to sell 4 capes to Billiton from RBCT to Rotterdam and again  buying 
same deal with Coeclerici as a back to back with some profit.

OTC 
FFA s
No trades
      
EOL
No trades this week but EOL trader joining our group Thursday and new routes 
to be added shortly which should add liquidity and new players.

Miscellaneous
Our position as it stands now is short about 350,000 tons for balance of 2000 
mostly attributed to our November/December Colombia/LBT panamax short.  For 
cal 01 we are 6.2 million tons short and cal 02 1.7 million short and cal 03 
about 400,000 tons short.  These figures do not take into account our two 
Coeclerici cape deals as those have not been finalised with counterparty and 
have not been booked as of yet

Pierre is in Asia all week and I am in the office

You had asked for clarification regarding the status of our SADAF bid and how 
the 501D turbine that Delaney wants may impact us.

Our bid, along with bids from others, are still under evaluation by SADAF.  
We expect to learn about SADAF's decision through informal channels within 
two weeks, but a formal announcement from SADAF will probably not be 
forthcoming for another month or so. If we win the bid, we enter into PPA 
negotiations that could take about six months to finish.  Until the PPA is 
signed, we wouldn't know for certain that we had clinched the deal.

We were aware of Delaney's possible need for the turbine when we bid SADAF, 
and thus we structured our bid in a manner that provides that we can proceed 
with or without this specific turbine.  

Ownership of this turbine would marginally strengthen our prospects.  
However, I don't want to obstruct another Enron  affiliate if there is a 
bonafide use for the turbine that adds to the Enron bottom line.

If Delaney has a firm "bird in the hand" he should take the turbine.  
Conversely, if our deal firms up before Delaney has a firm use, I would want 
to take the turbine.

My guess is that Delaney's deal will firm up before SADAF.

Rick  

any thoughts?  
Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
10/08/2000 09:21 AM
The partial sale of Enron India's 100% interest in Metgas is on Cliff 
Baxter's list of corporate assets for sale.  As I expressed in our recent 
telephone conversation,  I view Metgas as a key asset that could be of great 
value to the EGM LNG network.  I believe that Enron should reconsider whether 
or not a Metgas selldown is a wise move at this time for the following 
reasons:  

1.  The Dabhol LNG terminal is ideally located for future LNG arbitrage 
plays, i.e., halfway between middle east and far east LNG suppliers.  
Opportunites for Mideast/Far East swaps or shipping backhauls could generate 
significant value for EGM.

2.  Metgas currently holds exclusive rights to use Dabhol's LNG terminal for 
imports of LNG into India, and it will be at least several years (if ever) 
before a second LNG terminal is built in India.  We should not be giving this 
strategic position away.

3.  The fact that our competitors (e.g., Petronas, BP, BG etc.) want to buy 
in is an indicator that we have something of value.  Even a partial selldown 
(and granting of voting rights) to one of these players could serously 
compromise our optionality and ability to maximize value to Enron. 

4. I suspect that the market value of Metgas at this time (given that there 
is still significant developement risk) is fairly small relative to its 
network value to EGM.

If, in spite of my arguments, a decison is made to sell down Metgas, there 
are two things that we could do to limit the damage:

1.  Prior to the sale, sign an agreement between EGM and Metgas that provides 
EGM with exclusive rights to use the terminal, and

2.  EGM should step into the Metgas/Malaysia LNG contract (i.e., EGM should 
buy from Malaysia and resell to Metgas) to ensure that we maintain maximum 
optionality in this contract.  We could do this in a way that gives us 
control of the contract but passes Metgas risk through EGM and back to 
Malaysia.

I understand that the time fuse for this selldown is very short---immediate 
action is needed if you want a vote on this.

Rick  

put this on the calendar.  Jeff

MKT SUMMARY

Despite the fact that we have seen some cargoes offered for resale in ARA mkt 
for nearby delivery thru to Q1 this week the tone of the mkt 
remains very firm. EDFT, seemingly still unsure of it's burn schedule one 
week to the next had a spot cape to find a home for if he could replace 
with tonnage from either ourselves or the mkt for December delivery. We 
offered equivalent of $39 cif ARA but they chose to take her themselves 
and two port her into Le Havre and Montoir which shud highlight the inability 
to extract from the mkt anything better than $40.50-$41 cif for delivery
December period. Indeed, due to rescheduling Anker Coal were offering some 
South African material into ARA for Nov shipment which we
showed some interest in but they claim to have unloaded it at $40.75 on a cif 
basis. Thus the direction and structure of the ARA mkt continues
to reflect what we are seeing in both the FOB origin and frt mkts - there is 
no incremental tonnage available out of Australia for Europe as producers 
look to take advantage of a soaring Pacific prices. Many were already well 
sold as the mkt really took off and hence are actively trying to fulfill old
European contracts from elsewhere in order to free up some bullets. Certain 
South African producers claim to be sold out until the New Year and
Drummond continues to struggle with getting their shipment schedule back on 
track stating that it won't be until May next year that they are fully 
back on track again. While there is not a huge amount of open demand thru to 
the end of the year anyone who finds themselves entering the 
spot mkt from here on in will have to dig deep into their wallets. Q1 01 
still proves to be a very interesting period where on the supply side 
we will still be experiencing all of the above mkt factors but where there is 
also still a substantial amount of open demand to be satisfied. Still
could see some fireworks and a steeper inverse than what we see today with Q1 
01 at $41.50 fob and Jan/Dec 01 at $41.25 - watch this space.

SPOT TRADES     

While we have worked towards procuring some spot tonnage thru various 
channels it has been a week without any spot business. As per
above the mkt is fairly well covered for nearby tonnage and sentiment of the 
buyers is to remain very hand to mouth for final requirements
rather than pay these high prices in advance. We are also not too aggressive 
at mkting what material we have unsold in stock or arriving
later in the year as we are confident that the mkt will give us handsome 
returns as we move further into the winter months and those spot
buyers are eventually forced to the table.

SELLING SIDE

Mission still have not covered their December requirements. Our offer of 1.46 
GBP per GJ delivered Ferrybridge and 1.28 GBP FOR 
Hunterston were only valid until Friday but they claim to hold on offer of 
1.30 delivered Ferrybridge for Polish material. We said that
he shud be filling his face at that level and if we could have some aswell 
that wud be very kind. The sage continues!
We have agreed in principle to a five year supply agreement with Stadtwerke 
Bremen for between 850mmt - 1mil tonnes per year
starting Jan 01. Prices will be linked to the BAW Index.
HEW/VW combined are tendering for 270,000mt for Q2 shipment into Hamburg. We 
have offered $42.50 cif.
Electrabel looking for 50mmt each month 2001. 
EDFT continue to look for some cover for Q1 01.
Veag - 300mmt cif Rostock for Nov00/Jun 01
Endesa - 4 capes for 2001.
H del C was interested in spot cargo we were looking at and still working 
various possibilities of swapping material for 2001.
While we hoped Coe Clerici may be suitable counterparty to sell us Russian 
coal going forward they are looking for us to sell them
some sort of structure which will limit their Russian short going forward!
Fenosa - 250mmt of Low Vol U.S material for 2001 but so far unable to get an 
offer basis this material.
Innogy looking for upto 1mil tonnes for delivery throughout 2001
Bewag still have tender out for 500mmt for next year where we are looking to 
put a proposal to them basis Polish material.

BUYING SIDE

Continue to work Emerald for material out of the U.S. - hopefully persistence 
will pay and we may close something this week for 2001 
shipments.
Bot a further cargo from Masefield for Q1 shipment FOB Santa Marta at $32 
basis 11800btu/lb
Ensham had a lower quality coal (cape quantity) on offer at $25.30 fob Oz but 
unfortunately the specs make it a much more difficult prospect
to find a home for.
Possibility of buying some bits and pieces ex Maputo for Q1 which would 
equate to somewhere in the region $41 cif ara. Would be good
to test viability of shipping thru this port.
In tandem with 5 year agreement to supply Bremen with coal we have agreed a 
five year Agency Agreement with German counterparty
whereby he will procure Polish coal for Enron for shipment against our Bremen 
obligations.
NCSC - looking at feasibility of swapping or buying outright South African 
material for 2001.

EOL

What started as a fairly quiet week ended as our best and most exciting week 
yet. Between Thursday and Friday we did 16 trades via
EOL equating to just over 300,000mt. Glencore was the main sponsor of the 
action on Friday, intent on driving prices higher they were
a net buyer on the day and are no doubt testing our ability to act as a 
physical market maker and hence deliver against our commitments
with no coal assets as a backstop! Life to date we have traded 950,000mt on 
EOL so hopefully all going well we shud surpass the 1mil 
mark this week. 
We shud be in a posn where we can roll out our options against the SECA at 
Coaltrans in two weeks time.

GAMEPLAN

Running the risk of sounding repetitive our focus must remain on securing 
tonnage to play with for next year. To date our Drummond long has
been the only real ammunition we have and there is little security of supply 
out of Puerto Drummond for the first 6 months of next year. With the
demand that we have on the table today we could turn our 1 mill long into a 
short with no problem at all.  While there will always be a level
where one is happy to short a market I wud feel very uncomfortable doing so 
at the traded levels for 01 today despite the absolute levels 
being the upper end of the historic range. We still have a little way to go 
to actually signing contracts which secures us the 5 year deal 
with stadtwerke Bremen but  on the assumption we do we must start looking at 
our supply strategy for the first 6 months of next year where
it looks to be most challenging. The business we will be fantastic for 
creating flows into Germany and ARA and with the guarantee that we
can supply 10% of the total volume as Petcoke it will certainly act as the 
springboard for launching us into this tightly controlled mktplace.

Best Regards
Jez

Simon Rich of Louis Dreyfus is on the board of TMG and his company owns 10% 
of the stock.  Does Louis Dreyfus still trade petroleum products?  We're just 
curious if he might try to kill a deal with a preceived competitor.

Dear Naomi,

Thanks for the opportunity to work with you on my new home.  I've enclosed a 
virtual tour disk (just follow the prompts), and some floor plans from my 
architect.  If there is anything else you need, please call anytime.  I'm 
excited for you to see the house in person, and have the chance to discover 
my passion for 20th century design.  Dennis and Daniel have been a great 
source of the best objects and knowledge.  Of course it is a primary concern 
to make sure the home, the objects, the furnishings, and the space work 
together.

Dennis and Daniel speak very highly of you and it is important to me that I 
have the help to complete this project with great attention, and all that 
results from that attention.

Best Regards,

Jeff

Hi Rick, 

I understand it is hot in Dubai--hopefully it will cool off soon.  On an 
organizational matter, I'm not too comfortable with your creating new org 
charts, and creating a new exec committee, etc.  Please call me next week so 
we can discuss this.  

Jeff

Supposed to be low 70's this evening, and cool tomorrow a.m.

The situation of this file, which was on the last leg , is suddenly 
worsening.  (cargo payment exposure decreasing as follows :  19 million oct 
3rd  / 14.5 million oct 15th / 5 million oct 30th,  zeroing in november  as 
we have stopped deliveries to GM  - We continue only to supply KPC and Conti 
cargoes direct to the third parties) .
Main cause is the fuel crisis in Europe, particularly in Spain,  where 
combination of prices kept low under government pressure, and blockade of 
terminals by strikers, have cut  the cash flow of GM,  putting into peril the 
above plan;  and this is worsened by the attitude of the owner, who seems to 
be unable to face the situation. He is now stopping his management effort to 
sell the company,  which was the only viable solution;  the company being 
unable financially to sustain the burden of carrying the strategic  
inventories, a direct consequence of the increase of the trading volume in 
the early 2000.   
As a reminder, we have 20 million USD of strategic inventories in the name 
(and paper control) of ECTRIC Spain. We need however to urgently get 3 more 
documents  to have paper  title/possession of these, with always the risk 
that a Spanish liquidator contest our position.
We could initiate the sale of these inventories, however as they are used by 
GM in their strategic inventory figure, we immediately make GM unable to 
continue their operations, as they will loose their operating licence and 
stop payments...

GM general manager was here today, he was asking if Enron could step in and 
save the company ;  however,  it doesnot seem to be possible without 
increasing our exposure, which we have no appetite for..

We are going to meet asap GM President to put all possible pressure on him to 
accept to sell the company to a third party (Tamoil/BP are  potential 
buyers), and sign the few documents missing, giving us full control of ECTRIC 
Spain. We will then monitor situation on a daily basis;  fear that we will be 
in a difficult corner if Spanish conflict is not ending, and if company 
cannot get sold.

Thanks
Michel

Bjarne was reviewed as a part of Enron Europe this time and his promotion was 
based on a long period of  high performance.   He is viewed as one of the 
most valuable people in the business and there was no controversy whatsoever 
in London about his promotion.   In fact I repeatedly get calls for his 
services from various groups around Europe who would love to hire him if they 
had the opportunity.  In Oslo he has been one of the main contributors behind 
most off our models, and I think that the job he has done with setting up the 
Weather desk here in Oslo deserves very positive feedback, even if we didn't 
make money last year.  We have really moved up the deal flow and are poised 
for an outstanding year 2001 in Weather.

In the future I will obviously cross check all things like this with you and 
Mark, so there aren't any misunderstandings going forward.  

Regards 

Thor

Hi Thor, 

Sorry you won't make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is 
never a bad thing.  
I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.  When I look at 
the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and 
I don't think that deserves this promotion.  What else does he do?  I'm also 
concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.  His promotion 
has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up.  

Jeff

Great article.  When/where will this be published.  Have a great weekend.

Dear Jay,

Here is the Jay Baker piece for our newsletter.  I like the way it
turned out.  I worked on it a bit...he is so proud of its humbleness and

ofcourse I love the fact that it is so understated but a few of his
initial comments were a bit much.  After all this house is extraordinary

quality   and as you know it is always harder and probably more
expensive to create something simple and elegant. See what you think and

call me or email with any changes and then we'll run them by Jay Baker.

Hope you love the house.

CALME's HR advised me that there is no match for my skills and experience in 
your business unit.  I spent a great part of my professional career in the 
oil & gas business.  Therefore, I have contacted Mike Brown to see if I can 
bring value to his team.  I have not gotten any response yet.

As I have about three weeks left to find a position within Enron, I would 
like to explore/seek origination opportunities in a totally new area for 
Enron:  Cement.  This industry can be transformed to the new economy and 
given its size, it may well be a significant income generating market for us 
and certainly within a short time another commodity for EnronOnline.

This is new for me but enormously challenging.  I am asking you to give me a 
chance to sell this concept to you at your convenience.  I have enclosed a 
brief resume for your review.

I look forward to meeting with you.  Thanks, Jeff

Gentleman,

We are currently planning a three day trip in early March to provide you with 
the opportunity to visit the coal properties in our portfolio and meet the 
principals.  These include the following:

DPR Holding Company  Chris Cline  Beckley W. Va.
The American Coal Company Bob Murray  Galatia, Ill.
BMR Resources  Richard Gilliam  Benham, Ky.

We plan to use the corporate jet in order to facilitate transportation to 
these garden spots. You will have the option of touring all three operations 
or limiting your visits to a specific mine/principal. Each visit will include 
an underground mine tour.

Bill Giuliani will be coordinating the visits for Enron and will be 
contacting your assistant  this week. Please let us know of your availability 
and particular areas of interest.

Mike

Hi Jeff,

Thank you so much for coming last Friday and speaking to the students about 
resumes - and everything else!  I think your story was an extremely valuable 
one.  It is good for the students to hear that there is a life outside Wall 
Street, and that their desire for challenge and stimulation can be more than 
fulfilled outside of New York.  It is also good for them to hear that there 
is not one answer to any particular question, and I appreciated that you and 
all of your colleagues pushed back when they pressed you for THE ANSWER.  All 
of us at MBA Career Management can say that until we're blue in the face, but 
when you speak they listen.

Thank you once again for participating.  And please pass on my best regards 
to Evan Betzer.

Best regards,

Sara Simons

Dear Mr. Shankman,

At the suggestion of my colleagues Michael Baker & Donna Armand, I am
just dropping you this email to introduce myself -- the Penn development
officer who covers the world!  I am not sure I can benefit you --
although particularly in Asia I do know an awful lot of people --
perhaps as much as you can benefit me -- for the same reason.

And there may be some Penn initiatives around the world -- such as
the Center for the Advanced Study of India, about which you do know --
that you might like to be aware of -- a major new collaboration in
the making in the Life Sciences with Singapore, for instance....
you never know when the network will help.

I'd certainly welcome knowing more about what you do as well.  Totally
by coincidence I am coming to Houston Sunday to see an alumna who is in
poor health.  I am sorry that it is over Yom Kippur -- otherwise, I
would have offered you a meal.  Perhaps we can do it another time,
Philadelphia, Houston, or Hong Kong!

Thanks for all you do for Penn.

Ed Resovsky.

It's not necessarily an either/or decision.  Michelle, do you think this is a

he thinks about the importance of our participation in this?

conference or the entrepreneurship conference?

Kristin
Hi Kristin

I am following up on our conversation earlier with respect to Enron
participating in the Whartons Finance conference and the evening
reception known as Bullish on Finance.

I think this forum will be a great opprotunity for Enron to reach
the students interested in finance and it also provides a great platform
to talk about Enrons unique position in the global financial
community.

Please do consider the option of sponsoring a panel at the Gold level.
It provides a great value and essentially a full panel "ownership" to
talk about Enrons acitivities.

I would like to touch base with you early next week to hear you thoughts
and feedback on these proposals.

Looking forward to a great conference participation.

Kind Regards

If you'd like to get me the resumes today, I'll take a look, and pick a few 
out.  This way we won't need to change the meeting time.  Michelle was my 
first choice to lead the effort.  OK about Suzanne.  

I'm serious about keeping a highly visible presence on campus, and am willing 
to spend some money, strategically.  Keep me updated.

Would you like to change the meeting to Tuesday October 10th?  The meeting 
would have to take place at 9am because I have a flight out of town at noon.  
Just let me know what you would like to do.

On another note, I wanted to let you know I am removing Suzanne Farrow from 
the team this season.  This decision has come after her incessant quibbling 
with me about pettily details.  I have better things to do with my day than 
to banter back in forth with Suzanne, as I am sure you do as well.  Suzanne 
has been a problem with her continual emails from day one.  I feel we as a 
Wharton team have the recruiting season under control.  Also, Michelle 
Nezi-Marvin has agreed to be the Wharton team lead and has been very helpful 
with details and arrangements over the last couple of weeks.   Thank you.

a team meeting will be held on:

Monday October 9th at 2:00pm in room 11C2

In the meeting we will review resumes that have been received for our

Dear Celeste and Kristin:

I am re-sending information regarding the Wharton Entrepreneurship
Conference and the opportunities to sponsor the conference as well as
participate in the Expo.  We are expecting the conference to double in
size with more than 1000 attendees.  In addition, we would like to
emphasize that the spirit of entrepreneurship is alive and well outside
of the "dot.com" world including in large, innovative companies such as
Enron.  We have already lined up some smash hit speakers including
Christy Jones of Trilogy and PCOrder as well as Anita Roddick of The
Body Shop.  We would be very interested to have the participation of
Enron in the conferences as a sponsor or at the very least, a
participant in our career expo.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Cassandra Santos

Gentleman,

We are currently planning a three day trip in early March to provide you with 
the opportunity to visit the coal properties in our portfolio and meet the 
principals.  These include the following:

DPR Holding Company  Chris Cline  Beckley W. Va.
The American Coal Company Bob Murray  Galatia, Ill.
BMR Resources  Richard Gilliam  Benham, Ky.

We plan to use the corporate jet in order to facilitate transportation to 
these garden spots. You will have the option of touring all three operations 
or limiting your visits to a specific mine/principal. Each visit will include 
an underground mine tour.

Bill Giuliani will be coordinating the visits for Enron and will be 
contacting your assistant  this week. Please let us know of your availability 
and particular areas of interest.

Mike

Enron is the major underwriter of a very unique and INNOVATIVE exhibit at the 
Museum of Fine Arts ... Star Wars:  The Magic of Myth.   It will be on 
display from March 11 - June 24, 2001 and we're really excited about it!  We 
know that there are going to be a variety of ways to involve the business 
units, employees and our external customers, and therefore we are asking you 
to participate on a steering committee to make sure that we leverage this to 
Enron's maximum potential.   Your expertise is needed!

Our kick-off meeting will be Monday, October 16th at 3 p.m.  in 4C2.  I will 
explain the exhibit in further detail at that time.  Please let me know if 
you are able to attend.  Cookies will be served ...

Jennifer Fraser is leading our fundamentals intranet group for all products 
within EGM.  Please contact her so we do not duplicate efforts, as the coal, 
etc site will be incorporated with some uniformity into the larger EGM 
site.   

Thanks.  Jeff

   
	
	

Jeff,

I need to get resources dedicated to building an intranet site specific to 
Coal, Emmissions and Clean technologies.  West Power built an intranet site 
which proved invaluable in providing fundamental info to the group.  Stu 
Staley is independently working on one in London.  I am also aware gas is 
pushing the same initiative.  Jeff Andrews, a new research hire in our group, 
was hired to develop an intranet site for our group.  I have attached a memo 
he has written which is pretty good considering his limited experience.  I am 
hearing you have initiatives for this started, and would like to get 
resources dedicated to our group as well.

weather derivatives trading in the region.

We have received advice from AsiaRisk Editor, Ellen Leander, Enron has won

Hi Thor, 

Sorry you won't make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is 
never a bad thing.  
I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.  When I look at 
the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and 
I don't think that deserves this promotion.  What else does he do?  I'm also 
concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.  His promotion 
has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up.

but also including some commercial ideas relative to the South American 
region and elsewhere.  

I would ask at your convenience for confirmation of your interest, or not, 
and availability for meetings during the week of Oct 16th-20 in Houston.   

I am available, in the meantime, to respond to any information you need, 
including clarifying any of my experience at or prior to Enron.

Thank you in advance for any effort extended in my behalf.

FYI, these are the type deals we as a trading group really like as they give 
us some physical volumes so we can get into that market as well as a 
financial transaction to make some money. Both sides should be a winner for 
us.  We have worked with Chris on 2 others of these and they have failed due 
to the variuos reasons but primarily the way the uk tax authorities look at 
the structures. I will keep you posted on the progress. 
Chris Glaas
09/28/2000 03:42 AM
F.Y.I.
We are helping Chris Harris here in London putting a structure together that 
can give us crude oil in the Nsea. 

The idea is that we will buy the crude oil from a North Sea producer to a 
fixed price. The duration could be for the next 4-6 years depending on how 
comfy we are with the exposure. By buying future oil to a fixed price at 
lower numbers than the future curve would suggest and paying upfront (due to 
time value of money), the producer will end up paying less tax.
This has been tried many times before by different banks and never worked. 
This time Chris Harris thinks that by presenting the correct package it might 
pass.  We will see.

However, in case of  success, we will have to do two things.
1. sell futures for the next 4-6 yrs, volume could be 25-50' bpd.
2. sell the physical bbls.

Number 2 is no problem and depending on the volume I think number 1 should be 
OK. We might have to hedge thru WTI, but will try Brent.

Question: with a deal like this do we need any signatures from above? Chris 
Harris will be happy to run a full presentation if required.

Just a short note to touch base on MetGas related activities. We, (the MetGas

starting on Wednesday, October 4.  The agenda is attached for your 
information.  If you have any questions or would like direct feedback please

When can we discuss the way forward for MetGas LNG supplies and the 
integrated approach among the upstream team and the MetGas team that is 
crucial to securing terms and conditions that fit the market?

 

I've already talked to Cliff B.  The only thing we are precluded from is 
building a power plant in Singapore...

I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete 
for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased 
expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This 
was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece 
of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners 
going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we 
do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive.  
Maybe I don't understand it all.

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

Very strong need for people in Japan next august.  I'd like to get some 
people interested in helping start there, or get there after some enron 
indoctrination.  Thanks.  Jeff

I asked Tess about Japan while we were up at Wharton and she wanted to try to 
remain under the radar screen as far as her Japanese expertise because she 
was trying to get some personal issues resolved.  She also wanted to stick it 
out in the Steel Group until some of the uncertaintly was resolved.

I agree that we should put Chris on the resume list.  I am very hesitant to 
guarantee or even indicate where people would go once they get to Enron 
during the interview process.  I know that last year we were looking for 
people who were interested in Asian opportunities (especially Korea and 
China), yet by the time these folks started we no longer had opportunities 
available there, leading to a lot of disappointment and disenchantment with 
Enron.  Jeff, how likely is it that we will still have a strong need for 
people in Japan next August?

I think he has a strong resume.  He's definitely worth putting on the 
interview list.

As for Japan opportunities, is there a way to get Tess Dyar plugged into 
those?  She just started (from Wharton) after spending nearly 10 years at 
Goldman in Japan.  She definitely has an interest in continuing her work with 
the country.  I think she's been a little disappointed since getting here and 
seeing APACHI dissolved.

Hi Mr. Shankman,

I am a second year finance major at Wharton.  I left a voice mail for you
the other day in which I mentioned my interest in pursuing finance
opportunities in Japan.  I have extensive experience in Japan and am looking
to go back and take advantage of some of the fascinating changes that are
occurring over there.  I will try calling you again this Thursday to
hopefully discuss Enron's strategies and opportunities more specifically.  I
have attached my resume for your consideration.  I look forward to talking
to you.

Sincerely yours,

Christopher Handte

Hi Jeff,

Thank you so much for coming last Friday and speaking to the students about 
resumes - and everything else!  I think your story was an extremely valuable 
one.  It is good for the students to hear that there is a life outside Wall 
Street, and that their desire for challenge and stimulation can be more than 
fulfilled outside of New York.  It is also good for them to hear that there 
is not one answer to any particular question, and I appreciated that you and 
all of your colleagues pushed back when they pressed you for THE ANSWER.  All 
of us at MBA Career Management can say that until we're blue in the face, but 
when you speak they listen.

Thank you once again for participating.  And please pass on my best regards 
to Evan Betzer.

It was a pleasure to meet you last week at the Inn at Penn.  It sounds as
though Enron is doing some very exciting things with more to come in the

I called Vince Kaminski a few times last week.  His secretary mentioned that
he was off again this week on a business trip returning on Oct 9th, I
believe.  I am confident that he will get a project proposal to us by the 13

Bobby retires this month, but will continue as a consultant to Enron India.  
His stated intention is to shadow Clay and his team to help arrange LNG 
supplies for Metgas.  We do not need this and it adds a layer of confusion 
whenever he is in attendance in negotiations, but to date neither Wade nor 
Sanjay has been willing or able to control this.  The India group tends to 
blame their failure to market Metgas supplies on the LNG team's "failure" to 
get better terms, and they insist that Bobby or others attend the meetings to 
ensure that we are doing a good job.

We believe that we have obtained LNG for Metgas on favorable terms, 
particularly in light of the fact that we have convinced Malaysia and Abu 
Dhabi to accept the credit risk of Metgas customers, i.e., with no Ennron 
support in the middle and no Indian government support behind the buyers).  
They believe that our supplies are priced 50 cents above the "market", which 
they perceive to be Qatari supplies to Petronet ( a proposed 
government-backed LNG import project in Western India that is a long way from 
being real).    

We believe that we know the pricing terms for the proposed Petronet deal and 
that the price is not as low as rumored.  We also believe that the Metgas 
customers are willing to pay the price that we have negotiated and that the 
Metgas pipeline economics are sound (although the India group has been 
unwilling to share their economics with us) and that, once the LNG contracts 
are in place, we can reduce the LNG price significantly via a backhaul from 
Malaysia using ADGAS/TEPCO ships.   We can further reduce the price if we can 
get access to the spare capacity on the ship dedicated to DPC and use it to 
move incremental cargoes from Abu Dhabi to Metgas.

Bobby and his team want us to reopen the price in the Mayasia term sheet.  We 
do not intend to do this.  Malaysia has told us that they will walk the deal 
if we insist on a lower price.  Malaysia recently sold additional volumes to 
Japan for a price about 20 cents higher than the price to Metgas and they 
believe they can also sell our volumes at a higher price to more creditworthy 
buyers in the far east.

The Malaysia COI includes a cp that Metgas will finalize contracts with its 
end buyers by Sep 1999.  We have repeatedly  gotten Malaysia to extend this 
target date, which is now end October 2000, but Malaysia is getting impatient 
with India and I am not sure how much longer we can hold this together 
without some more firm evidence from India that the markets are real

I will be in India on Oct 4/5 to meet with Sanjay and Wade to discuss this.  
We will also try to finalize the terms for us to provide LNG  fuel management 
and shipping services to both DPC and Metgas, and will seek clarification 
from Wade/Sanjay as to how they intend to sell down DPC/Metgas without losing 
control of the LNG terminal.  Clay, V V RAo and Wayne Perry will be with me.

Working with India is never easy

Rick

   
	
	

I'm hearing a little noise about Bobby Ferris in Sanjay's group.  Did he 
retire or not?  Bobby's job is not going to one soley in which he directs the 
LNG team to source product for metgas.  What's the story?

Hopefully Brunei LNG/Shell won't beat us to the punch.  You can bet that Mr. 
Damit at Brunei LNG gets his intelligence from Shell who no doubt are working 
on this already
(Shell is in a JV that just rolled out an online shipping capacity/freight 
trading business this month).
The first one to launch an LNG Trading internet platform will have an 
incredible advantage over all others.

PATTAYA, Thailand (Dow Jones)--Online liquefied natural gas trading is on the 
way and will challenge the way business in the industry is done, 
Mohammed Damit, head of LNG marketing for Brunei LNG Sdn Bhd, said this week 
at a gathering of gas industry executives. 

"It's only a matter of time before we see energy trading activities on the 
net," Damit said, adding that the biggest LNG online opportunities are
in ship chartering and spot LNG trading. 

Damit said online trading would result in greater price volatility. 

LNG prices are currently indexed to crude oil prices, in term contracts for 
as long as 20-30 years, that tend to smooth out price fluctuations 
over the life of the contract. 

Damit added that online traders will use standardized documents, simplifying 
trading.

Will discuss this with Clay to get a better idea of his perceived workload.  
In the interim, we will follow up with Andrew to let him know that we will 
probably have a spot for him in the Enron organization so that he doesn't 
slip off the hook

   
	
	

Any thoughts on this?

Jeff
Brad Hitch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT on 09/21/2000 11:09:16 AM
Jeff,

I don't know if I'm going to get to meet Andrew, but he looks good on paper.  
My only question is whether we need another person working on LNG in Dubai.  
Obviously, I don't know quite what structure you want to put in place, and 
perhaps there are some projects I'm not aware of, but from what I've seen I 
would be worried that this guy would get bored. 

Just a thought, but looking at this guy's resume he'd be an ideal guy to work 
with Jonathan Whitehead and Joe Hirl in Tokyo.  He speaks fluent Japanese, 
knows the Japanese market, has contacts at Mitsubishi, and knows the LNG 
world.  Quite frankly, he might do more good for Enron's LNG effort working 
for Enron Japan than for LNG.

Also, regarding Elba Island, do you think you'd be ready for a conference 
call on Monday?

Thanks,
Brad

Some follow up on friday's meeting:

We need to focus quickly on whether or not there is any deal to be done with 
Middle East suppliers that can contribute to Enron Europe's power project in 
Spain.

Our pending deal with Adgas to ship LNG on the Heogh Galleon could be a good 
fit however  the current volume being discussed (0.3 MMTA) is only a small 
portion of the 1.3 to 1.5 MMTA required for the project in years 03+ (minimum 
delivery would be 1.0 MMTA).  We should press ADGAS to see if they would 
commit to a higher volume.  We also need to determine what we believe is the 
most effective pricing structure for the ADGAS LNG purchase (both in terms of 
supply to our project in Spain, but also for potential diversions to Europe 
in 01/02) and for what term.  Based on our discussions on friday, it may be 
that a crude based purchase price may work the best.  We have discussed both 
Brent and NYMEX based pricing formulas with ADGAS.  Merritt, Eric, lets add 
that to the agenda for our monday morning meeting and get some price 
structuring done.

The structure of the ADGAS deal will be based on a U.S. delivery.  We will 
reserve the right to divert to any other market (except TEPCO).  We will 
likely have to share, in some way the shipping savings, if we divert to a 
non-U.S. terminal but I think we can keep any upside made on the indexed 
portion of the price for ourselves.

In addition we will be contacting OMAN LNG to determine their ability to 
provide quantities to augment the ADGAS supplies, as well as potential 
shipping options (Exmar?)  Obviously we need to consider shipping 
requirements for our Atlantic Basin projects (i.e. Elba Island) when thinking 
about shipping for Spain.  I would also like to look at how Elba could be 
used as part of a potential take or pay avoidance strategy for the Spain 
power plant.

I will try to keep everyone updated as the pieces come together.

The First Gas Power Corp. (FGPC) liquid fuel supply transaction involves a 
1000 MW (two power blocks of 500 MW each) combined cycle land based power 
plant located on the island of Luzon in the Republic of the Philippines. In 
Fuel deliveries did not start until April 2000 and have not been at the MTM 
volume of 31,050 barrel per day. To put it in perspective, FGPC should have 
taken delivery on 14.2 million barrels by now and they have only ordered 0.9 
million, a shortfall of 13.3 million barrels. This shortfall, as a result of 
the delayed plant start-up and reduced consumption, has caused the ECTRS 
books to currently have a $6.1 million receivable through the end of August, 
2000. The plant is currently consuming 10,000-12,000 barrels per day, which 
means the receivable will continue to increase until the consumption reaches 
the expected MTM volume. When ECTRS approached EI Asia Pacific for the 
true-up amount we were stonewalled. Following many months of discussion with 
EI about the receivable,  Enron Corp. reorganized EI into global regions, one 
of which was Asia Pacific (APACHI). APACHI said it was not their deal, nor 
had they ever benefited from the deal since the MTM revenue originally went 
to EI and they didn't have money in their budget to return funds to ECTRS, 
regardless of the true-up agreement. Subsequently, Global Fuels meet with 
Rick Buy to discuss this matter. Rick recognized and agreed with our book 
problem, but indicated that Enron Corp. was not prepared to remedy the 
situation. We have been waiting for Corp.'s help ever since. 

 ECTRS did not do anything wrong and yet their books have suffered the 
consequences of a project not living up to it's original estimate. How can 
Enron operating groups grant MTM origination across company lines and not 
expect those regions and projects to live up to the original MTM volumes, 
term and margins granted? 

Please follow up with this.  Jeff

At our LNG coordination meeting in London last Friday, I asked Doug Arnell to 
be the point person tocoordinate the assembly of a quick data base of all of 
our LNG sources and uses and ship availability over the next several years.  
He will work with Merritt Thomas, Brad Hitch and Eric Groves and will 
coordinate all of his work with Eric Gonzales.

The purpose of this exercise is to give us, in light of the fact that we do 
not have an operational LNG book,  a quick picture of the overall situation 
so that we can make some quick calls on Hoegh Galleon, Abu Dhabi etc.

I have noted that Doug has since started copying the two of you on lots of 
emails.  I will ask him to take the two of you out of the details on this for 
now so that we don't overload your email inboxes, unless you want to see all 
of the details.

I will screen the emails and forward you info to keep you in the loop but at 
a higher altitude without all of the gory details.

Please advise 

Rick,  

What is the network theory here?  I'm also not a fan of an only Jordanian 
play.  Politically, I'm not sure it makes sense, (like Gaza)  What's the 
benefit here?

FYI---this project is heating up rapidly and may be quite attractive.  I had 
separate talks inLondon on Friday last week to explore turning this into a 
regional development project in the Aqaba/Eilat area at the tip of the red 
sea (where Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi all meet and where a regional 
planning authority is in place).  There may be a good opportunity for a 
regional power and district cooling plant with energy management and 
gas/power marketing opportunities.

Will advise after Rob's meeting s in Cairo/Amman and after we scrub this at 
our Dubai planning meeting this week

Please respond to Hamdi Atta <Hamdi.Atta@gdi.co.ae>
Charles,

Further to my last email my thoughts on the competing schemes are as
follows;

I reviewed the subject of your email from the angle of competing schemes and
the advise I received is that the whole project should be presented and
dealt with as an "area" project serving several countries inclusive of
Jordan (ie. the hub approach). It is very important that it is promoted this
way or there might be a big risk of leaving the image or consideration that
this is just purely a Jordanian project without a broader scope.

Regards,
Hamdi

Fellows,

I had a number of interesting sessions today on Amman on the subject of
Egypt gas. IN summary:

- The Prime mInister and Oil Minister are open to discuss this project,
in the context of clear future needs, estimated at 400 BCF by 2005. As a
matter of fact, the Oil Minister - Wa'el Sabri - brought in his senior
team to the meeting and scheduled a working session with Enron for
September 27, at 10:00 AM

- In addition, the Royal Court (Diwan) support this development and has
sent to the meetings Dr. Bassem Awadallah, the Economic Advisor to King
Abdullah

- The Amoco deal is dead: they had an axclusivity arrangement which
ended recently and they had in mind a pricing scheme linked to the "fuel
being used currently" or to oil prices, both of which were totally
unacceptable to JOrdan

- Whatever deal there is will need to compete against the odds that the
deal with Irak, which provides Jordan with virtually "free" oil, will
keep as it is. In fact, it is this deal which has allowed the Government
to procrastinate on the AMOCO discussions

- Jordan is comfortable that there is gas in Risha, close to the Irak
border. Schlumberger are currently exploring in that region. The thing
is that the government is convinced that whatever gas they may find in
Risha should not prevent them fromstriking a deal for an import scheme

- The government has been approached by the Saleh Kamel group of saudi
arabia, which believes thay may be able to set up a new company which
will develop gas fields in the northwestern part of saudi (Tabouk) and
export it to Jordan. This is still at a very preliminary stage, but
appears to be of great interest to the jordanians

- IN addition, British Gas approached the minister with a new scheme,
relying on gas discovered "off the coast of Gaza and Israel, which will
require a shorter pipeline. the thing is that the Jordanians feel
uncomfortable with imports through Israel at this stage of the "peace
process"!

So here we are, welcome to pitch into this situation. I used the
argument of speed of development and this is something we need to check
with the Egyptians.

The course of action is as follows:

1. ENRON is to issue a letter to the Jordan Energy Minister (ASAP)
stating the opportunity and formally requesting discussions. No
MIDDLEMAN PLEASE...THIS WAS CLEARLY STATED BY THE PM and the Minister!.
The address is:
H.E. Eng. WA'EL SABRI
Minister of Energy & Mineral Resources
P.O.Box 140027, Amman, Jordan
Fax No. 9626 586 5373
Phone No. 9626 581 1338

A fax will do, as far as the minister is concerned.

2. A meeting has been scheduled on september 27, at 10:00 AM in the
Minister's office. it is likely to be attended by Ahmad Bashir,
secretary General of the Ministry and Rashad Aburas, Advisor to the
Minister (National Electric Power Co.), plus some other people

3. Based on the demand projections and timing, the jordanians expect
some kind of a formal proposal. time of important, as other competing
schemes may have political or technical delays

Fellows, the Jordanians are supportive of the scheme and its sponsors,
so we need to capitalize on this.

In line with my phone discussions with Rob, I will try to rearrange the
meeting for monday sept. 25 and, if possible, our meeting in Cairo for
sunday sept. 24.

I will keep you posted. Any thoughts on the competing schemes are most
welcome.

Charles

Clear it with arnold if you want dutch.  Let me know as people come to you.  
the goal is to have people rotate into your group directly, or from the gas 
fundamentals group if possible, and vice versa.  

Keep me updated, and you, I and Lavo will work this out.  Jeff

   
	
	

JS:
Several analysts have approached me with the desire to join me in EGM. What 
are the limitations on this? Also Dutch quigley is interested in coming over 
as well. He would like to start in research with a view that he would later 
trade or market something in EGM.

I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete 
for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased 
expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This 
was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece 
of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners 
going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we 
do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive.  
Maybe I don't understand it all.

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

Jeff - I think your ideas of adding marketing and research analysis to the 
group are good starting points. I don't feel this will increase revenues for 
us in 2001 as our  efforts here are only to win volume from others in a thin 
volume environment.  Eventually the captured deal flow should help the group 
trade from a better knowledge base but for the next year it will require a 
significant recruitment and training effort.   Both the recruitment and the 
teaching process are ones that we need to focus on.  Please let me know what 
you have in mind on the recruitment side and I would like to highlight that I 
feel there are very few people to teach the analysts and associates.  I plan 
on spending an increasing amount of my time working with the younger team 
that I'm assembling in London.   By end October, the London office will have 
5 managers, 4 associates and 1 analyst in our group.  This is a real shift 
from the approach of the past where the focus was on recruiting directors.   
Given our previous track record on recruiting from the outside (about 33% 
success in terms of performing well and acclimating to enron) I think this is 
the right approach but we must realise this is a slower process when we look 
to revenue growth and one that will also require us to shift more focus 
toward teaching. My plan is to put much of the associate resources toward EOL 
marketing initially and see what talents they have for being marketing and 
analysis.  The one analyst joining the group is coming over one of the 
consulting companies in London and I'm putting him in charge of drawing up a 
list of potential customers in every European country.  Please let me know if 
you have any plans of bringing somebody in to organise globally the marketing 
business.  Can't help but feel that we are very marginal in the electronic 
trading of oil and could lose all of our business in the near future.  Having 
seen the ICE demo I would prefer that system of ours because of volume.  This 
is a complaint that I have heard from many traders regarding the use of our 
system.  The challenge is how can we put up more volumes, more markets, and 
tighter 2 ways to convince more people to trade with us and not get run 
over.  What do we know about the ESPEED system and what they are going to 
have.  I saw a Reuters story saying they were launching Oct 2nd with Koch, 
Dynergy, Entergy, Willams, and a few others.  Are we thinking about trying to 
join up oil markets with either of these two sites and what are the plans if 
we do begin some of the small customer basis we do have?   This is area that 
we giving a great deal of effort and attention to but what are our plans if 
we fail to be the largest in this platform.  I don't feel that in the oil 
business we will be successful unless we can be the most preferred site 
because most companies will not have two websites up on the computers.   We 
are having a difficult time getting anybody but the most aggressive trading 
companies to look at our numbers so it seems difficult to believe the 
industry will look at two different e-trading sites.   

BUILDING THE PHYSICAL TRADING BUSINESS 
This has always received luke-warm interest from Enron.  I believe that the 
inefficiency within the oil markets is not great enough to try and profit on 
that
alone.   So when we talk about going big that really means getting involved 
in some kind of steel and trying to dominate certain aspects of the physical
business.  Tankage and shipping are the easiest and quickest ways for us to 
increase the business we are already doing in these areas with the shortest
financial commitment.  Mike and Jeff you should be aware though that the 
corporate commitment to be in the oil business has previously been poor.  We 
can
candycoat this subject but it is very clear that most of our competitors are 
more aggressive on the credit and performance risk in emerging markets.  We 
have
a credit department that have done a poor job, if any at all, in getting out 
there visiting with the national oil companies that we have to be able to 
participate with
(petrobras, pertamina, petrolimex, sinochem, sinopec, egpc, nnpc) if we have 
any real plans of significantly expanding our physical volumes.   We are also 
the
worst company in the oil business in putting out a contract that shows we 
have a commitment to perform.  Our contracts are also drafted with many 
escape clauses that will be rejected by many end-users who will insist on a 
greater performance guarantee.  As we discussed briefly in Singapore, I think 
there are several airlines that we could target in the U.S. for physical 
supply.  I will tell you now that legal would not accept the consequential 
damages that the airlines have in their tenders.   Previously, I have not 
gone after this business because I didn't believe we would have the political 
clout or sponsorship from those in your position to take legal on in such 
matters.  Please consider this (I will fax you a tender offer from Japan 
Airlines) and lets discuss if we are ready to accept that if we fail we are 
willing to accept that it could cost us several million dollars.  That kind 
of loss I have never experienced and seen it happen on very few occasions but 
it is something that we have to accept if we want to go after the airline 
business.  

I will let you know more my thoughts about how we go should try to go 
forward....this message was more to highlight how I'm trying to advance the 
group along and what are the challanges we face at the moment.  Lastly, on 
that theme we are trying to work with IT over here to develop some systems 
that will make us better suited to do customer business.  At the moment 
everybody is working off of individual excell spreadsheets and we are trying 
to get toward a server based system
and options system that would be available to everybody and designed by IT 
people instead of traders.  I will let you know if we need any help from you 
on this as intially we do seem to be getting stonewalled by the London IT 
department.

Hey, I hear you want an M5  (I know, crazy timing), but mine was just delivered today, and I'm not taking it--I think I'm going to get a new 7 instead.  Do you want it?

Bank of America and Sempra have traded with us online today.  Also, Morgan Stanley has called us and wants out of all long dated trades.  With morgan, we primarily have only financial trades, and will charge them to get out.  No cash out the door on these.

no, I'll have IT check on my side.

Were you able to open my report this morning?  I checked with IT and they it should have gone through OK.

I can't open any of your reports still.  Please check with IT.

ok.  i checked with a few others that i send the report to and they didn't have any problems.

the new one didn't work either.  please check with IT.

Thanks guys.  Any ideas?

Sorry jeff...I'm locked down on a deal...please keep me in mind in the future

Hi guys,  

I've had a cancellation for tomorrow's intereviews at Wharton and was hoping you guys could fill in.  Please let me and Michele Nezi Marvin know as soon as you can either way.

Thanks.   Jeff

who is there now, and do you have a list of grads, or others who have interviewed in the past?

Jeff,
Let us know If you have suggestions on a replacement. This is the second year in a row Kevin has backed out on interviewing at the last minute.  If we can't find anyone, we'll have to interview fewer people.  The replacement would need to fly to Phila Monday night and would get back late on Tue night.

Hi Robert,

I could not open the file.  What are you interested in doing?

Jeff

Mr. Shankman:

My name is Robert Brown and I am a fellow alumnus of the Wharton School.  I
noticed that you provided your name on the Penn Career Network as a mentor
for other alumni.  I have just returned from a sabbatical and am currently
seeking to enter the energy industry in Houston now that I have returned
stateside.  As a person who has achieved a prominent position in the
industry in which I am interested, I thought you might be able to help me in
my endeavors with some advice.

Would it be possible for me to contact you at a convenient time, so that I
might be able to ask you a few questions?  Please feel free to call me on my
cell phone at 832.541.5805 or you can also reach me through e-mail by
responding to this e-mail.  Thank you for making yourself available to other
alumni like myself.  I look forward to speaking to you.

Hello Jeff,

Hi Betsy,

Sorry for the delay.  What are you interested in doing?

Jeff

Jeff, 

Just got off the phone with Greg Curran.  Guess he's been talking to you about the fact that I'm moving off the bandwidth trading desk here in London and have been exploring opportunities in different groups.  

Was telling Michelle Nezi Marvin last week about my situation.  Coincidentally, she offered to introduce me to you for some good advice as to what I should do.  I was one year behind her at Wharton and look forward to seeing her in Philadelphia next week for on-campus interviews.

I'm actually enjoying London quite a lot, and so am hoping to stay here for the time being.  But Greg suggested I send you a copy of my CV as you might be have some good ideas for me.

Thanks.... and look forward to speaking with you, 

Betsy

Jeff,

Hi there......sounds like Penny has been equally emphatic on both sides
about meeting...

So sorry not to have responded earlier ...it has been such a completely
psychotic week for me. I have been in London and Stockholm this week - I
don't think I slept more than 3 hours a night all week. I am on my way
tomorrow to India (Bombay and Bangalore)...London on Thursday...and back to
New York on Thursday night or Friday morning. Friday and Saturday (April 13
& 14) are fairly free for me - would Friday night work for you?

It will be difficult for me to reach you from India- given schedule and time
difference, but I will be accessing email. I can be reached on a mobile
number in Europe on today and on Thursday - ++44 7990 973 620. As of Friday
- in New York, the best place to reach me is on - 1 917 862 6552. By the
way, how is the Peninsula post-renovations? I liked it before the
renovations - am sure its even more wonderful.

Elizabeth

Hi Elizabeth,

I'm Penny and Sam Britell's friend (Sam's from college) who have
mentioned (truthfully, insisted) that we should get together for a drink
next time I'm in NYC.
I'll be in new york sunday the 7th through the 14th and would love to
get together for that drink Penny and Sam keep telling me about.
Fortunately I have a pretty open schedule next week, so if you have any
time, I'd like to meet you.

I'll be staying at the Penninsula next week, or feel free to call me on
my cell phone at 713 854 4952.  As well, I'll be checking voicemail in
the office (713) 853 1761.

I'll be out of the office the next two days, but leave a message if you
have time.

Regards,

Jeff

Dear Jeff-
I have been in Atlanta for two weeks and am continuing to unpack and
assemble furniture. I thought of you last night as I came across the
wonderful surrealism book that you gave me; what a great book. Of
course, I had to stop my unpacking to read through parts of it. I did
not get much unapcking done, but I had fun.
I reconnected with Christina Johns, one of my roomates at Penn with
Dori and she passed along Dori's email address. I sent her an email
and she responded, and appears to be happy in Philly with her 18
month old daughter. I told her that we had seen each other in NYC
during the past years and gave her an update on your successes and
accomplishments.
I hope that work is going well. I have to return to an orientation
session. My new phone number (404)248-2290 and address 757 Houston
Mill Rd. NE, Apt. 8 Atlanta, GA. 30329-4240. Does Enron have an
office in Atlanta?

Hi Jeff,

How are things in Houston?  Sorry it's taken us so long to write.  No
excuses, just forgot actually.

Last night however, we heard about an art exhibit that will be here in
October called SOFA.  We were wondering if you were planning to come up for
that and thought we should shoot you an e-mail and find out.   Even if you
don't plan to come for that, we'd still love for you to come up and visit.
We have a few friends we'd like to introduce you to (no, Alyson has not
forgotten about your BMW offer).

Talk with you soon!

Jeff and Alyson Goldberg

ps - Alyson stopped working, so you can call her at our home any time
773-472-5743

yes, I know him and will call now.

Jeff

So you'll call him?

David,

I run a $650 million dollar commodities fund at Harvard Management Company.
Our focus has been on arbitrage strategies in the commodity arena - we are
looking to expand into weather and power. I was wondering, if given the
potential situation at Enron, that there might be employees interested in
interviewing for several positions both within my group and foreign equities
? I apologize if this is too forward or that I have assumed too much in
terms of potential restructurings.

Thanks,

Stuart D. Porter

Hi Carole,

I won't be able to make it to NYC this week.  How could I put a reserve on it?  How would you feel about sending it to me on approval?  If not, what other ideas do you have?  Hope you had a great weekend....

Jeff

Dear Jeff,

We just received the new Kondo piece - and quite honestly, I think it is
even better than the one you saw at the gallery.  I am attaching two images
- the first of just the plaque, and the second with the frame.  The
gestures in this piece are more interesting than the first and the plaque
is about 1 inch larger (height and width).

Please know that our photography doesn't do this piece justice - it is
beautiful and the color is much more vibrant than it appears.

Please let me know your thoughts.  As is gallery policy, all offerings are
subject to prior sale.

anything else. Have a great holiday.

Ground (tracking # 1z 150 x09 03 3938 7453). With the holiday week, I would
expect you'll get it just post-Thanksgiving. Let us know if we can do
anything else. Have a great holiday.
best, Greg

Alan, where is the special narrative of my EEL board membership.  Should I resign from all of these companies immediately?

Jeff

Mike/Jeff:

Attached is a list from the Enron Corporate Secretay's Office of the Enron companies where you are a Board member and/or an officer, noting your title.

It is my understanding that the Enron Director/Officer Liability Insurance Policy does apply to directors/officers of each of these companies.

Let me know what questions you have and I'll do my best to answer them or promptly find an answer.

Regards, Alan

can you come right now?

You said last week that you might make a call Wharton on my behalf and I should stop by sometime this week.  I was hoping to take you up on your offer and wondered when would be a good time for me to come see you.

Thank you,

is this in the rolodex

Sunday is better than Saturday for me. (The Poe Elementary School Carnival
is scheduled for Saturday, and then Jack and Jean are attending his
teacher's wedding that evening).

Give me a call, or I'll try you on Saturday to finalize.

Thanks I'd love to.  this weekend would be best, if that's ok.

Yes, I'll send the check tomorrow.  Send all the pictures you have.  How low is the bench?  The Mies chairs I was asking about are the very classic chairs shown everywhere.  The back and seat chrome legs intersect and form a curvy X.  (How's that for description?)

Jeff

Hi Jeff,
We are bringing alot of new furniture to the shop tomorrow. I will send some
jpegs with an overall view and you can tell us if there is anything of
interest. Also, have you gotten your new checks yet? We could really use the
payment.
Thanks, Kim

Thanks for the note.  You have no idea how awful this is.  I hope no one I know (like) ever has to go through this.

I'm thinking about making the dragofly table a gift to the MFA, Houston, where is was just exhibited for 2 months in the Defining Modern show.  What would  you appraise the value as?  (Approximately, and of course I know it's not anything close to a fomal apprasail?)  Also, I've had 2 people approach me about selling it outright.  Any ideas?

Hugs.

Jeff

one from shell, which is a bit surprising since i thought we cleared this last week. but anyway, the guy's name is james blount and number for stasco is 0207 546 5755
the other is socgen and this is due to some limits on gas side that they r linking. the guy there is frederic naudan and his number is  33 1 42 13 03 91.

 

I don't really know him.  I'm not sure he is the king, but I'll ask around.
 
 
Jeff

Jeff,
 
Fred has been heading up EBS' Asian trading business out of Singapore.  Prior to this he traded power for Fallon.  May not be as high powered as Storey, but worth taking a look.  I'd like to get him set up to speak with you by VC.  When would you be available?  
 
Joe
 
PS we are now 15 hours ahead of Houston.  Japan does not turn its clocks back in the fall.  Would be much easier to have calls during our morning versus your morning.
 
Joe,
 
I enjoyed our conversation yesterday and look forward to learning more.  Now it seems more challenging than ever to pick a spot within Enron, but I have had good conversations with several groups and it does look like some good opportunities do still exist around the organization including your shop.  As you look over my CV you will I'm sure notice that my educational background is different than the typical Enron recruit.  I think that my performance during my years within Enron and the consistent recognition I have received in PRC in some of the core operations of Enron's business should demonstrate that at this point differences in education are insignificant relative to my potential to positively contribute to the business.  I look forward to talking again soon.

Regards,
Fred
 
 

if I were a rich man....

or

I'll call you later.

No really, how are you?

The Following are our  recommended changes to the agreement( I would also 
like to discuss the waiver of conflicts section with you):

Page 2, item (3) should read "The payment of a "project fee" of $175,000 upon 
the achievement of each milestone described in Exhibit A to this letter.

Item (4) should read "The payment of a "project fee" equal to 2% of the 
project's total cost upon the achievement of the milestone described in 
Exhibit B to this letter.

Exhibit A should read as follows:

Individual milestones subject to "project fee" payments:

1. With respect to Haywood Power I, L.L.C. ("Haywood Power"), the abandonment 
by the Tennessee Valley Authority ("TVA") of its proposed 320 MW expansion of 
its Haywood County, Tennessee facility ("Lagoon Creek"), which results in 
Haywood Power being allowed by TVA to interconnect into an existing 500kV 
open bus position in the Lagoon Creek substation. Achievement of this 
milestone shall be evidenced by the interconnection specifications set forth 
in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and Haywood Power, and the 
milestone shall be deemed to be achieved upon execution of said 
Interconnection Agreement.

2. With respect to Haywood Power, the decision by TVA to eliminate the 
Network Upgrade related to the reactive power requirements as set forth in 
Haywood Power's System Impact Study, presently estimated at a total cost of 
$5 million.  Achievement of this milestone shall be evidenced by the Network 
Upgrade requirements set forth in an Interconnection Agreement between TVA 
and Haywood Power, and the milestone shall be deemed to be fully achieved 
upon execution of said Interconnection Agreement to the extent such Network 
Upgrade cost is eliminated. To the extent that such Network Upgrade cost is 
less than $5 million, but greater than zero, a pro rata portion of the 
$175,000 project fee shall be paid.

3. With respect to Calvert City Power I, L.L.C. ("Calvert"), the elimination 
of TVA's present requirement for Calvert to pay for a Network Upgrade 
consisting of the construction of a new 30 mile 500kV transmission line from 
Cumberland to Montgomery. Achievement of this milestone shall be deemed to 
occur upon (i) Calvert having determined in its sole and absolute discretion 
that the overall project economics of its 510 MW generation facility are 
viable, and (ii) execution of an Interconnection Agreement between TVA and 
Calvert.

Exhibit B should read as follows:

The development and construction of a generating facility in cooperation with 
or partnership with certain distributors of the TVA (a "Development 
Project"). Any such Development Project shall initially be proposed by Wyatt 
or Sideview Partners, Inc.exclusively  to Enron. Enron shall have thirty(30) 
days to make a determination as to whether to proceed with any proposed 
Development Project. Enron shall not have any obligation to proceed with any 
Development Project. At such time as all definitive agreements related to the 
Development Project have been executed, the Development Project shall be 
deemed to be an approved Development Project (an "Approved Project"). For 
purposes of payment of the project fee, the milestone shall be deemed to be 
achieved, for Approved Projects only, 50% upon the commencement of 
construction of the Approved Project, and 50% upon commencement of commercial 
operation of the Approved Project. For the avoidance of doubt, a project fee 
shall not be payable for any Development Project unless it becomes an 
Approved Project as defined herein.  

I heard more about Viviana before I left London last week and apparently her 
concern she was'nt being properly guided or mentored- despite her apparent 
current performance and your  lack of time, I think we do owe her an action 
plan at mid-year at the latest and a decent opportunity to redeem herself. 
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. Thanks.

If this is who( Governor Davis) DGA and NDN chooses to support despite the 
fact that his lack of leadership has imposed  incalcuble pain and costs on 
California,  please remove me from your e-mail and any other  lists from here

February 26, 2001

I note that the HAWC and the Northeast Water Plant is on the Infrastructure 
Committee's agenda tomorrow at Houston City Council.

I am concerned about the proposed Azurix project with the Houston Area 
Water Corporation and the City of Houston. Two weeks ago I met with the 
Mayor and City Attorney on the Mayor's political business and they told me 
of their concern about the future of Azurix.  They wanted some assurance 
from Ken or Jeff that Azurix would be around as a part of Enron if it were 
awarded the Northeast Water Plant Project.  I believe they had some 
communications with Azurix officials but they really wanted to hear from 
someone at Enron.

I sent the word back to Enron through Joe, that someone high up should 
contract the Mayor and the City Attorney to give them whatever assurance 
they could concerning their concerns. I believe Joe discussed this with Steve.

Last Wednesday night I saw the Mayor and asked him if his request through 
me had any results.  Had he heard from Enron?  He said no, and that he 
needed to have some better feeling about the future of Azurix.

I assume we are working hard to get this project but based on my 
conversation I would think we need to give some communication to the Mayor 
from someone high up in the Enron organization.

George

I'm leaving at 1 o'clock- I don't know if that works or not.

Rick --

I am working with Chris, Mark Taylor and others to pull together the agenda 
and materials for Newsome's visit to Enron on March 6th.  Do you want to host 
Newsome?  Mark Taylor has offered to be the host if you're not available.

 It is critical to our nation's energy future  to achieve robust competition 
in wholesale power markets in order to ensure that electricity can move most  
effectively from where it is produced to where it is most needed. To that 
end, this Administration will strongly encourage the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission( FERC)  to actively exercise jurisdiction over all 
aspects of electricity transmission in interstate commerce and place all uses 
of the grid under the same rates, terms, and conditions.  This jurisdiction 
must also be extended by Congress to cover non-FERC jurisdictional power 
authorities.

the
Investors Group have been discussing with government officials.=20

 The second article is on the rationing situation which will result in cuts=
=20
of over 20%
over the next 6 months.

We are preparing a summary of the impacts on our business for discussion=20
with =20
you this week.

AES Suspends Brazil Investments
US-based power company AES Corp. has put on hold plans to invest between
US$2 billion and US$2.5 billion on energy projects in Brazil, alleging that=
=20
the
government=01,s policy on pricing is jeopardizing its operations.
AES President Dennis Bakke, on a brief visit to Brazil, said the company
suspended indefinitely its plans to build as many as 10 thermoelectric powe=
r
plants.
Bakke criticized Brazil's electricity sector regulator Aneel for maintainin=
g=20
an
energy policy that charged what Bakke said were ``unrealistically low price=
s=20
for
consumers,'' forcing AES to carry the burden of rising costs.
He said investments would remain on hold until the government came up with
a solution.
AES has already invested US$6 billion in Brazil, primarily in electricity
projects, making it one of the country's top private foreign investors.

Energy Blackouts To Begin June 1
The government announced Tuesday that it will begin a policy of programmed
blackouts starting June 1 as part of its energy rationing plan.
Mines and Energy Ministry officials had at first hoped to delay any blackou=
ts
until August, concentrating first on a program to induce consumers to reduc=
e
energy use. The critical level of reservoirs in the country=01,s main=20
hydroelectric
plants, however, forced Tuesday=01,s decision to accelerate the blackouts w=
hich=20
will
last until the end of November when the rainy season begins.
The blackouts will occur in the Southeast, Central-West and Northeast regio=
ns
of the country. At the same time the government will introduce a program=20
providing
incentives to consumers to reduce their energy use. The goal of the plan is=
=20
to lower
electricity consumption by 20%.
Although the general outline of the rationing plan was announced Tuesday, t=
he
details have yet to be worked out due to differences between the government
ministers who compose the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE). A new
meeting of CNPE was set for May 23 by which time it is hoped that an agreem=
ent
will have been reached on how to implement the plan.
The initial proposal from Mines and Energy was for a 15% reduction for
industry, 20% for residences and between 18% and 20% for commerce. The
ministries of finance, planning and development, however, asked for more ti=
me=20
to
consider the impact of the energy cuts.
The principal concern among government officials is with the impact on the
economy of the proposed blackouts. According to a study to be released toda=
y=20
by
the Get?lio Vargas Foundation, a 20% energy cut would slow economic growth =
by
1.5% of gross domestic product and would have a direct impact on 850,000 jo=
bs.
Production costs for industry would rise 1.5%, government tax receipts woul=
d
decline by R$6.6 billion (US$2.9 billion) and Brazil=01,s trade deficit wou=
ld=20
increase
by US$1.6 billion, according to the study. The study=01,s authors also said=
=20
there was
no guarantee that the effects of the program would be limited to this year.
Business leaders reacted with apprehension to the prospect of obligatory
blackouts. Most defended a policy of separate reduction goals for each=20
industrial
sector, sparing industries that depend heavily on electricity. The S?o Paul=
o=20
State
Federation of Industries (Fiesp) said that sectors who are major consumers =
of
energy such as steel should be exempted from any rationing.
While details were lacking in the government=01,s plan, officials said that=
 the
administration of the energy cuts would be placed in the hands of local=20
utilities
which would determine the locations and schedules for daily blackouts.=20
According
to national energy secretary Afonso Henriques, a 20% reduction in consumpti=
on
would amount to a cut of six hours a day.

Could each of you get me by next Friday( May 18,2001) a list of the top 5 
priorities for each of your respective areas....and, if, possible, a 
consensus document reflecting the top 8-10 priorities for the entire group? A 
brief description of each of the priorities would be appreciated with an 
attempt to quantify, where possible, the value associated with each of the 
priorities( either value potentially created or loss of value avoided). 
Thanks.

One additional point I should have mentioned on last e-mail...While it was 
good to spend this visit exclusively in the office, I want to find additional 
ways to contribute to the group during my future stays in the London office. 
If there are meetings outside the office, with regulators or others, where I 
could be of value, please let me know. I will try to give as much advance 
notice as possible of future stays in Europe. I'm feeling my way through this 
new role  and will be looking to the four of you for guidance, both as to 
where I can contribute and where I can't. Thanks.

Linda had no contact with Treasury...she will check around in early a:m.

Ideas on the horizon
Opportunities in your business unit for AA's 
The benifits of rotation in your business unit
An open Q&A session

These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have 
handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them 
ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current 
AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted

Steve--Thanks.  This paper sheds alot of light on why Cal. is problematic.  
Jeff, Jim S., and I talked about it today because of Kevin's desire to be 
able to float his entire position against the pool and the reg. group idea 
that some "penalty" or separate charge should be attributed to those that 
cause the big congestion (primarily because of the Cal. problem that day of 
is cheaper than day ahead due to the caps.)

Steve Walton

Christi,
 I found this to be a very interesting paper on the California Price Spikes.  
The conclusion is that price caps are infact creating part of the problem.

Thank You

Kevin Ruscitti was promoted to manager last review period.

I don't remember him.  Can you send his resume

Hunter:  John called Chris Williams today asking what was happening, so I 
returned his call and told him that I would check.  He interviewed with you 
and your group on 8/22/2000, and it appears that John may have been a 
candidate for your 4:00 am analyst position.   From our conversation today, I 
would guess that he was too experienced (and,thus,too expensive), but I don't 
know if there is yet another position I am not aware of.    Would you give me 
an update on his status so that I can call him back?

Dave-

Thank you for taking the time last week to speak at the floor meeting on 29.
I come from an engineering background and work in a financial reporting role 
for Andrea Reed.
I have found the transition from engineering to finance at Enron a natural 
one with my eye on details and
the analysis process.

I have attached Gwen Weddington's resume which I would like to pass on to the 
Fundamentals Group for the Gas Business,
which you mentioned is now being formed.
I think that she could be a valuable addition to Enron.
She is currently an Operations Manager at Air Products and Chemicals' 
Industrial Chemicals Group.

Can you tell me to whom I should forward this?

Thanks,

Carol

Dear Carol:

I appreciated the opportunity to speak with you on Friday.  As I mentioned,
I am pursuing other opportunities outside of my current position with Air
Products and Chemicals and have been intrigued with the things I have read
about Enron.  Also, part of my strategy is contacting a few friends who
might be kind enough to "keep their eyes open" and share thoughts and ideas
as to companies I should contact.

I was hoping that you might take a moment to review the enclosed resume.  As
you can see, I would like to find a position which will utilize my strong
operations background.  I would certainly enjoy another position as an
Operations Manager, but would be open to exploring new industries as well.
I am confident my strengths are applicable within a broad range of
industries.  Your suggestions and ideas as to companies to contact would be
very encouraging.  I am open to any avenues you suggest.

Additionally, I am interested in expanding my circle of acquaintances.  It
seems that you may, possibly, be able to provide me with a few select
introductions.  Any names of individuals who might be of help to me, or who
can direct me to others, would be greatly appreciated.  The more contacts I
make, the more opportunities I can uncover.

If you have any thoughts or ideas please jot them down.  I will contact you
again in a few weeks to discuss your ideas.  Thank you in advance for your
help.

Sincerely,

Gwen Weddington

The Associate and Analyst Recruiting Department will be conducting a number 
of two hour workshops to review our recruiting and interview process for the 
fall on-campus recruiting effort.  Critical information regarding our 
on-campus interview process, revised evaluation forms and program structure 
will be reviewed during these two hours sessions.

It is mandatory that all team members attend these workshops.  All team 
members must attend in order to articulate and demonstrate the Enron 
recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

recruiting process.  Knowing how busy schedules are, we have made 
arrangements to present these workshops in two hours sessions for a total of  
40 workshops that will run during the last week of August, through the month 
of September and end at mid October.

Listed below are the dates, location and times for each session.  Please 
select a date and time and e-mail this information to my assistant, Dolores 
Muzzy.  We can accommodate 25 participants at a time.  Dolores will take 
dates and times on a first come, first serve basis.  We have scheduled enough 
sessions to accommodate every member of both the Associate and Analyst 
recruiting teams.

In order to participate in the recruiting process, you must attend one of 
these sessions.  We will be tracking participation.  CPE credits will also be 
given for attending this workshop.

A fact is this summer the NE never got very hot.  Therefore the 
Great Lakes didn't heat up as much as normal. Argument is then that 
the cool fronts might be colder to the NE actual temps b/c of winds off 
the colder Lakes.  
Does the lake affect snow theory cover this or would this be the infamous
Shively Windchill Effect I used to hear so much about when on Central ??
May be the reverse will happen, please enlighten me if you know something...

It might be interesting to take a look at the historical water temps. of great
lakes historical vs current year, may be the Enron depth of research can 
investigate.

Here is the link, I haven't had the time to do it yet....

CERA is publishing some reports on their website that we should pay for and 
post on our website.  Enron may already have an account.  Here is an example 
that I scanned

Did some searches on the Internet and identified these resumes.  Any interest 
in any of them?  I have not contacted any of them regarding this position but 
will do so if there is any interest on your part.
Let me know your thoughts

Energy InfoDisc Release

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) has released
its latest quarterly CD-ROM, Energy InfoDisc, which is now
a two (2) disc product. Energy InfoDisc is a comprehensive,
high-tech product that is easy to use, yet robust enough
for serious number crunching and analysis.  It provides
fast, easy, and inexpensive access to:

- Historical time series for production, consumption,
prices, and resource availability of conventional and
alternate energy resources

- Analyses of economic and technical topics

- Projections of future energy supply, demand, and prices
database applications that allow users to generate their
own individualized energy databases

On disc 1, users may view and search more than 400 data,
analysis, and forecasting reports and directories
published by EIA over the previous 12 months, including
the Monthly Energy Review, Short-Term Energy Outlook,
International Energy Outlook, and Country Analysis Briefs.
On disc 2, users may access EIA's extensive energy
database applications to generate their own individualized
energy databases.  Among the EIA database applications
contained on the Energy InfoDisc:

Annual Energy Outlook 2000
Electricity Databases
Oil and Gas Information System
Short-Term Energy Model
State Energy Data
U.S. Emissions of Greenhouse Gases
World Energy Database

Each new quarterly issue highlights new products and any
changes or enhancements to the CD. Energy InfoDisc contains
information on special industry topics such as the
restructuring of the electric power industry and greenhouse
gases and global warming.  Publications are displayed in
Portable Document Format (PDF). Most of the energy database
applications are written in Microsoft Access. The Microsoft
Access run-time engines required for these applications are
included.

Energy InfoDisc is issued quarterly. STAT-USA, a U.S.
Department of Commerce information service for business,
economic, and trade professionals, distributes EnergyInfoDisc,
through a cooperative agreement with EIA.  Orders can be
placed over STAT-USA's toll free order number: 1-800-STAT-USA
or by calling (202) 482-1986.  Energy InfoDisc can also be
purchased through the National Technical Information Service
(NTIS). NTIS is the federal government's central source for
the sale of scientific, technical, engineering, and related
business information produced by or for the U.S. government
and complementary material from international sources.  To
place an order by phone, call 1-800-553-NTIS (6847) or

Brent,
?
There is a way to stop the gain control from  automatically adjusting. The 
parameter that needs to be modified in?the  html file is UseAutoGainControl. 
It needs to be set to FALSE. This will stop the  volume from going down on 
Hunter's and Patrice's clients.
?
Darshan.
?
?
?
You might try turning off AGC (set  UseAutoGainControl to FALSE) in the 
HTML.? This should stop the mic volume  from changing.? Also check if AGC is 
set in the sound card.
?
Corey
?
?
?
?
Darshan,
?
Perhaps:
??? if the client is set such that the  property
???????  UseAutoGainControl=TRUE
??? then the client is attempting to adjust the microphone level  
automatically.
??? A guess on my part is that if the sound card is somehow unable  to 
automatically adjust the mike level, then an error such as the one described  
could occur (?).
?
??? Could this be the case here?

Hunter-

Thanks for letting me show you the Gas Model. I want you to know I will 
always go out of my way to help you and your traders develop and use good 
models.

I need tools, and Kevin has been fantastic supporting with these. He's alread 
bought a $25,000 Sun server to be dedicated to real-time mathematical models.

Can  I can tentatively count you "in" on the SAS software. Our current 
license expires Sep. 14 (ie, soon), and I need to knowing where a total of 
$40,000 is coming from. As it turns out, I "need" to count on Gas for around 
$15,000, which I note is a lower price to you for unlimited user access than 
you would pay for a single-workstation SAS PC license. Remember, not only are 
many of the calculations you need  too big for Excel, my own Gas Model will 
run in SAS and will be available to you. And, Carmen Ayala in Contract 
Administration, will support you every step of the way here, since her 
assignment is to wean Enron from an obscenely expensive emerging addiction to 
SAS-PC

I'm sorry to have to bug you like this, but I have a deadline staring me in 
the face.

Clayton

Please mark you calendars for Thursday August 10th for the Alliance Meeting.  
This meeting will be all day.  The location will be EB32C2.  Please let me 
know if you have any questions.

Thank you,
Lynn

I will send you updates

I have the same problem as Patrice

The control automatically sets the volume to the optimal level when you use
the mic to eliminate unwanted noise and static. I had Patrice go to our
corporate demo site and speak for a few minutes. We did not hear her volume
go down. I was logged in on my PC and I also dialed in with my cell phone to
see if I could notice anything abnormal. But, she sounded fine. The other
thing is that, according to Patrice, she is the only one having this problem
with her volume going down which is why I am gravitating towards a localized
problem.

Brent: I will be back in the office tomorrow morning. Can you spare some
time?

Thanks.
Darshan.

Issue#1)

It is not the physical microphone that is having the problem.  The microphone 
volume on the software declines as the speaker talks.

Hunter,

Please see comments below....

Does this happen using different microphones?
Brent: Can you swap the mic of an affected user and see if this persists?

I forwarded this request to our Product Marketing group. We have had this
request from other users as well. I will keep you updated on the response.

> 3) We have trouble with latency.
>

I spoke with Brent briefly a few moments ago and suggested changing the
jitter buffer value to 1. If the speech becomes choppy then we will have to
revert to 2 and put in a sniffer on the route to see if there is anything
hardware-wise that may be affecting the data throughput.

1) When some of the members of the chat room begin to talk, their microphone

2) Many of the users use the ctrl button in their daily activities.  The talk

The Electronic Commerce team is working with Marketing Operations and

critical step in this process is creation of a database.

I would like to schedule a quick 30 minute meeting to discuss creation of 
this database and ensure all potential interfacing groups are in the loop.

 * Review Objectives
 * Determine best database   -   Oracle or Sybase
 * Set Priority for DA's

Please let me know if you are not able to attend.

  -  This is not the file that will be given to DA's, but gives you a basic

It is ENA's standard language which includes language relating to being able

different language in any master including GISB.

Did you take care of this?

Please let me know the names of the internal traders who will need execute

Are you going to want a separate risk book for these transactions and will we 
want this set up on EOL?

Thanks for your help.

demand which will take place Wednesday July 12 at 2:15 in the big boardroom 
on the 30th floor. I would encourage everyone to come and bring any traders 
that you think would benefit from it.

Sounds good....marty mare knows where to get them as well.

See you Monday

Jeff,
Can you take just a couple of minutes to share with  me the level of 
experience these MI and WI cash traders need to be. I have  several junior

I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.  This may 
help you prepare for Thursday.

Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this 
production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily 
load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 
55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal 
differences in load.

Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However 
these states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume 
more gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the 
regional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and 
move gas to the areas of greatest demand.

Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if 
the daily production is growing or shrinking.  

Very simplistic, but maybe it helps.
Hunter

how did this go?

Thomas Araujo @ ENRON

06/21/2000 09:41 AM
I  spoke with some of you concerning the Market Knowledge Management (MKM) 
project.  At this time, we would like to demonstrate the MKM pilot  to you.

To refresh your minds, MKM is a one-stop shopping for market data and 
associated activities.  The project is done in collaboration between two 
groups in Houston and one in London.  In November/December 1999 some of you 
took part in user forums to discuss the feasibility of a one-stop shop for 
market data

Background:
The intention is that all existing systems (i.e. various databases and 
services) will be linked through a common infrastructure that will allow all 
these systems to provide the services they have always provided plus a set of 
standard services, such as:
Security
Data Validation
Notification
Auditing, and 
Calculation.

In addition, it will allow client applications to ask MKM for the data and 
services they need instead of going to individual systems.  The point here is 
that the user (or application) 
will not need to know where the data resides, and
will have a uniform level of services across all systems

Demonstration:
A pilot was developed to prove the underlying technology and to provide users 
a simple demonstration of the product to derive exact user requirements.

The demo will include the following components:

Browser: provides a user interface for publishing and retrieving a limited 
selection of price and volume data for gas and power busines units;
Time Series Index: stores time series metadata;
Message Station: an inbox which holds inbound time series data;
TIBCO messaging backbone: underpins MKM and is transparent to the user;
and Connectivity to two market data servers:- LIM (Houston) and PR1P(London).

The remaining components will be delivered in following phases.

I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to demo of the product.  
I would like to schedule the demonstration for Friday, June 23 at 1:00.  
Could you also RSVP me.  I am also attaching a document which will give you 
more information of the MKM project.    If you cannot meet me on the 
suggested date, I can you a demo of MKM at your desk at your convenience.  If 
you would like to go through the browser, the web address is 
http://test-mkmtimeseriesindex.enron.co.uk/default.asp?canregister=true.  Use 
your network id and password to gain access to the web site.  If you have any 
questions please call me at 35733.

Thank you in advance,
Thomas

I don't remember if I told you that Fletch and I will be playing golf on 
Saturday morning.

Thank You

Has the deal between you and Patrice been booked?

Richard Tomaski@ENRON
06/13/2000 05:37 PM
After discussion with Patrice, here is the finalized agreement for the 
day-ahead purchase deal (between ENA-central desk and EMW) for the Wilton 
Plant. 

Location:  Northern Border (Wilton) to become MEH pooling point
Price:        GD chicago large end-users plus $.015 or GD northern border 
chicago point if one becomes available
Term:        6/1/2000 thru 9/30/2004
Volume:  0-75,000 mmbtu/daty
Notification: by 9:15 am of trade date

Any volumes greater than 75,000 up to 120,000 will be priced at Patrice's 
purchase price plus $.015 

I will draft a simple letter for both parties to sign, as a matter of record 
keeping.  Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks

Richard

great

The two canadian points (Dawn and Niagara) are quoted in US dollars so a 
basis can be calculated.  We also need to add NIT (AECO).  John McKay manages 
this product.  He should know the hours of trading and which day should be 
selected for index calculation.

Hunter

has anyone notified EOL of our flip-out choice.  I think the product would 
work like this:

Chic - Peoples      June one day withdrawal / July ratable 
injection                      .015 bid     .025 offer
Chic - Peoples      June balance of month withdrawal / July ratable 
injection    .015 bid     .025 offer

I think the rest of month would be more popular but we should give both a 
try.  Also we need to work on an auto hedge feature for the Chicago office.

call me

thanks

book it

EOL and Peoples transaction explain year and quarter.  The biggest reason is 
EOL.  I think the month to date numbers are up because we are experiencing an 
increase in EOL trading in the Gulf Coast Region.  Let me know if you need 
more info.

EOL and Peoples

where did you get your copy of Green Markets?
Hunter

The first product looks good.  We need to consider having one product for 
parks and loans.  I think we should make a market in this product.  Let me 
know what you think.  Has Laura decided which organization will flip the 
deals?

Please call me (34772).   Where did you obtain your information?

Should we have an explanation of index calculation?  It may build more trust 
in the numbers.

The page is missing the gas flow date and the numbers require only three 
decimal points.  We need to add Canada numbers.  Also is it possible to make 
the basis column more straight? 

I don't know if you read your email so I am forwarding this to you.

going to pursue the project.

How are ya?

Has someone in NetWorks looked at this issue?

Thanks
Hunter

I would like to see the composite.  I think my home computer has logon access 
through the firewall.

I think that if a product does not trade for a day, we do not post the 
product the index or product description in the index page.  I think the 
index calculation hours should be 7:30 a.m. to 12:00 a.m.   How fast can the 
index page be calculated and posted?

Before we publish this we need to calc the index for a few days.  We need to 
feel confident that the index is calculating correctly.  You can reach me at

Today (06-15-2000) I reiterated to Theresa on a recorded telephone that she 
must be profitable in the second half of the year.  I believe that my exact 
statement was "If you are not profitable the next months we are going to have 
another talk".  After thinking about it afterwards, this statement is 
probably too vague.  Do I need to clarify this statement?  Should I define 
the exact amount of profit?  Should I explicitly say that I will ask her to 
leave the group?  Your help would be appreciated.

Hunter

I have attached how I would do it.  check out the red comment marks.  Do not 
add day ahead + 1
I leave for Portland around 4:00

Any more documentation on this deal?

Midwestern Gas Transmission
5/18/00 - Midwestern filed notice of a negotiated rate deal with Dynegy.  It 
provides for a monthly reservation charge of $.025/dth and a tiered indexed 
commodity rate based on spreads.  If the index spread is less than or equal 
to $.02, then the daily commodity rate shall be $.01.  If the index spread is 
greater than $.02 but less than $.10, then the rate shall be 50% of the 
spread.  If the index spread is greater than $.10, then the rate shall be 
$.05 plus 75% of the spread exceeding $.10.  The deal is effective 5/1/00 
through 10/31/00.

Dave Forster from Eol may be calling you.  I am trying to get the Hub online 
and I am having trouble because Enron does not own more than 50% of the 
Midwest Hub.  An EOL lawyer may have found a solution.  I have asked Dave to 
call you.  I wanted to give you a heads up.  

Thanks
Hunter

I talked to Louise and she said that Mark Taylor had the following idea.  If 
the Chicago office signs an agreement that binds the Chicago office to every 
"Midwest Hub" deal on EOL then we could avoid the PA and ETA.  I believe the 
Chicago office is on the network so the stack manager should not be a 
problem.  Louise said that she would have someone call Laura Luce.  Laura 
manages the Chicago office and is the person that would authorize the above 
agreement.

Thanks
Hunter

can you redo with day + 1 products only?  Also can you display the data

Thanks

we will need to do it after work sometime.  Let me know

agreed

I feel like such a heel.  There is a hidden pocket in my computer bag and I 
had placed my phone and flight info in this pocket.  Thank you for continuing 
to look for the phone.  I am embarrassed.

I had a meeting with Beth today.  I feel that it did not go well.  I asked 
for an IT person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn 
the fundamentals.  I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group 
to learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the 
front-end.  She did not like that idea.  Her proposal is that an IT person 
can sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants 
front-end production to be handled by her group.  

We ended the meeting with no resolution and we will meet again tomorrow.  It 
seems to me that if we don't have free access to the website or database, the 
group will suffer.  I will follow up tomorrow.

I am glad to hear your search is going well.  It sounds like you are on the 
right track.

Jason:

I was confronted this morning by Mark DiValero and he expressed his concern 
over ENA's nominations over the last two weeks.  He said that PGL is not 
staffed to confirm all 4 cycles of the nomination process and that ENA will 
start to get cut after the 2nd cycle if nominations are not correct.

I told Mark that I would get back with him early next week and let him know 
why ENA has had to consistently make changes at every nomination cycle.  
Also, please inform your schedulers of the risk that they are taking if 
nominations are not correct after the 2nd cycle (especially on weekends!).  

Please talk to your schedulers and let me know why we can't get our 
nominations correct.  Thanks!!

What is the latest on the EOL feeds.  I talked to Dave last week and he 
indicated it was no problem.  I have a meeting with him today at 2:30.  Let 
me know what I need to tell him.  Also, what is the latest with the late 
nominations.  I talked to Jason and he told him it was due to producers 
changing their noms.  I have not talked to George about this issue.  Jason 
also thinks that the problem is shorter lived that PGL&C has indicated.  
Please write back with PGL&C's position on the matter.

The next meeting regarding EOL capacity trading will be held on Friday, June 
9th in EB3321 from 11:00 am to 12:30 p.m.  There is a NYMEX screen in this 
conference room, and lunch will be provided.  Please advise if you are unable 
to attend.
Topics for discussion are:  
- Discuss limitation of pipelines/paths to be initially provided on EOL.  
Capacity traders should know which paths are the most desired from a trading 
standpoint,  along with the tradability of the capacity on those pipelines.
- Position reporting--Each of the capacity traders should be prepared to talk 
about ideas for handling position reporting for their difficult pipelines.
 Judy--TETCO; Dan--Tennessee; Chris--TCO; Theresa-ANR; Jane/Kim - ???
- Bob Superty will give an update on the technical aspect of tying into 
pipeline EBBs, and other Logistics issues related to EOL capacity trading.

	
	

Okay - let's try this again.  The meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, 
at 2:30 p.m. in room EB3125B.  I know that there are some conflicts with this 
time, but it's the closest time slot that is convenient for all.

If you can think of any more let me know.  Can we implement the security this 
week?

The "banned" users should now be unable to view the site in development or 
production.

Dave

Ok, Done.

Just an FYI for WebOps:  gasfundy.dev.corp.enron.com and 
gasfundy.corp.enron.com have a special group named 
"Corp\Web_GasfundyBanned".  This group is added at the wwwroot level and deny 
all is selected.  This will allow David and his group to deny access to the 
gasfundy site to a small group of users.

Thank you,

I confirmed that this does work, could we please remove Colin from that 
group, and put the same restriction on the production server?

Thanks,

David Dronet

You will have to close your browser and maybe even log out of your machine 
before the change will take place.

I just tried and I can access both prod and dev.

Colin

Colin has is now a part of the group.  Please test and let me know when to go 
forward.

Chris

Could we add colin tonks to that group for testing purposes?

Thanks

Ok, it is done on the dev site, please verify that the site is running as 
intended, and once I receive word of this, I will do the same on production.

Chris,

 I was just wondering if we had proceeded with this.

Thanks,

David Dronet

Actually, I mean the root web, everything but the virtual directories.

Ok, could we create a group called GasFundy_banned or something, and put 
these users in it?  They
would be denied access to the root of http://gasfundy.corp.enron.com and 
http://gasfundy.dev.corp.enron.com

No, but you could give us a list and we could create a group for them.  Will 
they be denied access to the entire site, or just some portions?

Hmm,  I've got a unique situation where there are a group of ex-gas traders 
they need to block from our gas site.  I don't know of a common group
they belong to but could we not implicitly deny them on an individual basis?

Thanks,

Dave

Not easily.  We could explicitly deny access to certain groups, but many 
times this results in unintended users being restricted because of unexpected 
group memberships.  Deny will always overrule allow, but it can cause quite a 
few problems over time.

Is it possible to deny certain users access to a site even if Everyone is the 
blanket access for that site?

As we discussed, my new boss, TJ Aruffo is interested in a tour of Enron's
Houston Trade Floor.  He is available the morning of the 1st.  He is flying
out of Intercontinental at 2:45 PM.  As far as I know he will be travelling
alone.  He  has not requested my presence yet.

The purpose of his visit is to see first-hand a world-class energy trade
floor and to begin networking with key industry personnel.  He is new to
this side of the business.  His previous role was NiSource CIO; so he comes
into his new position with a systems and process oriented view.   His
responsibilities at NiSource encompass the regulated gas supply management
and gas control operations of eight of NiSource's gas utilities (two are
primarily managed by EnergyUSA-TPC - NIFL and Kokomo).  He is responsible
for Bay State (and Northern Utilities), NIPSCO, and the Columbia
Distribution Companies (five LDC's).  We are currently fragmented in
Massachusetts, Columbus and Indiana and are in the process of evaluating how
to bring this together, functionally, locationally, or not at all.  TJ
reports to Pat Mulchay, who is President of the Merchant Energy Division.
Pat reports directly to Gary Neale, our CEO.

TJ's previous background includes a stint at Fidelity Investments, so a
trade floor is not new to him.

Please confirm Enron's address and if you don't mind, recommend a hotel that
is convenient.  Let me know who will be meeting TJ then we can  turn the
details of finalizing the arrangements over to TJ and your designee.  Thanks
for your help.

Jim--please take a look at these articles that will come out in the Crains 
magazine tomorrow.  You'll see that there are both opportunities and potholes 
for us on this issue.    It is very likely that we will get sucked into this 
debate----the ENA/ Peoples deal which has generally floated under the 
regulatory radar in the past is inevitably going to become more prominent. 
(Evidence even before these articles is that I received a call from the ICC 
staff late last week asking if we could participate in an ICC meeting on 
natural gas issue on Jan 23).  

The articles (and the gossip that I have heard in the past few weeks) point 
out that Peoples is in hot water politically--I would hate to see us dragged 
into that sesspool.  On the other hand, if ENA sees significant business 
opportunities that could be opened up to them in Illinois by a change in the 
regulatory climate, this could be the time to make the play....while the 
issue is hot and there may be pressure on the ICC to take some steps that 
they normally would not.

I'd appreciate it if we could plan a call to talk about strategy on 
Illinois.  I am going to have to give a response to ICC on Tuesday and we 
will need to determine who would particpate in the meeting at the ICC.  Roy 
and I had put in a call to Laura Luce last Thursday to discuss the request 
from the ICC...I have not heard back from her, but Roy may have.  

Are you available on Tuesday for a conference call?

Sue & Roy -- We thought that you would find the attached articles regarding
the high natural gas prices in Illinois to be of interest.  

To solve gas bill crisis, turn heat up on Peoples
Crain's Editorial - January 15, 2001
Considering the finger-pointing that's going on between politicians,
regulators and Peoples Energy Corp. executives, one thing is becoming
obvious: Fixing blame for the recent astronomical rise in natural gas prices
is much simpler than fixing the problem.
Nonetheless, all of these factions bear some responsibility for this
winter's monthly home heating bills, which, for many residents, are soaring
by hundreds of dollars over last winter's tabs. Each of these groups should
be held accountable for working to devise systems and strategies designed to
blunt future price spikes.
Make no mistake about it, this crisis will not melt away with the spring
thaw. Limited natural gas supplies and increased demand will continue to
pump up bills, rattle price stability and, along with other climbing energy
rates, become the economy's unwelcome "X" factor.
The weight of dealing with these pressures rests with the utilities,
especially Peoples Energy, the city's natural gas provider. To start with,
the utility's management must protect customers by anticipating escalating
demand, hedging risk and locking in gas prices when it can.
These are common business practices, used by corporations and even some
conservative utilities. In Michigan, for example, gas providers charge fixed
rates to customers and hedge their risk by purchasing gas years in advance
under long-term supply contracts. Right now, Michigan pays 29 cents per
therm, compared with the Chicago area's whopping 98 cents.
Peoples argues that it tried to lock in prices but was shot down when it
could not reach an agreement with the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC),
which regulates the utility, on what the fixed rate should be. In walking
away from the deal, Peoples left customers with the current rate system and
dumped the burden of price fluctuations onto them.
In essence, instead of managing risk, it put its customer base at risk.
Considering that decision and the subsequent fallout, critics are asking
whether Peoples, a regulated monopoly designed to profit from the public's
needs, is acting in the best interest of its customers. Those paying heating
bills - which in some cases are as much as 300% higher than last winter's -
are right to say no, as is Mayor Richard Daley, who's outraged at Peoples.
More troubling are concerns that Peoples management may not be up to the
challenge of resolving this crisis, especially if its recent handling of the
political fallout is an indication. The company acts as if the public has no
right to question its tactics or motivations. And when the Chicago City
Council held a public hearing about the heating bills issue last week,
Peoples Energy Chairman Richard Terry didn't show up.
At these prices, it's not asking too much for the chairman of the gas
utility to explain his company's position. That's not a job meant for a
public relations executive or a consultant, who were among the Peoples
advocates who actually did attend the council hearing.
The ICC shoulders its share of the blame, too. It should have more zealously
monitored the gas supply situation and the utility's plans. Now, the
commission is playing catch-up by holding an investigation into what Peoples
knew about the soaring gas prices and when it knew it.
Let's get an answer to that important question and find out once and for all
if there is price-gouging going on.
Just as critical, however, is the need to foster a statewide regulatory
environment that encourages gas utilities to use more hedging, storing and
price-control strategies. If there is any ambiguity in state law about the
utility's ability to do this, then the General Assembly should change the
rules and open up the process.
Peoples management, regulators and politicians must get beyond the blame
game and find a way to better insulate the public from surprise spikes in
energy prices.
Otherwise, we're all just burning money.

Gas flare-up gives city hot idea: Become a utility
But co-ops mean high risks, mild rewards

Utility man: William Abolt, head of Chicago's Department of the Environment,
is examining ways to cut residents' natural gas bills. One option: opening a
city-owned buying co-op. Photo: Steve Leonard   
January 15, 2001
By Steve Daniels <mailto:sdaniels@crain.com>
It's easier said than done.
That's something an angry and frustrated Mayor Richard Daley is about to
learn as his staff begins investigating plans to take on some gas-purchasing
duties on behalf of city residents.
Mr. Daley is livid over what he contends is Peoples Energy Corp.'s failure
to anticipate the rising cost of natural gas, to mitigate a huge run-up in
residents' monthly heating bills this winter. He thinks the city can aid
bill-payers, and punish Peoples, by developing a system that will funnel
lower-cost gas to ratepayers.
But the track record of other municipal gas utilities, or buying
cooperatives, shows that such a system isn't likely to achieve more than
modest rate savings unless the city is willing to take on significant
financial risks.
To protect against the kind of price spikes that have hit customers this
winter, the city would have to buy futures, or long-term contracts, that
could leave it exposed if prices were to decline substantially.
In addition, the city would have to contend with thorny issues such as the
collection of overdue bills and potential cutoffs of service to non-paying
customers - activities for which municipalities are ill-suited.
Despite the risks, utility critics contend that city intervention is
appropriate.
"It's a creative approach, and we need those," says Martin R. Cohen,
executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer watchdog group.
"These are extreme times, and innovative approaches are called for."
Most municipalities that have gotten into the gas-buying business have been
unwilling to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts that can shield
consumers against the sort of price spikes that have sent this year's
home-heating bills soaring nearly 300% compared with last year's. That's
because such arrangements can boomerang on customers, locking them into
higher-than-market gas costs if prices fall.
New York experience
"We wrestled with this: Should government really be in this business?" says
David Fountaine, village administrator in Hamburg, N.Y., a suburb of Buffalo
that formed a buying group for its residents in April 1999. "In our case, by
being in it, we've helped our residents."
Hamburg and nearby Sloan, N.Y., together hired a unit of Texaco Inc. to
supply gas to residents who signed up for the communities' program. New York
opened its natural gas market to competition five years ago, so residents
can choose either to remain with their gas utility or select an outside
marketer.
About one-third of Hamburg's 3,300 households buy gas from the village.
Those residents' gas bills last winter were 8% lower than the bills of
households that stayed with Buffalo gas utility National Fuel Gas Co. Last
month, when gas prices shot up, the village's price was 15% lower than the
utility's.
But Mr. Fountaine says the village takes no outsized risks, making no
long-term bets on the direction of gas prices. Rather, it simply relies on
its contractor to manage gas supplies as efficiently as possible.
Chicago officials are looking at programs like the one in the Buffalo area,
but also may be willing to take bigger risks to achieve greater savings.
"We know there are a lot of relatively new risk-management techniques being
used by large (natural gas) consumers," says William Abolt, commissioner of
the city's Department of Environment. "We want to know, what does the
industry do to manage (price) risk? That's what the reasonable company does,
but that's not what the local gas company does."
City officials need look no further than Downstate, where the Illinois
Municipal Gas Agency buys natural gas on behalf of 20 communities that
provide monopoly gas service to their residents. Last September, the agency
locked in prices for 50% to 75% of their customers' winter gas needs,
rolling with the market for the remainder.
That strategy is serving the agency's customers well. They're paying around
70 cents per therm - the measurement the gas industry uses for billing -
this month, compared with the 98 cents per therm that Peoples is charging
Chicago-area customers.
"There's no reason why investor-owned utilities couldn't do the same thing,"
says John Bell, the Municipal Gas Agency's general manager. "I think (a city
program) is a viable alternative if they don't like what they've got."
For its part, Peoples supports the city's desire to become involved in the
market. The move poses no threat to the utility because it doesn't profit on
gas purchases and still would make money on the delivery of the gas to
customers.
Meanwhile, the city is just beginning to consider alternatives. Although Mr.
Abolt says no system will be developed in time to help Chicagoans during
this trying season, a program most likely will be launched next winter.
Weighing the risks
The city's top priority will be to help low-income residents most vulnerable
to escalating heating bills, but all Chicago residents might be able to
choose between the city's program or remaining with Peoples. And one
possibility being considered would enable residents to choose either a fixed
price for gas before winter starts or rates that rise and fall with the
market.
While a fixed-price approach certainly looks good in hindsight right now, it
can have a downside if not managed properly.
In the Buffalo area, the two major private gas marketers offering fixed
prices to households recently dropped out of the residential market, forcing
some 23,000 customers to scramble back to the local utility for gas service.
To meet the unanticipated demand, the utility was forced to purchase gas on
the sky-high spot market.
It just such risks that Chicago officials are weighing. Says Mr. Abolt:
"This is not an overnight thing. You don't just snap your fingers and it
happens."

Dear Admins,
Please help!!
In an effort to receive correct EPSC & EIS invoices for January, we need to 
ensure that Joann Holloway has correct Cost Center and location information 
for all employees in the various gas teams.  I am attaching a file with 
employees and cost centers which was used by HR to make the "mass" change to 
the new cost centers after the reorg.  I would appreciate each of your help 
in dropping in Locations for each of the persons in the cost centers you are 
responsible for.
In addition, please check the position field for each person also, as I would 
like to be sure I have correct information on a

The questions that Gas Daily is receiving most likely pertain to the issue 
that Nicor was closed on Friday but the weekend index published substantially 
different from the Thursday index.  We did not transact at Nicor City Gate on 
Friday and did not submit a change in trades to Gas Daily.  I will discuss 
this with you tomorrow.

On December 21, 2000,  I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for gas 
flow on  December 22-26, 2000.

The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of 
$15.76.   This price was increased to $16.00 to encompass trades transacted 
via the telephone. 

The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:

Nicor Gas Company was closed for  their company holiday on Friday, December 
22nd.  As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for  the December 
22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 
22-26 time period.  Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 
22nd (even though they were closed)  for the December 23-26 time period, 
which resulted in a $13.88 posting for the December 23-26th period.  I 
received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing 
concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal 
activity that transacted on December 22nd.  

My practice is to take the price as reported on Enron Online.  On occasions 
there will be significant volumes transacted over the telephone that will 
impact the Enron Online price.  Due to timeliness of sending the price 
report, my volume is overstated, as opposed to intentionally reporting 
erroneous information.

Please ensure that this get's on eveyone's calendar.  Tom has also requested 
this event.

Happy Holidays,

Laura

I just spoke with Bill Morrow and he has a request.  Peoples is holding their 
April 4th Board of Directors meeting in Houston to highlight their production 
business.  Tom Patrick would like Enron to give the Board members a tour of 
our trading operations sometime between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.  He has also 
suggested that we provide an update of enovate as another agenda item.  I 
realize this is very advance notice, but I thought I would give you both 
heads up so that you could try to hold this time open on your calendars. 

Thanks - Gregg

The Peoples Energy Project is Currently On the Public Internet.  The version 
that has been released is not in its final phase.  
Many of the rules of the business have to be tested and changed to reflect 
the correct data representation.  The only way 
for us to do this is to have the current users who will be using the system 
to verify the correctness of the data.  Due to this fact, it 
is not recommended that this system be used for trading purposes until the 
portion of the system being worked on is verified to 
be in fact correct in its representation of the data.  It is still imperitive 
that  this system is viewed daily for its correctness, validation, 
fault tolerance and efficiency on a daily basis, for this is where we devise 
our metrics on the systems completeness.  

Currently there is a new update version of the application that resides in 
Chicago that delivers the data to the website.
Our current contact has been sent to a training in Canada and will not be 
available until Jan 20, 2001.  Due to this I would like to set up a meeting
to:

 Application Status Report
  1. Show the Parts of the application that currently are ready to be used
  2. Discuss the portions of the application that are currently in "Beta" 
(not ready)
  3. Discuss a testing process to bring these portions up to Production 
Status (ready for usage)

 Evaluate Current Project
  1. Does the project currently meet customer needs
  2.  Additions / Changes to fit needs
  3. Business Rules Changes
 
 Customer 
  1. Customer Site Feedback
  2. Developer / Management Feedback 
  3. Outstanding Issues

Hunter,

I wanted your opinion on how to respond to the following e-mail.  It sounds 
like Caroline Abramo is sharing some of Mike's research and the Fundamentals 
research with some of the hedge funds.  Do we want to keep sending her the 
information or limit it to certain pieces of research.  Do we make any/enough 
money off of their business to provide them with our internal research?  I 
have told her in the past that the quarterly production numbers that we 
provide are for internal use only, but it sounds like some of the information 
is going outside of Enron.  Let me know what you think.

Chris   
Caroline Abramo

Chris - this is feedback on Elena's sheets - the ones she puts together as 
part of Mike Robert's Monday package.  I think they have real potential to be 
very valuable but we could use a bit more digging on them- the feedback is 
from Dwight Anderson at Tudor who has been in the commodity markets for years 
and who has a very fundamental approach to his positions- one of his major 
tenants is that industrials (chemicals) can not produce at above $7 gas - he 
has done in-depth analysis of this and probably has a number in mind for how 
much comes onto the market at these levels- I will try to ascertain. He also 
wholeheartedly believes that more production will come in 02 and will see 
prices go below current levels- I know Sachin is working on the production 
numbers- it would like to see us project these out a bit further and have the 
historical production data as well - in order to see how extreme the changes 
in production have been.

The info that the funds share with us is very privileged - we generally do 
not share it with many people- I'd like to include you on discussions so that 
we can help them with their views as well as ours to bang out better trading 
strategies

Unfortunately, I have not been able to get into the fundamental site in NY 
but I am working on it.  I am sure a lot of this info is up there.

what do the ally cutbacks mean in mcf per day
what is the impact of the integrated steel plants running at 70% of capacity
(number released weekly) mean to power demand and hence demand for nat gas
what is going on re. nat gas liquids being stripped out? i.e. dynegy and
mitchell etc. have all announced full or partial closures of stripping
facilities as economics aren't there.  someone shld be tracking what this
means in mcf per day
why won't utilities give you utilization of plants by fuel type, as they do
in nuclear, so you can track power demand by fuel type
how much nat gas demand is being lost cuz nat gas ethylene producers have
shut down as margins are too low vs. their naptha based competitors.  etc.
etc.
where do we stand on switching vs. resid, diesel etc. etc.

i could go on, but i think i've made my point; what is in the report is
good, but it's incomplete and not totaled with some summary conclusions.
it's only the very easy, first derivative demands/closures.  it could add
real value by looking for alternative data points that aren't as easily
tracked by the market.

D- not sure if we ever showed this to you- once a week we update all the
plant closures for ammonia, methanol, and aluminium smelters and the
resulting gas and power that's back on the market.  these pages are in back
of the weather.  please let me know what you think of these- elena, our
analyst in houston is always looking for feedback which is hard to get
because the report only circulates internally.

Have we contacted GRE?

Janet Bowers@ENRON
01/02/2001 04:05 PM
Chris & Kelli,  I just wanted to clarify that GRE's actual testing is 
scheduled to begin in March, and this Sunday is a one-day deal for them to 
blow down their turbines.  The powerpak deal that we have with them is for 
the testing period of March and April.  I have talked with our Storage team 
regarding putting the gas in on Friday and Saturday of this week and pulling 
out on Sunday but they are really tight and aren't sure they can handle it.  
Is there any way that we can buy the 4500 MMBtu for Sunday only? And, if so, 
what is the cost differential?  Thanks!

Janet
x-7141

   

Kelli - the GRE deal is set to begin in May (per the long-term agreement).  
The interconnect is complete and testing will begin this coming Sunday.  GRE 
is responsible for noms during testing.  (As you may recall, ENA will be 
responsible for noms to storage once the deal begins.)  GRE wishes to buy 
4,500 MMBtu for this coming weekend. This purchase is not covered under the 
long-term gas deal; therefore, I presume you'll show GRE an offer at  Demarc 
or Ventura

Your contact (during testing) will be Janet Bowers (Omaha x7141).  

Please give Janet a call to arrange this weekends gas supply.  We may be able 
to sell/deliver the 4,500  on Thursday or Friday.

Janet -  Kelli can be reached at (713) 853-1828.

I know coordinating these moves is a real pain, but we have 4 commercial 
individuals that need to be sitting at the East gas desk: Frank Vickers, Gil 
Muhl, Phil Demoes, David Jones. Effective Jan. 1, they are part of the East 
gas team, and it's critical they sit with them. Could you get with Scott and 
Hunter and see what else can be done? Thanks.

Ina,

Have you made other arrangements for Frank's group or do we need to get 
together and try to come up with a "quick fix"?  I know before when I was up 
there inquiring about this, you had said that you were working on this same 
request for Scott Neal, so I wanted to check with you first before doing 
anything.

   Lorie, 

   Adam is on the churn for tonite.  However...Colin Tonks has laid claimed 
for those spaces with Hunter Shively's approval. 

   Also, thought you might need to know that with Adam's departure, that 
makes only three desks available (3247c,d and e). 

   3247a & b are currently being occupied by employees of Chris Gaskill with 
no plans to move to the best of my knowledge. 

    This of course, still leaves Kim Brown looking for (3) spaces on 32.   

   Additionally,  regarding Brenda Herod, her final count is (30) 
consultants, (26) current employees and (9) to be hired in January.  

  Please let me know if I can be of further assistance, 
  Heather, x33278

Is Adam's group on the churn for tonight?  Does this mean the spaces will 
become available to Frank Vickers and others after tonight?

  Per Marcie's email below, Adam Plager and his group will be moving out of

  on 32 and will be moving to 25.  

  I will follow-up with Marcie and make sure she knows there is space 
reserved for them on the 1/2/01 churn.

  Marcy,  

  Today,  Adam Plager was asked to find a space off of the 32nd floor, 
effective Jan. 2, 2000.  
   
  As I am sending you this email, we do not know where to move him.  I have 
contacted 
  Lorie Belsha who handles the majority of the floor planning and their are 
no spaces to
  move him.  She advised that we look to find a space with his direct report 
Bryan Powell 
  and asked me to contact Peggy McCurley, who then advised I talk to Cheri 
Westbrook. 
  When talking to Cheri Westbrook, she indicated that you have some space 
allocated 
  to you, but she was unsure if you have specific plans for them or if you 
would have (4) 
  spaces for Adam, to accomodate his immediate need.  

  I will be out of the office when you are back in on Wednesday, please 
advise Adam if 
  there is any space available.  I will call in to see if I can be of further 
assistance in this 
  search. 

  To help you expedite this process when you have come back (in hopes that 
you 
  have space available for Adam), I have attached the churn request.  You 
will need to 
  fill in the areas that I left blank (i.e, titles for new hires, cost 
center, TO location).  All the 
  equipment to be moved has been entered on the churn.  

  Additionally, when sending the request into the move-team, please say " 
This move 
  request is for the (5) spaces reserved by Heather Choate for the January 2, 
2001 churn".

John,
Bilal reconciled Tom Martin's VAR, dropping it from $3.5 to $1.246. Texas 
desk VaR dropped to $3.8

Frank
PS.  Bilal has been very helpful in dealing with the VAR issues, and I think 
it has given him a better idea of what trading is about.  Would you consider 
sharing some of the analyst/traders, much like Bilal, for a couple of months, 
maybe longer, maybe mornings only, to help on VAR issues, as it relates to 
both power and gas?  I think it would be an excellent way to introduce them 
to VAR, systems, risk management and trading.  Let me know your thoughts

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

I think I have a meeting at 3:00.

Call me when you have time tomorrow and we will set a time.

PIRA's Emissions Marketing Intelligence Service (EMIS) just released its
latest report to clients entitled, "Update: The Southern California (NOx)
RECLAIM Market."  On May 11 the South Coast Air Quality Management District
Board removed power generators, as defined under the program, from the NOx
RECLAIM market at least until 2004. However, their actions to date have left
the rest of the RECLAIM participants, such as oil refineries, facing an
ongoing, extremely tight market balance.

A second, extensive report analyzing trends and prospects in the SO2 Credit
Market will be released shortly.

Non-EMIS clients interested in the latest RECLAIM report can purchase it for
$2,000. The annual fee for quarterly EMIS reports is $4,500 for up to 10
users at one client site (office).

For more information, please contact Victoria Watkins at (212) 686-6808,

It appears that Enron fundementals would disagree with a alot of these assertions, but it is interesting to see what CERA is expected to publish Mid-June.

Richard

FYI

Enclosed are my notes from the discussion we had with CERA this morning. The
most important item is that CERA is revising their short-term forecast
significantly downward (from high $4.00s to high to mid $3.00s this summer).
This new forecast will be officially published next week. Please see  the
attachment for more information.

 <<Notes From Meeting With CERA June 6.doc>>

	----------
	Two CERA personnel from the natural gas side will be in the office
tomorrow (Wednesday) at 9:00am, room 18 D29, for an informal meeting. They
are available to answer any questions we have of market fundamentals,
pricing, etc. Please join us if you can.

excellent.  We need daily reports that represents the volume that we could loose.  The schedulers must know the proper rankings and cut procedures in a hurricane forms.

Hunter,
FYI - Next Tuesday we will be getting together with Tom to talk about what we will need to be prepared for in a hurricane.  We are planning to talk about the different interconnects within our region as well as the east desk, plans to replace gas, what legal considers force majeure and rankings.  I have invited the schedulers from the east and upstream desks hoping that this will help facilitate discussion and ideas on how to resolve problems should a hurricane happen.   

Kirk Lenart is also in the process of working with Unify team to create reports out of Unify to enable us to track cuts in Unify rather than on a spreadsheet.  This will be more efficient and accurate.  The code freeze on Unify will soon be lifted since the migration to the new server will happen this weekend.

Let me know if you have any other suggestions or questions.

All,

Over the last several months, the CommodityLogic team has designed, built, and beta-tested a number of "modules" to create EnronOnline-type capabilities for the mid and back-office.  By combining these web-based solutions with the back-office commercialization effort, Enron can now offer its clients a complete suite of operational services unique in the industry.

Many of you have also created important pieces in this puzzle, and all of you have valuable client relationships.

We'd like to put all of these elements together.

Please join our team for a demonstration of the CommodityLogic modules and a discussion on strategy next Thursday, June 14, 2:30 to 3:30, 49C1. 

If I have excluded anyone from the invitation list that you feel should attend, please let me know.

Looking forward to seeing you next week.

All the best,

Tom

Interviewers:

Since Shawn Abboud was "on the bubble" after round 1 (interviewers: Grant Zimmerman and Vivek Kumar) and
Bradley Johl was not found to be strong after his round 1 telephone interview (interviewers: James Scribner and John Walt)  my recommendation to the group is to remove them from the list.  Ramsey Soliman was found to be stronger after round 1, so I think we should keep her.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!

All -

Thanks again for all your help yesterday!

From our final meeting yesterday we identified 19 candidates to bring back to Super Saturday.  I can bring back no more than 17.

Based on yesterday's discussion the following candidates are "on the bubble:"

Bradley Johl
Ramsey Soliman
Shawn Abboud

We need to come to a consensus on which 2 to remove from our list.  Hopefully, we can decide this via e-mail discussions rather than calling everyone into a group meeting.

Please share your comments with the group.

Thank you!

We are short 4 interviewers for the ENA Trading Track Interviews on Thursday, November 1.   John asked me to contact you to get some more names.  Attached is the current list of interviewers we have thus far.     

Rgds, Karen.

 << File: Interviewer List 10.08.01.xls >> 

what is the latest?  Are we on schedule for 4,500,000 on Oct31?

Cora,

Thanks for the update.  I concur with the volumes base on the contract.  

Virawan - I have hedged 4,500,000 mmbtu's.  If you decide to inject more or less than that, you will be exposed fixed price against Jan, Feb, and Mar-02.  You have a copy of the contract, however, let's go over it sometime this week.

Sylvia Pollan

Attached please find the storage numbers as of October 22, 2001.  The total amount we must have in storage is 4,500,000 mmbtu and if we keep going for the remainder of the month we will have a volume of 4,507,779 mmbtu which will make us over by 7,779.  We are leaving this number out there until the last day of the month in the event that we encounter any cuts between now and then.   Per the contract we must have a minimum volume of 4,250,000 but no more than 4,500,000 by October 31, 2001.  If we have at least 4,250,000 but less than 4,500,000 then Michcon will allow us to extend the injection period until November 30, 2001  However,  if we have to go into November and inject gas they will give us a fixed amount to put in every day and there will be NO variation on that amount.   Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanks,

Cora

The presentation consists of a table and charts that encapsulate GDP and
IP performance, by country/region, for 2000-2002. It is a useful
comparative recap for the existing slideshows on the U.S., European, and
Japanese economies. Given the overall importance of economic trends and
their impact on regional and global energy markets, PIRA maintains
databases of key economic indicators to support our analyses of energy
fundamentals and the associated market forecasts. These presentations -
which are updated as new data become available - are being made
available complimentarily to all PIRA Online users.

sure.  Give me a call on the day that is best for you.

Hunter,

Thank you for your vote of confidence today.  I'm really grateful to have a shot at the trading track.  It means a lot to me and I promise to work very hard to prove myself.  

I was wondering if you would be interested in grabbing a coffee sometime over the next couple weeks.  I'd be very interested to hear your take on the trading track and what you would do if you were in my shoes.

Jason

Hi Hunter,
I recently joined the A/A program as a Senior Analyst as of November 2001 on recommendations from Jim Fallon, Paul Racicot, and Nicole La and I would like to speak with you on any opportunities that you may have within the Gas Fundamentals group.  I am currently working for Paul Racicot on the EBS trading desk as a metro capacity trader but I am interested in pursuing other opportunities within Enron.  I am ultimately interested in joining the Gas trading track and believe the fundamentals group would be an excellent place to start.  I've attached a copy of my resume and two recommendation letters one from Nicole La and one Joe Edwards, who heads up the bandwidth capacity trading desk, for you to review.  If you have any questions please call me at x34212.  Jim Fallon, Paul Racicot, Nicole La and Joe Edwards would also be happy to speak with you regarding my performance and potential at Enron.
   
Thank-you

Physical Trading

East - The East did not notice any credit hording in the morning.  In the afternoon Tractebel is buying the physical balance of month .04 over the GD swap

Central - Dynegy Canada sold most of the gas to us.  The desk bid was .05 over NGX.  Nicor Hub would not accept an $87 pre-pay for a wheeling fee.

West - EOL Socal cash was trading .08 higher than ICE Socal.  The desk finished short and the market made it very difficult to buy.  EOL SJ cash traded .10 to .20 cents lower than ICE.  The only point without a credit spread was Opal.  Liquidity picked up slightly from Thursday and Friday, but still slow.

AEP was noticeably absent from all regions.

does this plan satisfy our needs?

 

All,

The attached spreadsheet outlines the rotatons for the internal new hires.    Following your changes/comments/suggestions I will forward to Lavorato so we can finalise with the analysts and associates.

Thanks, karen.

gas is ok
Hunter,

Speaking with the above this morning, he indicated his interest in moving into gas as opposed to power (apparently got some good feedback on you ?!).  He currently works for Rogers Herndon and had also discussed with him his interest.

Let me have your feedback, and if you want him in your group,, I can switch him to gas fundies as opposed to power.

Karen.

ps.. attached again is the spread of new TT people.

The data is the most accurate data on field receipts and well completions in the US.  Chris believes that he can create an accurate production forecast model by basin and county.  This would give us an edge in the overall and basis market.

This is very fuck'n expensive.  Are we sure this isn't obtainable cheaper.

Hunter,

IHS
We met with IHS this morning to discuss the data that we need to complete our supply forecasts.  It is our intent to use the monthly historical production data in combination with well completion data, rig counts, and drilling permits to build a more accurate production forecast.  We need complete well characteristic data (depth, basin, age) in order to be accurate.  

In order to reach the goal above, we need to invest in two data services from IHS:

	US Production data - monthly volumes from all wells in the US updated on a lag of 1-6 months - $159,500/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly
	US Well data - well characteristics updated monthly, data age is only limited by CD-ROM delivery - $154,000/Yr. delivered on CD-ROM monthly

Next year, we will be able to cut the US Well data and add Scout Express, which will cut the cost by $115,500.  Scout Express has only one year of historical well data, so it does not currently meet our needs.  We will be able to do this after we build the historical well information into our supply forecast.

Danielle Marcinkowski is working with IHS on the contract for the data, she is going to try and negotiate the price this afternoon.  She anticipated having the contract today, and sending it to Chicago for approval.

PIRA
Danielle is working to finalize the agreement in the next 3 days.  I gave her a list of the services that we needed, and told her that we would like to distribute the PIRA material on the Commodity Fundamentals website instead of having individual user accounts.  Based on the services that I think we'll need (North Americal Natural Gas, North American Electricity, and the Daily Demand Forecast), our combined cost for Gas and Power in Houston, Portland, Calgary, and Toronto should be around $100,000 for 100 users.  Danielle is going to send an e-mail when she has the final price.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Since Zac opens a spot, Jason Jennaro is a good candidate.  

Zach has gone to great efforts to evaluate his situation and experience going forward and he has decided to work with the liquidation of the EBS assets.  After seeking opinions from various business people, the overwhelming conclusion was to work with the Estate prior to entering business school in the fall.

Thank you for offering him a position and an option to join UBS, but he will officially decline the offer.

Can someone do a study on the tariffs of major pipeline storage fields to determine which fields require that storage gas is withdrawn regardless of price.  If not, how much to roll storage?

I was looking at past levels, and I thouhgt to share my findings with you.

Highest levels as of the first week of April was in 1999 of 1,367 TCF.  Yesterday's AGA showed our levels @ 2,294.  In order to reach 1999's levels we ould need to withdraw about 103 BCF a week (2,294 less 1,367 divided vy the remaining 9 weeks until the first week of April).  

Also, 1999 had the highest levels for the third week of January, levels were 2,039.  Year 2002 is 255 bcf ahead.

agreed

I think this guy should be independent from the fundies.   There may be special projects that are "highly confidential" in nature that should be directed by you, Hunter, Tim and myself.   I think Robert would be more successful in a freelance role.

Other input?

I think he should report to Gaskill and Will (is will doing fundies?)

Hi John- thanks for the generous offer which I have accepted.  A couple of outstanding questions- 

1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.

2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.

Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

did you grab Bennett's internet favorites?

Hi Guys?

Per our discussion this morning - two further items needed to complete my end of this transition of the weather team:

1)	A contact number for The Weather Channel - (770) 226-0000.  It's a switchboard number but they do have a dial by name directory - that's how I get anybody I know there.  The 2 names:  Dr. Steve Lyons and Kevin Stenson.

2)	My internet explorer bookmarks can be found at O:/Research/Bennett/Favorites.

My understanding is that this is all you guys need from me to complete my part of this transition.  Please confirm this - and let me know if/what you still need me to do.  To avoid confusion - please respond to everyone on the list above so that we can ensure that HR continues to be in the loop with this effort.

Sorry about the confusion but please let me know what further I can do - or if you are satisfied please confirm that there is nothing further that you need.

Central Trading:

Jason Williams is an associate
Entertainment is too high for trading (s/b about $15,000)

Here is the Netco budget split out for your regions .  Could you please take a look at the headcount and expenses to make sure everything looks alright?  If there are additional items you would like to add (travel and entertainment looks low), please let me know.

Also, there are a couple people that belong to one of the Gas teams, but I'm not sure which region.  If you know where they belong, please let me know.

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new=
 building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being o=
ffered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the=
 new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The =
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is cu=
rrently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly empl=
oyee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name =
to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be m=
ade as spaces become available.=20

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be op=
ened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street lev=
el entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. Ga=
rage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an=
 exit in the event of elevator trouble.=20

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Pa=
rking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your em=
ail, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and=
 receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the =
new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and=
 Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.=20

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, w=
ill have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.=
)

looks good

thanks

Jay,

Does your group have space?

Hunter,

As I mentioned this morning, since Zach McCarroll turned down the offer we =
would like to explore the possibility of keeping David Woodstrom on the IT =
team to fill the open position.  The Fundamentals IT team has been cut to a=
 minimum support staff, and the addition of David would facilitate more dev=
elopment of fundamentals content.  David has been focusing on the operation=
al capacity reporting (morning ops reports) by creating better ways to acce=
ss the operational data (real time query tool vs. standard reports).  David=
 also has been responsible for maintenance and development of the commodity=
 fundamentals website since he joined the group in early 2000.  He built an=
d maintains the current message board system used by gas trading and as wel=
l as the critical notice alerts for pipelines.  He has also worked closely =
with the West desk and Portland on various real time load and outage report=
s.  David Dronet and I both feel that the addition of David Woodstrom will =
allow the fundamentals team to continue producing innovative products inste=
ad of providing only support for current operations.  Let me know if you ha=

FYI - This is Roy Boston's summary of the ICC meeting on gas prices.

Gregg
Hello All -- Attached is a memo highlighting the issue areas covered by staff at the ICC meeting in Chicago yesterday.  If you have any questions feel free to call.  It was strange to hear Tom Kennedy say that staff supports reasonable hedging practices and forward contract purchases while sitting next to Zuraski who opposed recovery of same in the PGLC fixed price docket.  Incidentally, Tom Kennedy noted several times that hedging will not necessarily reduce prices but will stabilize them.

 

Hunter, the meeting went well. We met with Bryan Murtagh (UBS attorney) and did an overview of the contract services we are looking to set up with the pipes, how those are utilized and some of the underlying risks/exposure of using these contracts. Basically the message was these are non-negotiable contracts, he seemed to understand that and didn't indicate this would require any major legal review from their side. We also had a discussion about the credit requirements and what some of the pipes are asking for. Follow up credit meeting to take place today to get into some greater detail and get a standard credit package together. Also UBS did indicate that they also want to do a credit review of the pipes before moving forward. To faciltiate that we gave them a list of the Day 1 pipes to start their process.

In summary, I don't believe there will be any challenge on us entering into these agreements nor a lenghty review by the UBS attorneys. The credit issue is big, need to have them expedite their review of pipelines and also recognize our need to satisfy the pipeline credit requirments for a new customer (standard credit package and any addtional requirements). Also need some defintitive answers on when we can actually send this information out (is it now or is it when the deal closes). Suzanne is going to a legal meeting this AM to discuss/recap where everything is at this point in time. I will forward any additonal information to you when I get it. This assumes the Power of Attorney issue will be settled shortly for contract execution.

Bob

Colin asked me to cover our current development on security.

I met with the Web Requests team yesterday and we found that our model was correct however there was an bug in the software.
We have worked through that and will do some further testing today.  If all goes well I anticipate we can define the users in the group
and implement secure links next week.

Would either of you be responsible on the ENA side for signing an "Assignment of Gas Contract?"  Thank you.
I believe that it would either be Scott Neal or Hunter Shively.  

Did you find an unexecuted copy of the assignment?

Sylvia/Linda, do either of you know who on the ENA side would be responsible for signing an "Assignment of Gas Contract?"  HPL assigned it's expense contract with TXU Fuel Company to ENA, and I have the paperwork in front of me.  Thanks.

A number of conference participants argued that, even under the new standards of Order No. 637, many pipelines still do not offer usable (manipulatable) data over their internet sites.  

What specifically are the above participants arguing?

Attached is the third draft of comments to be filed by ENA as a follow-up to the March 15 "Dialog" conference.  If you have any comments or concerns, please contact me at 713-853-5840 or Leslie Lawner at 713-345-8645 by Friday afternoon.  Comments are due to be filed at FERC on Monday, and I would like to get them out by FedEx Friday night.

What instant messaging are you using?  I am disappointed that Deirdre has left.  Liz is in the VAR group and needs to be here early.

Hunter

How come Instant Messaging only works for you?  I can not find most people on the trading floor (ie., Fletch, Arnold, etc)  It is kinda of ridiculous.  
By the way, I will be on the fifth and sixth floor of the new building.  Since the Wellhead desk/ Ecommerce will be on six and the rest of Upstream Products will be on five, I will be up and down on the escalators all day.

I heard that Deirdre went to the freight group under Reck.  How do you feel about that?  Probably don't give a damn since she did not report directly to you.  However, I think it is unfortunate that she left ENA.  

I saw Elizabeth Shim today.  She told me that she gets to work by 5:00 am.  Is it really necessary?  How powerful, forcing analysts to work from 5:00 am to 6:00 pm when most of the traders leave at 4:30 pm.  HMMM,

Thank You

Hunter, it appears that the bid week cycle for making IT based implementations actually falls five days prior and five days post bid week. Hence we cannot push the gas message board change without Director (business side) or above approval.

Thus on that note, please could forward this email to: David Wile (cc Bryan Lari, Colin Tonks, David Dronet) authorising this change so we can push the GMB asap. 

Thanks

We are in the middle of our bid week cycle.  I cannot implement this without director approval.

Chris,

what are our needs?

We have been assigned 24 new Associates, 26 new Anaysts, 8 summer Associates and 8 summer Analysts from the incoming class.

Please let me know your needs with respect to numbers.   Louise and I will then decide if we agree and then we will create a process to pick from the ones we have assigned to us.  I'm assuming that Calgary, Toronto and Portland have done their own thing and don't need any of these people (let me know if this is incorrect).  

If you received this and you report to someone else on this list (ie. you don't report to the office of the chair) please cooridinate your needs with your supervisor.

Please respond prompty,

John

Fundies:

Due to rotations we need six analysts in Aug/Sept.  Chris has been assigned three new analysts from the pool.  I believe these people are outside of the 26 assigned to you.  We need a minimum of three.  If you want to give us up to six, we will send our allocation of three back to the pool.  We would also like a summer analyst.

We have been assigned 24 new Associates, 26 new Anaysts, 8 summer Associates and 8 summer Analysts from the incoming class.

Did this show in my Monday var?

FYI
This is going down.  Thinking is if VAR goes ballistic they'll know Saturday and reverse before Monday.  There are risks involved in trying this over the weekend but Scott is committed to making sure there are no hitches.

Frank

Nilay,

OK its a go. I have changed the Vol Group CD in the Publication Name database from Omicron 10 to Omicron 1 for IF-ANR/LA. Hunter's VaR is half his limit and there should be more than enough cushn' to account for any increase in VaR this change may cause. Could you ensure it comes across in the GERMS side. If it does not because of an ERMS issue, could you contact Jeremy Wong? I think you could better describe any issues to him than I could. Thanks.

Scott

Are we going to reschedule?
FYI...

I just wanted to let you know that I have been working with the settlements group in order to put approx. $800,000.00 into the Central and East desk books for Devon penalties that have been incurred over the last year.  Settlements should be talking with the Risk group in order to get this done soon.   We are also working to determine the Pipeline cash out as a result of Panaco's imbalance over the last year.  After talking with legal it appears that we do have remedy to recoup cash out from Panaco. I'll keep you informed when I have more information.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Mark

Chris Gaskill and I will do it.

Does the audience understand the basics of natural gas?

Hey Hunter, how's it going? Got a favor. I am sponsoring a "Summer Series" of presentations to select individuals in EES to get them more acquainted with the wholesale marketplace and other areas of Enron. I will be having these each Wednesday beginning June 13th. We're starting with US Power which Rogers Herndon is going to present. On June 20th, I'd like to have someone present US Gas. I'd really like to have you present if at all possible. We're doing these in 5C2 which holds about 100 folks. The EES groups will really benefit in gaining more insight into the wholesale markets. I'm basically wanting to give them an overview of the current fundamentals in the US Gas market, the influence from Canada/Mexico, an update of storage and transportation balances/concerns, our view of the forward market and the things that are influencing it, etc. We probably just need a 30-45 presentation with about 30 minutes for Q & A. 

We're trying to establish a much closer link between the wholesale and retail groups, and things like this will really help. You could always bring someone else to tag team with if you like.  I will introduce you and be there the entire time, and Dave Delainey will more than likely be there as well. By the way, we will be taping these so folks can watch it on their PC's afterwards.

If you can do it, I owe you one! Let me know. Thanks!

Daisy Liemonta - No - I think she is more suited towards a back office role.  However I am on the fence and If Presto wanted to bring her in, that is fine.

Eric Moncada - Yes - Trading experience and desire to learn fundamental trading

Sandy Wei-shan - No - little interest in trading

Fines:

     I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

EOL:

We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

We believe Dynegy has written a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs.

Is it possible for Power to be on our floor?

Hunter, see below.  Any interest ?

Rain:

Is this something Hunter was interested in?  Will you forward this information to him and reply back to Stuart Fieldhouse about Hunter attending one of these demos.

-Ina

Hi Ina, 
My colleague Joy Pardillo has contacted you regarding a demo for some messaging software as a possible replacement for the Amtel Unit, which you are attending at 12.30pm. 
In addition to this, we have some software that puts the intercom on to the PC as well, which we would be very keen for Hunter Shively, and any other traders who might be interested, to have a look at. Could you ask Hunter if he would like to see a demo of the software at some time today. We have room 22C1 booked for the following times today. If he cannot make any of these times, let me know and I will sort out a location. 
11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. 
12:30 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.
The latest a demo could take place is 3pm. 
Many thanks

Various Beta Buttheads,
   OK, the deadline is fast approaching.  We're inside two minutes to play
and I need to know the game plan.  As of this day Oct. 2, here's what I have
confirmed in tickets ordered so that we all may sit together at this year's
homecoming game:
Mannino/1, Beek/1, Jordan/1, Artie/1, Wallace/1, Elvis/2, Grumbles/2,
Glass/3, Chuckles/1, J. Miller/2, Shack/1, Space/8 (he's bringing all of
Elzie's living relatives), Hutch/2, Fullerton/2, Coburn/2, Jansson/5 (he's
bringing all of Mom Pinchbeck's living relatives), Rossell/2, and Carl
Hohl/2 (he thinks...not sure because he never was).
    Now, if there are ANY OTHERS, you have about 48 hours because I need to
order these things when I get back in town on the 5th.  So if any of you
reading this want some, give me an email.  Also think about recruiting
others not on my email list that you think might not yet know about all
these plans.
     WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO ROCK THE NEW STADIUM.  I've already
contacted officer Caffey and he's given us yet another reprieve to behave
any damned way we want to, complete with SMU Secuity protection.

Yours in -kai-

Hello Jeff, 

I submitted a  question that didn't get answered at the meeting.  I was 
hoping you could respond.  

We routinely see citizens of a country hold an "inferior" currency despite 
the presence of superior alternatives.  The incumbent currency has a smaller 
bid/ask spread, and a network externality  locks-in  the inferior currency.  
Volume creates lower spreads and lower spreads in turn attract more volume, 
conferring a monopoly status on the incumbent currency.

Do you think that Enron Online is taking advantage of a similar network 
externality?  How do our bid/ask spreads compare to the alternatives 
available to our competitors?  Do we stand willing to match our competitors 
bid/offer?

A final note:  I was curious to learn what you did to become so successful.  
Is there a place where your biography or resume is posted?  

Thanks in advance,

David Porter.

Good morning, Kristin.  Your Dad would like to meet you today at Maggiano's 
(located at 2019 S. Post Oak Blvd., 713.961.2700).  I'll make a reservation 
for 12:00 noon - he'll be there then, and I know you'll probably be a few 
minutes later than that.  Let me know if you want another plan.  SRS

Hi, Kristin.  I guess we got our wires crossed last Friday about lunch.  
Sorry about that.  He told me that you guys have rescheduled for tomorrow 
(Tuesday) at 12:30 p.m. and that you will meet him there.  I'll make a 
reservation at Carrabas on Kirby in your Dad's name at that time.  Please let 
me know if you have a conflict.  Thanks, SRS

PS - I also have you down for lunch with your Dad on Friday, November 10 - do 
you have it down, too?

Hi, Beek.

I'm going through all of your e-mails to Jeff and am not able to find the 
information on Elvis' party Friday night.  Someone had sent an attachment 
with the details, but I was unable to open it.  Would you mind sending us the 
"final" agenda for the festivities this weekend?  Jeff will arrive in Dallas 
+/- 4:00p Friday night and will be staying at the Crescent Court hotel.  
Thanks so much!  SRS

Attached is an expense report for Sherri Sera that requires approval.  Please 
review, approve and forward to "expense reports."

John, any chance you can sent this e-mail to me?  Apparently it has a 
"confidential" stamp on it, so even though I have access to Jeff's mailbox, 
it won't allow me to open it.  Unfortunately, Jeff does not check his own 
e-mail, and if I go into his machine, I won't be able to print it as it is 
not connected to any printer.

Thanks, John.  I'll see that Jeff gets it as soon as it's received.  SRS

Ladies and Gentlemen,

Thank you all for participating on the associate and analyst PRC committee.  
I believe that the PRC process is the most important tool we have to evaluate 
Enron's talent, and your role in the process is critical.  With the all 
important year-end PRC quickly approaching, I'd like to spend a little time 
with you sharing not only my philosophy on the process, but also talking 
about the mechanics of the process.  There will also be time to answer any 
questions you may have.

To that end, please join me and Charlene Jackson for breakfast on Thursday, 
November 30, at 8:30 a.m. in EB50M.  If you are unable to attend in person 
and would like to participate by conference call, that can be arranged.  
Please RSVP your attendance to Cheryl Kuehl at x3-9804.

I look forward to seeing you on November 30, and again, many thanks for 
spending your time on this critical process.

Jeff

ventures in the US and Asia for many years.  Of late, he has been running

Jeff met with him today to discuss this.  Jeff suggested that Gerald contact 
you to discuss further.  I have provided Gerald with your telephone numbers, 
address and e-mail address.  You should expect to hear from him shortly.

Dear Sr. Rivera,

I'm writing on behalf of Mr. Jeff Skilling in response to your e-mail below.  

Mr. Skilling is very interested in meeting with Sr. Rafael Miranda.  
Unfortunately, he does not have any planned trips to Europe within the next 
couple of months, though that may change after the first of the year.  If, 
however, Sr. Miranda has any plans to be stateside, I would be happy to 
arrange a time for the two of them to meet.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Dear Mr. TenHave,

We are in receipt of the above referenced letter addressed to Mr. Jeff

Jeff,

As the new year rolls around, many executives we work with choose to
re-evaluate their personal financial matters and in some cases, make changes
where appropriate.  Accordingly, I am writing to arrange a brief visit
around the 1st of the year to evaluate your current situation and see how
Goldman Sachs might be helpful to you.

Can I phone Katherine to arrange this brief meeting with you?

Sincerely,

Neil Kelley <NKelley@TQCap.com> on 12/01/2000 02:51:21 PM
Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a "new economy" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our "offices" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17 acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Dear Ms. Siska,

On behalf of Mr. Jeff Skilling, I am responding to a request from Mr. Warren 
Staley to forward to you the name of Enron's contact with regard to an 
information exchange on leadership development between Enron and Cargill.  
Mr. Skilling suggests that you call Mr. Steve Kean, EVP and Chief of Staff.  
Mr. Kean can be reached at 713.853.1586 or via e-mail at 
steven.kean@enron.com.

If I may be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Dear Mr. Schaeffer,

Apologies for the delay in responding to your e-mail below.

Jeff has given your proposal serious consideration.  However, given the 
current demands on his time, he has decided to decline your offer to join the 
Cogent Communications Advisory Committee.

On behalf of Jeff, many thanks for the opportunity and best wishes for 
success.

Dear Jeff,

Hope you are doing well.  It has been quite a long time since we last spoke
when I was with Pathnet.  I have since started another company called Cogent
Communications and the company has been progressing very well in the last
year.

I'm in the process of putting together an Advisory Committee for the company
composed of industry, business, and political leaders.  I think your depth
of experience in telecom could add a lot of value to the company and am
looking to gauge your interest level in joining the committee.  The
commitment is limited to one meeting per year and you would receive stock in
the company.  Thus far we have commitments from Sergio Zyman of Coca Cola
and are in discussions with Bob Dole and Vernon Jordan.

Cogent is a facilities-based ISP offering very high bandwidth Internet
access to business users in the top tier cities in the US.  Utilizing the
latest in fiber-optic technology, we've built an all optical nationwide
network and are offering 100mbps non-oversubscribed service for a flat rate
of $1,000 per month.  Feel free to take a look at our website at
www.cogentco.com.  The company has raised over $350MM in financing to date
with investors including Oak Investment Partners, Broadview Capital, Texas
Pacific Group, Capital Research, and Worldview Technology Partners.

Please give me a call/email at your earliest convenience.  I look forward to
speaking with you and catching up.

Sincerely,

Dave Schaeffer, CEO
202-295-4201

We are in urgent need of approximately 35 interviewers for this weekend's

weekend.

Details are as follows:

Date:  Saturday, December 9
Time:  7:45 a.m. Breakfast
  8:30 a.m. Interviews begin
  1:30 p.m. Decision meeting (no longer than 2 hours)

Jeff approves.  SRS

The purpose of this email is to obtain the necessary approvals from each of 
you per the policy dated October 27, 1999 concerning entering into agreements 
containing non-solicitation provisions.

Jay Fitzgerald has been negotiating and is about to finalize a services 
agreement with Scient Corporation (Scient will be providing software and 
hardware related services).  It contains a mutual agreement not to solicit 
the other's employees for a one year period.   Jay thinks the major 
beneficiary of that provision will be us, since it is more likely that they 
will want some of our employees rather than the other way around.

Please indicate your approval by reply to this email.  Thank you.

Dear Neil,

Sorry you two missed each other last night.  How would 10:30 a.m. on

Jeff, I've been meaning to corner you at one of the YPO functions to spend
a
minute discussing a couple of topics.  First and foremost, I wanted to
introduce Genesis Park which is a "new economy" investment company that's
been recently founded here in Houston by Paul Hobby, Fred Lummis, Steve
Gibson, Peter Shaper, Bruce Herzog and myself.  Paul and I were hoping to
have an opportunity to spend 30 minutes with you in the next few weeks to
describe in person what we're all about.  And to be clear, we're not
looking
for Enron money, we are raising money from private individuals.  We've
already met with Jay Fitzgerald and Steve Horn to establish the
Enron/Genesis business relationship.

I also wanted to get your views on Enron's approach to oil trading and
whether the Vitol Group presented an opportunity.  Frankly, I think Vitol
is
an excellent acquisition target although the success they've enjoyed in the
last year or two will make it a bit more difficult.  They have an
unbelievable franchise, but they also have some fundamental weaknesses
which
could be exploited to Enron's benefit.  I'm shooting in the dark here but
hopefully it's worth some discussion.

If you can free some time during this busy holiday period to meet, it would
be greatly appreciated.  Paul and I could come to your office, or possibly
you could come to our "offices" over on Hermann Park.  We're buying 17
acres
on Hermann Park adjacent to the Park Lane Towers which we plan to develop
into a technology park.  For the time being, we are officing in a high tech
shed on the property!

Please let me know.  Thanks/Neil.

Mike, Jeff's intent is not that you would interview, but that you would put 
the hammer (so to speak!) on some of your people to sign up.  

Have a good weekend!  SRS

   

Jeff,

Sorry, I can't participate on Saturday.  I have serious commitments that I 
can't break specifically on Saturday.  I know that we are short people and I 
do take this process very seriously.

We have received numerous requests from individuals in the business units who 
either want to add someone to the PRC Committee or who want to have someone 
attend the Associate and/or Analyst PRC meetings because they do not have a 
representative on the Committees.  

Unfortunately, it is not possible to add additional PRC Reps at this time 
because all of the Associates and Analysts have been divided between the 
existing PRC Reps.  Additionally, as you are aware, the PRC meetings are next 
week, December 12th & 13th and there is not enough time to gather 
information.  We will, however, be reducing the number of Associates and 
Analysts that each PRC Rep is representing and will need several additional 
Reps. If you have individuals that should be nominated please send the names 
to Terry Bosien.  The parameters that were used for the initial appointments 
were as follows:

The person must be a well-respected individual who is nominated/approved by 
the Office of the Chair of the Operating Company
The Associate PRC Reps are vice presidents
The Analyst PRC Reps are directors /sr. directors

The level of the PRC reps on the committee is important to adhere to for 
several reasons.  First, Jeff wanted individuals at these levels to gain 
additional exposure in the organization and be involved in activities beyond 
their business unit boundaries.  Additionally, it potentially places the PRC 
Rep in an awkward position and they may feel undue pressure in the meeting if 
they are required to disagree with a more senior individual.  

We have also received request from individuals wanting to "observe" the 
meeting.  As in the MD/VP process, individuals are not allowed to just 
observe if they are not a part of the Committee.  We attempted to have the 
major units represented, however, it is not possible to have every division 
represented.   Jeff Skilling spent over an hour with the PRC Reps explaining 
why the individuals selected as PRC Reps, rather than the Associates' & 
Analysts' managers, should be the ones to represent the Associates & Analysts 
in the PRC.  He also reiterated the importance of the PRC Reps' 
responsibilities which was to (1) meet with the Associates' and Analysts' 
managers;  (2) gather as much information as possible and (3) advocate 
objectively for the individual.
Also, if there are too many individuals in the room it is difficult or 
impossible to come to a consensus, which has been the case in the past.  

I hope this is helpful.  If business units find this is not acceptable, they 
should seek approval for their attendance from Jeff Skilling.

Thanks for your understanding, cooperation and support.

Charlene

 

Dear Mr. Casamento,

Edward, Jeff is booked solid today and Friday and traveling tomorrow.  He 
then will be on vacation from December 18-January 2.  I would suggest that 
you send him an e-mail.  If he needs any additional information, we can try 
to get the two of you together for a few minutes the morning of the 
interview.  SRS

Jeff,

I spoke with Mark Palmer concerning the interview with Businessweek magazine, 
January 2nd.  He has asked me to participate in the article to discuss Enron 
Media Services and thought it would be a good idea for me  to give you a 
quick update in the event the reporter questions you about the business.  Let 
me know if you would like for me to stop by or call you to bring you up to 
date.   I will be out on vacation December 20th returning January 2nd.

Congratulations on your appointment to CEO.

Lance Stuart <LStuart@erehab.com> on 01/28/2000 07:56:14 PM
Just a quick update and follow up to my previous e-mail.

My colleague, Cory Christensen (another McKinsey alum), and I met with IBM
regarding a potential strategic relationship. That meeting went far better
than expected. A similar document to the one I sent to you has now reached a
number of their senior executives. Tom Bouchard, SVP of Human Resources, for
example, reacted by saying, "They're (e-rehab) addressing a huge problem. I
would love to talk to them." one of their senior healthcare VPs stated,
"This is exactly the kind of thing IBM would like to do. This is not the
only big thing we're looking at, but this is definitely big. It's right on!"
The table has turned. IBM is now pushing us with information requests and to
move the process along.

We told IBM that e-rehab is most interested in them as a customer, as is the
case with Enron and another half dozen blue-chip companies with which we
have initiated a dialogue. However, because IBM has come to recognize the
relevance and potential value we can deliver, they are now keenly interested
in becoming a minority investor (assuming that we clear their due diligence
screens).

The meeting with IBM last Friday was in Stamford Connecticut so I arranged a
meeting just prior to that with Steve Denning in Greenwich. Our visit was
meant to be purely social, but Steve reacted quite positively to our
business and would be interested in considering an investment by General
Atlantic Partners (GAP) if we sign up an IBM ... or one or more companies of
similar stature, such as Enron. Aside from GAP and our current investors, we
are not considering traditional funding sources. GAP is an exception because
of their potential non-monetary value-added.

In any case, the purpose of this note is to solicit a reaction to my earlier
e-mail. In other words, would Enron have an interest as a potential (early
adopter) customer and/or strategic investor? I would not have approached you
in the first place unless I was convinced that our services would be of
great benefit to Enron. If you have an interest in exploring this
opportunity, I'd like to determine and schedule next steps. I apologize. I
don't mean to be pushy, but I'm anxious and feel a great deal of urgency.

I'll place a call to your office next week to get a read on your
temperature. Look forward to getting a response.

Regards,

Lance Stuart

Karen, thank you for the update.  Please note in future communcations that 
"McKinzie" is actually spelled "McKinsey."  As Jeff worked there prior to 
coming to Enron, this is a typo he would notice.  I have changed it in the 
copy of this message given to him.  SRS

Karen Marshall@ECT
02/08/2000 08:52 AM
Leonel Azuela (Harvard) verbally DECLINED our offer to become an Associate at 
Enron.  He will accept a position with McKinzie in Houston.  He said he 
really appreciated the calls and the follow up especially from Jeff Skilling 
and he wants to keep in touch since he will be in Houston.  Leonel said that 
due to his financial situation, he really had no choice but to accept the 
McKinzie offer at this time.  Other than that, he admires and respects Enron 
and thought we did a top notch job with our follow up. He really envied the 
opportunities we had to offer.  It was truly a monetary issue.

BUT... It's not over, we still have 4 outstanding offers for HBS that expire 
on February 15th.  Please call the candidates and offer your assistance in 
answering any questions about the organization or Houston in general that may 
help them with their decision.  

The candidates are:      
     David Frost   617-562-1872
     Scott Landry   617-661-8499
     Amy VanBuskirk 617-868-1816
     Antonio Vivanco  617-868-9008 

I spoke to everyone last week and I know that a few want more time.  For 
example, some candidates are doing very targeted searches that are outside of 
the campus recruiting process.  Unfortunately, we cannot extend our 
deadline.  I honestly think we have a chance with these candidates.  It is 
important to emphasize the opportunities at Enron because most of them have 
other offers that exceed our package, but if they look at the BIGGER PACKAGE, 
we are very much a contender.  It's our job to sell them on that long term 
opportunity and to look beyond the short term.

Thanks for your help.

Karen Marshall
Recruiting Manager
     

Happy to hear you are ok, Mark.  Do you need aything we can we can fed ex to 
you (or get to you in another manner if necessary?).  Please let us know.  

Sherri for Jeff...

Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probably
only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.

Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in the
streets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up on
solid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad construction
here; stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half a
block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparent
injuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not so
lucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed had
a genertor and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying, men
reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in the
middle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks in
neighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much I
learned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, which
is depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.

A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs up and about;
mistook that comotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much like
after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in my
subconscious.

Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  May
need it.

Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll send
this to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok and
worried about them worrying about me.

Love,

Mark

Hi, Suzanne.

I was wondering if you would do me a favor.  You have sent a couple of 
packages to Jeff's home by UPS or FedEx.  Unfortunately, Jeff is never there 
to sign for them, so the packages are delayed in getting to him as we have to 
track them down.  UPS is very good about rerouting to the business address, 
but FedEx won't reroute without the permission of the sender (i.e., you).  

At any rate, in the future if you would send packages to Jeff at Enron Corp., 
1400 Smith Street, EB5008, Houston, Texas, 77002, I would really appreciate 
it.  And of course, anything marked "confidential" is opened only by him.

Thanks a lot, Suzanne.  Hope all is well with you.

Sherri

Amelia, just wanted to make sure that you had Jeff signed up...I'm sure you 
probably do!  SRS

Michael, I'm responding on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who is traveling abroad.

It appears that this is informational only for Jeff, and you are not inviting 
him to attend the meetings.  If this is an invitation to attend, he is unable 
to as he will still be traveling abroad.

Sherri

I have made some arrangements in scheduling potential investment bankers to 
talk with us about our current project.  I have informed them about our 
current situation and thinking, and they will be prepared to present their 
ideas on deal process, potential investors/buyers, valuation, fee proposal, 
credentials etc.  I plan to make a decision very quickly regarding whom we 
will work with, and get the process moving as quickly as possible.

We will meet with Merrill Lynch on Monday February 28 (a time has not yet 
been designated)
Schroder's will be in our offices on Wednesday March 1, 2000 at 9:30 am
I am still trying to schedule a date and time with Nicholas Wrigley and 
Rothchild

I would greatly appreciate your letting me know if (1) you have interest in 
attending these meetings and (2) you can attend a Merrill meeting on Monday 
and the Schroder's meeting on Wednesday.  Thanks.

Mr. Collins, 

Mr. Skilling is considering this invitation and has requested a bit more 
information.  What time are the awards presentations taking place on April 
11?  Mr. Skilling does have an appointment in New York at 8:00 a.m. on April 
12  that would be very difficult to reschedule.  Given this time constraint, 
I'm not sure it will work.  Please advise at your earliest convenience.

I am sure you are aware that as part of  first ever Risk Awards - published 
in January - Enron Corporation achieved the  accolade: Energy/commodity 
derivatives house of the  year.

This award was won, not simply  because of your lead in energy and power in 
the US, but because of the lead  Enron has taken in new areas of risk 
management.

We very much hope you can join us to be presented  with the Award at the Risk 
2000 Europe Congress in Paris on April 11th - we  invite you to attend the 
conference as a full delegate and I am sure there are a  number of sessions

Good morning, Yelba.  

It has been a long time!  You may not remember me, but I have been working 
with Jeff since the McKinsey days (my name used to be "Baumbach").  

After reviewing your e-mail, Jeff suggests that you speak to Lou Pai, 
Chairman & CEO of Enron Energy Services; his telephone number is 
713.853.5646.  By copy of this e-mail, he is advised that you will contact 
him.

Good luck with your venture, Yelba, and welcome back to Houston.  If I can be 
of assistance, please don't hesitate to call me.  And please tell Richard 
that we said hello.

Regards,

Hi Jeff,
Don't know if you remember me from your old McKinsey days, but I am Richard
Saettone's wife. The entire family is finally back in Houston after several
years in Peru.  I am working for a company called Home-Link Services, and
wanted to request your aid in finding the correct person to talk to at Enron
regarding our business model.

We currently represent over 200,000 transactions per year (people moving),
and one of the most requested services from our customers is the connection
of utilities.  As an aggregator for the energy sector with that type of
volume, who do you recommend we call?  We are expected to grow to about
500,000 transactions by year-end.

Feel free to call me with any questions.  I would be most happy to send you
or the proper Enron contact an executive summary for review.

Richard sends his regards and we hope your family is doing well.

Mr. Skilling,

Hello, my name is Samuel Pak and I am an Analyst in the A/A program.  There 
will be approx. 15-20 of us from the A/A program participating in the MS 150 
with you.  As a result, the Encounter has asked me to cover this event for 
our up coming next issue.  As with any great story, we need a picture!  So 
therefore, I would like to request a moment of your time after we take our 
Enron Dream Team photo prior to the start of the ride.  I have spoke with 
Amelia Alder and Deborah Gebhardt, and they are willing to accommodate us 
after the group photo.  So how about a photo?

Look forward to meeting you.  Good luck!  I know I will need it.

Regards,

 As you may know, I have recently been hired to direct the new Office of 
Labor and Employment Relations (formerly Fair Employment and Labor 
Practices).  One of the many major roles of my group is to conduct 
investigations into employee allegations of discrimination, harassment, and 
other unfair treatment. One recent investigation involved an employee who was 
communicating via e-mail with your office on a constant and unyielding 
basis.  As experience shows, this is not an uncommon occurrence as some 
employees feel that they must go to the top to get attention.

 As you have been doing, please direct all such employee communications to me 
for prompt processing.  This will enable you to avoid being subjected to 
depositions and trial testimony in any subsequent legal proceeding as a fact 
witness.  Naturally, I will keep you informed as to the results of the 
investigation to any extent that you desire.

 Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

Brian

Rachael, well, I was wrong again.  Jeff said he is not interested in doing 
the morning broadcast with Sam Malone; no reason given, so I didn't ask.  
Sorry!  SRS

Jeff,

Sam Malone would love for you to join him live at the Morning Show broadcast 
from the Enron Building on April 7.  The optimal time to speak with Sam is 
between 7 and 8 am, but not at the top or bottom of the hour .  He wants the 
opportunity to banter with you on air about why Enron is the best place to 
work, Enron Field and what you have been doing lately.   It will be very 
informal, and depending on your schedule, he welcomes you to stay as long as 
you can.

Please let me know when you are available.   

Rachael

Dear Mr. Buttrey,

Jeff received your e-mail and asked me to respond on his behalf as he is 
traveling.  He would really enjoy having lunch with you on your next visit to 
Houston.  Please give him a call when your plans are firm...he can be reached 
at 713.853.6894.

Jeff also inquired as to what you are up to these days.  When you have a 
minute, please drop him another line.

Jeff, I don't know if you have heard, but WA won the state basketball 
tournement last weekend.? I have ordered the Beacon News for last Sunday and 
would be happy to make copies and send to you.? Kerkman is still the head 
coach in his 24th year.? The point guard on the team is John Fowler.? John's 
dad is Herman Fowler who played in 71.

Hope all is going great for you.? I know the opening of Enron Field is 
keeping you busy as well as running Enron. 

I need to come to Houston soon.? Would there be a time I could run by and say 
hi or buy you a sandwich for lunch? 

Hope to hear from you. 

Mike Buttrey 

Mark,

I got your nice letter - hope things are going well.  I'm really looking 
forward to seeing you in SF next week.  Have a safe trip.

Jeff

Thank you for the information, Brian.  I'll make sure Jeff sees this.  

For your information, should a need arise for you to give Jeff completely 
confidential information, his voicemail is the only secure means to do so (I 
do not have his password).  His extension is 3-6894.  Otherwise, all mail 
(e-mail included) is opened by me.

Again, thank you for your quick response for information.  SRS

Jeff:

 His name is Richard Heidecker, who was sending e-mails to Joe.  Mr. 
Heidecker claimed that he was fired from Enron because of an alleged 
disability.  Our investigation determined that there was no merit to his 
allegation.  However, Mr. Heidecker continued to attempt communications with 
Joe.  I felt that it was prudent  to alert OOC by the message below not to 
engage in unnecessary communications with potential litigants.  I have not 
heard anything from Mr. Heidecker in several weeks.  Please let me know if I 
can be of further assistance.

Jay, Jeff received a call yesterday from a 2nd year HBS student and 
co-founder of a B2B commerce company - Franz Edward Alphonse - who wanted to 
speak to Jeff (for the ever-popular "5 minutes") about his company.  Jeff has 
asked that you follow up with this gentleman.  His phone number is 
617.493.5597.

(Karen, I'm copying you in the event you have any information on Mr. Alphonse 
- i.e., did he interview w/Enron and if so, how did he do).

Thanks, Jay.  Please send Jeff a note with any update once you have spoken to 
Franz.

PS - I'm back from Italy and ready to have that drink whenever it works for 
you and Greg.  I understand he's out for a few weeks now while he moves his

Not a problem, Kimberly.  Thanks for the heads up.  If Franz calls before 
Monday, I'll transfer him to you.  SRS

Mr Skilling,

During the All Company meeting you mentioned the warehouse location on North 
Shepard where the
Broadband equipment was being assembled.

I and a couple of others would like to visit it. This would be useful to us 
who are responsible for categorizing 
types of material and getting them in the SAP Material Master via the Aspect 
Corporate Catalog.

Who can provide us the street address and allow us to visit?

Thanks,
 Brad Noble

Mr. Skilling is unavailable on January 17.  However, we appreciate the 
invitation.

Mr. Jeffrey K. Skilling 
President and COO 
Enron Corporation 

Dear Mr. Skilling: 

Building on the success of our special event held this past August in 
Houston, Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) has created a new 
service, the "Mexico Energy Advisory Service". Designed to help facilitate 
the dialogue between the energy community and key government decision-makers, 
this service creates an open environment for members to exchange ideas with 
the country's energy policy makers regarding the future of the Mexican energy 
sector and the role of private investment.

To launch this new service, we will be hosting the inaugural Mexico Energy 
Summit on January 17, 2001 in Mexico City at the JW Marriott Hotel. This 
event will bring together senior executives from the energy community as well 
as key members of the new Mexican government in interactive sessions aimed at 
facilitating dialogue between the public and private sectors.

We invite you to consider participating in this first Summit, and becoming a 
member of the service. To view the agenda for the first Summit meeting, as 
well as a description of the scope, benefits, and deliverables of the 
service, please visit our website at: 
http://www20.cera.com/event/details/0,1324,CID1287,00.html 

The goal of the Mexico Energy Advisory Service is to help bridge the 
information gap that now exists in Mexico's energy sector. Through our 
interactions with the private sector, the state owned energy companies, the 
new administration, the Congress, and other interested parties, CERA will 
formulate objective and independent market analysis, and will monitor the 
progress and pitfalls of the energy reform process in Mexico.

To view the complete details of the service, please visit our website at: 
http://www20.cera.com/offerings/details/0,1504,CID1286,00.html 

To participate in the Summit, please complete and return the enrollment form 
found on our website. Please note that a portion of the Summit fee may be 
applied toward your first year's membership in the service. Should you have 
any questions about the Mexico Energy Advisory Service or the Summit meeting, 
please contact me or my colleague Lauren Laidlaw.? I can be reached directly 
at +1 617 498-9191 or e-mail to abullrich@cera.com.? Ms. Laidlaw can be 
reached at +1 617 441-2604 or e-mail to llaidlaw@cera.com.

Mark,  

Jeff is considering taking Jeffrey on an African safari July 4-13, and was 
wondering if you would have any interest in joining them.  He is in the 
process of gathering information now and has not yet committed, but wanted to 
guage your interest.  He's looking primarily at the Ngorongoro conservation 
area and the Serengeti.  I can forward a proposed itinerary to you once 
received from the guides.

Please let us know if you're at all interested.

Dear Jeff,

A few months ago we talked about me working for Enron.  I am a long time
friend of John Miller...golfing and social...imagine that.

Though we did not find a position for me in your company things have gone
quite well.  I now have opened an office for Angus Systems Group in Atlanta.

Jeff...your company does a lot of facility stuff and our company is the
expert in web based applications for properties for work requests and
preventive maintenance.  Could you give me the name of the person in your
company that I could show our applications to?

Here is a little about our company and a brochure on a web, wireless and
paperless Tenant Request (work order) solution.

H.H.Angus and Associates is our "mother" company. www.hhangus.com   I work
> with Angus Systems Group Limited www.angus-group.com   Our experience in
> property management is second to none.   For 81 years we have designed
> buildings.  25 years ago we put Angus employees in buildings to manage
> them...just like you do.  For 20+ years we have been designing software
> for property managers.  The last 3 years we have been developing and
delivering
 the web based products called Angus AnyWhere.   We are the ASP.  Quite
simply we
are a web,wireless and paperless work order solutions company....designed
> especially for Property Management.

Jeff...you really need to look at what we do.  We are in fact the industry
leaders in systems that could do the whole of North America for your
company.

Happy Holidays,

Bill

I will tell Miller (the married man) that we are trying...somehow..some way
to do some business.

Dear Hilary,

The items Mr. Skilling purchased have arrived in Houston and I'm working with 
a customs broker to get them out of KLM Cargo.  The broker has indicated that 
the packing list and tax invoice are not descriptive enough to get the items 
out of customs, so I need to provide them with a detailed list of items, what 
they are made of and what he paid for them.  Unfortunately, Mr. Skilling is 
out of the country until January 2, 2001, and KLM will only hold these items 
until December 23 when they send them to some government warehouse.  If you 
could e-mail or fax me this information asap it is greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your assistance.

Mr. Skilling,
First, let me congratulate you on being appointed to CEO of Enron. Very 
exciting news!

Mr. Lay may have spoken to you about NewPowers' desire to be the premier 
energy provider to Enron employees.
- If you had a moment, please take the time to read and reflect on the 
opportunity of this project.
- As you will notice, I was assigned to lead the project and am looking 
forward to working with Enron (again).

I look forward to  the opportunity of seeing you again, while I am in Texas; 
and I hope that you will find it worth your while to provide input to this 
project.
Having a good understanding of Enron and it's culture, I strongly believe 
that your direct support will have a huge effect on the success of the 
project.

Below is the Email that Mr. Lockhart sent to Mr. Lay:

As part of NewPower's plan to enter Texas, we would appreciate your support 
to implement a plan to offer Enron Employees the opportunity to sign up to 
NewPower when deregulation opens on February 15th.  We believe that an Enron 
Employee Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity and customized offers to 
employees at Enron's partners could be a cost effective way for NewPower to 
help achieve our goal to be the branded choice of electricity in Texas  

We have developed some compelling "Consumer Driven" sign up incentives for 
Enron Employees such as "Guaranteed Savings - Free December" electricity, a 
aligned to a $20.00 NewPower ATM card and free companion airline ticket 
coupons. 
 
We would appreciate your help and support on the following:

Obtaining Enron Executive support/guidance for our proposed Enron Employee 
Exclusive offer for NewPower electricity. 
 - It would be helpful to have your personal endorsement linked to 
implementation assistance through Cindy Olson's HR group.
Guidance and support for a similar "Customized" offer to Enron's partners 
employees that might include Vincent & Elkins, Compaq, Arthur Andersen, 
Continental, University of Houston, University of Houston American Airlines.
   - We would appreciate any thoughts on other companies we should approach.
          - It would be helpful if you would consider sending  a letter or 
email of introduction to the companies CEO and head of Human Resources in the 
near future.
                  
To help you understand more about the proposed plan, attached, please find a 
copy of the plan highlights and draft creative that was sent by Nick Utton 
(Chief Marketing Officer) to Cindy Olson.  Nick is currently in discussions 
with Cindy on how to best implement this plan and has assigned Wilson Kriegel 
as the NewPower manager responsible for working through the details.  

I look forward to your input and help.  
This could go a long way in Texas towards our goal of NewPower being the 
national brand of "Energy Solutions".

Wilson Kriegel

Shack, 

Thanks for the nice note.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but I 
took a couple of weeks off for the holidays  immediately following the 
announcement.

The reunion was really great, and I'm sorry too that we missed each other.  
Next time you get to Houston, please give me a call (713.853.6894).  It would 
be great to get together and catch up.

Hope you had a great holiday and Happy New Year!

Craig_Shackleton@amat.com on 12/19/2000 12:52:42 PM
Rocky,
I saw the announcement of your promotion in the Austin paper a couple days ago
and wanted to send my congratulations.   I recall our freshman year, you wrote
your chemistry paper on energy, I wrote mine on semiconductors.  Little did we
know our initial interests as 18 year olds would become our careers.

Arends says he sees you regularly when you hold your financial reviews.  I
wasn't able to make it to his wedding.  Did you? If so, how was it?

Sorry we weren't able to connect at the reunion in October, I really hoped 
we'd
have a chance to catch up on what's happened since we last talked (maybe 15
years ago?).    Hope you aren't overwhelmed with the Beta egroups email 
banter.
It's been fun reacquainting with the brothers.  I'm getting together with Bill
Jordan next month in California on one of my trips.  I know you're busy, but 
if
you have a second, drop a reply.

I'm proud of your career accomplishments and our shared history and 
friendship.
Good work, worm.
Have a great holiday.

Unfortunately, due to Jeff's travel schedule, a meeting in January or even 
early February is not feasible.  I would be happy to schedule a meeting in 
late February or early March if that timing works for you.  Please call me 
should you wish to proceed on that basis.

Thank you and regards,

Dear Jeff,

Congratulations on being named Enron's new Chief Executive Officer.  What an
outstanding and well-deserved accomplishment.

Cary Maguire and Dean Niemi would like to make a trip to Houston in January
to visit with you if your schedule permits.  Cary is particularly interested
in touring the trading floor.  Would you please let me know if you would be
willing to meet with them and, if so, when the best time would be?  Thank
you.

Also, Liz Williams, SMU's Treasurer, met with Bart Schachter of Blueprint
several weeks ago.  She said his fund looks like a good opportunity.  She
shared with me that even though SMU is currently over its allocation to
venture and private equity and has therefore slowed down on new commitments,
the University's investment advisor is evaluating Blueprint.  She also told
me that decisions on venture and private equity can often take quite awhile.
I will keep you posted on any further developments that I learn.

Warm regards,

Suzanne

Thank you,

Jeffrey Skilling

Dear Jeffrey,

I'm writing in regards to your online strategy and in particular how you plan 
to build and scale your emerging online business and relationships.  
E-Business Relationships can mean a lot of things.  At it's core, it is 
understanding the needs of your customers, partners, and employees 
(collectively, your Business Community), and getting the right content to the 
right person to generate the greatest impact in the most timely and effective 
manner possible.

Strong e-Relationships increase retention rates, conversion rates and drive 
long term loyalty.  The idea is to make the internet your Business 
Communities' preferred channel for completing a transaction that is being 
offered, whether that is completing a support call, buying a product, 
registering for an event or service, enabling partner success, managing an 
account, training, or just acquiring information.

As Enron Corp looks ahead, it is important to continue to better understand 
who your Business Community are and in turn build online relationships with 
them.  Studies have shown that companies spend five times more on attracting 
new customers than on retaining the customers they have.  Attracting new 
employees can cost 10 times more than retaining existing employees, and in 
the energy business your reputation with your partners is critical to your 
success.

Vignette is the undisputed leader in Value Chain and eRelationship Management 
with the most robust platform, applications and services offerings in the 
industry.  With over 1200 customers, Vignette is helping our customers 
create, manage and automate their online relationships.  The Vignette 
Platform enables our customers to manage and automate the flow of information 
from their back office to their front office, from their suppliers to their 
customers, partners, and employees and all the way through eMarketplaces and 
exchanges.

Some examples of value we deliver to our customers include:

- Portals - Reliant Energy, Shell Oil, Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), 
Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA), Fidelity, Merrill Lynch, C/Net, 
ICQ, Industry Standard, iWon, United Airlines
- Knowledge Management - Encyclopedia Britannica, AMA, NotHarvard, Click2Learn
- Customer Self-service - 3Com, On Semiconductor, Bank One, Compaq, First 
Union
- eCommerce - FuelQuest, DownStream Energy, Land's End, Ingram Micro, 
Travelocity
- Partner Enablement - National Semiconductor, Compaq, AMD, NASD, Deutsche

- Syndicated Business Network - National Semiconductor
- Data Mining & Analysis- Amazon, Seagate
- Back Office Integration & Partner Exchanges- ExxonMobil, Grainger, 
AltaVista, Honda, Coca-Cola

I have included a case study done on Royal Dutch Shell that I think you will 
find informative as well as relevant to your business.  Over the next few 
weeks, you will receive a more detailed information packet from Vignette.

John, thank you for the report. I have asked Joe Dilg of Vinson & Elkins (w=

issues) and Rob Walls to look into this matter.  Jim

John Sherriff@ECT
01/31/2001 08:38 AM

=09

Eric Shaw's team has learned that an investigation has been initiated by th=
e=20
Turkish military to expose and eliminate corruption in the Turkish energy=
=20
sector.

On January 6, the military took seven energy sector bureaucrats into custod=
y.=20
In the following days, other officials from TEA? (the electricity generatio=
n=20
monopoly) and the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources (MENR) and=20
executives from a number of Turkish companies were also taken into custody.=
=20

While many of the bureaucrats and executives have been released, a leaked=
=20
report from the military investigators suggests that the operation is wide=
=20
ranging and may ultimately target the Minister of Energy and Natural=20
Resources and other senior energy sector bureaucrats and businessmen.=20

Enron Implications

Trakya - One Turkish newspaper has reported that Enron=01,s  478 MW Trakya =
power=20
project was being investigated.  This has not been reported anywhere else. =
=20
Because the power price at Trakya has been the target of criticism in the=
=20
past, we are not surprised by this report. Although an investigation is=20
always a possibility, other than the one newspaper report, there has been n=
o=20
indication, official or otherwise, that an investigation is planned or=20
underway.
=20
GAMA - It has also been reported that the wife of Gorkhan Yardim, the Gener=
al=20
Manager of BOTA? (the natural gas monopoly), works at GAMA, our Turkish=20
partner in the Trakya project, and that his expensive car was a gift from=
=20
GAMA. GAMA has told us, and Yardim has defended himself publicly by saying,=
=20
that his wife has been working at GAMA since 1993, long before Yardim had=
=20
risen to his current position of power at BOTA?, and that the car was not a=
=20
gift from GAMA. It is worth noting, however, that there have been a number =
of=20
newspaper reports questioning GAMA=01,s role in a controversial gas marketi=
ng=20
deal being undertaken by their TurRusGas joint venture with Gazprom and BOT=
A?.

Outlook

It is still not clear how or when this investigation will end. In the mediu=
m=20
and long term, this will be good news for Enron and other reputable Turkish=
=20
or foreign companies which have found it difficult to do transparent energy=
=20
deals in Turkey in the past. In the short term, however, it is likely to=20
result in a marked decrease in meaningful activity in the Turkish energy=20
sector, as worried bureaucrats, innocent and guilty, lay low.=20

We will continue to monitor developments, especially with regard to the=20
Trakya project, and report as necessary.

Dear Mr. Kester,  

We are in receipt of your letter dated January 26, 2001, regarding a 
sponsorship opportunity at Energy West's Summer Energy Conference.  Upon

Jeff,

As you may recall from our discussion on your visit to London last summer, 
one of the challenges we have in Europe is raising the external profile of 
Enron.  To help address this, I recently replaced Ralph in a group of UK CEOs 
which meet monthly, so I can continue to raise awareness of Enron's 
businesses and generally network.   At each lunch meeting which lasts around 
two hours, one of the CEOs makes an informal 20 minute speech on a current 
business subject of their choice and then a discussion follows.

The group has asked if you would like to chair the meeting in September 2001 
on a date of your choice.  At the end of this note there is a list of the 
current membership.  I have been to one meeting and only around a third 
attended.

Please let me know if you are able to commit time to this.  There is no 
problem if you decline.

Thanks, Matthew.  Let me know when I should have Jeff arrive in London in the 
event you or John Sherriff want to set up other customer meetings while he's 
there.  I will have him return to Houston on Friday, 9/28, but he could 
arrive in London as early as Tuesday, 9/25.  Let me know.  Thanks, SRS

Sherri - The date is Thursday 27th September in London.  It will be a lunch 
format with around 20 attendees.  We will be away from Enron House at a 
central London location (to be confirmed) between 12.15pm and 2.45pm.

Matthew, Jeff's soundbite is "the transformation of gas and electric 
markets."  Hope this helps.  SRS

Sherri - Let me have Jeff's preferred September dates and I'll make sure we 
get one of them fixed.

It would be helpful if Jeff could give me a sound bite to headline his 
discussion for the group.  One obvious area of interest is how Enron has 
transformed itself over the last ten years to the P/E ratio of 50+ we see 
today.  Another area of interest would be Enron's perspective of free 
markets, regulators and California.  Please let me know Jeff's preference.

Matthew

Matthew, my apologies for the delayed response.  Jeff is definitely 
interested in chairing the September 2001 meeting.  Please let me know if 
you  have any dates in mind and we'll see how they work on Jeff's schedule.

Jeff,

As you may recall from our discussion on your visit to London last summer, 
one of the challenges we have in Europe is raising the external profile of 
Enron.  To help address this, I recently replaced Ralph in a group of UK CEOs 
which meet monthly, so I can continue to raise awareness of Enron's 
businesses and generally network.   At each lunch meeting which lasts around 
two hours, one of the CEOs makes an informal 20 minute speech on a current 
business subject of their choice and then a discussion follows.

The group has asked if you would like to chair the meeting in September 2001 
on a date of your choice.  At the end of this note there is a list of the 
current membership.  I have been to one meeting and only around a third 
attended.

Please let me know if you are able to commit time to this.  There is no 
problem if you decline.

Dear Mr. Brannen,

Jeff has left for the day, so has not yet seen your note.  However, I wanted 
to let you know that the timing may not work on February 15.  He is attending 
a board meeting that morning, which is followed by a luncheon.  There is not 
much daylight in the afternoon, either, but I'll check with him first thing 
Monday morning to see if there is anything we can do to free up a few minutes.

Have a nice weekend.

Hi Jeff,

Update:  I am a good friend of John Millers in Atlanta. We actually met at
his wedding.

I am coming to Houston next week and have a 1:30 appt on the 15th.  with
Bill Donovan to demonstrate what we do...long story but he is excited to see
what we do.

I was thinking maybe we could grab an early lunch before the meeting.

Patti,

It was good to see you and Mike last night. 

I wanted to follow up on the MS150 - I can assure you that you will do fine 
without training (assuming, of course, that you have a bike).  I did it that 
way twice before with no major complications.  Given your running, you will 
do better.  It really is a lot of fun.

Sherri is checking to see if you can join the Enron team.  We will be the 
first team off on Saturday morning and the team has good facilities (tents, 
food, etc.) that improve the experience.  GO FOR IT!!

Jeff

PS - hi, Patti - this is Sherri.  I did check with our team captain and she 
said you could join our team so long as you do so by Friday.  She is going to 
e-mail all the necessary forms and information to me, which I will forward to 
you today if you are interested.  Let us know!  Hope all is well...

I look forward to seeing you Thursday evening, February 15, at the Texas 
Public Policy Foundation ("TPPF") event, "A Farewell Evening with Lady 
Margaret Thatcher."  Wendy Gramm, who serves on our Board, is the Chairman of 
the Board of the TPPF.  The TPPF is a state research institute guided by the 
core principles of limited government, free enterprise, private property 
rights and individual responsibility.  TPPF is similar in many respects to 
the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., but focuses on state issues.

Greetings Jeff, 

I am contacting you to inquire as to your interest and availability for a 
potential corporate directorship. 

In particular, I'd like to speak to you for a moment about an potential 
directorship at a British company with annual revenue of $5.4 billion. It is 
the global leader in education publishing and also has considerable growing 
interests as a provider of financial information and other media. The board 
meets seven times a year - three times in London, three times in the US, and 
once elsewhere. I would be delighted to speak with you on this in further 
detail if it is of interest and send full information.

If this particular opportunity is outside your interests,? then I would like 
to take a moment to discuss what types of directorships you would prefer.

Please don't hesitate to contact me at 312-993-0754 or by e-mail. 

I appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to hearing from you 
soon. 

Best regards,

Bill, many thanks for the invitation to speak at the the conference outlined 
below.  Believe it or not, I'm already committed to be out of the country on 
the dates of the conference, so I'll have to decline.  I do appreciate the 
offer, though.

It was nice hearing from you.  Take care, Jeff

<Bill_Meehan@mckinsey.com> on 02/20/2001 01:02:54 PM
Jeff, next October 23, 24, 25 in Laguna Niguel, Texas Pacific is hosting
their annual  portfolio company CEO conference (about 50 CEO;s in
attendance).  TPG ( a client of mine), you may know, is a premier private
equity investor--known best perhaps for Continental Airlines or if you ride
motorcycles Ducati,. $10billion in funds investment and good guys, you may
have met Jim Coulter, or David Bonderman or Bill Price, the senior
partners. They love to have you as their keynote speaker and I think it
would be worth your while.  Let me know if it works or whether I can
connect you up with them directly. I hope all is going well and
congratulations on your formal recognition as CEO.. Cheers Bill  P.S. Steve
Ballmer mentioned to me a couple of weeks ago that his meeting with you
last year was "one of the most influential he's had"
                    "Boyce, Dick"
thx for the effort here

10/23 dinner, 10/24 all day, 10/25 am
at ritz carlton, laguna nigel, near Newport Beach

I'm happy to call Jeff he and I arranged a mutually beneficial meeting last
year with a client CEO.  As always, who knows and the date ane place always
matter--Dick date and place?

                                         Subject:     Jeff Skilling for TPG
CEO Conference

Bill --

As we discussed by voicemail, it would be great if you could connect with
Jeff Skilling to see if he would be interested in speaking at the TPG CEO
conference on the topic of Growth. Kristina sent over to Dick a copy of our
growth pamphlet, which he may also wish to use at the conference.  Enron is
featured prominently in the pamphlet as a great example of a growth story.

By way of background for Jeff, TPG has combined funds of well over $10
billion under management including its most recent $4.5 billion fund.
Their investments are loosely split between telecom, high tech, Europe and
all other.  They also have partial interests in a number of specialty funds
including Newbridge (Asia and Latin American), Aqua (water-related
investments), Colony (real estate), Gryphon (early stage, growth) and a
number of others including newly created venture and crossover funds.
There will be over 50 CEOs at their conference, including Continental
Airlines, America West, Del Monte, Beringer, Ducati, Bally, and a host of
others.

I can't remember the exact date for the conference, but I think Dick
mentioned the fall time frame.

Please let me/Dick know if Jeff would be interested in speaking with Dick
further.

Dear Mr. Paul,

I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who asked me to let you know that he 
will send you a check in the amount of $200.  

While Jeff would probably be to modest to tell you himself, I thought you 
might be interested to know that he has been named the National MS Society's 
2000 Man of the Year, and will be honored at a dinner on September 30.  He 
has been a big supporter of the MS Society, primarily through his riding the 
MS150 from Houston to Austin since 1997.  This year's ride is April 15-16, 
and he has been busy collecting pledges - $20,000 so far, which will be 
matched by the Enron dollar-for-dollar.  Enron Corp. has the largest MS150 
team in the nation in terms of dollars raised, and this year our goal is 
$350,000.  It appears that our 378-person team has already blown through that 
goal and is well on its way to raising $400,000.  As MS has touched my 
family, I am very proud to be associated with a man and a company who so 
actively support research to find a cure.

I'm sure Jeff will write a personal note when he returns to town and sends 
his check.  In the meantime, good luck with your fund raising, and have a 
nice weekend.

Sherri Sera

To All Brother Beta's (and El!!),  3 weeks ago Woody Berry and I took a trip
to Rockford, Illinois to visit Phil Morrow, who has been struggling with MS
for the past 12 years.  The pictures tell the rest of the story.  I would
say that speaking for Woody that the trip was very bitter/sweet.  Bottom
line:  count your blessings, we never know what life has in store for us.

I will be hosting my Annual MS Walk/ Party in May.  I have done this for the
last 10 years.  I initially thought it would be a good thing for me to do as
I thought I had MS!!  Fortunately, my Neurologist thinks that I had a small
stroke back in '91 (never thought having a stroke would have been GOOD
news!!).

Now, I host the party in honor of Phil Morrow in hopes that we can find a
cure to help him.  As always, I collect donations from anyone and everyone
who is interested and/or able.  If you would like to send in a donation,
simply write out a check for whatever amount to:   NMSS (National Multiple
Sclerosis Society) and send it to:

Chuck Paul
6193 Forest Hills Dr.
Norcross,  Ga.  30092-4513

My email address is listed below.  If you have any other Beta's who you
think would like to see these pictures, please forward them on.

PS  First game at the new Ford Stadium on the SMU campus will be 9/2/00 at
6PM against KU.  Homecoming this year will be October 28th.  The new stadium
is looking GREAT!  I hope to be at both games but definitely at Homecoming.
Hope to see many of you there.  We will even have a 'tailgating' section
with 'adult beverages' allowed!!!

Jeff,

Thanks for getting back to me.  You probably saved us quite a bit of time and 
money.  

It looks like half of the City of London has been duped into helping E.ON 
fool its shareholders.  I wonder how many of their other sales were actually 
auctions versus pre-arranged sales dressed up for the shareholders.

We will start our brainstorming sessions over again with a new rule - no 
Germans!

Thanks again,

Joe

Please see the attached memo from Jeff and Ken.

Dear David,

At Jeff's request, I'm writing to let you know that he does not wish to meet 
at this time.  The current demands on his time dictate that he schedule only 
meetings of the highest priority.  His personal finances and investments are 
in order; therefore, he thanks you for the opportunity to meet, but 
respectfully declines.

Jordan Larimore, now that we are both reaffiliated with Lehman.
The proposed meeting was not about Lehman's Private Venture offering per se,
but rather about reestablishing a broader Private Client relationship
between you and Lehman.
I look forward to hearing from you and wish you well on your trip.

yet.  Should I wait to hear from you?  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS

FYI.

We are meeting with Joseph Dial next Tuesday, a former CFTC commissioner and 
friend of the Wendy Graham.  He had sent you a letter on March 1 about an 
options and futures exchange he was building called eWorldTradeX, Inc.  I 
don't know what he wants, but we are following up on it and we will let you 
know about it, if necessary.

Thanks.

Thank you for the invitation.  Your e-mail doesn't indicate what date you

Dera Mr. Skilling,

Just a short e-mail to invite you to a meeting that I will be having with
Carl Carter in your on-line development team at 1.00pm on the 27th floor in
your offices located at 1400 Smith.

Financial Market Solutions (FMS) is a leading financial software company
located in Bellevue, Washington. The company is dedicated to the development
and implementation of Internet-based trading solutions for institutions in
the global financial marketplace.  The central component of all FMS
solutions is the Universal Trading Platform (UTP), which is a dynamic
web-based platform that enables unlimited numbers of simultaneous users to
access the system and execute trades on a fully automated basis. This basic
premise distinguishes FMS from other solution providers and gives our
clients the ability to more effectively manage the liquidity of multiple
users, trading over the Internet on a single platform. The UTP has been
fully developed as a complete Foreign Exchange dealing system, however, the
same platform can be used for transactions in any tradable financial
instrument.

FMS has employed a team of expert software designers and technicians as well
as experienced professionals from the financial markets, who together have
designed and developed the UTP to transform the way the FX product is
delivered to end-users. The platform is equally suited to the needs of large
institutional users as well as retail investors. The FMS system, using the
latest technology, is the most advanced on-line trading system available
today and will likely shape the FX business model of the future.

We have made some majorprogress over the last 15 months and are poised to
announce some key relationships that will have a mojor impact in the FX
industry.

I understand that you are very busy, and that this invitation is unsolicited
but as they say nothing ventured nothing gained.

Kind Regards,

Dear Mr. Trice,

On behalf of Jeff Skilling, I am writing to thank you for the invitation to 
the CAM gala on April 6.  Unfortunately, Jeff will be unable to join you as 
he will traveling out of the country on that date.

With regard to your second invitation to meet your business partner next 
week, I regret to tell you that he is unable to accept the offer.  He will be 
in So. America, and therefore, will not attend the GS conference in Aspen.

Sincerely,
Sherri Sera

Jeff,

Two things:

Would you like to join Liz and me at the Contemporary Arts Museum Gala,
Friday, April 6th at 7.30, Bayou Club, Black Tie?

I would like to introduce you to my business partner, Clint Carlson in Aspen
next week.  He is going to attend the Goldman Sachs Natural Gas conference
March 18th - 21st .  Clint is the chief investment officer of our firm and
is the portfolio manager for our relative value arbitrage strategy (pairs
trading) which includes about $450mm in energy pairs.

Please let me know, Roy Trice, 214.932.9618.  

Mr. Krings,

I received your voicemail this morning.  On December 3, I forwarded this 
information to Mr. Mike McConnell, who in turn sent it to Mr. Jay Fitzgerald, 
Enron's Managing Director of e-Commerce.  He is the appropriate person with 
whom to follow up.  He can be reached at 713.853.6161.

Regards,

Mr. Skilling,

I'm Glenn Krings with Sterling Software in Omaha, Nebraska and I recently
sent you a Priority mail envelope with a letter introducing e_CURE.  In
talking to your secretary, it apparently got lost in the shuffle, so I'm
sending it as an attachment via e-mail. e-CURE is an important new service
to help you reduce the costs of electronic data transmission or EDI.  It
further helps you to insure that the business rules in deregulated energy
markets are followed.

If you have any questions or if you need additional information about
e-CURE, please call me at 402-291-8300 x291 or e-mail
glenn.krings@sterling.com.

Have a nice day,

Mr. Skilling,

I was compelled to contact you by the following information:
While reading eCompany Magazine March Issue, I came across the following
quote from Jeff Skilling CEO of Enron.

"Keeping the system up. You dread the chance the system will crash. We had
an air conditioning problem last April or May, and went down.
The next day the front page of Gas Daily Journal had a story that said "Gas
trading stops because Enron online is down.""

Netbotz offers early warning to just that type of failure and more.
http://www.netbotz.com

Mr. Skilling who would I contact at Enron to make them aware of a product
with a sub $1000. price tag to prevent those issues in the future?

Jeff:
In the March 2001 article of ecompany you recently made a statement about
what " Keep's
executives up at night?"  You were quoted:  "  Keeping the system up.  You
dread the chance
the system will crash.  We had an air-conditioning problem last April or
May, and we went down.
The next day the front page of Gas Daily Journal had a story that said, '
gas trading stops because
EnronOnline is down.'

I work with Availant, a software company in Cambridge, MA and our product,
Availant Manager, is
"self healing" technology.  It is proactive and autocorrective, designed to
monitor key system
resources and to take safe and effective action on an event before an outage
ever occurs. Recently,
Compaq decided to ship our software with every new Proliant server it
delivers to its customers.
It is brand-named Compaq Availability Agents.
http://www.availant.com/home.html

We believe our software could be of great value to Enron as the operation of
your online business is
so dependant on continuous server uptime.   If you would, please let me know
via email or phone the most
convenient way in which to schedule a meeting with the team who runs your
server operations.  I can be
reached directly at 617-374-7969.

I'd like to introduce you to?our company?and set-up a?one-hourconference 
call?and discussion with you?and/or?someone you?trustto evaluate?this 
opportunity.

iSpheres Corporationisco-founded by the Chairman of  Computer Science 
Department at California Institute of Technology.

iSpheres enables dynamic arbitrage opportunities in commodities  trading. 
With iSpheres, trading firms wrap applications like steel  marketplaces, 
energy marketplaces, demand planning systems, and production  planning 
systems as components, and derive additional business value by  monitoring 
these components for real time interdependent events and then  reacting to 
those?composite events  based on business rules.

iSpheres provides a software framework for developing and deploying these  
loosely-coupled Web Services or Meta-Applications. These applications are  
assembled from multiple components, each of which was previously itself an  
application and data source, to enable new business processes. 

For example, a $22 billion investment bank uses the iSpheres Meta  
Application Framework,?to  detect and react to interdependent market events. 
This enables them to optimize  and automate the acquisition and response to 
relevant dynamic?events in  their Market Intelligence information 
environment. 

The build out of the Internet and the rapid  deployment of eBusiness 
applications over last several years has established the  need and created 
the ability to build and deploy loosely-coupled Web Services or  Meta 
Applications. 

Please advise, otherwise I'll  follow up with you in 3-5 days.

Jeff,

Have we explored the possibility of a broadband partnership with the Disney 
Corporation? I watched an interview the other night with Michael Eisner, and 
he said several times during the interview that Broadband held the future for 
delivery of Disney's entertainment products, but Disney is still waiting for 
the broadband infrastructure and bandwidth to be developed.

Kristin's potential interest in attending Boston University.  Would you be 
willing to provide us with your phone number?

Please let us know if there is anything we can do to assist you with your 
future visits to Houston.  I looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Mr. Compton,

This meeting is most definitely on. My apologies if there has been any doubt 
on your part; however, Jeff has been traveling about 90% of the time since 
mid-February, which has put us a bit behind schedule.  I will be in touch 
with you soon to schedule a phone call with Jeff.

Regard,

Saturday - March 31 - Columbus - 8:00 AM - 56 miles - (hilly)
Here is the Conoco series, sponsored by Steve Moskowitz - This is ride #12, 
and there are 14 in the series, at a cost of $20 total.  Questions:  Patrick 
Scales at Enron - 713-345-3673.

You read the note right - it says we're starting from COLUMBUS, Tx!

Sorry this note is a day late and still missing a key detail - the exact
starting location - but due to the Round Top/Warrenton Antique Fair (100,000
visitors/day), we felt we needed to modify our route this Saturday.  There
is a hilly 56 mile route which starts in Columbus and covers many of the
same challenging hills as the ride originally planned but stays away from
Round Top, Warrenton, and Fayetteville and the busy roads immediately around
these towns.

Weekly Ride - Columbus, TX, Sat, 3/31 - 8 am

This week, we'll still get our hill training in and will have the
opportunity to climb the same hill (Lone Oak) that we would have had to
climb on the New Ulm route.  This ride is a 56 mile loop starting in
Columbus, hitting Lone Oak and Frelsburg and picking up beautiful
Zimmerscheidt Road going the other direction.  The Rides Around Houston book
gives this ride a score of "9" for exercise potential so look for some
hills.

The ride will start at 8:00 am sharp.  Columbus is an hour from the Sam
Houston Tolway/I-10 intersection so please allow yourself time to arrive in
Columbus by 7:15 am.

Directions to the Start - Beason's Park
We have permission to use Beason's Park as the starting off point.  Someone
is using the pavilion from 2:00pm to 7:00pm, and I told Judy that most of us
would be gone by then and we didn't really need the pavilion.  Beason's Park
does have restrooms, however, I will not vouch for the condition.

Beason's park is on US 90 just east of Columbus.  The most direct way is to
take I-10 to exit 698 (US 90 exit) and take US 90 west.  The park is on the
left hand side of the road just before the bridge over the Colorado river.
For those of you (like us) coming from Magnolia/The Woodlands the best way
is to take FM 949 to I-10.  We stay on the feeder which becomes US 90 at
exit 698.

If you want to pick up food or go to the bathroom before the ride, stay on
I-10 until exit 696 (Hwy 71).  There are convenience stores and bathrooms at
this exit.  At this point you can either take Hwy 71 north to US 90 and turn
right (east) to get to the park (which will be on your right just after the
bridge) or get back on I-10 to exit 698.

NOTE - As we get out into the country, I highly recommend stopping at the
local stores for your sport drinks, water, and a quick rest stop.  Your
drinks will be colder this way, you will have a timely rest stop, and the
local business will look forward to our return.

Here's a few reminders for those of you who are new to the list or have a
short memory:

Starting Time - 8:00 am - SHARP!
There were a lot of riders pulling into Cat Springs at 7:55 last Saturday.
If you arrive in Columbus after 7:30 and aren't fast at bike prep and
signing in, you'll get left at the start this week.  PLEASE allow time to
get to Columbus between 7:15 and 7:30.  Even though we're not riding to
Warrenton, we want to be off the roads as early as possible.

Check-in Process
Every rider is expected to sign in to indicate that they have started the
ride and sign-out on their return.  We have no way of knowing that you are
on the road and may need assistance if you don't sign in.  PLEASE arrive
early enough to sign in and remember to sign out when you finish the ride.

If you have completed the online or paper waiver, your name will appear on
the alphabetical sign-in sheets.  They are split up into groups of 5-6
sheets to speed up the sign in process so look for the clip board with your
name.  If this is your first ride and you haven't signed up online, you need
to complete a paper waiver and fill in your name on the blank sign-in sheet.
If you completed a paper waiver last Saturday and your name is not listed on
the alpha list, it's because you didn't sign the waiver (3 of you), you
signed one but didn't provide any emergency information, or I just couldn't
read your handwriting (5 VERY sloppy waivers last week!).  PLEASE arrive
early enough to fill out a legible waiver or slow down a minute when filling
it out.

I hate to harp on these details but it is vital that everyone help out to
ensure that you have a safe and fun ride.

Thanks!

Stan,

Per Jeff's request, I have forwarded the resume you attached to Philippe 
Bibi, President & CEO of Enron NetWorks.

Jeff would be interested in a tour of the building.  Would if the afternoon 
of May 8, at 3:30 would work for your schedule.  At Jeff's request, I plan on 
including Bill Donovan.

Thanks,
Joannie

Jeff,

How's it going in the world of energy?  I enjoy reading about you and your
adventures. Sounds like you might be having a little fun as well.

Attached is a resume from an acquaintance of mine.  Nice guy and would be
credit to anyone's organization.  Thought you  might forward it to
personnel.

Don't forget you've got a lifetime warranty on the drywall in your house.
My compliments.  Call me if you have any problems.  Also I walked your new
building last week.  Quite impressive, especially what we're having to
build on a tight schedule.  Should really be nice.  If you'd like a
personal tour, let me know.  I'd love to put you in a hardhat and introduce
you to the team that's doing all the work.  Would make a great shot for my
in-house publication and maybe yours as well.

Miss seeing you at our Forum meetings.  WPO is not as much fun as YPO.
Enjoy it while you can!

-Stan
                    "Brent R. Larsen"
Hi Stan:

It was good to meet you this morning. I've enjoyed working out with Joel;
he's a good "kid" and I can certainly relate to his Midwest roots and Iowa
State background. I grew up on a grain/livestock farm in Gladbrook, Iowa, a
town of under 1,000 people, and did my BS at Iowa State and MBA at Kansas
University.

I'm currently working as Director, Business Development at RedMeteor.com,
an
internet-based energy brokerage company. We compete against Altra Energy,
EnronOnline, InterContinentalExchange and HoustonStreet. We started with
$22
million in venture capital, but need an additional infusion of capital to
build out our business model. I think it's going to be difficult for us to
attract additional funding in this climate, so I'm interested in making a
move to another employer when I find the right fit.

As I mentioned this morning, I've been talking with Conoco recently (my
previous employer for 9 years) as well as Enron's Broadband Services group.
I'm looking for a Houston-based business development position that would
build on my eCommerce experience at RedMeteor or my oil & gas pipeline
operations background. I've also met with Reliant Energy recently although
I
understand they've suspended hiring in their trading/eCommerce groups due
to
the California crisis.

Any suggestions you would have would be appreciated. Thanks for your time.

Christie, do Sherri or I need to do anything to send the survey from Jeff's 
e-mail?

Thanks,
Joannie

Jeff and Sherri,

As Jeff and I descussed briefly on the Dallas trip, Enron is involved ina 
5-yr research relationship sponsored by Stanford, in conjunction with 
McKinsey entitled "GLOBE"--it's looking at how Global companies manage 
themselves, internal communication networks, etc.

Part of the yearly plan is to conduct an emplyee survey of approximately 100 
"global" employees. I've taken the survey myself--it takes less than 15 
minutes--it's very easy and doesn't require revealing anything sensitive we'd 
be concerned about. Clicking on the invitation letter will provide a direct 
link to the survey, so please feel free to review the survey itself, or even 
take it.

We can best benefit from the data gathered if we get a good return on our 
survey.  We're likely to have the best chance of a good return if the 
invitation letter to participate comes from Jeff.

Would you please read the attached letter? If you give it your consent and 
approval, we can arrange to have the survey sent from Jeff's mailbox.

Please let me know--thanks!!

--Christie.

Hi Christie !!
 
  Please send me the survey invitation letter.  Also, I will send you a copy 
of the random list of respondents for your review tonight.  As I mentioned to 
Gerry, the survey is already developed and hosted by the Stanford/McKinsey 
group; therefore, there is no additional development work required.  
Typically, I would use our in-house survey tool, confirmit, to build and 
deploy surveys.  This is a special case where the survey link is already in 
place.  My specific deliverable for you would include the list of 100 random 
individuals and a mechanism for the deployment.  The same manner in which 
Gerry and I received the survey can be used for the 100 random individuals.  
That is, simply mailing the survey link along with the invitation letter to 
each individual via Lotus Notes.  This is not a typical function of my area; 
however, I am glad to lend assistance in this case.  

In the future, should you require a survey built from "scratch" 
(so-to-speak), I will be able to assist you in that process.  Thank you for 
your patience.

Regards,
Milton

Hi Milton and Gerry!!

I can prepare the survey invitation letter.  Shall I send it to both of you?  
When do you think we can expect to be ready to send the survey?

Thanks to both of you!

--Christie.

Can you do lunch on Thursday?  Just for fun, but to also pick your brain 
about roses.

Joannie

How about 9:00 a.m. on the 9th?  Bill Donovan will join in on the tour.

Thanks,
Joannie

hats!

Dear Mr. Skilling:

My name is Tony Kishindo and I am the Senior Market Analyst for DeWolff
Boberg and Associates. I am approaching you with hopes of scheduling some
time on your calendar for an introductory meeting between yourself and my
Vice President, Scott Bein.

The meeting is 45 minutes long and we are not looking for any sort of
commitment or decision at this point. We realize you may not be considering
the services of an outside resource, now or in the foreseeable future. We
non-the-less would appreciate the privilege of meeting with you, determining
the compatibility of our two firms, and earning a place in your Rolodex.
Regardless of the outcome of this meeting, we sincerely appreciate your
kindness and courtesy.

We offer our clients guaranteed process improvement and operations cost
reduction. We guarantee a 20% - 30% increase in production in as little as 8
months. The reason the results are so quick is because we are not technology
peddlers, we focus in on people, equipment and materials which we have found
to be any companies most valuable assets. We offer our clients a security
blanket when it comes to process improvement. Please feel free to visit our
home page at, www.dewolffboberg.com.

Thank you for your time, I look forward to scheduling 45 minutes of your
time at your nearest convenience.

Sincerely,

Tony Kishindo

David, just heard that you joined the 2001 Enron MS150 team - 
congratulations!  Look forward to seeing you out at Tully Stadium on the 20th.

Jeff

Mike, I received a voicemail from Matt Khourie tonight regarding the 
presenters.  Apparently, Jeff's recollection that Matt was to contact the 
presenters was inaccurate; Matt indicated that it had been agreed that you 
would contact the presenters and he would be responsible for arranging the 
SUN demonstration.  

With Jeff out of town until Monday, I would really like to have someone 
contact the presenters before the end of the week.  Is this going to be 
possible?  I'll call you tomorrow to follow up.  In the meantime, below are 
the links to the presenters' bios, which I believe include their phone 
numbers.  Let me know if you have any trouble launching any of them.  

Additionally, I spoke to Penny this morning regarding the number of RSVPs we 
have to date.  I'm very concerned about space and would like you guys to 
reconsider the buffet idea, with seating scattered around the facility, and 
the meeting room set up "class room" style.  If we go with the plated 
breakfast and have 120 people seated around 12 "10-tops," there will be no 
space for a screen, podium, AV equipment, etc.  If we have more than 120 
people (I think the number this morning was 104 with reservations continuing 
to come in), we will not have enough space to seat everyone in the meeting 
room.  In talking with some of the others who have planned breakfasts for the 
YPO group, I've been told that many YPOers do not show for the breakfast and 
will walk in just in time for the presentations.  I think you guys and Jeff 
are scheduled to meet next Tuesday, so perhaps that can be discussed then.

I'll give you a call tomorrow, Mike.  Thanks, SRS

Eurasia Group is pleased to announce a breakfast roundtable in the next in
our Eurasia Forum series:

TURKEY'S POLITICAL STABILITY with TANSU CILLER, FORMER TURKISH PRIME
MINISTER

Discussant: TBD

Chair: Ian Bremmer, President, Eurasia Group

DATE: Friday, 4 May 2001
TIME: 8:30am - 10:00am
PLACE: Eurasia Group Executive Offices
461 Fifth Avenue, 14th Floor (enter on 40th Street)
New York, NY  10017

A public row between the Turkish president and prime minister in
mid-February sparked market turmoil that resulted in an overnight 30%
devaluation in the lira and a crash of the IMF-backed stabilization program.
These events led to the resignations of the central bank governor and
treasury undersecretary and have tested the staying power of the country's
three-party government coalition.  In response to this instability, the
Turkish government appointed former World Bank Vice President, Kemal Dervis,
as the new Minister of Economics in hopes of resuscitating the country's
fledgling economy.

Ciller was elected Prime Minister in June 1993; her True Path party led
several coalition governments until 1996.  After losing her seat in 1996,
her party formed a coalition with the center-right Motherland Party which
was followed by an alliance with the conservative far-right Welfare Party.
The later move resulted in heightened tension between True Path and the
military and business establishment.  In the current financial turmoil, Ms.
Ciller has attempted to reposition herself as a force that will regain the
nation's financial and political stability.

Dear Mr. Thornton,

We are in receipt of your letter to Jeff Skilling dated March 30, 2001.  Jeff 
has been traveling for the past 2 weeks; however, I wanted you to know that 
your letter was received and that you will receive a response as soon as 
practical.

In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I may be of further 
assistance.

Hi Sherri!

I actually sent Gary an email this morning, thanking him for the idea.  I 
don't think it is something we would want to pursue at this point - though it 
isn't a bad idea.

Hope all is well with you.

Diomedes, I have been searching high and low for this information for you, 
and I think I may have found something.  I have a letter from you to Jeff 
dated November 15, 2000, regarding a wire transfer in the amount of 
$110,109.00.  It broadly outlines expenses and references an attached report, 
which I unfortunately do not have.  Would this letter be of any help to you?  
Please let me know, and I'll be happy to send it right to where ever you 
designate.  SRS

Hi Jeff,

I was trying to get a copy of the expense report of Swanswalk (the company
we set up to buy the house in Rio) and I discovered that unfortunately my
copy is in the boxes I sent to London from Brazil and they still have not
cleared customs in the U.K. If you recall, I sent you a copy of the report a
few months ago and I was wondering if you kept a copy in your files. If you
did can you please fax me a copy in the U.K at 011-44-2078239871?

Thanks and I hope all is well with you.

Diomedes.

Hi, Diomedes.  I just tried to reach you on your cell phone (713.539.6731)
for Jeff.  Could you please give him a call at your earliest convenience?
713.853.6894 is his number.  Thanks, SRS

Tiffany, I'm waiting to hear from Jeff to see if he wants to speak to each of 
the panelists separately as I am finding it difficult (impossible so far!) to 
find a time that all are available.  Too many busy people.  I shall be back 
in touch with you as soon as I can have the conversation with Jeff.  My 
apologies for the delays and slow communication.  Thanks very much for your 
patience.  SRS

Tiffany Roach <troach@Greylock.com> on 04/11/2001 01:59:32 PM
Hi Jeff: 

We will have to find another time to schedule a phone call with David...he

Hi, Mark.  Hope you enjoyed Italy - I was in Capri and Positano a couple of 
weeks ago and loved it!

Jeff asked me to write you to see if the plan he is hatching will work for 
you...

He and Jeffrey will fly into Istanbul, arriving on June 24 (he asked me to 
see if you knew the name of the hotel on the Bosporus - sp?)  They would stay 
there until about the 28th or so, then the three of you would head to Nairobi 
and stay at a few places.  Jeff mentioned Mt. Kenya Safari Club and another 
place I can't even begin to spell or pronounce, but I'll figure that out 
later...

You will need to be in Kilimanjaro for the safari on July 4.  The rough 
sketch of the safari is as follows:

7/4 Arrive Kilimanjaro; overnight (O/N) at the Polo Club
7/5 Charter flight to Ngorongoro (fly over Mt. Kilimanjaro); O/N at 
Ngorongoro Crater Lodge
7/6 Ngorongoro Crater tour; O/N at Crater Lodge
7/7 Drive to Monduli GCA; O/N Monduli TGTS camp
7/8 Hiking in Monduli; O/N Monduli TGTS camp
7/9 Flight to Kirawira, western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp
7/10 Western Serengeti; O/N Kirawira tented camp
7/11 Flight to Rubondo Island; O/N Rubondo Island camp
7/12 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp
7/13 Nile Perch fishing at Lake Victoria; O/N Rubondo Island camp
7/14 Charter flight to Arusha; depart later that evening for the States/Turkey

Hope it sounds good to you.  Please let me know and I'll begin making flight 
arrangements, etc...I'm also collecting all the information with regard to 
required Visas and innoculations (there is a long list!); I'll pass that on 
when I receive it.

I'm heading to Las Vegas tomorrow for a long weekend, so will be in touch 
again early next week.  

Take care, SRS

Gentlemen,

Messrs. Micheal Holthouse and Matt Khourie (Jeff's co-hosts of the April 24 
YPO event) invite you to join them at dinner on Monday evening, April 23.  
Reservations have been made in Matt Khourie's name at Capital Grille, located 
at 5365 Westheimer Road (in the Galleria area), at 7:00 p.m.  Should you need 
transportation to the restaurant, I will be happy to make those arrangements 
for you.

Please send me a note confirming your attendance at this dinner.  I look

Stan, Jeff will be travelling the biggest portion of May.  Would you let us 
know the next time Ali is in the US and I will try to work something out for 
them to meet.

Thanks,

stanmarek@marekbros.com on 04/12/2001 11:05:55 AM
Jeff,

Happy Easter!

A few years ago at the YPO Harvard University, I met a guy from Venezuela.
He and I have kept in contact through the years and we get together from
time to time.  We had dinner a few days ago and he asked me if I thought
you might be interested in meeting with Ali Rodgrigues.  Ali will be in the
US sometimes in May and may be available to meet.  He and my buddy have
been friends for years and I thought I'd extend the offer.  I don't know if
there is an agenda or not.  Those guys are hard to read.  Just let me know
if it's something you want to do.  Otherwise I'll just forget about it.

Keep that stock going up!

-Stan

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to 
Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this 
weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise 
$50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you 
consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Sherri :-)

Thanks for the pledge, Loretta!  This was most definitely not directed at you 
- I just wanted each of the assistants to know that I had solicited their 
executive...again...so I bcc'd the assistants.  Thanks for the very quick 
turnaround.  SRS  

Sherri - Rebecca says to put her down for $500...and you can put me down for 
$25...I'm always glad to have made these contributions when I'm doing my 
taxes and I just finished that little exercise!!!  Loretta

$50,000 is pre-match, so I guess the ultimate goal is $100,000 (Like the poor 
guy doesn't have enough pressure!).  Mark, this is very generous of you.  
Good luck with your ride and I'll see you in LaGrange!  SRS

Jeff,

My name is Samuel Pak, and I'm an Analyst in the A/A program.  I will also be 
riding the MS150 with you and the Team this weekend.  As I did last year, I 
am writing an article on the MS150 for the Encounter.  As such, I was hoping 
that maybe we could chat a few minutes at lunch in Bellville or at dinner in 
La Grange.  If this is OK with you, I will find you and introduce myself, and 
we can go from there.

Much Thanks!
Sam.

Hi, Kristin,

Your Dad asked me to let you know that he got your message.  He would like to 
meet you at Maggiones (the place you two met for lunch the first time).  I'm 
making a reservation for you guys in his name at 1:00 p.m. 

Would you please reply to this e-mail so I know you got it?  Thanks, Kristin, 
and have a nice lunch.

Sherri

Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no 
problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner was 
cancelled.

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need 
for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility; 
it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make 
arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from 
where.

The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will 
begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and John 
Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the panel.

I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today, 
so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to call 
me should you have any questions or need additional information as I will not 
have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.

Regards, SRS

Kevin, I'll have a sedan from Beal's (713.731.9233) pick you up at the Four 
Seasons and bring you to the facility.  Once you get inside, there will be a 
check-in table - the ladies manning that table can direct you to Jeff.  Would 
you like me to have the sedan stand by to tke you to the airport or another 
destination following the panel (which will end between 9:30 and 9:45)?  
Please advise.  Thanks, SRS

It would be a HUGE help if a car could meet me at the Four Seasons (1300

scenario-planning project conducted by some of the most prominent Houston
business leaders.

The Board of the Center for Houston=01,s Future recently committed
resoundingly to the creation of Goals and a Strategic Plan for Houston that
will allow our community to achieve its extraordinary potential over the
next decisive 20 years.  This landmark program, already underway, will be
assisted by many dedicated volunteers from throughout the community.  Led
by Chairman Gene Vaughan, the Center, an affiliate of the Greater Houston
Partnership, is focused on very tough questions:  The world and Houston are
changing rapidly - what will be the new reality in 20 years and beyond?
What do we want Houston to be?  What are the obstacles and trade-offs?
Most of all, what plans, resources, determination and leadership are
necessary now to get Houston to its desirable future?  If you are
interested in what can be done to give Houston a great future worthy of its
past - and particularly if you want to get involved - this is an
outstanding opportunity to discourse with one of the citizens leading the
charge.

Gene Vaughan is chairman and founder of Vaughan, Nelson, Scarborough &
McCullough, L.P., an investment management firm originated in Houston in
1970 whose Investment Counsel and VNSM Trust Company manage securities
portfolios for foundations, endowments, corporations and families.

Within his profession, Mr. Vaughan was founding chairman and governor of
the Association for Investment Management and Research, a past chairman of
the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts and a past chairman of the
Financial Analysts Federation.  He is chairman and has served as a director
since 1970 of Dreyfus Founders Group of mutual funds (Denver).

Mr. Vaughan has been a trustee of Vanderbilt University (Nashville) since
1972.  He is a director since 1990 and on the Executive Committee of the
Greater Houston Partnership.  He is Chairman of the Center for Houston=01,s
Future whose mission is to help prepare Houston proactively for future
opportunities and challenges.  Mr. Vaughan is a director of the Houston
Grand Opera Association, a trustee of Goodwill Industries and past chairman
of The Houston Forum.  He was founding chairman of Presbyterian School
(early childhood through grade 8) and served as a trustee of St. John=01,s=

Dave, do you have a date and location in June?  The month is filling up 
quickly, but if they can be flexible, we can probably work it out if Jeff is 
interested.  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS

Jeff, 

I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management 
team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future 
relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his 
direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of 
Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the 
same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard 
you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the 
conference.

Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our 
commercial and real estate business.

Let me know your interest.

Angela - thanks for making time to have dinner with us on Wednesday:  it
was great to see you.

As Art mentioned, since the time we have started working with you, we have
made frequent references to our operating teams about Enron's
accomplishments in the areas of customer excellence and employee
satisfaction.  More generally, we've held Enron out as an example of a
highly accomplished company in all the areas Macerich is currently focusing
on as an organization (operational integration, customer orientation,
scalability, change leadership, and strategic focus).

All of that being said, we would be extremely appreciative of an
opportunity to have either Jeff Skilling or Dave Delainey speak at either
of these conferences.  In any event, we're delighted that you would make an
effort to see if this can be put together.

Relative to upcoming Macerich events, there are two scheduled:

(1) University of Notre Dame Executive Education Program, May 7 - 9 in
South Bend.  The curriculum is centered on change leadership and strategic
thinking (officially "Enhanced Leadership and Strategy in the New
Economy").  Attendees include our Executive Team (Art, David, Rick,Tom, Ed,
and Larry Sidwell) and our Operating Team (17 SVPs).  There is also a
round-table discussion scheduled with our Board on May 9.

(2) Macerich's Company Conference, June 4 - 7 in Park Cities, Utah.  The
emphasis of the conference will be on our "e-Business Transformation" (more
specifically on becoming wholly integrated across functional roles,
customer facing, and highly scalable) and capturing value in our "Value
Network" (relationships we have with retailers, partners, vendors,
shoppers, etc.)  The attendees for this event include the same people at
UND as well as our managerial professionals from the malls and our
corporate offices (about 250 people, total).

Let me know if you need any additional background or information.

Eric

Dave, please disregard my previous e-mail about the date and location in 
June, unless June 4-7 in Park City, UT, is not it.  As Jeff has to be in 
Wyoming on the evening of the 7th, it is possible that he speak in Park City 
that morning and then go on to Wyoming for the dinner he's attending there.  
I'll be back in touch once Jeff has seen this e-mail and responded with his 
interest...SRS

  Hi, Kristin,

  Your Dad asked me to let you know that he got your message.
He would like
  to meet you at Maggiones (the place you two met for lunch
the first time).
  I'm making a reservation for you guys in his name at 1:00

The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting 
firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, 
their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the 
project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to 
those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in 
the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it 
seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by 
asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices 
and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by 
surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. 

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our 
participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network 
Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 
minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will 
be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific 
practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If 
you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those 
of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the 
survey.  

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for 
contributing to this important learning opportunity.

To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and 
simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron 
Company Code, which is: 

C673EV

To begin the survey, click on the link below:

Thank you.

Good morning Stan.  I am holding 11:00 - Noon on Wednesday for the building 
tour.  I think it would be okay to meet Jeff and Bill Donovan in the lobby.  
Unfortunately Jeff will be leaving to go out of town right after lunch, so I 
don't think that the tour of the Hobby Performing Arts Center will work for 
Wednesday.

Thanks and have a great weekend.

Just a reminder about the job tour on Wednesday.  I will be in San Diego
until Tuesday night so I wanted to check in today.  I will be happy to come
to Jeff's office to pick him up or we can meet in the lobby. Just give me a
time and I'll set it up.  I will also be available to show him the Hobby
Performing Arts Center if he has time.

Jay,

I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is 
little overlap.  Having said that, however, I'd like to keep a "last veto" 
right - just give me a call when you've got something.

Good luck to you in the future, Jay.  You'll be missed at Enron.

Best regards,
Jeff

Jay Fitzgerald@ECT
05/09/2001 08:55 AM
Jeff-

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  
For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley 
about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily 
for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, 
while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it 
is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I 
will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term 
Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital 
community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future 
payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some 
very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to 
cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think 
that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if 
I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer 
enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned 
professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this 
note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too 
presumptuous!).

Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not 
wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep 
up the great work!

Jay

Karen, heres the version of the PRC memo you should use.  Please call if you 
have any questions.  SRS

Unfortunately, Jeff doesn't have any information on Rick Barsky.  Would you

Through YPO International, we got a membership inquiry from Rick Barsky,
CEO of Agennix(don't know what company does).  He apparently used to work
at Enron.  Bio says he was involved in start up of Enron Renewable Energy
Corp. and Enron Solar.  Any input you can give us on this guy?

Dear Hilda,

Jeff has asked me to forward Sophia's resume to Celeste Roberts, director of 
the associate and analyst program, and to Beth Tilney, who oversees 
recruiting for marketing and communication graduates.  They will review her 
resume and determine if there is a match between Enron's needs and Sophia's 
background and skillset.

Thank you, Hilda, for forwarding Sophia's resume.

Hello Jeff

A voice from the past.  Hope you are doing well.

I wanted to gain your assistance to point me to the most appropriate person
I could interview at Enron.  I am helping a client understand how companies
in the US Natural Gas and Power industry are coping with the challenges in
their industry in terms of developing and retaining the "right skills".
So, someone who could provide an external perspective of how players in the
industry are coping with the challenges as well as an internal perspective
on Enron would be great for me to interview.  If that means more than one
individual, that is fine too.

Hope this is not too much of an imposition.  I'll undertake the
conversation over the telephone and keep it short.

You can reach me on email: sgiridha@prismintl.com or on my cell phone:
240-603-6084.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

=01&Raising Children of Character in A World of Affluence=018
Dinner and Discussion Club

Join us for a new type of Harvard Club experience.  Ever wanted to talk
substantively about a topic, while having a great dinner, but were afraid
that your dinner guests would not be able to go the distance with you in
the conversation?  We have the solution.

Modeled after a format that members David and Anne Grizzle and Danguole
Spakevicius and William Altman have been enjoying for years, the Harvard
Forum will provide an opportunity for an extended conversation with fellow
club members.

The format works like this:  we=01,ll have dinner, and then a panel of Harv=
ard
grads will give brief introductions to the evening=01,s topic from their
perspective, and then we will all engage the topic for ourselves, first in
a large group and then in small groups.  The panel members will be
knowledgeable, but not so expert that anyone will be intimidated.  They
will, however, be provocative to assure that the subsequent conversation is
lively.  You will come away knowing your fellow club members better than
ever - maybe better than you ever wanted.

The topic we=01,ve picked is one with which many of us have struggled.  Our
children may be growing up in a world far more affluent - privileged - than
we enjoyed.  How imperiled is their character by our success?  What
practical steps can we take to insure that we pass along to them the
character values that we treasure?

We plan to schedule a Harvard Forum every quarter.

Because of the format, attendance is limited.  Please respond as indicated
below.

When:    Friday, May 18, 7:30 p.m.
Where:   Briar Club, 2603 Timmons (East Briar Room)
Cost:      $35.00 per person

Reservations:  Email dottie@kerr-solutions.com or call 281/424-3084
(Payment must be made at time of reservation by credit card or mailing
check to 3413 Cobblestone Lane, Baytown, TX 77521-1956.)

For further information, contact David Grizzle (david_grizzle@yahoo.com or
713-324-2966) or Danguole Spakevicius (danguole@fempartners.com or
713-665-4218).

Dear Mr. Skilling:

I write on behalf of Jerry Murdock, who is currently in Europe.  Mr. Murdock

one of your fellow invitees.

The purpose of your conversation with Mr. Murdock is to discuss the above in
more detail and to more fully brief you on the purpose of these dinners.

Due to the fact that Jeff is unable to attend on July 19, I believe it would 
be better to reschedule the call for sometime next quarter.

In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense.  
Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of 
Jeff's time is committed through February 2002, so knowing what the

free up some time.  Thank you.

brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?

Thank you, Erica.  I'm waiting to Jeff to return from a meeting (within an 
hour or so).  He is currently scheduled to be in Europe the week of September 
24, so at this time, he is not available for a September 25 dinner.  I'll 
advise as soon as I have a chance to speak to him.  Thanks again for your

Sheri:

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Gil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, 
but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy 
travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has 
turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit 
the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. 
Quackenbush calls we will decline.

It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.

Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-)

Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet with
them.

Regards,

Gil Marmol

Thanks for the update, Jay.  If this guy doesn't have time to talk to you, he 
just not want to do business with Enron too badly!  I wouldn't waste a whole 
lot of time on this.  Happy Easter...SRS

I have been in contact with this guy.  He didn't have time to speak on first 
contact, so we set up a time to talk on Monday, and he did not call and was 
unavailable when I rang him.  Looking forward to his return call...

Jay, Jeff received a call yesterday from a 2nd year HBS student and 
co-founder of a B2B commerce company - Franz Edward Alphonse - who wanted to 
speak to Jeff (for the ever-popular "5 minutes") about his company.  Jeff has 
asked that you follow up with this gentleman.  His phone number is 
617.493.5597.

(Karen, I'm copying you in the event you have any information on Mr. Alphonse 
- i.e., did he interview w/Enron and if so, how did he do).

Thanks, Jay.  Please send Jeff a note with any update once you have spoken to 
Franz.

SRS

PS - I'm back from Italy and ready to have that drink whenever it works for 
you and Greg.  I understand he's out for a few weeks now while he moves his 
family to Houston...

Stephanie, I don't have all of Jeff's pledges collected yet!  Do you want 
what I have (about 65%) or shall I wait until all have been collected?  I'll 
send out another e-mail today to the slackers ;-)  Let me know.  SRS

If you haven't already done so, please turn in your MS150 pledges TODAY to 
either Stephanie Strong (EB2365c)
Becky Pham (EB2336b)
or Amelia Alder (3Ac3120).

Thanks.

Dear Mr. Morgan,

On behalf of Jeff Skilling, thank you very much for the invitation to speak 
to the San Diego Chapter of YPO.  Jeff was very flattered and somewhat 
intrigued by your offer.  However, given the current demands on his time, he 
must respectfully decline your invitation.

Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level 
representative of Enron speaking to your group, and I'll be happy to do what 
I can to facilitate that for you.

Again, Mr. Morgan, thank you and the San Diego Chapter of YPO for the the 
opportunity.

Hi Jeff.

I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the "truth").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.

I will schedule a "special" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Ronnie Morgan

Stephane, I'll be sending to you today checks totaling $22,063.73, which 
represents 53% of the $41,386.23 total pledges.  I'll be contacting people 
today to collect outstanding pledges and will send a "care package" to you 
daily with what I collect.  SRS

If you haven't already done so, please turn in your MS150 pledges TODAY to 
either Stephanie Strong (EB2365c)
Becky Pham (EB2336b)

Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke 
with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in 
financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set 
relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also 
interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; 
likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of 
the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am 
highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston 
through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any 
opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Best regards,
Michael Kuntz

Hi, Kristin.  Your Dad asked me to write you and suggest that the two of you 
meet for lunch tomorrow at Grotto on Westheimer at 1:00 p.m.  They don't take 
reservations, but the lunch crowd should have cleared out by that time.  Let 
me know if that's ok with you or if you decide not to drive and need him to 
pick you up.

Have a good time.  SRS

Hi again, Kristin.  Just wanted to make sure you received my e-mail yesterday 
about meeting your Dad at Grotto (on Westheimer) at 1:00p.  Send me a note 
back and let me know, ok?  Thanks, SRS

Kristin - you're right!  I didn't realize you and your Dad had talked this 
morning.  Sorry for the confusion!  SRS

Hi, I thought that we decided to meet at Carrabais on kirby.
Thanks KLS

Dear John,

On May 9, 2000, you sent a cover memo along with a business proposal for CMI 
to Jeff Skilling.  That e-mail was inadvertently deleted, but fortunately not 
before Jeff saw a printed copy.

Jeff has asked that you send that e-mail to Dan Leff in EES for review.  Upon 
his review, a determination will be made as to whether or not Enron will 
pursue this opportunity.

Thank you for your assistance in this matter.

Regards,
Sherri Sera

Hi, Mark.  The itinerary is changing a little bit with regard to where you 
are staying while in Africa, so I will forward the latest and greatest as 
soon as I get it.  Probably sometime late this week...

Just wanted to be sure that you are working on getting your Tanzanian visa 
and getting the required shots.

Congratulations on the new job - I guess this means you'll be staying for a 
while?

Sherri

Amelia, I was able to collect the remainder of the pledges ($5,140).  Please 
let me know where you are located, and I'll try to get it over there today.  
If you happen to be in the building and want to stop by, that's fine, too.  
Katherine knows where it is if I'm not at my desk.  SRS

test worked!  Jeff is out of town today, so I'm responding on his behalf.  SRS

Hello, Mike.

11:30 still works for Jeff.  Why don't you meet him at the Enron Building 
(1400 Smith Street) - I think you had mentioned that you wanted a quick 
tour.  You'll have to check in at the security desk in our lobby; I'll make 
sure they know that you are expected so they'll give you a visitor badge and 
send you to the 50th floor.

I'm not sure yet where Jeff plans to take you for lunch - anything in 
particular you like?  SRS

Mike Buttrey <Mike_Buttrey@mhbt.com> on 05/19/2000 03:10:27 PM
jeff, i just wanted to confirm lunch on thursday, may 25.? i believe sheri 
and i agreed to around 11:30.? however, i should be very flexable as i have 
an early morning appointment and should be done around 10:30. 

look forward to seeing you.

Jeff's response to this inquiry is:

"No - just a social visit - he seems to be trying to make it soound like 
something very different."

Hope this helps - call if you need clarification.  Thanks, SRS

Jeff,

We spent quite a bit of time over the past several months discussing a 
possible minority investment of about $5MM in Silicon Energy.  We have broken 
off those discussions because (1) their proposed pre-money valuation of 
$150MM was, in our opinion, excessive, and (2) our people at EES, who would 
be the primary users of Silicon Energy, were not happy with Silicon Energy's 
functionality.

With this in mind, have you had discussions with John which we should know 
about or which would help give us strategic direction?

Thanks,
Kevin W. Kuykendall

 

Just spent 2 days in Mexico with Jeff Skilling - we might finally get things 
moving with Enron.? He gets our message and is not happy that internal IT is 
slowing down progress...? JW

John, 

Sounds like everything's still on track for you, which is excellent.? We 
have not done anything with Tridium.? As for their management issues, as 
with any small company they have some holes they need to fill. 
Nevertheless, we're pretty comfortable with their overall team. 

Good luck with your continued progress.? I definitely look forward to 
receiving occasional updates.? We still may have reason to join up in the 
future. 

Thanks, 
KK 

Kevin - we will be releasing the names of the primary investors in our 
Series D round in a press release shortly and will make sure it gets to 
you.? We are talking to a few banks and are still on track for a 4 
(superscript: th) quarter IPO, although they are trying to get us to 
register sooner.? The Carrier partnership is fantastic - we already have a 
few new customers on the utility side for the residential curtailment 
program.? Hope all is well at Enron - did you guys ever do anything with 
Tridium?? Have they solved their management issues??? JW 

???? -----Original Message----- 
???? John, 

???? I just wanted to touch base and catch up on any recent developments. 
???? Assuming that your round has closed, who are the primary investors? 
???? What 
???? is your current schedule for an IPO? 

???? Also, I read a press release a few days ago regarding your partnership 
???? with 
???? Carrier.? It was quite interesting, especially after having talked 
???? with you 
???? regarding that project during my visit to your headquarters. 

???? Thanks,

Dear Mr. Ryan,

We are in receipt of your letter to Mr. Skilling regarding CallTech

Mike, we appreciate you keeping Jeff in the loop for the 2001 U.S. Open.  
However, Jeff is not a golfer and has decided to decline this invitation.  
Thank you for the offer. 
Katherine for Jeff Skilling 

Mike Buttrey <Mike_Buttrey@mhbt.com> on 06/05/2000 04:58:32 PM
Jeff, this message is self explanatory.? Pat Arthur of our office is "in 
charge" of selling and setting up hospitality suites for companies in Texas 
and we have an opportunity for our firm and our firm's friends to sign up 
before he "goes public".? If Enron would be interested, let me know and I 
will make sure it is taken care of.

Regards, 

Mike Buttrey 

PS? thanks again for lunch. 

The U.S. Open golf? tournament will be held at Southern Hills Country Club in 
Tulsa next June 11-17. 

With few exceptions the OPEN is never held this far south, thus making the 
event very accessible to those of us in the Dallas area. This will mark the 
3rd Open to be held at SHCC.

I've been asked to assist in the Corporate Hospitality for the event. Because 
of this it is possibly to offer to your clients an invitation to one of the 
world's preeminent sporting events. To see it live , to watch the drama 
unfold in person, is an unforgettable moment. This is one reason why 
companies want to secure a corporate hospitality package. Before I put the 
word out in the Dallas market (and they will sell out soon) I wanted clients 
of MHBT to have the first shot. (I think this is a fair privilage)

The tickets to the event are sold out already, so the only way to gain access 
is via a hospitality package. They aren't cheap but the chance to have a U.S. 
Open so close might never happen again. Prices are from? $28,500 to $150,000. 
These prices range from a table in a furnished, shared pavilion to an 
exclusive environment. 

If you have anyone you think might be interested please let me know and I 
will be happy to visit with them and describe all the amenities associated 
with each option. 

These started to go on sale in the Tulsa marketplace recently and several 
options are SOLD OUT, including a few over $ 500,000.

Since demand is so high and space is limited I will hold off a week before 
making non-MHBT clients aware of this opportunity of a lifetime.

Take advantage of getting your best clients into the 2001 U.S. Open. 

Pat 

Per our phone conversation, you may cancel this service for Jeff Skilling.

Since I have been processing the Webley invoices over the last 3 months I've 
have noticed that many of you don't have any or only have very little usage 
on your accounts.   The purpose of this e-mail is to see how many of you want 
to keep your telephone assistant services and who wants to discontinue the 
service, since most of the Webley charges are only service charges and very 
little or no usage.

Thanks,

By now, a member of our SAP implementation team should have contacted you 
with information about your role as a timekeeper.  This role is very 
important at Enron.  By using a single time entry system, we will be able to 
gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their 
associated costs.  Time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs 
real-time.  If time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and 
project costing are negatively impacted.
 
We are quickly approaching the first SAP time entry deadline of June 30, at 
3:00 p.m., CST.  It is critical that we work together to meet this deadline.  
Within the next day or so, you will receive information from Todd Peikert, 
the site manager for the Corporate groups, on what you need to do before June 
30th.  

Several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry 
periods.  Beginning June 23rd, you can contact the Center of Expertise (COE) 
at (713) 345-4SAP with any questions or problems you are experiencing.

We appreciate your hard work and support to make our SAP implementation a 
success.

Dear?Mr. Jeffery  Skilling?
?
My name is  Scott Berta,?I along with my partners, have created some really 
wonderful  opportunities for companies and individuals to participate in 
company training  combined with corporate philanthropy that benefits our 
community. I will be  meeting with Mrs. Charla Reese and some of her team on 
Monday November, 20th at  2:30pm?(1400?Smith Street in Houston, Texas). We 
will be discussing  implementing these team philanthropic?events at Enron.
?
I know  that Enron is very committed to corporate giving and philanthropy. 
I?read  the wonderful write-up on you and what Enron has done during the MS 
150, in  Philanthropy in Texas magazine.? One of the events that my company  
offers is Bikes for the Little Tykes.? This is an event  that creates team 
awareness along with a powerful sense of giving. The  participates?give the 
bikes that they have put together as a team to  needy?children in their 
community.? Unbeknownst to the participates,  the children are brought into 
the event at the very end of the  program.?Team members are able to?see first 
hand what they  have?accomplished and?that they have really have made a 
difference in  a persons life.? We then go through a debrief session and try 
to help the  participants understand how their "customers", aka the children, 
made them feel  and how they can relate their experience to that of their 
daily  activities.
?
I know  this is short notice, but if you have time on Monday, I would really 
like to  meet you.?I look forward to meeting with you and sharing with you 
what my  company has helped other companies do for their communities and 
themselves.

Hi Mark.  I heard you guys had a great time in Africa - it's hard to believe 
it has already come and gone!

Just wondering if you still have your unused KLM ticket for the 
Istanbul/Amsterdam/Nairobi leg of the trip.  That is a refundable ticket, so 
if you would return it to me I can get Jeff's card credited for the charge - 
I believe it's in the neighborhood of $2,000.  If you have it, just drop it 
in the mail to:

Sherri Sera
c/o Enron Corp.
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, TX 77251-1188
U.S.A.

Thanks and take care,

The ponytail, tattoo and the beard were gone when he showed up last Monday.  
I hope somebody got some pictures of that!  SRS

Sherri,

When I got your message, I was certain I had thrown the ticket away.  But, I
was happy to find that I had procrastinated and still had it.  It will be in
the mail shortly.

The trip did go well; thanks for setting it up.

I'm curious to know whether Jeff kept the ponytail and tattoo?

Mark

Bert, will you please e-mail me Gene's exact title.  Thanks, SRS

Liz, would you please e-mail me Greg's exact title.  Thanks, SRS

Dear Ms. Kurz,

I spoke to Mr. Skilling regarding your e-mail below.  Of course he is always 
willing to entertain opportunities for NED's; however, given the current 
demands on his time, it would have to be something pretty significant in 
order that he would pursue and/or accept such an appointment.

With regard to the specific company you have in mind, he is happy to review 
any written information you may have.  Once he has had a chance to review it, 
we will contact you to let you know his level of interest and to set up 
follow-on discussions if appropriate.  By mail or Federal Express, the 
information may be sent to:

Dear Jeff,
I am a Partner with Whitehead Mann and rang you today to introduce myself and 
my firm.  We are an executive search consultancy who act for large global 
organizations to find Non-Executive Directors(NED)for their Boards.  At any 
one time, we have a number of European clients who are keen to have American 
nationals join their Boards due to their growing interests in the US.

I am approaching you to see if you would ever entertain taking on a NED 
position.  I have a specific client in mind which is a Paris-based, global 
industrial company with worldwide revenues in excess of $15 billion.

I know that you have just returned from holiday and have a busy schedule over 
the next few weeks, but I would be grateful if you could let me know if you 
would be interested in talking further about Board appointments.  I can be 
reached at 212 551 3552 or via e-mail at your convenience.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Barbara Kurz

Hello, Mark.  The person you can speak to at Enron is Eric Shaw=20
(44.207.783.5408) - he heads up that part of Europe out of our London=20
office.  By copy of this e-mail, I'm letting him know to expect your call.

Glad to hear all is well.  Good luck with your project!  SRS

Jeff,

I am preparing a report here for a client about foreign companies'
experiences here in Turkey.  I was wondering if it would be ok for me to
contact someone involved with Enron=01,s Turkey operation.  I suspect that =
any
such information is confidential, or at least sensitive, but if not, would
be very interesitng.  Please do not hesitate to say a big loud no.  Just
asking!

Hope all else goes well.  We should plan on talking on the phone sometime
soon, just for grins.

Mark

Mr. Knapp,

Thank you for your invitation to Mr. Skilling to speak at the March 22, 2000, 
Energy Industry Restructuring seminar in Paris.  Unfortunately, Mr. 
Skilling's schedule does not allow him to participate.

Sincerely,
Sherri Reinartz-Sera
Assistant to Mr. Skilling
713.853.5984
713.646.8381 (fax)

Jeff,

The International Energy Agency would like to invite you to speak at a
one-day Seminar on Energy Industry Restructuring to be held on 22 March 2000
here in Paris.  Enron's unique position in the global gas and electricity
businesses and your personal role in bringing that about would be of great
interest to the audience.

The audience will be composed of senior government officials from IEA member
countries who serve as delegates to three of our "Standing Groups" (i.e.,
oversight committees); the Standing Group on the Oil Market, the Standing
Group on Emergency Questions and the Standing Group on the Long-Term.
Chatham House rules will apply (no attribution without permission, no press,
open exchange of ideas).

If your schedule and inclination permits, we would like you to speak for
about 25-35 minutes on corporate objectives and strategies, your experiences
to date and any general plans for the future (that you are permitted to
discuss), with a focus on the gas and electric industries.  Case studies of
particular business developments would be of special interest.

The presentation would be in the second panel of the morning on "Sectoral
Aspects of Energy M&A Activities from a Company Perspective".  The 2-hour
session would start  at around 11AM and would include two other speakers
from Europe covering oil; Michel de Fabiani (President of BP France and
chief architect of the BP-Mobl downstream joint venture), who has
tentatively accepted and electricity; M. Saab, Head of Planning for EdF, who
has been invited, but is checking his schedule.

We are attempting to line up senior officials from the FTC, the EU
Competition Authority and a Japanese energy industry authority for an early
afternoon session to discuss "Public Policy Implications of Energy M&A
Activity".  You might find some useful insights into the possibly disparate
regulatory mentalities in these three regions.

I would be pleased to send you a complete working agenda for the meeting and
a formal invitation letter.

Please give my best regards to Ken Lay.

David

P.S. You may remember me from the days I was running the Energy Group and
Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in the 1980s, and for part of the time
following Enron.  I am now Head of the Oil Industry and Markets Division at
IEA and Editor of the IEA Monthly Oil Market Report.  I hope your schedule
will allow you to come to Paris.

Charla, Jeff said this is acceptable to him.  Thanks, SRS

I am facilitating the 2000 Chairman's Award process and am presently 
arranging a time to present the Selection Committee's recommendations to the 
Office of the Chairman.  I have spoken with Sherri to get on your calendar 
and understand that you have a very busy October.  I am scheduled to meet 
with Ken on October 25 at 9:00am.  If you are agreeable, I will meet with him 
first and then present the approved finalists for your review when you are 
available.

Please let me know if this plan is acceptable - thank you.

Johnathan,

My name is Sherri Sera, and I work for Jeff Skilling.  Jeff has asked me to 
see if you have a completed e-mail list for Class #64, and if so, could you 
send it to me.  I'm assisting him in getting the group together Saturday 
afternoon or evening, and he would like to poll the group to see if that is 
something they would like to do.

I appreciate your assistance in this matter.

seeing more of you in the future.

I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling (who, by the way, has really enjoyed 
the old pictures being e-mailed back and forth).  He has asked me to find out 
what the schedule of events is for the SMU Homecoming October 27-29.  He's 
unable to attend any events on the evening of Saturday, October 28, as he 
will be at the wedding of a very good friend; however, if there are events 
scheduled outside of that time, he would very much like to be there.

Can you provide this information or pass me on to whomever can?  Any 
assistance is greatly appreciated.

Just a short note to thank you for taking the time and effort to give me some 
of your ideas.  Believe it or not, we're working these exact issues right 
now.  Thanks very much for your input.

Regards,
Jeff

Charlene, I'm sending down the letter Benjamin sent to Jeff with some ideas 
about improving morale in the program, which was referenced in the e-mail I 
bcc'd you on a moment ago.  SRS

Beek,

Rocky asked me to let you know that he is really hoping to be at the party 
Friday evening and at the game Saturday afternoon, but he'll have to be home 
Saturday night for a wedding.  We'll keep you posted on how it works out, but 
so far it's looking like he'll be there for part (perhaps most?) of the fun.

passengers.  Please let me know departure time on 10/20, and return time on 
10/23 when that has been determined.  Thanks, SRS

Admiral Monteleone and I have been working on the arrangements for our

Hello, everyone!    I have some sad news to report.   Stan's father, Eugene 
S. Horton,  passed away yesterday.   I don't know all the specifics on what 
happened, and I don't have the specifics on the funeral arrangements as of 
yet; however, Stan requests that in lieu of flowers...for those of you 
interested...a memorial fund will be set up and he would prefer that you 
contribute to the fund.   We will have those details for you at Tuesday's 
staff meeting. 

For those of you who would like to send Stan a sympathy card, his address is: 
Stanley C. Horton
          70 Champions Bend Circle
          Houston, Texas  77069  

Also, please be informed that we are canceling Monday's EOTT conference call 
and our 9:15AM staff meeting.    Stan will be back Monday night and wants to 
have our Tuesday off-site staff meeting as scheduled.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Please let me know if you are able to join him.  If you do plan to attend,

Jeff:

I am taking the liberty of writing this note to you regarding a tremendous 
potential business opportunity that has to do with trading of Foreign 
Exchange Online . The idea is to bring the clients and the banks together 
where  the banks can bid to buy or sell when business clients wants to buy or 
sell certain currency. My understanding is that the total foreign exchange 
turnover per day is in several trillion dollar range.  Currently, I am 
working in Santa Cruz, Bolivia as President/General Manager of Bolivian 
portion of Bolivia to Brazil pipeline and may not be up to speed on Enron's 
activities in this area.   If we are already doing this, please disregard 
this note and accept my appologies for taking your time and, if we are not 
doing this, here is my two cents worth and let me know if I can do anything 
to implement it. 

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for your leadership 
in making this such a great company. I have been with the company for last 
twenty years and it has been a phenomenal experience. The best part is that 
we have just  began.  I am very excited about  the future growth 
opportunities of  EBS and am looking forward to contributing in that area one 
of these days.  

Regards,

Nasim Khan 

Mark, Jeff asked me to let you know that John Sherriff, CEO of Enron Europe, 
is expecting your call pursuant to the voicemail and letter you sent.  John 
is very anxious to talk to you.  He can be reached in London at 
44.207.783.6522.  Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Regards,
Sherri

Roxanne, there may be an opportunity to bring a guest, but I am waiting to 
get RSVPs from the entire group before offering that as tickets are limited.  
I'll be back in touch as soon as I've heard from the entire class.

I would definitely like to have a ticket.  Are guests invited or is it 
limited to members of the Seal Class #64?  If guests are invited, I would 
love to have one additional ticket.

My office address is as follows:

Roxanne Piper

Please thank Jeff for arranging this outing -- it sounds like it will be a 
lot of fun!!  Call me at (713) 651-7217 if you have any questions.

It's the first picture you've sent that I did recognize anyone!  He looks 
just like his son Jeffrey Jr. in this picture!

I never was able to open the document that was sent twice, which I believe 
had all the details.  I know that there is a party Friday night at Elvis' 
house, but I don't know exactly where that is; and I know there is a football 
game at 11:00a on Saturday, but I'm not sure whether or not Rocky will be 
able to attend.  His significant others' sister is getting married the night 
of 28 Oct, so he must be back in Houston for that.  We'll get him a corporate 
aircraft, though, so he can come and go as he pleases.

That was probably a very long answer to a very short question!  At any rate, 
if I could get the details for the party Friday night, I would really 
appreciate it.  In the meantime, I'll find out if Rocky is planning to go to 
the football game Saturday.

Vince, I am checking the date on Jeff's calendar (I'm assuming the date is 
February 22?).  I am holding that date whole week for a trip abroad, but I

Jeff,

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
you as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.

Vince

Patti, can you believe that out of all those dates you offered that Jeff is 
only available on October 14?!  I have penciled it in on his calendar as has 
Rebecca.  We'll look forward to more details.  Thanks, and have a wonderful 
time in Cabo!  I'm so envious!!!  Sherri

Jeff,
?
Hi!? Mike and I want to get a few couples  together for a casual dinner.? We 
would like you and Rebecca to join  us.? I thought I'd run a few dates by you 
and see if any of these  work:
?
Fri. Oct. 6
Fri. Oct. 13
Sat. Oct. 14
Sat. Oct. 28
Fri. Nov. 3
Sat. Nov.4
?
As you can see from our schedule, we are pretty  open!? Let me know.

P.S. We really enjoyed seeing your centerfold photo  the other month.? Was 
this a trial run for a potential, more revealing  spread??

Stephanie, I don't have all of Jeff's pledges collected yet!  Do you want what I have (about 65%) or shall I wait until all have been collected?  I'll send out another e-mail today to the slackers ;-)  Let me know.  SRS

If you haven't already done so, please turn in your MS150 pledges TODAY to either Stephanie Strong (EB2365c)
Becky Pham (EB2336b)
or Amelia Alder (3Ac3120).

Thanks.

Mark, I sent this home to Jeff last week, and perhaps you retrieved it from his e-mail at the house.  In any event, I'm cleaning out our e-mail files and thought I'd pass it on to you.  SRS

Jeff/Mark or Sherri or whoever gets your emails: 

Thanks for the Astros tickets.  The estate planning lawyer that I am using is Don Fizer with Fizer, Beck, something, something.  He is located in the Galleria at 1360 Post Oak Blvd, Suite 1600, Houston, TX  77056 and his number is 713-332-4251.  He has been great to work with because I was clueless and he was able to explain this stuff in a way that was pretty easy for me to understand.  I also recommend making the first stop at the law firm instead of the trust company or financial advisor because I have found several of the trust companies and financial advisors really trying to push cookie cutter stuff and it is pretty easy to get something that doesn't fit your specific needs.  I found Don very good at looking at my situation and directing me to a couple specific strategies and then to a couple trust companies that are better equipped to handle that.  

The trust company I went with was Sentinel Trust, they are located at San Felipe and Kirby - 2001 Kirby Dr, suite 1210, Houston, 77019-6081.  Bob Sweeney is my contact there 713-528-3728.  I went with them for two reasons.  1 Because I was basically philosophically aligned with their approach ... conservative ...and I liked them better.  

and 2 they are very rigorous in their evaluation of investments and they have a guy named Bruce (I don't have his last name) who is interesting to talk to about markets, investments etc and I think he is smarter than the average bear.  

I will get you the name of the other trust company when I can find it. 

Good Luck 

Ken

Gil,

Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. Quackenbush calls we will decline.

It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.

Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-)

Jeff,

Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
and the recent piece in Bloomberg.

Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron
(EES, Enron Networks, Global
Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
sites are examples of the results of
this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
that Enron will use going forward.

David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
the work at Enron.  He and
Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
you, bringing you up to date
on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.

I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
of their interest.  He will be
following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet with
them.

Regards,

Gil Marmol

Sheri:

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Regards,
Erica Harris

Erica, thanks for the note.  Joannie has left the office for the day, but
will return tomorrow morning.

In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense.
Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of
Jeff's time is committed through February 2002, so knowing what the
dates/timeframes are would be most helpful in the event we need to try to
free up some time.  Thank you.

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?
Erica

Erica, Jeff is currently scheduled to be on vacation July 19.  Would it be
possible to schedule during the next quarter?

Dear Mr. Skilling:

I write on behalf of Jerry Murdock, who is currently in Europe.  Mr.
Murdock
asked me to pass on the following information regarding your telephone call
scheduled for 10:00am (CST) on Tuesday, May 15.

Insight Capital hosts a quarterly dinner with Robert Rubin and Steve
Friedman and other selected guests.  Our next dinner is scheduled for July
19 and will be held in Aspen, Colorado.  The Current State of the Global
Market will be one of the topics under discussion and Jack Welch of GE is
one of your fellow invitees.

The purpose of your conversation with Mr. Murdock is to discuss the above
in
more detail and to more fully brief you on the purpose of these dinners.

Please do not hesitate to contact me should you require any further
information.

Thank you, Erica.  I'm waiting to Jeff to return from a meeting (within an hour or so).

Sheri:

Thanks for the response.  Our next dinner is scheduled for September 25, at
the moment I'm not sure who the other invitees would be.  Jerry would
probably have a better idea as he puts together the guest list for each
event and may already have something in mind.  That's actually another
reason why I think we should leave the call tomorrow on the calendar.
Depending on Mr. Skillings availability/interest Jerry might want to
reconfigure his invitee list for the most appropriate mix of people.

Regards,
Erica Harris

Erica, thanks for the note.  Joannie has left the office for the day, but
will return tomorrow morning.

In the meantime, I'll run this by Jeff to see if he thinks it makes sense.
Do you have any dates for future dinners in mind?  The vast majority of
Jeff's time is committed through February 2002, so knowing what the
dates/timeframes are would be most helpful in the event we need to try to
free up some time.  Thank you.

Probably the best thing is for the call to go ahead, that way Jerry can
brief Mr. Skilling on our plans for the remaining dinners throughout the
year and Mr. Skilling can decide on the best one for him to attend.

Does that sound feasible to you?

Erica, Jeff is currently scheduled to be on vacation July 19.  Would it be
possible to schedule during the next quarter?

There are only a few available spaces at the upcoming Harvard Forum.  Don't
miss this new and exciting event.  Make your reservations today.  See
meeting details below.
**********************************************

Harvard University Club of Houston - Harvard Forum
"Raising Children of Character in A World of Affluence"
Dinner and Discussion Club

Join us for a new type of Harvard Club experience.  Ever wanted to talk
substantively about a topic, while having a great dinner, but were afraid
that your dinner guests would not be able to go the distance with you in
the conversation?  We have the solution.

Modeled after a format that members David and Anne Grizzle and Danguole
Spakevicius and William Altman have been enjoying for years, the Harvard
Forum will provide an opportunity for an extended conversation with fellow
club members.

The format works like this:  we'll have dinner, and then a panel of Harvard
grads will give brief introductions to the evening's topic from their
perspective, and then we will all engage the topic for ourselves, first in
a large group and then in small groups.  The panel members will be
knowledgeable, but not so expert that anyone will be intimidated.  They
will, however, be provocative to assure that the subsequent conversation is
lively.  You will come away knowing your fellow club members better than
ever - maybe better than you ever wanted.

The topic we've picked is one with which many of us have struggled.  Our
children may be growing up in a world far more affluent - privileged - than
we enjoyed.  How imperiled is their character by our success?  What
practical steps can we take to insure that we pass along to them the
character values that we treasure?

We plan to schedule a Harvard Forum every quarter.

Because of the format, attendance is limited.  Please respond as indicated
below.

When:    Friday, May 18, 7:30 p.m.
Where:   Briar Club, 2603 Timmons (East Briar Room)
Cost:      $35.00 per person

Reservations:  Email dottie@kerr-solutions.com or call 281/424-3084
(Payment must be made at time of reservation by credit card or mailing
check to 3413 Cobblestone Lane, Baytown, TX 77521-1956.)

For further information, contact David Grizzle (david_grizzle@yahoo.com or
713-324-2966) or Danguole Spakevicius (danguole@fempartners.com or
713-665-4218).

Hello Jeff

A voice from the past.  Hope you are doing well.

I wanted to gain your assistance to point me to the most appropriate person
I could interview at Enron.  I am helping a client understand how companies
in the US Natural Gas and Power industry are coping with the challenges in
their industry in terms of developing and retaining the "right skills".
So, someone who could provide an external perspective of how players in the
industry are coping with the challenges as well as an internal perspective
on Enron would be great for me to interview.  If that means more than one
individual, that is fine too.

Hope this is not too much of an imposition.  I'll undertake the
conversation over the telephone and keep it short.

You can reach me on email: sgiridha@prismintl.com or on my cell phone:
240-603-6084.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

Mr. Skilling will be travelling and unable to attend on May 24.

I'm back in town and have everything set for Friday AM at 9.  I am also
going to Hobby Performing Arts immediately afterwards with Paul Hobby and
we'd love to have Jeff join us for a short tour of that job as well.

Thanks,

Jeff,

Unfortunately, Jeff doesn't have any information on Rick Barsky.  Would you like for me to try and get information from anyone else?

Through YPO International, we got a membership inquiry from Rick Barsky,
CEO of Agennix(don't know what company does).  He apparently used to work
at Enron.  Bio says he was involved in start up of Enron Renewable Energy
Corp. and Enron Solar.  Any input you can give us on this guy?

Karen, heres the version of the PRC memo you should use.  Please call if you have any questions.  SRS

 

Jay,

I've always taken a pretty laid back approach to the noncompete when there is little overlap.  Having said that, however, I'd like to keep a "last veto" right - just give me a call when you've got something.

Good luck to you in the future, Jay.  You'll be missed at Enron.

Best regards,
Jeff

Jay Fitzgerald@ECT

Jeff-

As you may know, I have (somewhat reluctantly) decided to resign from Enron.  For some time now, I have wanted to take some time off, and had asked Whalley about the possibility for a six month unpaid, unvested sabbatical.  Primarily for reasons of precedence, he was unwilling to pursue this option, which, while it is disappointing to me, I accept.

The purpose of this note is twofold.

First, I would like to thank you for making this company the great place it is today, and for giving me the opportunity to have a great career here.  I will forever look upon my nine plus years with Enron fondly.

Second, I would like to ask you as the administrator of the 1997 Long Term Incentive Plan to allow me to explore opportunities in the venture capital community without triggering non-compete provisions with regard to future payouts.  I very much enjoyed my brief role in venture capital, and have some very good contacts in that area here in New York.  Since NetWorks decided to cease operations in that business earlier in the year, I should not think that Enron would view anything I might do there as competitive, especially if I were not working directly in the energy space with an Enron competitor.

At present, I am planning to spend my time at least through the summer enjoying, and travelling with, my family.  I have nothing planned professionally as of yet, but wanted to take the opportunity to drop you this note while I might still be viewed positively (I hope that's not too presumptuous!).

Please let me know your thoughts on this non-compete provision as I would not wish for anything to be awkward for us going forward.

Again Jeff, thanks for many great memories, and as an Enron shareholder, keep up the great work!

Jay

Hi Friends!

The big Rice-ALP final presentation day is almost here:  MONDAY, May 7th,   4pm,    at Enron, 1400 Smith.  Please come to the Enron Lobby and ask for me or my assistant, Melinda McCarty.

After the presentation, you are cordially invited to dinner and an Astro's game (vs Phillies)  at the Enron Box at Enron Field.  As participation in the Enron Box at Enron Field is limited to this special invitation list only, please confirm your attendance via return eMail, or via voice mail to me at 713-853-6117 ASAP.

We're very excited about the work the Rice ALP team has done and we're all greatly looking forward to the presentation.

Hope to see everyone Monday!!

Best regards!

--Christie.

Good morning Stan.  I am holding 11:00 - Noon on Wednesday for the building tour.  I think it would be okay to meet Jeff and Bill Donovan in the lobby.  Unfortunately Jeff will be leaving to go out of town right after lunch, so I don't think that the tour of the Hobby Performing Arts Center will work for Wednesday.

Thanks and have a great weekend.

Joannie  

stanmarek@marekbros.com on 05/04/2001 09:22:05 AM
Joannie,

Just a reminder about the job tour on Wednesday.  I will be in San Diego
until Tuesday night so I wanted to check in today.  I will be happy to come
to Jeff's office to pick him up or we can meet in the lobby. Just give me a
time and I'll set it up.  I will also be available to show him the Hobby
Performing Arts Center if he has time.

-Stan

The Stanford Business School, in collaboration with the management-consulting firm McKinsey & Company, is conducting a large study of global corporations, their management practices, and organization.  Enron is participating in the project in order to learn how our own practices and activities compare to those of other leading global firms and to see which bring true benefits in the global marketplace.  One of the unique features of the project is that it seeks to assess the knowledge and communication networks within a company by asking employees throughout the company to comment on their actual practices and experience.  The goal is to obtain real and accurate information by surveying the people most directly involved in the company's operations. 

I would like to ask you to help us in getting the most out of our participation in the GLOBE Initiative by completing the GLOBE Network Survey.  The survey is brief and should take no longer than 15 or 20 minutes.  Your responses will be treated as strictly confidential, and will be used solely by the Stanford/McKinsey researchers to evaluate how specific practices and structures impact global communication and knowledge flows.  If you would like individual feedback on how your own networks compare to those of others in the study, please check the appropriate box at the end of the survey.  

Please save this email for future reference and, again, thank you for contributing to this important learning opportunity.

To complete the GLOBE Network Survey, please click on the link below and simply follow the survey instructions.  You will need to enter the Enron Company Code, which is: 

C673EV

To begin the survey, click on the link below: http://63.211.208.100/GLOBENetwork/survey.asp

You may also copy this link and paste it into your favorite browser.

Thank you.

Thank you for your e-mail.  Mr. Skilling is traveling for the remainder of this week, but will be back in the office on Monday.

Jeff,

Judy Lay Allen, an associate of yours on the Federal Reserve board, spoke with Joannie Williamson today regarding my desire to interview at Enron.

I am a graduate of Princeton University with two years experience in financial modeling and communications.   Towards assessing my skill set relative to peers, I took and received a 740 on my GMAT.  I have also interned in a gas exploration company and am familiar with the industry; likewise, I have worked with clients in telecommunications and am aware of the work Enron is doing in the bandwidth trading/pooling field.

I am aware of Enron's executive training/business analyst programs and am highly interested in exploring opportunities therein.  I am in Houston through Friday evening and, given the short notice, would be grateful for any opportunity to meet with the appropriate person any time Thursday or Friday.

I look forward to interviewing and applying my experience at Enron.

Best regards,

Jeff, 

I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the conference.

Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our commercial and real estate business.

Let me know your interest.

was great to see you.

As Art mentioned, since the time we have started working with you, we have
made frequent references to our operating teams about Enron's
accomplishments in the areas of customer excellence and employee
satisfaction.  More generally, we've held Enron out as an example of a
highly accomplished company in all the areas Macerich is currently focusing
on as an organization (operational integration, customer orientation,
scalability, change leadership, and strategic focus).

All of that being said, we would be extremely appreciative of an
opportunity to have either Jeff Skilling or Dave Delainey speak at either
of these conferences.  In any event, we're delighted that you would make an
effort to see if this can be put together.

Relative to upcoming Macerich events, there are two scheduled:

(1) University of Notre Dame Executive Education Program, May 7 - 9 in
South Bend.  The curriculum is centered on change leadership and strategic
thinking (officially "Enhanced Leadership and Strategy in the New
Economy").  Attendees include our Executive Team (Art, David, Rick,Tom, Ed,
and Larry Sidwell) and our Operating Team (17 SVPs).  There is also a
round-table discussion scheduled with our Board on May 9.

(2) Macerich's Company Conference, June 4 - 7 in Park Cities, Utah.  The
emphasis of the conference will be on our "e-Business Transformation" (more
specifically on becoming wholly integrated across functional roles,
customer facing, and highly scalable) and capturing value in our "Value
Network" (relationships we have with retailers, partners, vendors,
shoppers, etc.)  The attendees for this event include the same people at
UND as well as our managerial professionals from the malls and our
corporate offices (about 250 people, total).

Let me know if you need any additional background or information.

Eric

Dave, please disregard my previous e-mail about the date and location in June, unless June 4-7 in Park City, UT, is not it.  As Jeff has to be in Wyoming on the evening of the 7th, it is possible that he speak in Park City that morning and then go on to Wyoming for the dinner he's attending there.  I'll be back in touch once Jeff has seen this e-mail and responded with his interest...SRS

Jeff, 

I will be heading out to Macerich's offices to meet Macerich's management team. At that meeting, we will be discussing the outsource and the future relationship between the companies.  He would also like me to speak to his direct reports about change management and other cultural characteristics of Enron.  However, he would really like you to provide a presentation on the same general topics to the Macerich Company Conference in June.  He has heard you speak and believes your approach and perspective can benefit the conference.

Obviously, these guys are an important relationship and reference for our commercial and real estate business.

Let me know your interest.

Regards
Delainey

The Board of the Center for Houston's Future recently committed
resoundingly to the creation of Goals and a Strategic Plan for Houston that
will allow our community to achieve its extraordinary potential over the
next decisive 20 years.  This landmark program, already underway, will be
assisted by many dedicated volunteers from throughout the community.  Led
by Chairman Gene Vaughan, the Center, an affiliate of the Greater Houston
Partnership, is focused on very tough questions:  The world and Houston are
changing rapidly - what will be the new reality in 20 years and beyond?
What do we want Houston to be?  What are the obstacles and trade-offs?
Most of all, what plans, resources, determination and leadership are
necessary now to get Houston to its desirable future?  If you are
interested in what can be done to give Houston a great future worthy of its
past - and particularly if you want to get involved - this is an
outstanding opportunity to discourse with one of the citizens leading the
charge.

Gene Vaughan is chairman and founder of Vaughan, Nelson, Scarborough &
McCullough, L.P., an investment management firm originated in Houston in
1970 whose Investment Counsel and VNSM Trust Company manage securities
portfolios for foundations, endowments, corporations and families.

Within his profession, Mr. Vaughan was founding chairman and governor of
the Association for Investment Management and Research, a past chairman of
the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts and a past chairman of the
Financial Analysts Federation.  He is chairman and has served as a director
since 1970 of Dreyfus Founders Group of mutual funds (Denver).

Mr. Vaughan has been a trustee of Vanderbilt University (Nashville) since
1972.  He is a director since 1990 and on the Executive Committee of the
Greater Houston Partnership.  He is Chairman of the Center for Houston's
Future whose mission is to help prepare Houston proactively for future
opportunities and challenges.  Mr. Vaughan is a director of the Houston
Grand Opera Association, a trustee of Goodwill Industries and past chairman
of The Houston Forum.  He was founding chairman of Presbyterian School
(early childhood through grade 8) and served as a trustee of St. John's School.

Mr. Vaughan received a B.A. in 1955 from Vanderbilt University, an M.B.A.
in 1961 from the Harvard Business School, where he was a J. Spencer Love
Fellow, and earned the Chartered Financial Analyst designation in 1969.

Dear Jeff,

 

Thank you for setting aside time to meet with me.  I have attached my resume to help bring you up to date on my career.  

 

As you will see, I have been providing advisory services since 1995.   During these years, I have done some of my best work.  I am proud of the service that I have rendered as an independent consultant.  

 

Now, I feel it is time to move to a new chapter in my career.  I look forward to sitting down with you to think through ways to apply my experience, intellect and energies to new professional challenges.  I respect you tremendously, and wherever the next part of my career may lie, I know that my search and choice will benefit significantly from your perspective.

 

Finally, I am attaching the recommendation to HBS that you wrote in 1981.  I found it during a profoundly challenging period in my life.  Your historic words of support helped me keep fighting and successfully moving forward.

 

If you would like to reach me before our meeting, please call (213) 926-2626 or email kevinscott@onlinemailbox.net .  Thank you again.

 

Sincerely,

Kevin, just wanted to let you know that a sedan through Beal's has been reserved and will pick you up at 7:15a at the Four Seasons.  I've asked that the sedan stand by and take you as directed when you are ready to leave the North Shepherd facility.  Regards, SRS

Thank you!  SRS

Kevin Hannon @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 04/23/2001 10:33:09 AM
Sherri,

Put me down for $750

Kevin

Ok, I'll tell you what I've told everyone else - the pledges Jeff has received range from $20 to $6000.  So, pledge with your heart, keeping your pocketbook in mind!  By the way, Jeff finished the ride in just over 14 hours!  SRS

Kevin Hannon @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 04/20/2001 01:56:56 PM
No matter how much I have, its never enough.

Kevin

How much to you have?!  SRS

Kevin Hannon @ ENRON COMMUNICATIONS on 04/20/2001 08:03:14 AM
OK Sherri how much do you want?

Kevin

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Kevin, I'll have a sedan from Beal's (713.731.9233) pick you up at the Four Seasons and bring you to the facility.  Once you get inside, there will be a check-in table - the ladies manning that table can direct you to Jeff.  Would you like me to have the sedan stand by to tke you to the airport or another destination following the panel (which will end between 9:30 and 9:45)?  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS

Kevin Compton <KCompton@kpcb.com> on 04/23/2001 09:51:29 AM
It would be a HUGE help if a car could meet me at the Four Seasons (1300
Lamar Street) about 7:15.  Just let me know, otherwise I will take a cab.

Where should we meet with Jeff tomorrow at 8:15??

Kevin

Kevin, I got your message about not being available for dinner -  no
problem.  The other panelists were arriving too late also, so the dinner
was cancelled.

I just wanted to touch base and make sure you had everything thing you need
for tomorrow morning.  I'm attaching a map to the North Shepherd facility;
it's about 10 minutes outside of downtown.  I would be happy to make
arrangements for a sedan to pick you up if you like; just let me know from
where.

The event begins with a buffet breakfast at 7:30 a.m. and your panel will
begin at 8:45 a.m.  Jeff would like to meet with you, David Arnoff  and
John Thornton around 8:15 a.m. to cover any last minute items about the
panel.
I'll be at the North Shepherd facility beginning about 2:00 p.m. CDT today,
so you can reach me on my cell phone (713.854.1426).  Do not hesitate to
call me should you have any questions or need additional information as I
will not have access to e-mail after 2:00 p.m.

Regards, SRS

(See attached file: ypomap.ppt)

Please let me know if you have any questions.  I will send an e-mail with the in-room fax number tomorrow.

Thanks,

Jeff,

My name is Samuel Pak, and I'm an Analyst in the A/A program.  I will also be riding the MS150 with you and the Team this weekend.  As I did last year, I am writing an article on the MS150 for the Encounter.  As such, I was hoping that maybe we could chat a few minutes at lunch in Bellville or at dinner in La Grange.  If this is OK with you, I will find you and introduce myself, and we can go from there.

Much Thanks!
Sam.

$50,000 is pre-match, so I guess the ultimate goal is $100,000 (Like the poor guy doesn't have enough pressure!).  Mark, this is very generous of you.  Good luck with your ride and I'll see you in LaGrange!  SRS

   

even though i too am riding for the 9th time to austin.....and attempting to raise big bucks....i'll help the "Big Cheese"..put me down for $500 pre match....is your $50,000  pre match ?

Thanks for the pledge, Loretta!  This was most definitely not directed at you - I just wanted each of the assistants to know that I had solicited their executive...again...so I bcc'd the assistants.  Thanks for the very quick turnaround.  SRS  

Sherri - Rebecca says to put her down for $500...and you can put me down for $25...I'm always glad to have made these contributions when I'm doing my taxes and I just finished that little exercise!!!  Loretta

Jeff,

Happy Easter!

A few years ago at the YPO Harvard University, I met a guy from Venezuela.
He and I have kept in contact through the years and we get together from
time to time.  We had dinner a few days ago and he asked me if I thought
you might be interested in meeting with Ali Rodgrigues.  Ali will be in the
US sometimes in May and may be available to meet.  He and my buddy have
been friends for years and I thought I'd extend the offer.  I don't know if
there is an agenda or not.  Those guys are hard to read.  Just let me know
if it's something you want to do.  Otherwise I'll just forget about it.

Keep that stock going up!

-Stan

Dear Mr. Morgan,

On behalf of Jeff Skilling, thank you very much for the invitation to speak to the San Diego Chapter of YPO.  Jeff was very flattered and somewhat intrigued by your offer.  However, given the current demands on his time, he must respectfully decline your invitation.

Please let me know if you have any interest in another senior-level representative of Enron speaking to your group, and I'll be happy to do what I can to facilitate that for you.

Again, Mr. Morgan, thank you and the San Diego Chapter of YPO for the the opportunity.

Regards,
Sherri Sera

Hi Jeff.

I am Mike's brother, Ronnie, living in San Diego and a member of the San
Diego Chapter of YPO.  With all the propaganda being spread about the
electricity and energy crisis we are experiencing here in California, I
thought it would be worthwhile to invite you to town to give us an
insider's view on what is really going on (aka, the "truth").  Is there
anyway you can find time in your busy schedule to visit us over dinner
with a short talk and a question and answer period.  The sooner the
better.

I will schedule a "special" meeting of our chapter to accommodate any
dates that work for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Please include my name on the list of interested people.

Thank You,

Just a reminder that we really need to keep in contact with CERS on the off peak as they are beginning to buy more on more from us on-peak.  We still need to net out with them each month so any purchasing from them will greatly help us on the day shift.

thanks, 

ryan

We sold 3mw of NP15 to "SIERRA PACIFIC HOLDING" for friday 11/09/01.  The price is 34 dollars and it is not in enpower or caps as of yet.

	I bought 8mw of SP15 from Gas recovery systems and built the purchase in CAPS with the APX.   It is 8mw HE 9-17 @29 dollars.  We also had Arco come back up and they need to be sold or used to cover a short, it is 26 mw in SP15 and the gen schedule is already built in CAPS for 10/24 and 10/25.  They are up around the clock and need to recieve fair market price for their generation.

Hello Ryan,	

	My name is Garrett Stephenson and I am a executive recruiter in the Houston area. I currently have a few opportunities available in ERCOT and WSCC trading and was wondering if you would be interested in looking at these opportunities or if you knew someone that would.   Please let me know a good phone number and time to contact you.   I am representing a great company who is offering great benefits, base, and 17% of the book back to the traders.

Thanks.

Enpower to Caps is going to be out for HE 15.  We sold 25mw to Allegheny in SP however IT has not yet built an APX5 counterparty in caps so I put it in APX1 and then changed the template to send it and balance.

thanks,

The fees that we charge for marketing EES has been revised and will take effect 10/4/01.  The new fees are as follows:

	1-100mw's=$3 fee
	100-200mw's=$4 fee
	over 200mw=$5 fee

Please note that if we market 101mw's for EES then we charge them $4 on the whole 101mw's for a total fee of $404.  Also if we were to market 201mw's for them then the total fee would be $1005 dollars.  In other words if they go over a the limit on one fee then we charge them the higher fee on all the mw's.

thanks,

ryan

AFTER TALKING TO KATE HERE I WAS MADE AWARE THAT SOME DEALS WERE ZEROED OUT IN "DEAL SCHEDULING" FOR THAT DAY.  CONSTELLATION IS CORRECT THOUGH, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN 25MW AT 40 DOLLARS.

THANKS,

RYAN
Hi Ryan,

On August 21, the following deal contained 0 mws and 0 $'s.  According to the Counterparty, which is Constellation, it should have 25 mws @ $40.00.  It's for hour ending 15.  If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Thanks

ACCORDING TO ENPOWER THIS DEAL WAS DONE ON ENRON ONLINE, AND IT DOES HAVE 25MW AT $40 IN THE DEAL.  THE WAY IT READS OVER HERE IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DISPUTE.  IF I AM READING THIS INCORRECTLY LET ME KNOW.

THANKS,

RYAN

The following are the basics on what I was proposing on hourly call/put options:

1.  Structure:
	a. Delivery Point: NP15 or SP15
	b. Strike Price: determined at time of purchase or sale
	c. Quantity:  one option equals 25 megawatt hours
	c. Premium:  one time cash outlay for right of option quote as dollars per megawatt hour
	d. Settlement Index:  Expost, determined under the expost tab on the cal iso web site as the 10 minute average zonal price for the hour in which the option is to be settled.
	e. Exercise deadline:  Must be exercised 2 hours and 10 minutes prior to the begininng of physical power flow for the hour in which option will be settled financially.
	f.  Duration of option:  Expires at 20:50 of the day in which the option was purchased/sold.

	*In most cases I can quote a premium in which I will be willing to settle the option financially OR physically.
	** Of course execution of a transaction is subject to the counterparty having the appropriate credit approval for the agreed upon financial and or physical deals.

We had some problems scheduling ARCO as the ISO had a 10.8 mw curtailment scheduled for ARCO through HE 24 for 8/1/01.  In order to schedule the extra 6mw for 8/1/01 I had to change that outage and set the curtailment at 5mw and that is scheduled through 9/1/01.  The ISO had two separate outage schedules and I said to just go with the 5mw curtailment until you guys could get back with them on the exact outage.

Thanks,

ryan

It appears that there is a 10mw transmission schedule missing on peak from Pac System border to Mid C.  This has us out 320 mw at Mid C for 8/1/01.	

thanks- 
ryan

Somehow it seems everyone ends up in portland...just was flipping through web pages and ran across your listing on the david douglas site.  Hope everything is going well.

ryan

I had to change your august schedule since I misread leaf's vacation request.  The way I have it now is four night shifts in a row from the 8th through the eleventh.  This shouldn't be too bad since you have seven nights off prior to the schedule.  I couldn't figure out any other way to do it, while keeping everyone else's requests whole.  If you would rather break up your six day then give me a call and I will make the adjustments.

thanks,

ryan

1.  When you buy from the imbalance(Services 2mw for HE 17-22) please make sure that you buy from the correct zone(i.e.  if finals have sp load dec'd then the buy from the imbalance in enpower needs to be in sp).  Day shift, assumed the ISO would make a buy from NP and for 3 hours they dec'd SP load.  Even better if you know that you are going to buy from the imbalance then submit a schedule that is BALANCED,  in this case they should have created a new load zone in SP under the Services book and inserted a -2 for HE 17-22.  As always we don't want to buy from the imbalance but if all other options have been exhausted then at least submit your preferred zone to purchase from rather than leaving the ISO to roll the dice and force balance you how ever they want.

2.  Unless I have been informed incorrectly, we should be accounting for bloomberg fees as a fee rather than sticking it the price.  This should make the SAR and settlements just a little easier.

Anytime on the 10th of July works for me.

Thanks,

Ryan

There is no enpower to CAPS for 6/21 since the ISO computers went down and they do not have any finals for HE 21.  They said that some time around noon today they will try to repost the data after their guys recover it from the down servers.  Somebody in Houston or here may be able to just make the preferred the final for that hour, however this is something that I never learned how to do so I am going to have to pass on doing that.

thanks,

ryan

Either the 5th or the 6th will work, I will be out of the office but can stop by to do the interview.

thanks,

ryan

As the southwest heats up, or the ISO goes into stages of emergency, or path 15 is congested north to south we will want to get power from the northwest utilities down to APS and so on in the southwest.  We can do this many ways but one that I have discovered that may have much capacity is as follows.

1.  NW Utility to PAC on BPA(T)
2.  PACW to IPC(T)@Enterprise(ENPR) on PAC(T)
3.  IPC@ENPR to PAC(T)@Borah Brady(BOBR) on IPC(T)
4.  IPC@BOBR to Four Corners(FC3) on PAC(T)
5.  Sink with anyone at four corners or buy tranny over to palo or mead.

I'm not sure how long there is going to be room but for monday there is 400mw of room on this path.

Enjoy,

Slinger

Hey, good to hear from you.  All is going well here.  I'm still with Enron for a few days.  Our division just got bought out by the Union Bank of Switzerland, or better known as UBS.  I guess things didn't work out so well for most with the company, but what are you gonna do.  Right now it's 6am and I am the only one here.  About 75% of our portland office got laid off.  I'm in early to read my new contract with UBS, I think I'm going to sign it which means I'll be here for another year at least.  I should end up getting a new UBS email address soon, also my hotmail account is a good address, rmsling@hotmail.com	So when are you up in Portland?  It was two years ago january since I've seen you!  Hope everthing is going well.

FWD: hey ry-man! how's tricks? all is on the well-ish tip w/me, um...i hate to be the ba-zillionth person to ask, but what is your story re: employment now? funny thing...rick waddell-enron VP in houston was a co-chair for the round table i was on at a foreign policy conference up at west point during the week preceeding enron's public announcement. actually, the conference ended that very day- all quite interesting...:) anyhow, hope you get this. i will wait to hear that you are still recieving email at this address before i blab on much more. ah! i do look forward to hearing from you and hope all is wund-a-mous w/youse. misses! kelly (mcintyre)

On sunday we had a problem with PSCO, they tried to back out of a purchase from El Paso since they claimed they were picking up the power at the FC 230 bus instead of the 345 bus.  Also there is an issue with the schedule being until further.  This once again highlights our need to be as clear as possible on ALL aspects of the deals that we do.  All new people should have a discussion with myself or another senior member as to the differences between the FC's busses, N. Gila vs. Devers and other points on the grid that you are unsure of.

thanks,

I know your ad said that you wouldn't reply to anything without a picture but I'm not really computer literate yet and I thought your posting was interesting.  Energy law is a hobby for me right now since I'm an electricity trader for Enron.  Anyway, I'm not really looking for anything more than to meet some new people.  Hanging around traders all the time gets a little out of control and leads to meeting the wrong girls.  If you want to email let me know.

PLEASE BE VERY CAREFUL WITH DEAL ENTRY, EXTENDING DEALS, BROKER FEES AND KEEPING STRAIGHT WHICH BOOK YOU ARE DOING THE DEAL UNDER.  THESE ARE ALL PROBLEMS I ENCOUNTERED WHEN RUNNING THE SAR TONIGHT IN A ADDITION TO MPC DEALS NOT BEING IN THE SHEET, AS I TALKED TO YOU GUYS ABOUT THAT EARLIER.  PLEASE SORT THE SERVICES AND INC SHEET EITHER BY DEAL, SOURCE OR SINK.  JUST LUMPING IT ALL TOGETHER IN AN ENDLESS STRING OF DEALS IS LIKE PLAYING 52 CARD PICK UP WHEN THERE ARE MISTAKES IN MANY OF THE DEALS.

FOR HE 11  5/13/01, I CUT A 50MW WHEEL REALTIME FROM MALIN/MEAD230.

RYAN SLINGER

For HE 21&22 of 5/4/01 18mw was cut to a zero

For HE 24&1 of 5/4-5 10mw was cut to a zero

There were some schedule changes to april and may due to some training classes on the last weeekend in April.  If anyone has conflicts let me know or trade where possible.

I designed a slightly different el paso model and it is in the Jan 02 el paso folder under Test El Paso Model.  The differences are just getting rid of the PX junk and adding in places to copy in the dispatch info(notes and proposed buy/sale decisions).  It should make it easier for the person on the following day shift to make a good hand off and evening peak decision.  If you have any ideas or want to design a new preschedule tab or anything else that would be cool.

We are long 10mw SP15 from the APX for HE 1-10 at a price of $15.  EES is short so you should be able to offset the two.  The deal is not in Caps or Enpower.

Jeanne,

Per our conversation, I am requesting a check for the remaining dollar value 
from the relocation credit card provided to me.  The name as it appears on 
the card is Matthew Smith.  My new address is:  2345 Bering Dr., Apt. 514, 
Houston, TX 77057.  It would be great to have the check by the end of the 
week.

Thanks you.

Mat

Thanks, Gwen.

Well, it wasn't that bad.  I was delayed a half an hour from Newark and then 
was only about a half an hour late getting into Houston.  I made it to bed by 
12:15 am and managed to drag myself out of bed at 5 am.  I have a bunch of 
work to do this week which SUCKS, but I'm interested and excited about what I 
have to do, so it's good.  Fortunately this scheduling thing has become 
second nature so I don't really have to think too much this morning.  How are 
you?

Mat  

kathy.scully@milliman.com on 01/16/2001 08:20:52 AM

what time did you get home and when did you wake up?

So tired I am.

Hey, we need to talk.  So far I've gotten Duncan's check and that's it.  I 
have not gotten the place yet, since I was waiting for you to tell me that 
they are on their way.  Since I have not heard from you, I'm assuming they 
are not....so what's up?  I still need everyone's email because I don't not 
have those original messages with everyones address on them.  I think it 
would be great if everyone who's commited could send me an email just saying 
when they plan on paying...I guess it's really only your friend and Duncan's 
friend, so I guess it's not really a big deal.  I don't know, I guess I just 
don't have a warm fuzzy feeling because you're the only person I speak to and 
I often times have trouble getting in touch with you, which by the way, you 
never did reply to my email asking how often you read you email so I know 
whether I should use it to get in touch with you.

Anyway, I just got back from NYC...had a great time, except for the fact that 
Scully feels the need to build a wall between us.  I can deal, but its just 
kind of annoying.  I just feel the need to put this skiing thing to bed 
quickly.

Mat

Hey baby,
If you haven't already, I say let's go with the 22nd-25th in Feb.  We have
our six and can add on others as they fill in, but I'm done waiting for
people to get back to me!!!! Did you get my card yet?
Can't wait!!!

The snow was heavy on Sunday but what a great time!!!   Last night I took a
lesson and we hit the moguls (or as those "in the know" refer to them as,
"the bumps").  What a rush.  My ski's are a tad long for me (180's) and so
it was tough at first but about three runs into it I started feeling the
rhythm and that was it....total addiction!!

So what's going on???

love, k

you know where you are going some do not.  Please get with me ASAP so we can

so not even remotely funny.

Thanks for reminding me, I was in the process of emailing you, but I got 
distracted.  Anyway, it was working for Ken because he had someone's password 
coded into the file.  One of the IT guys found it and coded it into my file, 
so that I really don't need access anymore.  Apparently I have all the 
necessary software as well.  Thanks.

Mat

Phillip,

I'm building a sheet for each person specifically for financial hedging.  
Each day it will pull in the previous days position and previous day price 
curve to calculate the mark to market.  Then that day's transactions can be 
entered to calculate the P & L of transactions which close out previous 
positions, as well as to calculate the new open positions.  Initially, I 
thought that daily P&L could be calculated by simply adjusting the P&L 
whenever a transaction was made by the difference between the bid/offer of 
the closed out position by the offer/bid of the new position (of course time 
value and storage costs would be included).  However, this only works if the 
person is 100% hedged, meaning they do not have any open positions which 
require marking.  As the seller of synthetic storage utilizing 100% hedging, 
I should be able to do this, except for the fact that I will have size limits 
on transactions that will probably leave me open here and there.  

The main question I have is simply, "Should I be calculating the P&L for each 
person's storage book for open and closed positions?"  Then beyond that, if 
we do calculate the P&L's from the buyer side, it seems that if their storage 
is not hedged, I will have to develop the market value of the storage in the 
ground and the remaining capacity to mark to market it.  So, I guess I could 
apply the model for that purpose.  Does this make sense to you?  Any comments 
are appreciated.  Thanks.

Mat

Hey, I hope you've gotton a chance to get a phone any everything.  I finally 
have access to all the computer applications that I need.  If only I had 
access to the directories with the required files!  

Anyway, I wondering what you thought about drinks after work thursday and if 
you had any venue preference?

Mat

I was waiting by the phone all day and night for you to call, but no, I was 
ever dissappointed that I was not a high priority for you.  I suppose I'll 
just keep waiting.

Mat

Hey cutie, I just spent forever writing you a nice little reply to your
email on the ski trip, my email availibility, phone b.s, your NYC trip and
Scully, all to have this piece of shit freeze up....so I think perhaps I
will just try to get some time to call you tonight!!!!
love, k

You should now have checks from myself, Duncan and Bill.  Sharon said she
would get back to me today, but I think we should jump on this lodge asap.

Tom,

Thanks for the new version.  I finally got the other version to work, but 
only by running it on Ken's computer.  I have some questions regarding the 
summary sheet, and I plan on spending a significant amount of time with the 
model this weekend....so yes, let's meet tomorrow if possible.  I'm free 
anytime except between 9:30 am and noon.  Just name the time and place.  I 
also need to get familiar with the model used in Chicago for the real time 
decision making.  Speak to you soon.

Mat

Tom,

Here are the two curve files for this year that I have downloaded.  Thanks 
for your help.

Mat

Kristen,

I thought Mark had called you, but I guess not.  He said that he can't have 
Wendy and Amy change their plans, so he can't go on the ski trip.  It was 
pathetic....I heard, "so, are you guys still planning on coming that 
weekend?...well good...."  He proceeded to talk for at least two hours on the 
phone, and just mentioned the outcome yesterday.  I pushed him to give me 
details, but all he said was the cost was a major factor and that Wendy had 
time off.  I think he was bullshiting and that he never really asked them 
(I'm such a skeptic).  Anyway, fuck'm.  Any ideas?

Mat

Sorry, I'm busy...work.

Brad,

What's up cuz?  Are the lights on in San Francisco?  I think it's only a 
matter of time before the national guard comes in to prevent rioting in the 
streets!

Anyway, I was just wondering what plans you have in the next month or so 
because I want to go someplace and do something, but I'm just not sure what 
yet.  I have a bunch of vacation I need to take and I'd rather not sit around 
here and twidle my thumbs.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.  

Mat

Yo, sorry I haven't gotten back to you right away.  I am still trying to 
figure when and where I'm taking vacation.   Puerto Rico is right up there, 
buddy, so what's the latest on the whole contract extension?  I checked some 
airfares a couple of weeks ago and, WOW, it was a bit high, which is why I 
didn't jump right on this.  I'll do some checking tonight, and I'll let you 
know what I come up with.  Ideally, mid to end of February is best, but of 
course, that all depends on if you're still going to be there. Anyway,  I 
just wanted to let you know, I'm still considering.

Mat

We need to work out a system here Kristen.  Why is it you are so freakin hard 
to get in touch with?  I asked you how often you check email, but you've 
never told me, once a day, week, what?  And this cell phone thing...Do you 
have it with you all the time...is it on...if not, how often do you check 
voicemail...how long after I leave a message should I expect to here from 
you?  I'm generally impatient, which is why it kills me to wait to hear from 
you, especially when I have not idea of what time frame to expect.  

Anyway, I really need to make plans, otherwise I'm going to go to Utah with 
Dave, or San Fran, or Puerto Rico.

Mat

Hey, I don't know if you've been reading any of those emails today, but 
please tell me we (as in me and you) can do something other than hand out 
with those fucking losers.  You know Mark's all over this fucking thing!

Trading was boring today, well, boring because I'm not participating yet.  
Soon though.  The superbowl isn't until 6 pm I think, so yes, I say we go 
someplace or your place.  I'll just tell everyone I have to work, which I do 
anyway.  It'll be my second to last weekend stint.  I'm jealous about you 
being in NY.  Have a drinky for me.  I'm going to look for some pussy on 
saturday...big "frat" style party at some chics place.  Too bad you're 
away...I'm sure we could do well.  Anyway, have fun in NY.

Mateo

Marlo,

As discussed, I am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested 
information.  Each spreadsheets are identified by month.  Within each 
spreadsheet are a number of tabs.  Based on the customers you mentioned on 
the phone, I believe you need only to use the "OCCMarkets" tab.  Customers 
are along the horizontal with dates on the vertical.  For each customer, 
several columns are used to identify the gas supplied to the customer from 
each location.  Please call if you have any further questions.

Mat

Sara,

Yo, what's up?  How are things across the street?  Let me guess, you got all 
rested up saturday and sunday, then when out three nights already this week, 
and now are ready to go home, do laundry and sleep.  Unfortunately, I've been 
extremely lame, mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not.  Anyway, I 
haven't been feeling so hot, yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning 
which really helped.  Poor Ted had to pick the slack.  So, any big plans for 
the weekend besides laundry?  Superbowl?  Happy hour?  Toilet flushing into 
the phone?  Stupid drunk?  

Mat

Andrea,

I'm rotating as part of the trading track sometime before March 1st to the 
Gas Fundamentals Group.  I'll get you the required information next week.  
Thanks.

Mat

Hmmm, I don't if I could pass up an opportunity to dive the Caymen islands.  
Timing wise the end of February still works best, but if you're still working 
then it wouldn't be nearly as cool as if it were March and you weren't 
working, so I'm willing to hold out until you know your fate.  Definitely 
keep me informed, though.  I'll just plan a ski trip in the mean time to hold 
me over.  Say hi to the crew for me...and of course, Jewels.

Mat
 

Try to call me at work today and I'll give you the latest fare availability.  
713-853-0472.   

Talk to you later.

Mateo

As a matter of fact, mark your damn calender......March 8-11....I'm in town 
and will hopefully be attending the Big Championship game Sat.. night, 
otherwise just partying.  Again, you name the time and place, and whoever 
else might be interested in "getting it done".  How's the residency going?  
Enron kicks ass, but I feel like it's going to take me forever to get where I 
need to be, and you won't believe where that is, but more on that later.  Go 
Syracuse.

Tom,

I believe that your right up correctly interprets the current model, but as 
we discussed, I think the more correct methodology is to use the next day's 
cash price since the Gas Daily print is for gas traded the previous day and 
delivered the same day as the print.  If I'm trading day gas on April 7th, 
the prices I'm basing my decisions on are those represented in the Gas Daily 
print for April 8th.  If we do not change the model, I think we need another 
sentence to clarify that the cash prices a day behind.  Of course, eventually 
we need to fix the model.

Mat

A-eet

I'm going to be working late, and I have some errands I need to run, so I 
don't really have plans, except that dinner will probably be around 8 pm or 
so.

Mat

I have consulted my partner, and it would be great if we could be added to 
the reservation list.  Please pass this on to whoever.

R U  coming?? It's gonna be a good time........
?
Ok gang - here's what I have so far  for Sunday.? We need to be there around 
10:45 (11:05 at the latest!)?  They won't seat us if we are all not there.? 
The list so far includes  Alexis, Lou, Mark, Keri, Katya, Angie and myself.? 
We can add to the  reservations up to Sat.? so let me know if any one else 
wants to come  (Tammy???).? Also, is Andrea, Matt or Jeff coming??

Yan,

Based on my review conducted the morning of February 6th, here is a list of 
items that need to be addressed in the next version of the West Desk's Flow 
Summary sheet:

PGT - These numbers appear to be one day off.  The numbers in the Test Sheet 
for February 6th are identical to those used by the West Desk yesterday for 
February 5th.  I verified that they are the Cycle 2 numbers posted on PGT's 
website for the 5th.  Generally, we use the Cycle 2 numbers, however, 
sometimes only Cycle one is available for our morning meeting.

Northwest - None of these numbers match our flow sheet.  It appears the Test 
Sheet pulls Cycle 3 nominations, whereas we use Cycle 6.  However, the 
website we use to pull the flows is generally not available to use until as 
late as 7 am (we are not sure why).  I understand you may pull the numbers 
from a different place, so we should find out whether you can get the numbers 
earlier.

TW - TW numbers appear to be correct, except for the IB Link number.  We pull 
the IB link number from the El Paso Blanco I/C point reported by TW.  It 
looks like your sheet pulls the number from the El Paso INWPLBLA point.  They 
differ by about 5,000, but I don't know if one is more correct than the 
other.  To be consistent, though, we should probably change the Test Sheet.

PGE - The numbers also appear to be one day off.  The numbers for February 
6th are identical to our Feb. 5th numbers.  Is this a reporting or a 
scrubbing problem?  It is possible you are pulling the data from the website 
before they update it with the next day's data.  We manually type these 
numbers in.  If you pull from our spreadsheet, then the latest numbers would 
not be in when this report is run.

El Paso - Most of the numbers appear to be correct, except for the plant 
receipts.  The numbers are close, but we should compare our formulas because 
I don't think this is a cycle problem.

General - The "Difference" column of the Test Sheet compares the latest cycle 
for the current with the final cycle of the previous day.  This can cause 
intraday fluxuations in scheduled quantities to appear as day to day 
fluxuations.  Any "Difference" column should compare identical cycles.  I 
suggest that we add additional cycles to the Test Sheet for the current day 
and the previous day.  This way we can compare identical cycles as well as 
pick up any intraday fluxuations.

As we discussed, you'll let me know when you're ready to revise this report.  
These notes should give us a great place to start.  I look forward to getting 
this report ready to use.

Mat

I didn't forget, I'm just new to Lotus...

What's up?  Any news on Pirnie/AFI contract negotiations?  

No skiing yet.  Unfortunately, my trips are in limbo.  I'm pretty sure I'm 
going to South Padre island in two weeks, but the skiing might wait until 
March, except that I'm going to NY for the Big East Championship Game and my 
brother's coming down here for a week to hang out.  Oh well, I need the 
vacations...

No word yet-
Raul and John Batten are here today trying to sell our services to the new
administration - so we should hopefully know soon...  Did you go skiing?

What's up?  Any news on Pirnie/AFI contract negotiations?

Sorry, Jeff and I went to happy hour.

What is the deal with this glitter thing?

Hey honey, how was the Men's Club?  

I look forward to the details.....

I told you I'd help.  Just be patient.

Ina,

I was not out today.  Yesterday and today I was taking a class.  I'm sorry I 
didn't tell anyone, it was a last minute decision.

Mat

Alexis,

I think I'm going to the cookoff, so I'm will have to decline.  Sorry.

Mat

I'll have to think about it.

Thanks.

Marlo, 

Can you please forward that email you sent me to Patti Sullivan since I have 
not used the path manager and my mail forward feature is not working.  Thanks.

Mat

Hey Jennifer, I actually have a couple friends in town this weekend as well, 
and we'll definitely be looking for some of Houston's finest entertainment 
(and although the strip clubs are rated highly here, that's not what I'm 
referring to).  I'd definitely be interested going out Sat., but I don't have 
any suggestions as of yet.  I'll see what I can come up with.

Mat

Indian chick is a party girl.

Duncan and Kristen are coming Saturday.  I don't know about the Rodeo.  Over.

Fuck, I'm writing this while I'm chewing on lunch.

Lunch today with details? 

Indian chick is a party girl. 

Hey,

I haven't heard from you.  Have you bought your Padre tickets?

Mat

I'll call you tonight.

Steve,

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from the 
meteorologists...................

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.  
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here 
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to run.

Mat

4069450@archwireless.net

you can send him email on it.

I want to know what its about.

Mat

Do you have his pager number????  His cell phone isn't working and I NEED to
talk him NOW.

you didn't answer my question.

Jennifer,

As it stands right now, don't count me in for dinner.  I may call you tonight 
or tomorrow if it works out that I can come.  I think my friends would like 
it, but they're here seeing someone else as well.  If I don't make it to 
dinner, we'll definitely meet you guys out afterwards.

Mat

Yo, you about ready?

word.

I should be good for a place to say, but I certainly appreciate the offer.  
I'm definitely still coming, though.  Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, tell me 
when you're free, and we'll hang out.  You and Jess up for dinner?  Right 
now, saturday night is the only night I have plans (basketball game).  I'll 
be going out afterwards, though.  Just let me know.

Later.

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got 
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to 
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope 
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Mat

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Hey buddy, what's happening?  Not much up here these days.  I took last week 
off and Phillip is out this week, so I don't have much to do.  I'm pretty 
much done scheduling and I start next week in Gaskill's group.  

Anyway, you were going to send me the names of those guys in London we talked 
to about the synthetic storage, and if you did, I lost them.  Regardless, any 
chance of digging them up for me?  I may want to talk to them about their bid 
process.  I think Phillip is ok with going ahead with the idea, but I think I 
need to keep the ball rolling here with or without him.

Mat

Oh, I had fun as well.  I'm glad you guys came.  Unfortunately the rest of 
the week was not great, but Jeffrey and I met some ladies friday night and at 
about 2 am we all decided to head to Louisiana to gamble!  It's a great 
story!  I went flying on Sunday too which was nice.  Give me a call if you 
want to chat sometime.

Mat

Hey boy.  HOw's it goin?  Hey, I just wanted to write to say thanks for the
fun while we were in Houston and the week in general, but mostly for taking
care of my drunk, annoying ass at the airport.  I think I was still a little
looped the next morning.  Totally sorry if that turned into a big
babysitting job for you!!!

So, did you have a fantastic weekend after we left?  How did you avoid the
freaks?  love, k

Tom,

I took a few days off and just got back....

Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm 
sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way 
too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even 
when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to 
run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if 
you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this 
thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the 
results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out 
all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the 
parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, 
then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a 
bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  
Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

Hi Mat,
I took away your licence key from the back of your PC yesterday.  The 
problems with our network licence for the solver have gone away - I do not 
really understand what happened.  Try the model aand see if it works OK - 
runs fine on my computer now, whereas it did not run 2 weeks ago.  I suspect 
some sort of network problem, and IT have not been able to figure out any 
more likely cause.

Tom

Tom,

Sounds fine anytime is good.  Basically the parameters that need changing are 
those on the Optimizer sheet:

Start/End Date
Spreads
Max Inj/With rates
Max Storage volume
Selected Curve
Storage Facility

I'm free all week, so let me know when and where if you want to get together.

Hi Matt,
Multiple values for parameters - sounds OK.  I'd add an extra run option to 
the menu bar, and you could set up a list of parameters on a separate tab, 
each line corresponding to a complete run.  How about a meeting tomorrow when 
you could tell me what parameters need to be varied?

Hey, thanks for returning my call.  As you're probably out from work, I'll 
try you again when I get in tomorrow (thursday).  I basically just wanted to 
touch base again since Ken has now moved on and left me with our synthetic 
storage project.  I'm also looking for a legal and EOL contact to help us 
develop a contract and run the bid process through EOL.  You may have 
provided these to Ken, but I can't get in touch with him.  Thanks again.

Mat

Well March probably isn't great for me anyway...going to NYC 8-11, and my 
brother's coming for a week.  So, I guess just keep me posted.  I took a week 
off and went to South Padre island so it took the edge off my need to get 
away, but certainly did not completely satsify.  Still looking for more.

Talk to you later.

Mat

Dude

sorry for the long response period - howz it???

So the saga continues - we have no contract extension - in fact - today in
March 1 and our contract ended yesterday - it is anticipated that we will
get an extension through March - but it hasn't happened yet - aye bendito!!!

In a way I hope the whole thing just blows up so I can go hang in the
Caymans for a while - how sweet would that be???

anyway, March is not looking that good - going to CA on the 17,18 - got a
chickie visiting 24/25 - and going to NY for the Pirnie technical symposium
on the 3/31 and 4/1...  how did life get so freekin' hectic.

I'll keep you posted

Steve,

Yo, what's up?  I'm just sitting at work getting the weather updates from
the meteorologists...................

Anyway, I was just wondering what the latest is on the the Pirnie/AFI saga.
Are you out of a job yet?  I'm feeling the need to get the hell out of here
and take a vacation.  Still thinking of your neck of the woods.  Got to
run.

Mat,
Could you send me the StorageValue.xls and the curves spreadsheet you are 
reading from, please?  I'll test the model on my PC with the settings you are 
using.

Installing on another PC is no problem.

Tom

So where the hell was it?

Did you want me to print my resume off and bring you a copy tonight?  I have
to drop off Jeff's "gift" before he leaves...I figured I might as well bring
you a hard copy.

Hey you!

I just noticed that Enron has a HR Rotational Program opening on
flipdog.com.  Should I go ahead and submit it online or would have a better
shot waiting if you submit it?

Just one thing, my first name only has one "t" in it.  

Thanks.

Please take a careful look at the numbers on the phone card and let me know

Hey, I didn't call you back because of the fuckup that I learned of right 
after you hung up on me.  I'm sorry.

testing 1 2 3.

Once again, I was out when you sent me mail.  I went to NYC for a long 
weekend.  Had a great time, but I'm still exhausted.  Hope you're having a 
great time in Utah.  If you get back before the weekend, drop me an email.

Hey Mat- hope you enjoyed your time off.  I'm heading to Utah for some
skiing next week for a little break myself.  Anything going on tonight?

Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Mat

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at
the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Dean's is located on Main between Prairie and Preston.

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of
you), we are going to dinner at El Tiempo downtown (713-221-1695 @ Main &
Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.

Chris,

I met with Phillip yesterday, and he had a few more items to add to his list 
of objectives for me.  For your information, the attached table provides the 
additional items.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.  
Also, the following e-mail from Mike Grigsby relates to the Socal sendout 
model objective.  Also for your information, I will be running Randy Gay's 
EOL product (Keystone Cash) next week and will be covering for Tori K during 
her maternity leave.  I don't expect these activities to interfere with my 
fundy responsibilities. 

Mat

Let's have Matt start on the following:

Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
database created should help him forecast core demand.

Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
TW pipelines.

Mike

i would love to, except for the fact that I have a 4:30 meeting, because of 
which I had to cancel my flying time!  Call me later.

and by the way, i don't check my email that often, so you might want to try 
my phone or pager 8774892073@pagenetmessage.net in the future.

Mat

thanks.

I have added the pipes that you asked for....

Chris,

This spread sheet contains the new WIC meters, as discussed.  I also 
discovered that there are about 200 meters we current get manually for CIG 
that also need to be added to the database.  They are included in the 
attached file on separate sheets.  Meters already existing in the database 
are not included for either pipe.  Can you please dump these into the 
database and set up additional sheets in the Socal manual entry spreadsheet 
for these meters.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Mat

Amanda,

Can you please add this link to the fundy website under the Power tab.  It 
should be called "Proposed Gas Generation Plants".  Thanks.

Mat

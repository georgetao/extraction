you didn't think that was funny?  do i need to explain that one?

i say we go to tealas and sit on the porch.

sorry i didn't call you back last night.  i didn't get home until late.  looks bad over here.  everything was business as usual until yesterday.  i think our books were so cooked that it is beyond repair.  i will call you later.

dynegy trades around their assets.  they aren't big risk takers like enron.  looks like the deal is now done.  now we just need to wait and see what happens.  

Sorry to hear that. I read where the treasurer and a corporate attorney were
canned. I still feel the trading unit is somewhat elite in the business and
that whoever takes you over will realize that. What is Dynegy like. Good
capital with Texaco/Chevron behind them.

Racist photos of fraternity members
rocks Auburn, brings condemnation
<<...>>
By DREW JUBERA < mailto:djubera@ajc.com <mailto:djubera@ajc.com> >
Atlanta Journal-Constitution Staff Writer
<<...>>
Auburn, Ala. -- When the Southern Poverty Law Center received a call this
week about Internet photos of an Auburn University fraternity member
dressed
as a rifle-toting Klansman pretending to lynch a white student in
blackface,
the staff checked out the photo's date.

"We wanted to verify that it was taken in 2001, not 1951," said Kelvin
Datcher of the center in Montgomery that tracks incidents of bigotry. "The
kids who called us were frantic."

The photo, and others of students in blackface wearing Afros, jewelry and
jerseys with the lettering of a black fraternity, were taken this year at
Halloween parties at two fraternity houses and posted on the Internet by a
party-photo service.

The incident has rocked the campus of more than 22,000 students, which
bills
itself as "the loveliest village on the plain" and says it is intent on
recruiting minorities. As the photos illustrate, a racist, segregated past
is hard to escape.

Students at Auburn and other colleges have no personal memory of Jim Crow
segregation. But when it comes to socializing, many students gravitate
toward those of their own race. And social fraternities and sororities --
many of which used to enforce racial exclusionary clauses -- remain some of
the last bastions of segregationist attitudes.

Last year, when a black freshman applied to the University of Georgia's
all-white Alpha Gamma Delta, most of the members were adamant that she be
rejected. "If we had a black girl in our sorority, none of the fraternities
would want to do anything with us," one was quoted as saying.

That incident came to light because one sorority member, Ali Davis, filed a
racial discrimination complaint. UGA temporarily suspended Alpha Gamma
Delta
during an investigation. Davis, saying she felt ostracized, later left the
school.

Around the country, the Kappa Alpha Order, which is fond of displaying the
Confederate battle flag, has been implicated in various racial incidents in
recent years, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported.

The Louisiana Tech University chapter was placed on probation after a
confrontation with black football players in which frat members made racist
remarks, the center said. At Millsaps College in Mississippi, Kappa Alphas
dressed in Afro wigs and blackface to protest pro-minority initiatives. In
February, the KA chapter at the University of North Texas received a
five-year suspension for disorderly conduct and verbal intimidation after
some members were accused of racist remarks.

Such antics aren't limited to Kappa Alpha or the South, the Southern
Poverty
Law Center said. Several fraternities and sororities at New Hampshire's
Dartmouth College threw a "ghetto party" in which students dressed up as
urban African-Americans -- a theme that has surfaced at other campuses --
while a sorority there promoted a "slave auction" fund-raiser. The Sigma
Chi
fraternity at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln burned a cross at one of
its ceremonies.

Such incidents leave college administrators, especially those assigned to
foster diversity, wringing their hands.
"We've been working so hard to do the right thing, and then something like
this happens," Doyle Bickers, Auburn's director of admissions, said
Wednesday of the warped Halloween humor. "It breaks your heart."

"You can't escape your history," added Jim Hardin, an adviser in the
student
life center. "When something like this comes up, the question is, 'Have you
really changed, or are you just putting on a good front?' "

What has changed at Auburn, according to many black students, who make up
7.2 percent of the student body, is the administration's swift and open
reaction.

Interim President William F. Walker immediately condemned the costumes as
"shocking and outrageous" and suspended the fraternities, Beta Theta Pi and
Delta Sigma Phi. He attended a meeting of the Black Student Union and
promised a thorough but swift investigation, which is expected to be
completed within 10 days. Stories on the incident were displayed on the
university's Web site.

Delta Sigma Phi has expelled the two members who dressed as a Klansman and
his lynching victim, and suspended four others.

"Similar things have happened before," said Roland Harris, a junior
management information systems major and member of Phi Beta Sigma, one of
four historically black fraternities on campus. "But this time a lot of
people saw it, and they have to do something."

Auburn admitted its first black student, surrounded by 100 Alabama state
troopers, in 1961. The first black man pledged a traditionally white
fraternity in 1984, and there currently is one black pledge among those 24
fraternities.

Auburn's overall black population is still less than at most Southeastern
Conference universities, but stepped-up recruiting efforts led to a 24
percent increase of African-Americans admitted to this year's freshman
class. One sign of changing times: The university's Student Government
Association president is an African-American.

"We were finally beginning to say, 'Thank God, we're making some headway,'
and here comes this sad, unfortunate, damaging incident," said John
Bello-Ogunu, head of the university's office of multicultural affairs. "It
will no doubt be detrimental to our efforts to attract not only minority
students, but faculty and other staff as well."

Bello-Ogunu said the administration's reaction has been "on the mark." He
added that more action is needed, including diversity training for
fraternities. At the invitation of university officials and students, the
Southern Poverty Law Center will conduct a "mass workshop" on tolerance on
Wednesday.

Prentice Gilbert, an Auburn senior who oversees the campus' historically
black fraternities and who has helped recruit black students, said it will
take time to remedy the Halloween incident's impact.

"I have to keep reminding myself these were the actions of a few
individuals
who do not represent Auburn as a whole," Gilbert said. "This is the most
devastating blow we could take."

"The bottom line is, do we really want to be the 'Auburn family'?" he
added.
"If so, we really could become the loveliest village on the plain, as our
motto says."

hey!  I got your message this morning.  I didn't even end up going out. 
I came home and went straight to bed - i was so tired. 
I did good on the two parts that I studied for.  But the other two - I had 
no freakin clue what was going on.  I pulle the ole' "if in doubt, choose B or C". 
Oh well. 
What are you doing this weekend?  
I'm going to Austin this afternoon. 
My friend, Erika, (that moved to N.Y.) will be there and I'm going to hang out with 
her and Kate.  Do you remember them?  Erika is the tall girl that lived with Shirley and 
Mike Ecklund.  Kate is the blonde that used to hang out with me a lot. 
Get this - Kate was dating a guy from Austin for about a year and she moved there 2 months ago. 
Well, he just dumped her.  Can you believe that?  He begged her to move there and she doesn't 
know anyone else there. 
Anyway, she is pretty upset - so i'm going to party with her this weekend. 

tux has been ordered.  speech is being considered.

no problem.  hull said it wouldn't be a good party anyway.  you know you didn't fall asleep, it is called passing out.

I want to apologize to everyone for my Houdini act on Friday.  I went home to get a new battery for my cell phone (the phone died, I didn't turn it off), change clothes, etc. and ended up falling asleep on my couch.  It's lame but that is what happened.  I understand you had trouble finding the house (from cell messages).  Again, I am sorry for not getting back in touch.  

Thanks
Harry B.

what is your cell number again

they did talk to the trading floor yesterday and everyone was upset.  the only thing i can say for him is that at least he has hung around and stood in the fire.  skilling and fastow bolted.  i have no respect for them.  i guess his golden parachutte was in place since 89, but that was a situation in which the company is trading at 80 and we are taken over at 110.  not 90 down to 10.  

I read in the WSJ that Lay is foregoing his $60.2 million parachute. How
thoughtful! The article said that considerable pressure was exerted by the
trading department. Were you in on any of it? Hooray for the trading
department. Lay took a chunk out of Enron over the years. Can the trading
department go after Skilling and Fastow?

r&r was fun.  we went downtown first and it sucked.  i felt like i was in kabul w/ all of al queda.  r&r was packed though.  i didn't get there until around 1am.  when are you going home?

no, i didn't end up going out.  i went out friday night and felt hung over until 
about 5 on saturday, so i decided to take it easy.  
i heard you went to R&R.  how was it?  did you have a good time? 
i was going to call you yesterday to ask you about it. 

that is disgusting.  watch for me i will be the one dancing like a maniac.

i am going to stay here.  i am going to the ut/a&m game on fri.  i am just looking forward to hanging out and relaxing.  i need to get some sleep, relax and get my mind off of enron.  seems like it is day to day on whether or not we are going out of business.  it is wearing on me.  

i'm probably going home wednesday night.  what about you--are you 
staying here or going home? 

i want to see what my market value is.  i don't know what is going to happen here.  if you want to do a happy hour let me know.  maybe tomorrow after work or something.  let me know if you are up for it.

i feel bad for you.  it must be stressful there. 
let me know if you want to relax with a good 
margarita this week. 
are you going to start looking for something else, in case it goes 
out of business or are you going to wait it out? 

i guess i won't take paige to this

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

i was going to come home this weekend if you knew them.  we would have to set up a service contract with those chicks.

that was great.  that is as funny as i get.

what is shawn's cell phone number?  he was supposed to stay at my place last night and he didn't show up.

yeah baby.  i was there two weeks ago and there were hotties everywhere.  i am going to come home in the early part of july and we will figure out the final details.

 THE GOLFING NUN
A nun is sitting with her Mother Superior chatting.
"I used some horrible language this week and feel absolutely terrible
about it."
"When did you use this awful language?" asks the elder.
"Well, I was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked like it was
going to go over 280 yards, but it struck a phone line that was hanging
over the fairway and fell straight down to the ground after going only
about 10 yards."

"Is that when you swore?"
"No, Mother," says the nun. "After that, a squirrel ran out of the
bushes and grabbed my ball in its mouth and began to run away."

"Is THAT when you swore?" asks the Mother Superior again.
"Well, no." says the nun. "You see, as the squirrel was running, an
eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and
began to fly away!"

"Is THAT when you swore?" asks the amazed elder nun.

"No, not yet. As the eagle carried the squirrel away in its claws, it
flew near the green and the squirrel dropped my ball."

"Did you swear THEN?" asked Mother Superior, becoming impatient.
"No, because the ball fell on a big rock, bounced over the sand trap,
rolled onto the green, and stopped about six inches from the hole."

The two nuns were silent for a moment. Then Mother Superior sighed ands
said, "You missed the fucking putt, didn't you?"

Fellas, Check out "Charley's" ride! You gotta watch him  with both eyes. Before you know it you'll be pull'n a 66 Chevy.

Monday, November 20

Departure: Tulsa 8:39 AM

It's really me!!!!

Where are you nowadays?

Where have you been?

What have you seen?

Inquiring minds want to know!

I don't know if you have corresponded with Flet lately, but he is officially 
a short timer.  Looks like he's the proud owner of Midwest Power now that 
John Z. has taken off for the Great White North (Calgary).

On a completely different note, Sandra is still waiting for her postcards.  
Apparently you promised to send a postcard every week or something.

Oh, by the way, Martin and Kevin are officially married now.  And Robin is in 
Toronto awaiting the fateful day.

That's about all for now.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Big Lew

Anytime after 4:00 PM.

I got a letter from Diem with their new London address.  I figure I'll give 
them a month or so to move in  before I look into visiting.  Of course, 
getting time off in this job is easier said than done.  Anyway, enjoy your 
trip, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Does this mean that you will consider providing this access in the near 
future?  I imagine their are quite a few employees who live in an apartment 
(almost all recent college graduates).  Considering the intentions of the 
program were to bring high technology into every employee's household, 
neglecting those that live in an apartment would make the program a failure 
in my opinion.

I would appreciate a more detailed response.

Thank you,

To whom it may concern:

I am disappointed by the lack of internet options.  For someone like myself 
that lives in an apartment, it looks like it will be impossible to get high 
speed internet access.  Perhaps you would consider cutting a deal with OpTel, 
since they provide high speed internet access to every apartment in Houston.

Thank you for time,

To whom it may concern:

First, why does the Dell public website have more choices for upgrades then 
the Enron website?  For example, the website available to the public has a 
19" monitor (M991) for an extra $140.

Second, why is Dell charging Enron employees more for the same products it 
offers to the general public?  For example, the website available to the 
public allows an upgrade from the E770 monitor to the P991 monitor for $290.  
The Enron website allows an upgrade from the E770 monitor to the P991 monitor 
for $400.  Therefore, Enron employees are being charged an extra $110 for the 
same upgrade.

I look forward to your response.

Hey,

How was your Christmas?  Did you guys get hammered with snow and ice?

My vacation was very relaxing, and I managed to leave just before the real 
cold weather set in.  It also looks like I'm going to miss the biggest snow 
storm of the winter by about five days.  

I'm still not sure what I am going to do for New Year's eve.  It's been so 
busy this week that I haven't had time to talk to any of my friends.  If you 
hear of anything let me know.

Anyway, since the Nymex closed at Noon, I think I am going to get the heck 
outta here.

Talk to you later.

Andy

Hey Eva,

Sorry for the delay, but it has been absolutely nuts lately.  I think the 
smallest move we have had in the last 2 weeks was 30 cents.  Not to mention 8 
of the days were close to or more than $1.00.  Luckily, most of us have been 
on the right side through all this.  And lest I forget about basis.  Demarc, 
Vent, Chicago all up 70 cents.  And PEPL basis trading as high as plus 25 
cents.

Anyway, I am taking a much deserved vacation.  I will be flying to Boston 
tomorrow and coming back on Christmas.  I am looking forward to just hanging 
out with the family and spending time with my nephew.  Let me know if you are 
going to be in Boston during this time. My cell phone number is 713-306-0760.

On a completely different note, we finally got your postcard from Peru.  
Sorry to hear about the backpack fiasco, but it sounds like you had an 
incredible. time.

Looks like its about time to get outta here.  Lots of laundry and packing to 
do.

- Big Lew

I received an e-mail earlier stating that I was to be included in the second 
pilot along with Martin Cuilla and several other members of the Central 
Desk.  Recently, Martin received a second e-mail asking him to accept an 
invitation to the program.  Since the deadline for this application is 
tomorrow, and I have yet to receive this e-mail, I would appreciate you 
contacting me by phone in order to verify my inclusion.

We finally got your postcards this week.  Sandra was excited to receive them.
It sounds like your having a blast in Asia.  I have always wanted to visit 
that part
of the world.  I have some friends that are moving to London in January, so I 
guess
that will have to be the first trip I take.

On a different note, this wednesday was a bit like a stick in the eye.  
However, there's 
always next week.

Robin's last name is now Zivic, so her new handle is Rhonda Zivic (Honda 
Civic).  

That's it for now.

Eva Pao <epao3@yahoo.com> on 10/31/2000 04:28:27 AM
right...
i did write more, but i don't think it went through.
anyway, just got back from asia.  after thailand, i
went to singapore (bright lights, big city), malaysia
(resort in the south (note: resorts not fun during
monsoon season), and cambodia (worth the visit, esp if
not harassed by customs officer).  all in all, i would
say that the best place i went to was Chiang Mai,
Thailand.  Thailand, as a whole, is the kind of place
that i would visit many times.

hope all is well at big E.  hope weds are treating you
right.  what is better than...?

Hey Eva,

We got two postcards so far. Sandra was pretty excited.  She said to tell you 
that she looks forward to the next batch. It sounds like your having a great 
time in Asia.  I have always wanted to visit that part of the world. 

Hey Eva,

Got your message, was waiting for you to write more.  I'll have to check with 
Sandra, but I haven't heard her say if she got your postcards.  

Robin came back from her honeymoon and you can't tell when she's blushing 
she's so red.  

The last two AGA's have been great.  One was a 40 cent move and the other was 
20 cents (what's better than Wednesdays?).

That's it for now.

Must go see Suey.

What do you mean we're not working hard enough?

You're the one that is never in the office when I call.  Not to mention all 
those stories Nicole told me about you partying it up in San Francisco.

You know what they say:  All play and no work out west makes the stock price 
go south.

Hey,

It has been awfully busy now that I'm managing both Gas Daily and 
Mid-continent Basis.  Luckily, the market has settled down and given me a 
chance to get up to speed.

Needless to say, I haven't been to any happy hours either.  I did get to go 
to an Astros game with Natsource a few weeks ago, however.  If I hear of 
anything I will let you know.

Anyway, looks like it's about quitting time.

For the second time, please sign me up.

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and currently park in the Allen Center and Metropolitan garage are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You may enter & exit on Clay St. and Bell St., also pedestrians, will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please respond via e-mail if you are interested in acquiring one of these spaces.

Monica,

I have added some information to the forwards section.

I just wanted to pass a note to you because I wanted to clear up the skepticism about my trading system.     
     Psychology is 90% of the markets.  Just look at how the markets react all the time to news or consumer confidence.  Trading that psychology is key, and this is why my profits are so consistent. 
     
     Every month my gap trading system makes money in an up or down market.  What I am teaching uses psychology to its highest degree.  I teach you the most optimal time to take advantage of bargain-hunting and profit-taking, the most psychologically influenced aspects of the market.  This really keeps you out of losing gap trades because you need a way to filter them out.  You don't have to put your opinion in which trade to take.
 
          I'm sure it is not what I am charging for my system that makes you skeptical.  After all, you already know you can get a refund.  It is probably the doubt that it can continue, so why waste your time, right?  I have given you profitable updates frequently, but you may still find it difficult to believe it will continue.   So, here is my thought... 
    
     Just take the step to "watch".  You really don't need the time commitment because I will show you everything.  You just have to read the 60 page manual, and I will take care of the rest.  I will spend the time to show you.  Log onto your computer in the mornings and look for my emails.  I'll give you the trades and so forth.  Watching these trades to see how they react is the proof to everything that I am telling you.  I have no problem spending as much time as you need to make this work for you too.
 
     If you have questions feel free to ask me.    http://www.gatg.net

Diem,

Not much going on at work.  Brushing up on meteorology 101 and discussing Reminiscences of a Stock Operator.  I have been going to work for only a few hours a day.  Some days I don't go in at all.  Right now, we are waiting for the Judge to approve the sale to UBS.  I think we would get our offers from them sometime soon after.  I have been using the free time to do a little travelling.  We went on a cruise in December and this week I am going to Chicago the 17 - 21.  I plan to go to Boston in February to see my family.  Anyway, my work number is 713-853-6278.

Talk to you soon.

Andy

P.S. Guess what these are:   .................

Hi Andy!  How are you doing?  Are you working are sitting around?  Give me
your work number so I can call you.

	AyyyyyMayyyyy,

	How was your trip?  I hope you were able to get lots of sleep.  Huy tried to get me to go drinking last night, but I was far too tired.  I didn't get done with interviews 	until after 7:00 PM.  Trang said you told her to take care of me while you were gone.  I thought that was very sweet, yet I can't help wondering if you think I can not 	take care of myself (that was a joke by the way). 

	Kelly sent me Linda's numbers with plenty of attitude.  She mentioned something about you having an abundance of time while she has a scarcity of time.  But you 	can't tell her I told you.  

	Looks like I gotta go.  I miss you, and look forward to hearing from you.

	Love,

	Andy

Mery,

I have attached the transportation scenario with some prices added.  

Unfortunately, I will not be available at 4:00 PM today.  Please call me tomorrow in order to reschedule.

Andy

 

Greg,

One of my concerns regarding the merger is future compensation.  It is well known throughout the industry that Dynegy pays the lowest bonuses.  What incentive do we have to make money next year knowing bonuses in 2002 will be abysmal?  For that matter, what guarantees will be made in order to prevent a massive exodus next year for this reason?

Thank you for your attention,

Andy

See correction below
Is the formula for calculating transport cost:

cost of gas at receipt*(1/(1- fuel ratio)) + commodity charge?

            Ann S. Chen
Andy --

I have a couple of questions as I dive more into the details of figuring
out transportation costs. Still trying to figure out how you make your
decision whether to transport or not.  You compare the cent spread between
the Amarillo(offer) and Chicago basis(bid)+Nicor Index(bid) versus the
transportation cost.  In the numbers you provided in your example, the
spread was 12 cents.  I'm still confused as to how you compute the
transportation cost to compare that spread with. The fuel ratio you
specified was 3.19% and the commodity was $0.0167.

Thanks,
Ann

Hi Andy --

Thanks for helping us understand the tranportation and storage problem
today. We appreciate your patience. I know it's like teaching a baby how to
walk!

Anyway, just wanted to get you the updated numbers for the transportation
scenario, based on the changes you made at teh meeting today.  Can you also
double check with Philip regarding the issue with hedging Basis with
regards to transportation?

Have a great weekend!

Thanks!
Ann

Just compare to the bid in chicago

Andy --

If that is the case, for the example we went through yesterday, the
transport cost would be:

(NYMEX offer + Amarillo offer)*(1/(1- fuel ratio)) + commodity charge
(2.80 -0.05)*(1/(1-0.0319)) + 0.0167
2.75*1.0329 + 0.0167 = $2.86

How do you compare this transport cost to the spread between Amarillo and
Chicago basis and index (12 cents) to decide whether to transport?

Thanks!
Ann

WSJ(1/14) UBS Emerges As Top Bidder For Enron Trading Unit 		

01/14/2002
Dow Jones News Services
(Copyright ? 2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith 
  Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal 

UBS AG, the giant Swiss financial firm, emerged the apparent victor to acquire Enron Corp.'s North American energy-trading operation. Enron hopes the deal will breathe new life into its dormant trading business, once the generator of 90% of the Houston company's profit. 

But obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable, as indicated by the fact there were only two serious bidders -- UBS and Citigroup Inc. Enron wouldn't see any serious money from the UBS deal for at least a year, indicating how difficult it will be for the energy company's creditors to recover what they are owed. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, the largest such filing ever, shielding the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize. 

Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to bankruptcy-court approval, Enron would transfer to UBS Warburg, the investment banking arm of UBS, its wholesale energy-trading operation, including a staff of roughly 800 people and computer systems and hardware that comprised its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform. UBS wouldn't be acquiring any of Enron's huge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound. It also wouldn't provide any cash upfront to Enron. 

Instead, UBS would pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third of the energy-trading enterprise's pretax profit for a 10-year period, according to Enron. UBS would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the payment to Enron of money in years three, four and five. UBS would pay Enron 5.75 times Enron's prior-year payment for each one-third share of royalty eliminated. As such, it could completely eliminate Enron's royalty payments by the end of the fifth year. 

As incentive to buy out Enron, UBS's royalty payments otherwise would increase by 10% from years five through 10, up to a maximum of 44% share of pretax profit. 

Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said yesterday that he felt it was a "grand-slam great deal" for creditors since new life is being breathed into a "perishable commodity." Enron's staff had been kept together largely on the basis of retention bonuses that expire at the end of February. The trading operation effectively suspended operations prior to Enron's Chapter 11 filing last month. 

Enron had hoped to bring in a credit-worthy partner to take a 51% stake in a new trading joint venture, leaving the energy company with a 49% stake. But Mr. McMahon said no bidder was interested in that deal. There also were no bids for the trading operation from rival energy or energy-trading companies. One possible reason was that resuscitating Enron's vast trading business would require a top credit rating, lots of capital to back trading operations and an expert credit-risk department to keep track of what traders are doing and to constantly revalue the trading book. 

Since the Enron debacle, other energy-trading firms have taken pains to show they are de-emphasizing commodity-like trading of electricity, which Enron pioneered, and are instead concentrating on selling their own output of energy products and entering into contracts to protect themselves against price volatility. 

Mr. McMahon said he feels that "by virtue of a AA-plus bank purchasing this business, it changes the landscape of the energy-merchant business forever" by putting more clout in the hands of institutions with top credit ratings. UBS apparently hasn't committed to provide any set level of capital. There is no determination, yet, for how royalty payments would be divided among Enron's thousands of creditors. 

The largest question, though, is whether the trading business can truly be revived. Although Enron's global wholesale division, which included as its biggest component the North American energy-trading operations, generated about $3 billion in pretax profit during the first nine months of 2001, it has been dormant now for more than a month. Martin Bienenstock, Enron's lead bankruptcy lawyer, characterized the deal as "the sale of something that was dead that we are trying to bring back to life." 

Competitors say they think a certain amount of Enron's trades were conducted at very thin margins in order to build volume, and that such trading practice likely will disappear. "You'll see the churn going away," says Michael McNally, chief financial officer of TXU Corp., now the biggest electricity trader in Texas. He thinks EnronOnline has "significant value but there's only a limited number of people who would know how to use it." Scaled to transact trades on hundreds of types of contracts, the platform is oversized for most uses. 

UBS Warburg, which bought PaineWebber in 2000, has looked to expand its U.S. market share, and the Enron deal would provide entry into energy trading. John Costas, chief executive of UBS Warburg, said Friday the Enron unit would be "a valuable extension of our world-wide trading activities." 

The winner of the auction, held under the bankruptcy court's supervision, was announced shortly after noon Friday in a packed Manhattan courtroom, less than an hour after the two bidders had submitted final offers. Enron's advisers and its creditors committee, which endorsed the UBS deal, had negotiated nonstop for more than 24 hours. In addition to Citigroup, which Mr. McMahon said competed "neck and neck" with UBS, BP PLC, the British oil company, had submitted a $25 million bid for the computer settlement support system of the Enron unit. 

The proposed UBS transaction is subject to approval by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, who officially closed the auction to new bidders Friday. A hearing is set for Thursday at which creditors will have an opportunity to voice objections. 

Separately Friday, Judge Gonzalez declined to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston, denying motions from several creditors who had argued that Enron's headquarters city was a more suitable venue.

Hi Teresa,
Believe it or not, I just got my directory...I guess they finally figured out 
where I am located!  I also found out that I need to correct the company for 
my directory information.  It needs to be Enron Transportation & Storage 
instead of Enron Corporation.  Thanks and talk to you soon!

Hi...how are you?  Things are going well, but I sure miss you guys !  I left 
you a vmail last night saying that I can't attend Poli's party.  Jim, Meghan 
and I are going to be on vacation in California.

Let's talk soon and think about me when you guys go to Uncle Tongs!

Wish you were here!  Can't believe you got away so fast!
How's your job - is it you?
How's Meghan? (sp right?)  Bring her to Poli's party .... I hope you come.

Write me and let me know how you're doing when you can.  Did you buy a
house?
I really miss talking to you (and lunch!).   All my lunch partners are gone.
Linda's wedding is coming along.  The wedding is planned for Sept. 9 - be
here before you know it.
I hate it that I didn't get to say bye to you - you were always a pleasure
to talk to you - always "up" - which is good!
BYE - write when you can.
Marilyn

I'm enjoying working at campus.  It's very nice being close to home and my
son's school.

Take care,

KN (Oneok) called to get more information about the Right of First Refusal in 
their current contract.  The minimum requirement to keep ROFR in a contract 
extension is with maximum rate for at least 1 year.  Cathy Bulf will let TW 
know by Monday, and in writing, if they would like to exercise.

Below is a summary of available future capacity to the California border:

effective 11/01/2001-10/31/2003, 13,500 Needles and 14,000 Topock
effective 11/01/2002-10/31/2003, 21,500 Needles
effective 04/01/2002-10/31/2002, 14,000 Topock
effective 04/01/2003-10/31/2003, 14,000 Topock 

The spreads are still pretty wide even through 2002 at 0.75; and here's an 
opportunity to capture it before it tightens.  

Transwestern's average deliveries to California were 1109 MMBtu/d (100%) with 
San Juan lateral throughput at 866 MMBtu/d and Rio Puerco at 94 MMBtu/d.  
Total east deliveries averaged 327 MMBtu/d.  

El Paso average deliveries to California were 2262 MMBtu/d (77%) :
- PG&ETop (capacity 1140 MMBtu/d) deliveries averaged 651 MMBtu/d (57%)
- SoCalEhr (capacity 1250 MMBtu/d) deliveries averaged 1074 MMBtu/d (86%)

Guys:
I've narrowed the list down to the minimum combination of packages.  Please 
build all receipts to all deliveries except for Same Combos (Oasis-Oasis, 
etc.) or any Pool-Pool Combos.  Thanks.

Yes, these numbers are the posted volumes according to their bulletin board.  
Update, as of 01/23...PG&ETop is 699 (61%), SoCalEhr is 1195 (96%), and 
SoCalTop ios 538 (100%).  These volumes are slightly above last week's 
posting.  I was told that the board was the official source for throughput 
information; but, I will see if there is another source.

Steven Harris

Are you absolutely positive about these numbers? With all the problems in CA 
how could El Paso not be flowing more at Topock? I know we are taking up part 
of the space but it seems like they should be full to SoCal as well. Please 
reconfirm with other sources.

Sorry about my incomplete memo (I hit send instead of save).

Anyway, we would like to set-up a two hour meeting for Thursday, August 3rd 
to discuss the variables for modeling westward throughput on TW (to forecast 
fuel).  This will be a brainstorming session to discuss the various impacts 
on the level of throughput, such as, hydro levels, weather, prices, 
seasonality, etc.  Please let me know if morning or afternoon on the 3rd is 
good for you.

Thanks,
Lindy

Please address mailing envelopes from the attached list.  Thanks.

Please include me on the Priority Dual Monitor list.  I will be the product 
manager for trading Transwestern capacity on EnronOnline.  In order to manage 
the product in Stack Manager and view pricing information, two monitors for 
the same CPU are required.  Thanks.

Please increase the contract TQ from 350 to 500 effective 02/01/2001.  
Thanks.

Just to summarize and bring everyone up to speed...I spoke to John Havard 
with Pogo again.  He would like us to continue with drawings, engineering, 
etc. using his prepayment.  They have the list of equipment for ordering, but 
are waiting until the results of the well (hopefully by next week).  They 
also understand that some of the items could have long lead times.  We are 
all hoping this will be as successful as EOG's interconnect.

   
	
	

There must be something I have missed. The work order was submitted to 
Marketing for approvals and is in SAP but has not been released to date. The 
middle of February in-service date mentioned below is out of the question. I 
have not received word that pogo has given the go ahead for design or 
materials. We are doing the design (e-mail of 1-8-01) in preparation that 
they will want the interconnect. 
Please bring me up to date if there have been changes since the first week of 
January and if the scope of the project has changes since the cost estimate 
and materials requirements were submitted in early January. 

Thanks

order to monitor this facility. Thanks for everyone's help.
Thanks

Michelle,
In speaking with Laura Kunkle yesterday I learned that the land owner 
notification was sent on 1-08-01 and should be back by about 2-7-01.  Also 
the Environmental matrix is in the hands of Butch Russell in Albuquerque, so 
should be ready this week.  The electrical drawings are being done by Frances 
Balderas in Omaha and be ready by this weeks end. 
My understanding is that Pogo will build the facility per our spec's and we 
will operate it.  They won't purchase materials until their well comes in.  
Pogo anticipates the well should be completed in about a week and a half.
Just to recap, we will need a chromatograph, sulphur monitor, water monitor, 
flow control, positive shut-in and a means of overpressure protection.  The 
chromatograph will require commercial electricity.  Operation of the facility 
without the above will have to be approved by Rich Jolly.
George Kneisley, do you have any input not mentioned above?
In speaking with you yesterday, I think all of these are covered, but just 
want to make sure.
Thanks,  Arnie

Rich,
The POGO well isn't completed yet.  They expect to be down within three 
weeks.  This well is adjacent to the big EOG well that came into our system a 
couple of months ago and is in the same formation.  The EOG gas is still good 
gas so far.  Hopefully POGO's gas will be the same.
Thanks,  Arnie

Rich Jolly
01/18/2001 09:02 AM
Mike this is in your court now. Can it be installed by the middle of 
February? Arnie has anyone seen  a gas analysis on this?
Thanks
Rich

Michelle Lokay
01/18/2001 08:42 AM

According to John Havard with Pogo, we are to continue on.  With the work 
order approved, I was told the landowner's notification had already begun.  
Pogo is buying the required equipment (including chromotograph, monitors, 
etc.), per our specifications.  They will own the equipment, but we will 
operate.  Let me know if you guys have additional information...is this still 
possible by the middle of February?  Thanks.

Rich Jolly
01/17/2001 05:46 AM
Thanks Arnie. Even if Pogo owns the meter station we want to operate it 
including the flow control.This is one of the ways we're keeping our UAF 
down. If I can help let me know. We do need to discuss who will operate the 
facilities asap.

Michelle,

I was wondering where we stand now on the Pogo interconnect South of WT-1 on 
the West Texas Lateral.  Per our phone conversation a few days ago it sounded 
like the 30 day landowner notification would be the biggest hold up.  What 
will be the design capacity for the interconnect?  I think you told me, but I 
can't find it in my notes.  My understanding is that there will be a 
chromatograph, sulfur monitor, water monitor, flow control and a way to shut 
in if pressure reaches our MAOP.  Also, who will own and operate the 
station?  Let me know if I'm off base on any of this or what I've missed and 
also don't hesitate to call if you need anything.  Please let us know as 
things progress.

Thanks,  Arnie

Cathy Bulf (918-591-5143) just called to negotiate the contract extension.  
Capacity is 10000 to Needles and 10000 to Topock, both expiring end of Jan 
2001.  Her bids are through Oct 2001 at .16 plus fuel or through Mar 2002 at 
current rate of .131 plus fuel.  What is our strategy?  The spreads have 
tightened since last week.  She has to be notified by ASAP, so she can 
exercise her ROFR.

   
	
	

KN (Oneok) called to get more information about the Right of First Refusal in 
their current contract.  The minimum requirement to keep ROFR in a contract 
extension is with maximum rate for at least 1 year.  Cathy Bulf will let TW 
know by Monday, and in writing, if they would like to exercise.

By now I'm sure that you've heard about the upcoming electric industry class 
that has been customized for GPG staff.   The purpose of the class is to 
learn about electric utilities as our customers, learn about some of the 
current regulatory and legislative debates and the impact on us, and to learn 
about the economics of electric generation.   

The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel, 
Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with 
remarks on why he believes GPG needs to learns about economics and trends in 
the electric industry.  The class includes a full day of course work and a 
working lunch will be served.   A  workbook is being prepared and will be 
distributed to you a week prior to the class.  

I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per 
student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please 
RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a 
count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG 
attendees.  

Good.

I would like to schedule a meeting to discuss the components for modeling TW 
throughput.  The first date Kim, Lindy, Sean and I could make was Friday 
August 18th.  How does everyone else's schedule look for the morning of the 
18th?

Hi Mike,

Great to hear from you.  Would have gotten back to you sooner, but we just 
got back from vacationing in California.  Sure was tough to leave 
temperatures in the 60s and return to the 90s!

How are things going?  Did they ever implement Modular Forecasting?  Bet you 
love those Displays!  Sounds like you guys are pretty busy...too busy to be 
speculating about me!  I am in marketing for Enron, using my trading and 
financial background.  The timing was perfect and my commute is so much 
shorter!

Keep in touch...and shouldn't the Aggies be in the Top 20?!?!

Michelle,

Since I didn't get to say good-bye, I wanted to see how you were doing?  It
sounds like you landed on your feet pretty fast.  To be nosey, were you able
to get a severance package and then become employed that quickly?  The
speculation around here was that you already had the Enron job (i.e., may
have given notice already) and Will severed you because of the soft landing
scheduled (heck, I would have loved to be in your situation).

I guess you know that Will officially left the company.  Another speculation
was that he tried to garner a severance package himself, but they turned him
down (of course he was furious, but I don't know if it was true).

What exactly are you doing with Enron?  Is it in a Marketing role?  Randa
mentioned that you are travelling some, but didn't really know what your job
function entailed.

Periodically keep in touch because inquiring minds like to know (and I might
use you for some research).

FYI...I am scheduled for Jury Duty next Monday, August 14.

Met with Lee Hart.  Reliant is interested in bidding for the capacity being 
auctioned on EnronOnLine, but will probably not respond until Monday.  
Reliant is also interested in the concept of fuel monetization and will 
definitely work with us to give shipper's perspective.

Attended meeting with Conoco (Carla Johnson and Mary Ann Pearce) and Steve 
Harris, Rockey Storie to discuss potential settlement of Northern Natural 
take or pay case.

Introduced myself to Cathy Bulf of Oneok (KN).  They are also interested in 
the auctioned capacity.

Have there been any problems accessing the website?  Are there any issues

improving/troubleshooting the model.

I'm not sure I have all the users on the mailing list so please inform those

How are you?  I was just thinking of you guys and wanted to say "hi"!!!

Yes, and as a matter of fact...I'd called the Benefits Help Line recently and

Thank you!  I have tested the updated system and every thing seems to be 
working.  I did speak to the Help Desk last week and it was decided that we 
will run this program through Netscape Navigator vs Explorer.

Michelle,
Thanks for your patience.  It works now.
We don't know exact why it suddenly stops calculating marginal fuel.  Each 
piece of program worked correctly.  
We had to rule out possible causes step by step and to make sure the whole 
process work step by step.
Possible reason might be multiple version of calculation component being 
registered in the server and
the correct one was not used lately.  We cleaned it and re-registered the 
working version and it worked. 

Did you have chance to talk to help desk regarding internet explorer upgrade 
to 5.0 ?

Thanks,
Mei-Ling

ENRON INVESTMENT PARTNERS' BIGGEST GAMBLE TO DATE HAS BEEN THE $4 MILLION IT 
pumped into Cynet. The software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs 
in to a laptop or PC and lets you e-mail, fax, and use voice-and 
data-messaging. That may not sound like much. But imagine e-mailing thousands 
of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded 
message to tell folks to check their fax machines. Cynet is also developing 
the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to 
translate voice mail into e-mail.

The investment helped launch Cynet as the first African-American company to 
go public out of Houston. How's it doing? Not so hot. After the initial 
offering in January the stock jumped to $8, but it got pummeled in April and 
now hovers around $1. It has yet to recover. 

Still, Enron is holding on to its investment, now worth only $1.9 million. 
Cynet holds the exclusive North American marketing license for Teleran 
Electronic's wireless modems. That's got to be worth something. Compaq 
Computer is using the technology to add high-speed wireless Internet 
connections to its iPAQ Pocket.

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=

ClickAtHome includes the following:

disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20

Enron is a great place to work.

Unocal will announce higher that anticipated 3rd quarter earnings on 10/25.  
They also did not hedge their production, so are able to capture the higher 
energy prices!  Sounds like a good buy...already up 3/4 today.

Our Commercial group has definitely used the Deal Analysis system!  The 
reports have been very beneficial in quantifying some of our recent 
transporting deals on Transwestern.  For example, we executed a one year deal 
for 20000/day at our maximum tariff rate, which will generate $4 million 
gross margin.  Another one year deal for 8000/day, also to the California 
border, will give us over $1 million gross margin.  Two other examples for 11 
months each will generate an additional combined $1.5 million.  Hopefully 
this will justify our need for this system.  Let me know if you need anything 
else.

In an effort to bring incremental revenue for our pipeline, I researched 
outstanding invoices generated from facility interconnects, etc.  
Transwestern currently has no outstanding dollars to collect.  However, there 
appears to be $600,000 that can be collected on Northern Natural in addition 
to $250,000 that was written off.  Attached are the spreadsheets from 
Accounts Receivable.

and asked the question "Do we always cover variable operating costs on our 
park and ride deals"?  A ride can have a very negative impact on fuel use.  
Doesn't the Deal Analysis cover park & ride deals?  You might want to check 
into this.

Thanks........Terry

Open season responses are due from shippers on Friday 11/17.  Please make 
sure you canvass all your customers to find out who plans to respond and who 
doesn't.  I would like to submit to Steve a list of who we expect to see 
responses from, their anticipated volume, term, and price they're willing to 
pay.

This week, make sure you call all your customers (if you haven't already 
spoken with them) and discuss the non-binding open season.  Answer any 
questions they might have, and reiterate the response deadline.  See if you 
can get an idea if they plan on responding one way or the other.

Thanks again for your help on getting the well connected ASAP.  For the
weekend, we estimate we will be flowing around 34,000 mmbtu/day.
We have been replacing wellhead equipment and dehy's to allow for greater
production.
Hopefully this flow will continue for awhile.
We are selling the production at the interconnect, hopefully TW is getting
a good transport rate.  Earlier today, i could have paid TW $4.00/mmbtu
transport, got any FT?  $10.50 at the border, $5.50 at TW. Makes your FT
west shippers rich.

I know we have had numerous discussions with gas control, Michelle, field
people, etc.  Tell everyone thanks for the hard work.

I'm sorry!  I was out of the office for a memorial service on Friday, 
November 10.  How do I write that off?  FYI, I will be in all this week 
(Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday).   Thanks.

Executed firm transport contract with Oneok at maximum tariff rate for 
California deliveries.  Took advantage of widening market basis spreads; will 
generate $2.7 million in revenue.  Because the original terms had ROFR 
language dictating up to max rate only, included was a revenue sharing 
mechanism if contract is ever released above max rate.  The mechanism 
provides an opportunity to generate market based transport. 
Settled dispute with Burlington involving volume commitments under various 
pipeline pressures.  Dispute was originally at $3 million dollars, negotiated 
potential damages down to $100,000 in credits on prior transport invoices.  
Deal also included re-execution of Interconnect and Operating Agreement for 
lower volume commitments based on seasonality, thereby eliminating future 
potential dollar exposure.
Completed new facility interconnect with EOG for additional 30,000/day of 
supply on east end of system.  Potential opportunity for future transport or 
park and ride agreement.
Worked with Accounts Receivable to identify outstanding facility invoices.  
Located over $600,000 on Northern.  
Executed agreement with Cima Energy to be a new customer on Transwestern.
Worked as liaison with programmers to enhance Deal Profitability system.  
System now is also linked with the Risk Management System with weekly basis 
quote feed to ensure more real time data.
Co-ordinated Open Seasons with internal and external contacts.  Worked with 
programmers to enhance IOS system to handle maximum rate bidding and other 
e-commerce efforts.
Provide backup to both Short Term deal origination and contract processing.
Working with Eprime and SPS on potential power plant interconnect of up to 
200,000/day on east end of system.
Working with Eprime to become a new shipper on system from San Juan to East 
of Thoreau.
Monitor daily basis differentials to maximize additional transport rate 
opportunities.
Working with Market Services and Contract Administration to identify 
underutilized transport agreements for additional marketing opportunities.

I am free any of these days...my preference is either Thursday or Friday!

Michelle,

Our dba has loaded TW base differential to test database from revenue 
management data base
after Vernon added TW to his regular update.
The spreadsheet is the latest NYMEX and base differential for 4 areas of TW 
as of 11/28/00.
Please take a look.  If no problem, I'll apply the same logic that I used to 
create this spreadsheet
to TW deal analysis program.  I'll dynamically get the latest price from the 
table based on 
receipt point location.
Please let me know.
Thanks,

Michelle is it possible to evaluate a park-n-ride in deal profitability?  If 
not would this be valuable?  If it would be Mei-Ling and I would like to meet 
with you to understand what we might have to modify.

Two contract's ROFR notification expired this week (11/30/2000).  These 
contracts will terminate next year 11/30/2001.  Burlington with 15000 Ignacio 
to Blanco and PG&E with 20000 Blanco to EOT.  
Eprime signed a 50000/day park and ride agreement effective 12/01/2000.  
Current posted rates are at max of .3883.
Invoices are going out next week.  Included is the Burlington credit of 
$83000 in prior period adjustments.

Sorry I wasn't here for your email last Friday...I try to leave by 4:30!!!  
Yes, let's allget together soon...call me! 

Jim and I did see some movies lately:  Men of Honor with Cuba Wadding Jr was 
a good tear jerker, Charlie's Angel was humorous because we weren't expecting 
much, and Bedazzled brought us back down to earth.  I would recommend all 
three!  Meghan got some DVD's and her two favorite that she watches every 
night are Toy Story 2 and Little Mermaid 2...have your girls seen either one?

Hi Michelle,

How are you?  I was talking to Marilyn the other day.  We thought it would
be a good idea if we can try to get together one day.  Anyway, I haven't
asked you for movie suggestions since a long time.  I've seen "Perfect
Storm" and "The Patriot" .  Do you know of any others?  Or even if they are
still the theater ... I could add them to my future rental list.  Thanks.

Michelle:

The intial agreement Bob presented to EOG was for $10,000, this was to cover 
the cost to refurbishing the existing 6" tap.  The work order was generated 
with this amount so that the R-O-W folks would intiate a Landowner 
notification letter ASAP.  EOG estimated a 5 - 15 mmcfd volume and they were 
to supply all materials to re-activate this point.   A scope change was 
intiated and we were to supply the EFM for their meter tube,  a verbal cost 
estimate to Bob in the amount of $35,000 was relayed.  A third scope change 
raised the volume estimate to over 20 mmcfd, which normally means we install 
additional instrumentation.  Operations at this time insisted we add the 
needed equipment to the work order.  The E&C folks then put out the tighter 
cost estimate of $422,000.  This included the following cost revisions:

 Chromatograph     $55,000
 H2O Monitor     $10,000
 H2S Monitor     $35,000
 EFM      $35,000
 Flow control     $34,000
 Positive shut-in     $22,000
 Flow bypass     $12,000
 Engi. CSUP, Contig.  $120,000
 Tax Gross-up   $100,000 
  Total   $423,000

Michelle& Ron

Is Monday Mar-4, 9-10 am or Tuesday-Mar-4, 9-10 am ( my office) good for you to discuss the Baker Field project?
Please let me know. 

Thanks, Mansoor

I don't know if I am taking 1/2 day of vacation yet...or if we can just leave a little early to prepare and travel for tomorrow night.  What do you think?

What about tomorrow?

Count me in...Monday or Thursday morning?

You guys have probably already noodled on this, but if you haven't, maybe it's worth organizing a meeting next week to discuss the above storage project and benefits / risks to TW.

For instance:

Risks:
Red Lake connection to Kern cuts into TW forward haul market

Rewards:
expands TW's Park n' Ride capabilities (we offer more capability and back it with a storage position)
better PnR rates over the short term than what the storage can offer
more backhaul business on TW mainline (i.e. Citizens Utilities)
Compression ops agrmt w/ Aquila

Let me know if you'd like to get together for a brainstorm session.  Bids are due to Aquila by 3/15 and there are some financial caveats to discuss.

Can you spot what's wrong with this picture? Look closely. It may take you a minute.

We still need to bill Conoco the TCR II Surcharges on 20,000 MMBtu per day.  Maybe Michelle can get with Conoco and see how they want it billed.  If they want it billed on their new contract, maybe we can do an amendment.  If they want it billed on the old contracts, then you need to contact someone in the contract group to see how we bill it since the contracts are expired (i.e., overriding the CBS system or something).

Jeanette

Jeanette:

I just reviewed the handout for your presentation on the Global Settlement.  One of your slides stated that the 
TCR surcharge is applicable for 10 years from the Global settlement, even if the CFS's contract expires.

Conoco Contract Nos. 20747 & 20748 expired at the end of February.  I assume we should bill the TCR
surcharge for these contracts beginning in March, 2002.  Please let me know if this is correct.

Thanks!

Notwithstanding anything herein that may be interpreted to the contrary, the aggregate Operational Imbalance for all Interconnect Points in any month will be within a 10% tolerance level (i.e., neither exceeds 110% of the quantities scheduled, or is less than 90% of the quantities scheduled).

Bill,
Here is how I currently have paragraph 6 (tolerance level) in the OBA.  Should we insert another sentence reemphasizing that "all imbalances" will be "cashed out"?

Weather Trading 
Energy and weather are so inextricably tied to one another that it is sometimes hard to separate the two. The demand for power is directly related to temperature going up in summer and going down in winter. If, therefore, you have an unusually cool summer, the demand for power will be much lesser than anticipated, and the same in case of an unusually warm winter. Several electricity utilities enter into power purchase agreements based on anticipated demand, and would face serious financial losses in such cases. 
Weather derivatives provide such companies an option to hedge against risk of weather fluctuations. It is no surprise, then, that one of the conferences more lively discussions centered on the presentation by Tom Fletcher, head of weather trading for Mirant <http://www.mirant.com/>. 
In describing weather trading, Fletcher reported the market has grown exponentially since it was first formed in 1997. Fletcher highlighted how successful trading requires purchasing the right product. He went on to describe some of the sophisticated products being launched and how Mirant is integrating weather risk into their overall profile and what that means for the traders on the floor. 
With presentations from other market leaders such as Centrica, I-Wex, Spectron, Aquila, LIFFE, Mirant, Bewag, Aon and Entergy-Koch, Weather Trading Europe <http://www.eyeforenergy.com/weather/> provided three days of the latest developments in European trading. 
The conference touched on key issues surrounding the sector including liquidity in the weather market-where is it and how to access it; data issues-the state of play in European weather data and how you can best utilize the information you've got and a host of other topics designed to help attendees leverage their skills. 
As weather trading takes its place in the online world, there is a pressing need to develop greater use of weather derivatives from corporations to avoid the market becoming a predominantly speculative industry.

You are definitely welcome.  Are you coming in for systems training next week (or it that Spring Break)?

Just wanted to thank you and Teb for taking time out to join us for lunch on Wednesday.  If there is anything I can ever do for you, please
do not hesitate to give me a call.  Though I can never fill Julie's shoes, I look forward to working with you both in the months to come.
Have a great weekend.

Are we scheduled at certain time?  If I could be moved in the morning (I only have 2 boxes), that would be great.  I have customers coming in at 11:00 for the rest of the afternoon.  Thanks.

Your move has been scheduled for next Thursday, 3/14. All moves now take place during the day.

I'll deliver your pre-printed labels as soon as I get them from the Move Team, hopefully today. Please make sure to label everything that needs to be moved.

We have been working hard over the past three months to restore normalcy to the non-debtor companies in the EGS family of asset-based businesses.   We are doing our best to operate on a business as usual basis, and continue the regular, consistent programs we previously provided.  That is why earlier this year we paid performance bonuses and merit increases to most non-debtor employees, in the ordinary course of business. 

At the same time, I understand that events of the past few months have been disturbing and left many with a sense of uncertainty about their future.  We realize that you need some sort of "safety net" to allow you to be comfortable staying here as we work to reorganize.  With this in mind, I am pleased to inform you that we have put in place a severance plan for U.S. employees of certain non-debtor companies.  We have wanted this program for some time, but even as a non-debtor company we had to work extensively with consultants and creditors in securing its approval.

The severance plan provides that, under most circumstances, terminated employees would be eligible for two weeks of base pay for every full or partial year of service.  In the case of a termination due to reorganization, the minimum compensation would be eight weeks of pay and the maximum would be fifty-two weeks.  The details and restrictions to this plan are explained in the plan summary for your company's plan, which can be found on the ETS HR link on the Enron Transportation Services intranet site under "ETS HR Manuals". It can also be accessed by clicking on the attached weblink:  http://hrweb.enron.com/businessUnits/ets/etsHRmanuals.asp . 

I hope this plan will give you a bit more peace of mind and allow you to continue the excellent work you have been providing in our ongoing businesses.  Please contact your HR representative, if you have any questions about the severance plan or related matters.

Approved.

Michelle,

Per our conversation BRTI and Transwestern agree to increase the MDQ  of transportation contract 27748 from 10,000 MMBtu per day to 33,000
MMBtu per day, effective 12/14/01 - 12/31/01.  The agreed to rate for the incremental transportation quantity of 23,000 MMBtu/day is $.055
per MMBtu plus fuel.  As agreed, BRTI will have alternate receipt points from Ignacio (500535) and La Plata (500533) as well as EPNG Blanco
as an alternate delivery point.

Thank you,

Julie

Notice Text:
All Shippers Letter #02-033
Date:	3/15/02
Time:	11:00 a.m. MST

The purpose of this letter is to inform Northwest's shippers of how it
intends to deal with the upcoming maintenance announced by Questar Pipeline
at Clay Basin and by Transwestern Pipeline at its La Plata facilities.

Questar Pipeline has announced it will shut in its Clay Basin facility from
April 2, 2002 through April 15, 2002 and will then perform withdrawal tests
on April 16 and 17, 2002.  During this time Northwest will have no access to
Clay Basin.  Additionally, Transwestern Pipeline has announced that its La
Plata Compressor facilities will be shut in from April 2 through April 5,
2002, and will accept no deliveries from Northwest Pipeline.

During the month of March north flow volumes through the Kemmerer compressor
have exceeded capacity on a regular basis.  With Clay Basin shut in,
Northwest's balancing flexibility will be significantly impaired.  Northwest
will have no place to inject excess gas south of Kemmerer and as a result
cannot physically accommodate overscheduled volumes.

If north flow volumes continue to exceed Kemmerer capacity during the
Questar and Transwestern maintenance, Northwest will take the following
steps to maintain the reliability and integrity of its system: reduce line
pack on the south end of its system prior to the maintenance; cut
north-flowing alternate gas at compressor station cut points from La Plata
to Meacham as necessary to mitigate high line pressures or overscheduling
through Kemmerer; take all necessary steps to ensure that gas deliveries
from receipt points south of the Meacham compressor closely approximate
confirmed nominations;  entitle for undertakes or overtakes, as appropriate;
and finally, if required, Northwest will issue operational flow orders.

If net scheduled volumes north through Northwest's Kemmerer Compressor do
not exceed physical capacity, Northwest will have much greater flexibility
during the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins.  Northwest's customers can
help themselves and reduce the likelihood that Kemmerer will overschedule by
securing adequate gas from Canadian suppliers or by using their Jackson
Prairie storage during this work.

Northwest will make every effort to reduce the impact on its customers of
the Clay Basin and Transwestern shut-ins and will be monitoring the
situation closely.  Northwest will take every opportunity to relax system
restrictions in later cycles if north flow volumes moderate.  Northwest is
confident that if its customers respond prudently, the impact of the
Transwestern and Questar maintenance will be greatly reduced.

If you have any questions, please contact your Marketing Services
representative.

More information.  The Questar (Southern Trails) tie-in is for one day only, 04/02.  The Ignacio to Blanco line, from La Plata, will be down over 700 million (which is pretty much the whole lateral) from 04/02-04/05.  Talk soon, Michelle. 

Here's that e-mail from Northwest Pipeline which they sent to their customers.  Did you find out anything regarding the impact with the Southern Trails tie in.

Burlington has agreed to execute this outstanding OBA if the name on the contract is changed.  Can we update the name from BURLINGTON RESOURCES TRADING, INC.  to BURLINGTON RESOURCES Gathering, INC.  

FYI.

Per our earlier conversation, please increase contract 27748 to 25,000 for gas day 12th for a rate of $.05.  This is a increase of 15,000.

Thank you,

Michelle,

A few months ago, TW Marketing and Fac. Planning had a meeting to discuss TW CAS system issues. At this meeting, you indicated that the TW Marketers would like to have some training on CAS. I have discussed with Perry Frazier & he would like to set up 30 minute one on one hands-on training sessions with each individual. 

Can you coordinate with your team & identify a list of TW Marketer's who would like to have CAS training? I will work with Perry to schedule the training times.

Thanks Ramona

Bass hereby requests that the MAXDTQ volume on the proposed amendment dated 
3/13/02 on the subject contract be changed from 2,500 Dth to 2,200 Dth.

Michelle,

Per our conversation, PPL EnergyPlus requests that Transwestern assign 20,000 
mmbtu of primary receipts out of the West Texas Pool for the period beginning 
June 1, 2002 through September 30, 2002.  During the four month period beginning 
October 1, 2002 and ending February 28, 2003, the primary receipts will be 
reduced to 14,265 mmbtu.  Beginning March 1, 2003 through June 30, 2032, primary 
receipts will be increased to 20,000 mmbtu.  

For the four month period beginning October 1, 2002 and ending February 28, 
2003, PPL requests an additional day to consider our supply options prior to 
electing a primary receipt for the 5735 mmbtu not assigned.

Best Regards
David Smith

Thank you.

We'll take care of it.

Michelle,

Per our conversation, please increase contract 27748 to 23,115 effective 12/10 for one day only at the $.05 rate plus fuel.

Thank you.

Julie Reames

FYI.

looks accurate to me...

Here is how I see the February release, with the 50/50 sharing mechanism:

ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.1020 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $71,400 [$0.1020 x 25,000 x 28 days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will be adjusted for a capacity release credit of $56,700  [($0.1020 - $0.021) x 25,000 x 28 days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $14,700 [$0.021 x 25,000 x 28 days]
ENA will be looking for a payment of $14,700 for their portion of the shared upside

I'd copied your format for January...what do you think of the February numbers?    

Sounds good, but TW has a weekly gas control meeting every Friday at 3:00.  Can your meeting be finished by 3:00, or should we start earlier?

There is a great concern from TW Planning/ Marketing that the existing CAS system is not responding to our expectations.
While we have corrected numerous bugs in the program, getting the solutions to the production side has been somewhat slow. 
This has caused a delay from Facility Planning to the Marketing group. Lets plan to talk about some new features that Marketing
 has requested for the CAS system. Pipeline Facility Planning is arranging a meeting on Friday Feb-1 From 2 to 3:30 pm in 
Room # 3907 to discuss the concerned issues.

Mansoor Abdmoulaie & Perry Frazier

A primer on how to succeed in business:

Capitalism

You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull.  Your herd
multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the
income.

You have two cows. You sell three of them to your publicly listed
company, using letters of credit  opened by your brother-in-law at
the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated  general
offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption for
five cows. The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an
intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by your CFO
who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on
six more.

  

 
Mike,
Here is a spreadsheet that will hopefully help with reconciling the Mojave interconnect.  Let's talk soon.

Approved.

Michelle,

Per our earlier conversation, please increase our 27748 MDQ from 10,000 to 16,000 effective 12/11 for one day only.

Thank you.

<<San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo.htm>> 

FYI - When January 2002 invoices are run, please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ENA's contract 24924.  The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.0650 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $34,125 [$0.0650 x 25,000 x 21days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $32,812.50  [($0.0650 - $0.0025) x 25,000 x 21days]
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $1,312.50 [$0.0025 x 25,000 x 21 days]  (Richard - do we need/have a separate account for these revenues??)

Michelle - I know you indicated that ENA is looking to get a payment of $1,312.50 for their portion of the incremental fee charged.  However, we will need to discuss further.  The invoice that will be generated to ENA will not represent a credit due them since we would still be billing them for the first 11 days prior to this release.  

We can discuss further when the billing cycle approaches.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Elizabeth

Let's discuss this prior to billing.  I agree that ENA owes us money, but there were certain conditions agreed to before we could get this capacity back!...

Since ENA owes us $$$$$ I wouldn't think that we would send them $$$$$$.

Sounds like too much fun....you're the best!

Michelle:  

ok we are all set up.  We are going to do a snow shoe trip on Tuesday at 10:30 a.m. for 2 hours.  Supposedly easy trail, just enough to work up a sweat.  Then we are going to drive (45 minute scenic drive) to Hot Springs, Co.  Probably have time for a lunch.  Our messages are set up for 3:00 p.m. and we get to soak in any one of 21 sulphur pools at our leisure.  Sounds divine doesn't it?

Since they have to put salt on the pavement the guy suggested that we bring our own flip flops.  He says we can rent towels and robes but if I remember I'll bring them for us as backups if they don't have any available.

So looks like you just need warm clothing and flip flops.  Oh yeah, do you have a warm pair of boots.  We can rent the snowshoing equipment but we have to have a good pair of warm boots.  If you don't think you have a pair let me know and I can bring an extra pair along.  Hopefully they won't be too big for your tiny feet.  But boots are usually big anyway just wear lots of socks!

Let me know,

Good morning!

Are we still on tomorrow?  What are the calling instructions?  Thanks.

We are scheduled to meet with PG&E to discuss their plan of reorganization for gas on Jan. 8th at 10 AM CST.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Houston and Omaha ETS Employees,

As you know, Enron reached a settlement with Dynegy, which allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire Northern Natural Gas.

To discuss this action, please attend a floor meeting with Stan on Monday, January 7, from 1:30 - 2:30 in the Enron building in the area of 3922.  Omaha employees, please gather in 227. 

See you then.

Approved.  Please increase, on Amendment #4, the West Texas receipts from 14,265 to 18,000 effective Nov 2002-Feb 2003.  This will still leave a balance of 2,000 at the "East of Thoreau" area.  The Red Rock administration contract will also need to be adjusted.  Thanks.

Michelle, 

Per our conversation on January 2, please assign 3735/dth of available
West Texas Pool receipts for contract 27641 during the four months
beginning November, 2002 and ending February, 2003.  We will continue to
look for the remaining 2000.

As for Amendment 3 which increased our West Texas receipts to 14265
during the period described above, I do not see anything.  Can you send
me another copy and I will get that signed today.  Sorry for the
confusion.

If you have any questions, please give me a call.

Best Regards
David

Approved.  Amendment to increase TQ by 10,000 for 2 days.
 
Please increase the MDQ of TW #27792 by 10000 to 20000/d for January 1-2, 2002 at the same rates. 

Yes, I will keep you posted.  They have another level of approval left.  If that happens, we will receive either check or wire.

Is this cash coming into TW?

Approved.  Amendment to increase TQ by 10,000 for 2 days.
 
Please increase the MDQ of TW #27792 by 10000 to 20000/d for January 1-2, 2002 at the same rates. 

This is the San Juan to San Juan contract, with alternates out of the path.  Same as December.

Per our phone conversation, Reliant requests to continue its use of
contract  #27496 capacity for the period 1/1-1/31/2002.  Terms of this
arrangement will be the same as December's.

FYI.  Section 13(h) does state 3 months prior to expiration and 07/31/02 is 3 months before 10/31/02.

Susan,

Per our conversation today, Transwestern Pipeline and PG&E Trading can wait until after the upcoming holidays to discuss PG&E's right of first refusal on the 61,000 MMBtu per day that is currently posted. In fact, Section 13 (H) of Transwestern's FTS-1 rate schedule indicates that Transwestern could wait until July 31, 2002 to notify PG&E Trading as to the terms of the best offer. PG&E Trading would then have two weeks to notify Transwestern of its desire to match. I, however, suggest that we begin discussions of the outcome of the posting sometime in January.

I hope that your Holiday Season is everything you are hoping it will be. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!

Best Regards,

Paul

Dear Tech Support,

Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a
slowdown in the performance of flower and jewelry applications that had
operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0
uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.9,and installed
undesirable programs such as NFL 5.0 and NBA 3.0.

Conversation 8.0 no longer runs and Housecleaning 2.6 simply crashes
the system. I've tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to
no avail. What can I do?

Desperate

> >---------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear Desperate,

First, keep in mind that Boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package,
while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Install Tears 6.2 and enter the
command <C:\ I THOUGHT YOU LOVED ME>.

Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Guilty 3.0 and
Flowers 7.0. But remember, overuse can cause Husband 1.0 to default to
Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1. Beer 6.1 is a very bad
program that will create Snoring Loudly.WAV files.

DO NOT install Mother-in law 1.0 or reinstall another Boyfriend
program. These are not supported applications and will crash Husband 1.0.

In summary, Husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have a
limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. You might consider
buying additional software to improve performance. I personally recommend
Hot Food 3.0 and Lingerie 6.9.

Good luck.

Happy Holidays!

What do you think of this itinerary?  You guys would leave San Antonio and pick us up at Hobby for the same flight to Orlando.  On the return trip, we leave 1 1/2 hours before you, but you guys have a direct flight.  The trip is Friday through Saturday, for 8 nights.  The flights are getting more limited and have increased again!  Let's talk soon.

I have an issue with this format.  When you print it the header nor disclaimer no longer shows up.  We have run into this issue before, and that is why we have not put it in frames.  We may need to look at another format to cover the on-line users and the customers that print this report.  This has been an on going issue on-line when you scroll down you lose the header.  The printing customers won't think to highly of this format.  My suggestion is lets try look at another format that will cover both sides (printing and viewing).  Jeff /  Perry, we may have to get together and discuss this issue.

Sorry, I was out of the office yesterday.  We are currently not utilizing these systems.  Are you actually deleting them and can we resurrect if needed?

Michelle,
I left a message on your voice mail about the use of TW Deal Profitability and TW Deal Analysis.  Is anyone in Marketing still using these applications?  We are looking to stop the support of the applications if there are no users.

Thank you,

Wow...is that what really happened?!?!  I am so glad it's all clarified.  Since we're suing everyone (the accountants, the lawyers, etc.), we might as well sue our long distance carrier.  Talk soon!

Freezing out employee options during this period is probably the best way to further demoralize the workforce.  Are the benefits to Enron (and its related parties) worth the increased employee distrust of management that will result from this action?

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

Looks great to me.

If Chattahoochee converted all of their SFTS  to FTS-1 for the purpose of release, there is no problem with a gap.  If they still hold any SFTS,  they cannot have FTS-1 capacity at the same time, even for 1 month.

I have a question about the SFTS conversions that were done a while back so that the customer could utilize our capacity release program.  I noticed that The City of Chattahoochee converted their SFTS to FTS-1 and that the temporary acquisitions on their FTS-1 have a gap.  More specifically, they have a release in place for 10/1/02 thru 4/30/03 and the next release begins 10/1/03 thru 4/30/04.  Do the releases have to be consecutive in order for them to retain their conversion to FTS-1?  Because they will not have a release in place for May thru Sept. of 2003 according to their releases.  Is this wrong?  I haven't checked to see if this occurs on any of the other coversions and will if this is an issue.  Please advise.  nb

Please note, included in this report is a delayed in-service schedule for Red Rock.

  _____  

A Cat's Tale... 

This is the story of the night my ten-year-old cat, Rudy, got his head stuck in the garbage disposal. I  knew at the time that the experience would be funny if the cat survived, so let me tell you right up front that he's fine. 

Getting him out wasn't easy, though, and the process included numerous home remedies, a plumber, two cops, an emergency overnight veterinary clinic, a case of mistaken identity, five hours of panic, and fifteen minutes of fame. 

First, some background. My husband, Bill, and I had just returned from a five-day spring-break vacation in the Cayman Islands, where I had been sick as a dog the 
whole time, trying to convince myself that if I had to feel lousy, it was better to do it in paradise. 

We had arrived home at 9 PM, a day and a half later than we had planned because of airline problems. I still had illness-related vertigo, and because of the flight delays, had not been able to prepare the class I was supposed to teach at 8:40 the next morning. I sat down at my desk to think about William Carlos Williams, and around ten o'clock I heard Bill hollering something undecipherable from the kitchen. 

As I raced out to see what was wrong, I saw Bill frantically rooting around under the kitchen sink and Rudy, or rather, Rudy's headless body, scrambling around in the sink, his claws clicking in panic on the metal. 

Bill had just ground up the skin of some smoked salmon in the garbage disposal, and when he left the room, Rudy (whom we always did call a pinhead) had gone in 
after it. 

It is very disturbing to see the headless body of your cat in the sink. This is an animal that I have slept with nightly for ten years, who burrows under the covers and purrs against my side, and who now looked like a desperate, fur-covered turkey carcass, set to defrost in the sink while it's still alive and kicking. It was also disturbing to see Bill, Mr. Calm-in-any-Emergency, at his wits end, trying to 
soothe Rudy, trying to undo the garbage disposal, failing at both, and basically freaking out. 

Adding to the chaos was Rudy's twin brother Lowell, also upset, racing around in circles, jumping onto the kitchen counter and alternately licking Rudy's butt for comfort and biting it out of fear. Clearly, I had to do something. 

First we tried to ease Rudy out of the disposal by lubricating his head and neck. We tried Johnson's baby shampoo (kept on hand for my nieces visits) and butter-flavored Crisco: both failed, and a now-greasy Rudy kept struggling. 

Bill then decided to take apart the garbage disposal, which was a good idea, but he couldn't do it. Turns out, the thing is constructed like a metal onion: you peel off one layer and another one appears, with Rudy's head still buried deep inside, stuck in a hard plastic collar. My job during this process was to sit on the kitchen counter petting Rudy, trying to calm him, with the room spinning (vertigo), Lowell howling (he's part Siamese), and Bill clattering around with tools. 

When all our efforts failed, we sought professional help. I called our regular plumber, who actually called me back quickly, even at 11 o'clock at night (thanks, Dave). He talked Bill through further layers of disposal dismantling, but still we couldn't reach Rudy. I called the 1-800 number for Insinkerator (no response), a pest removal service that advertises 24-hour service (no response), an all-night emergency veterinary clinic (who had no experience in this matter, and so, no advice), and finally, in desperation, 911. I could see that Rudy's normally pink paw pads were turning blue. The fire department, I figured, gets cats out of trees; maybe they could get one out of a garbage disposal. 

The dispatcher had other ideas and offered to send over two policemen. This suggestion gave me pause. I'm from the sixties, and even if I am currently a fine 
upstanding citizen, I had never considered calling the cops and asking them to come to my house, on purpose.  I resisted the suggestion, but the dispatcher was 
adamant: "They'll help you out," he said. 

The cops arrived close to midnight and turned out to be quite nice. More importantly, they were also able to think rationally, which we were not. 

They were, of course, quite astonished by the situation: "I've never seen anything like this," Officer Mike kept saying. (The unusual circumstances helped us get quickly on a first-name basis with our cops.) 

Officer Tom expressed immediate sympathy for our plight. "I have had cats all my life," he said, comfortingly. Also he had an idea. Evidently we needed a certain tool, a tiny, circular rotating saw that could cut through the heavy plastic flange encircling Rudy's neck without hurting Rudy, and Officer Tom happened to own one. "I live just five minutes from here," he said; "I'll go get it." 

He soon returned, and the three of them, Bill and the two policemen got under the sink together to cut through the garbage disposal. I sat on the counter, holding Rudy and trying not to succumb to the surreal-ness of the scene, with the weird 
middle-of-the-night lighting, the rooms occasional spinning, Lowell's spooky sound effects, an apparently headless cat in my sink and six disembodied legs poking out from under it. One good thing came of this:  the guys did manage to get the bottom of the disposal, so we could now see Rudy's face and knew he could 
breathe. But they couldn't cut the flange without risking the cat. 

Stumped, Officer Tom had another idea. "You know," he said, "I think the reason we can't get him out is the angle of his head and body. If we could just get the 
sink out and lay it on its side, I'll bet we could slip him out." That sounded like a good idea at this point, ANYTHING would have sounded like a good idea and as it turned out, Officer Mike runs a plumbing business on weekends; he knew how to take out the sink! Again they went to work, the three pairs of legs sticking out from under the sink surrounded by an ever-increasing pile of tools and sink parts. They cut the electrical supply, capped off the plumbing lines, unfastened the metal clamps, unscrewed all the pipes, and about an hour later, voila! The sink was lifted gently out of the countertop, with one guy holding the garbage disposal (which contained Rudy's head) up close to the sink (which contained Rudy's body). We laid the sink on its side, but even at this more favorable removal angle, Rudy stayed stuck. 

Officer Tom's radio beeped, calling him away on some kind of real police business. As he was leaving, though, he had another good idea: "You know," he said, 
"I don't think we can get him out while he's struggling so much. We need to get the cat sedated. If he were limp, we could slide him out." And off he went, regretfully, a cat lover still worried about Rudy. 

The remaining three of us decided that getting Rudy sedated was a good idea, but Bill and I were new to the area. We knew that the overnight emergency 
veterinary clinic was only a few minutes away, but we didn't know exactly how to get there. "I know where it is!" declared Officer Mike. "Follow me!" 

So Mike got into his patrol car, Bill got into the drivers seat of our car, and I got into the back, carrying the kitchen sink, what was left of the garbage disposal, and Rudy. 

It was now about 2:00 a.m. We followed Officer Mike for a few blocks when I decided to put my hand into the garbage disposal to pet Rudy's face, hoping I 
could comfort him. Instead, my sweet, gentle bedfellow chomped down on my finger, hard, really hard and wouldn't let go. My scream reflex kicked into gear, 
and I couldn't stop the noise. Bill slammed on the breaks, hollering "What? What happened? Should I stop?" checking us out in the rear view mirror. 

"No," I managed to get out between screams, "just keep driving. Rudy's biting me, but we've got to get to the vet. Just go!" 

Bill turned his attention back to the road, where Officer Mike took a turn we hadn't expected, and we followed. After a few minutes Rudy let go, and as I 
stopped screaming, I looked up to discover that we were wandering aimlessly through an industrial park, in and out of empty parking lots, past little streets 
that didn't look at all familiar. "Where's he taking us?" I asked. "We should have been there ten minutes ago!" 

Bill was as mystified as I was, but all we knew to do was follow the police car until, finally, he pulled into a church parking lot and we pulled up next to him. 

As Bill rolled down the window to ask Mike "where are we going?" the cop, who was not Mike, rolled down his window and asked, "Why are you following me?" Once Bill and I recovered from our shock at having tailed the wrong cop car and the policeman from his pique at being stalked, led us quickly to the emergency vet, where Mike greeted us by holding open the door, exclaiming, "Where were you guys?" 

It was lucky that Mike got to the vets ahead of us, because we hadn't thought to call and warn them about what was coming. (Clearly, by this time we weren't 
really thinking at all.) We brought in the kitchen sink containing Rudy and the garbage disposal containing his head, and the clinic staff was ready. They took his temperature (which was down 10-degrees) and his oxygen level (which was half of normal), and the vet declared: "This cat is in serious shock. We've got to sedate him and get him out of there immediately." 

When I asked if it was OK to sedate a cat in shock, the vet said grimly, "We don't have a choice." With that, he injected the cat; Rudy went limp; and the vet 
squeezed about half a tube of K-Y jelly onto the cat's neck and pulled him free. 

Then the whole team jumped into code blue mode. (I know this from watching a lot of ER) They laid Rudy on a cart, where one person hooked up IV fluids, another 
put little socks on his paws ("You'd be amazed how much heat they lose through their pads," she said), one covered him with hot water bottles and a blanket, 
and another took a blow-dryer to warm up Rudy's now very gunky head. The fur on his head dried in stiff little spikes, making him look rather pathetically punk as he lay there, limp and motionless. 

At this point they sent Bill, Mike, and me to sit in the waiting room while they tried to bring Rudy back to life. I told Mike he didn't have to stay, but he just stood there, shaking his head. "I've never seen anything like this," he said again. 

At about 3 AM, the vet came in to tell us that the prognosis was good for a full recovery. They needed to keep Rudy overnight to re-hydrate him and give him 
something for the brain swelling they assumed he had, but if all went well, we could take him home the following night. 

Just in time to hear the good news, Officer Tom rushed in, finished with his real police work and concerned about Rudy. I figured that once this ordeal was over 
and Rudy was home safely, I would have to re-think my position on the police. 

Bill and I got back home about 3:30. We hadn't unpacked from our trip, I was still intermittently dizzy, and I still hadn't prepared my 8:40 class. "I need a vacation," I said, and while I called the office to leave a message canceling my class, Bill 
made us a pitcher of martinis. I slept late the next day and then badgered the vet about Rudy's condition until he said that Rudy could come home later that day. 

I was working on the suitcases when the phone rang. "Hi, this is Steve Huskey from the Norristown Times-Herald," a voice told me. "Listen, I was just going through the police blotter from last night.  Mostly it's the usual stuff: Breaking and entering, petty theft but there's this one item. Um, do you have a cat?" So I told Steve the whole story, which interested him. A couple hours later he called back to 
say that his editor was interested, too; did I have a picture of Rudy? The next day Rudy was front-page news, under the ridiculous headline Catch of the Day Lands Cat in Hot Water. 

There were some noteworthy repercussions to the newspaper article. Mr. Huskey had somehow inferred that I called 911 because I thought Bill, my husband, was going into shock, although how he concluded this from my comment that his pads were turning blue, I don't quite understand. So the first thing I had to do was call Bill at work. Bill, who had worked tirelessly to free Rudy--and swear that I had been misquoted.  When I arrived at work myself, I was famous; people had been calling my secretary all morning to inquire about Rudy's health. 

When I called our regular vet (whom I had met only once) to make a follow-up appointment for Rudy, the receptionist asked, "Is this the famous Rudy's mother?" When I brought my car in for routine maintenance a few days later, Dave, my mechanic, said, "We read about your cat. Is he OK?" When I called a tree surgeon about my dying red oak, he asked if I knew the person on that street whose cat had been in the garbage disposal. 

And when I went to get my hair cut, the shampoo person told me the funny story her grandma had read in the paper, about a cat that got stuck in the garbage 
disposal. Even today, over a year later, people ask about Rudy, whom a 9-year-old neighbor had always called the Adventure Cat because he used to climb on 
the roof of her house and peer in the second-story window at her. 

I don't know what the moral of this story is, but I do know that this adventure cost me $1100 in emergency vet bills, follow-up vet care, a new sink, new plumbing, new electrical wiring, and a new garbage disposal, one with a cover. The vet can no longer say he's seen everything but the kitchen sink. I wanted to thank Officers Tom and Mike by giving them gift certificates to the local hardware store, but was told that they couldn't accept gifts, that I would put them in a bad position if I tried. So I wrote a letter to the Police Chief praising their good deeds and sent 
individual thank-you notes to Tom and Mike, complete with pictures of Rudy, so they could see what he looks like with his head on. And Rudy, whom we originally 
got for free (or so we thought), still sleeps with me under the covers on cold nights and unaccountably, he still sometimes prowls the sink, hoping for fish...

How about tomorrow sometime?

Sorry Teb but I have an appointment with the Sinus Dr.  Can we visit in advance of your meeting?

Yes.
Teb - Even though PPL has a discounted rate for Red Rock, will we have to file it as a negotiated rate because the fuel is locked in at 5% for the term of the contract?
I am not familiar with the deal, but if the path is something different than East of Thoreau to Calif, the fuel rate is above max which I would think would qualify is as a neg rate transaction.  I would suggest talking to Teb Lokey regarding the actual filing as his shop will be making this filing.
Maria or Mary -do you have an answer to Lorraine's question?
Donna - Red Rock ?  Is PPL's discounted rate deal still going to be filed as a negotiated rate because we locked in the fuel rate at 5%?
 
I want to be an artist someday...but Mommy says no more live subjects.

The only thing I noticed was in the "Notices" section for administrative matters - we reference Market Services instead of Gas Logistics.

All, 

Please review the attached interconnect agreement between Transwestern and Questar.  It is fully reimbursable by Questar.  This interconnect will be a delivery point to Questar in the Blanco Hub.  FYI, the section of pipe that we are connecting the interconnect to is owned by Transwestern and is not part of the jointly owned facilities of the Blanco Hub.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me to discuss.

Please reply back to me with any comments you may have.  I would like to send a draft to Questar on Tuesday morning, January 22, when we return from our holiday. 

Bill and Robert - please see the red-lined language addressing the tax reimbursement.  

Thanks for your time,

Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a motion by TW to intervene in the PG&E FERC proceeding.

 << File: PG&E.doc >> 

We need to use FGT's filing as a guide to determine which parts of TW's tariff need to be changed.  

Debbie,  Can you work with Jeanette and Bill Rapp to see what needs to be done?  Thanks,  Teb

Teb,
I talked with Dennis a little bit about this.  (Dennis, we currently have electronic contracting for capacity release only).  We have language in TW's tariff for electronic contracting for capacity release on Sheet No. 72B. 

Let me know what you want to do and if we want to duplicate the Florida language.

Jeanette

Transwestern is getting ready to begin testing their new contract system.  In preparation for implementation of the new system, we need to make changes to TW's tariff to allow the option of Electronic Contracting the same way we did to FGT's tariff when we implemented their new system.  

The new contract system is scheduled to go into production Q1, 2002.

Teb, do we need a meeting, or can you proceed?

Let me know.

SMILING is infectious, You catch it like the flu 
When someone SMILED at me today, I started SMILING too 
I passed around the corner and someone saw my grin 
When he SMILED, I realized I'd passed it on to him. 
I thought about that smile, then realized its worth, 
A single SMILE just like mine could travel 'round the earth. 
So if you feel a SMILE begin, don't leave it undetected. 

LET'S START AN EPIDEMIC QUICK AND GET THE WORLD INFECTED!

Looks good to me.

Take a look at this.

Note that this does not address capacity release issues.
I think that might be too much for this letter.
I think we should take that up separately.
Probably, an ad hoc basis is best to start with.
For example, I think we should work with Marc of FPU on an individual basis and see what happens.
Then we would be able to feel more confident on whether to call a meeting on this or not.

No problem.

Teb - I've been meaning to tell you about a couple of appointments.  Mom has her last follow-up visit concerning her surgery this Friday at 11.  I would like to take off the entire day, but if that won't work I can come in for the afternoon.  Also, she has another appointment on Monday at 3:15 in Sugarland.  I will need to take a good chunk of the afternoon off on Monday.  Thank you in advance for always being so understanding.

We can charge directly but still need some guidance.  For example, it is my understanding that there are 4 WO set up for Red Rock - one for each station to be modified.  Our work is of a general nature, so do we have to further subdivide our charges to each of the stations, or to three of the stations.  Also, some of our time is spent on a general analysis of regulatory strategy involving all capital projects, and it seems like the overhead WO would be appropriate for these charges.  We don't necessarily want to have to have each person charge to 3 or 4 WO for each identifiable capital project and then to 10 or more WO for our general work.  Any specific suggestions, WO numbers, etc. ?

In response to where to charge your time to for TW projects, Jim Saunders prefers that you charge directly if possible.  Let me know if we need to discuss.

this will allocate their charges to all tw projects...of course red rock dominates tw capital expenditures
a direct charge to a red rock w/o would be ideal

The TW commercial and regulatory team are charging to the TW overhead WO for their time related to TW projects including Red Rock.  Is this how you think we should be handling?

I will be out Wed.  

Teb and Blair, I and Bill Rapp (and, maybe, Staci) will sit in on this.  You and/or Blair are welcome to sit in too.  I know that it is a long time to tie up a lot of people, so I am happy to report to you the results.  Frazier

INGAA has arranged a conference call to discuss material deviations this Wednesday, Jan. 30, at 12:00 - 2:00 p.m. (Central time). Rick Smead will be chairing the call.  The call-in number is:  712-271-0007; password is INGAA. 

Were we going to meet today to talk about the meeting with Stan?

I talked with Rod about the purpose of the meeting.  Stan wants to start thinking about the assumptions for the 2004 rate case and a ten year Plan.  I will bring the 2002 Plan but it is really a short-term Plan and Rod does not want me to hand out anything.  It is a strategy session.

We assumed in the Plan a rate drop effective 1/1/05.  I would like to review the assumptions behind that with Teb and Blair to better understand how it was derived.  This will be one of the major issues for discussion.

Rob is out and I don't know if he isavailable on the cell.  He is with Alexander in Florida.  I think we need to meet this pm.

This is new to me!  Teb, Rob is out on Wed. right?  You might want to call him on the cell.

Rob is out and I don't know if he isavailable on the cell.  He is with Alexander in Florida.  I think we need to meet this pm.

This is new to me!  Teb, Rob is out on Wed. right?  You might want to call him on the cell.

Were we going to meet today to talk about the meeting with Stan?

I talked with Rod about the purpose of the meeting.  Stan wants to start thinking about the assumptions for the 2004 rate case and a ten year Plan.  I will bring the 2002 Plan but it is really a short-term Plan and Rod does not want me to hand out anything.  It is a strategy session.

We assumed in the Plan a rate drop effective 1/1/05.  I would like to review the assumptions behind that with Teb and Blair to better understand how it was derived.  This will be one of the major issues for discussion.

Both are good for me.

Teb, are you available for a meeting w/Steve and his Commercial Group on tomorrow at 3:00p? or Friday morning?

Audrey - Could you please help me schedule a meeting with the TW Commercial Team and Teb Lokey and Rob Kilmer?

Thank you!

Happy Valentines Day to you!!!  (I had forgotten today was V-Day --  too much going on here.)  Hope you have a great day!  

Love, 
Teb

HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY!! 

I hope you'll take some time for yourself today and indulge in something
extra special. I'll be wearing a new crown a little later--but not the kind
you put on your head! It's COLD here but is supposed to reach the high
20s/low 30s. All kitties are inside, curled up in a warm spot. I bet yours
are doing the same, since your weather has been so heavenly.

Love and hugs,
Sandy

Teb, what is the FERC allowed interest rate we can charge customers for late payment?

I have a meeting on segmenting from 10 - 11:30 on Tuesday.  I'm available Tuesday pm.

I'm available.

Can both of you do it at 10:00 am on Tuesday?

Let's try Tuesday at 10:00 am.  I will set things up on this end and then contact you, Rachel and Teb with the phone number to dial into. 

Can we set up a phone conference sometime next Tuesday.
Rachel and I have some questions.
Is 10:00 am a good time?
If not, how about 2:00 pm?

FYI -  NBPL and MGT are going to proceed with implementing the PAL transactions posting under the Interruptible Agreements Informational Postings as indicated in Geneva Patterson's e-mail dated February 1 and are targeting April 1 as the first day.

Thanks,

Bambi

I have no questions.  Frazier,  Steve Veatch is over reporting so he should probably go instead of me anyway.

Our conference rooms are already booked for the afternoon, and some of us have meetings at 9am, so it doesn't look like earlier is going to be an option.  Teb, if you have some specific questions/concerns, you can email those to me and I'll be sure to bring them up during the meeting and get back to you in the afternoon.  Will that be okay?

Geneva,

Teb is tied up in the morning.
Can we do it in the afternoon?

Rob will give you minor changes.  Pleas make the changes and forward to Kevin Howard with copies to Jeanette, Rob and me.  Thanks! - Teb

 

Kevin - I made changes to the document.  I hope they were saved.  I am putting a copy in your office also. -  Teb

 

Kevin - We estimate the rate base at the end of 2002 (including Red Rock and other 2002 cap ex) of about $550 million.  I don't have 2001 rate base but can get it if necessary.  Please advise.  -  Teb

Teb:
Do you have a ballpark guess on TW's rate base at year end 2001?

Please pay the  $2154.18 invoice from Platts and charge it to the balancing tools account.  This expense was incurred because of changes to our cash out pricing recently approved by the FERC.  FGT's customers felt that Gas Daily's indices were more representative of the pricing into FGT's system than the weekly indices published in Natural Gas Week and we had to incur additional expense to secure Platt's permission to post certain data on our web site.

Thanks.

The meeting is currently scheduled for 9AM Wednesday morning in 46C2.  (Teb I think you were on the list of original intvitees, but I wasn't sure.)

Jack, FYI, Rachel is definitely on the official invitation.

 

 
This is a mate to another one that was sent around a couple of weeks ago, which said: Note to the Taliban: Hand over Osama Bin Laden or we will take all your women and send them to college. 
 
 

>> As for what to do with Osama bin Laden: Killing him will only create a martyr. Holding him prisoner will inspire his comrades to take hostages to demand his release.

Therefore, I suggest we do neither.

 
Let the Special Forces, Seals or whatever, covertly capture him, fly him to an undisclosed hospital and have surgeons quickly perform a complete sex change operation.  Then return her to Afghanistan to live as a woman under the Taliban.

Thanks.

I plan to take 3/5 (Tue), 3/7 (Thu), 3/12 (Tue) and 3/14 (Thu) as my vacation days.

Good plan.

Rob and Teb,
If you would like, I will work on this Thursday and finish next week if necessary.  We already have several put together from the change-over from NNG.

Jeanette
EY has requested copies of all FERC orders issued in 2000 and 2001 for their external review of TW's financial statements. Could you provide to me, some time next week?

Thanks for your help!

I think we need to update tariff sheets explaining the contract has terminated.  

Teb,

In talking with Michelle Brown about billing the Conoco contract, she was wondering if we needed to changed the tariff rate sheets for the Current Firm Customers.  I believe I copied you on the Conoco contract e:mail on the TCR II surcharges.  I was thinking (before talking with Michelle) that we really did not have to change those tariff sheets (5B.02 and 5B.03); however, I am not so sure anymore.  The CFC rates on 5B.02 do not apply to Conoco anymore.  So do we need to take them off?  There is a note on 5B.02 that says the surcharges on 5B.03 (TCR II) are applicable to the CFCs listed on 5B.02.

So my question:  Do we just leave the tariff sheets alone, since Conoco's contracts under the Global and Mini- Settlements have terminated, or do we need to update this sheets?

I do not think this is urgent, but I wanted to ask.

Jeanette

On Sheet 5A.03 of the TW tariff there is a footnote that does not have a reference to the upper part of the page, is the footnote an error, or has it been dropped by mistake.  Thanks.

Teb,
The footnote belongs on the line for Receipt Point Area: San Juan.  It should read as follows:

	SAN JUAN: (a) (3) (4) 

I suppose this is another tariff clean-up item.

Please plan to attend also.  It involves transactional reporting.

Please plan to attend a short meeting Wednesday, March 13 at 10:30 in ECN 3907 to discuss TW Firm shippers' amendments, transactional reporting, and "Holding Capacity".

The session should not last more than 1 hour.

Based upon our understanding of the request from TW Marketing, here is our suggested position on the posting and awarding of potential take-away capacity at SoCal Needles from approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.

TW would post on its website a notice in the capacity section that, based on information provided by SoCal regarding an expansion on their system, the take-away capacity at SoCal Needless may be increased by __Dth/day for the period of approximately 1/1/02 to 5/31/02.  Shippers would be advised that the actual start date would depend on SoCal completing their system modifications. The posting would say that TW would accept requests for such capacity during a stated period of time (a minimum of 3 business days).  TW would award the capacity to the shipper(s) willing to provide the greatest cost commitment. The greatest cost commitment would be defined as those revenues above and beyond the current revenues which Transwestern already receives from reservation charges being paid prior to the bid period.

Call me and I'll arrange for us to meet to discuss this further.   sjk

We're still refining the post-Red Rock regulatory rate base and won't know the offset until sometime tomorrow pm.  The same theory would apply to TW - if you don't collect a tax component, you would not have a rate base reduction for deferred taxes.  We should know by Friday morning what the net impact of eliminating the tax component and deferred taxes has on TW's rates.  I'm still not sure the tax component should be eliminated - Hope to understand more after Monday's meeting with tax.

Teb:
I was talking to Drew and Janet Place last night about some of the Lakehead tax issues.  Janet indicated that as part of Border's argument on including a tax component in its rates, it demonstrated that if they did not collect taxes in their rates, they should add back the accumulated deferred income tax balance to the rate base (some $300 million) which caused their rates to increase.  If TW were to do the same thing, would its rate also increase? I seem to recall that excluding the reserve for uncollectible accounts that was set up as part of the Enron bankruptcy, TW's accumulated FIT balance was close to $300 million.  Any thoughts on this?

It looks like we decide on a case by case basis whether to process pre-4/97 ppas.

Pre April 1997 was specifically not covered by the 6 month rule. -- but 8 don't think that means that we are automatically required to process all old ppas.  I think we should plan to manually handle any pre 1997 ppas that we feel bound to accept.

Great! Now get off your Blackberry and get back to having fun!

Please plan to attend a meeting regarding TW's Order 637 filing immediately following Steve's staff meeting on Monday, March 24.  We will remain in 39C1 following Steve's meeting to discuss the strategy for resolving TW's Order 637 issues.  FERC Chairman Pat Wood has pledged to get all 637 orders issued by this August so we need to consider what we need to do to eliminate those proposals we no longer want and, hopefully, trade them for deferring segmenting until the next rate case.  Please invite anyone else who could benifit from or contribute to this meeting.

Keep up the good (healthy) work.

Doctor said all was well - just upping my dosage a bit. But gave me good news that I'm all set for 50 years!!! (relatively, that is!) Thanks for pushing me to do this - feel better for having taken care of it.

Did you make an appointment?

Haven't heard anything from Shelley.  I think she had business plan meetings this pm.
  I will reschedule when I hear from her.
Teb,

	Have you heard anything back from Shelly? If she is available, what time will the meeting start since the TW staff meeting has been cancelled?

A platoon of crack Special Forces soldiers have taken the first steps of
reprisal after the incidents in America.

The heroic force, composed of A&M corps graduates, have broken into the dog
kennel area of the A&M Veterinary Science Building and captured all the
Afghans.

They reported light casualties.

I have the same recollection as to the reason for the decision.  It is my understanding that the only items being amended are receipt point entitlements and that the shippers knew these amendments would be required.  Also,  I don't know whether all of the Red Rock contracts require the receipt point amendments or only some of the agreements.  My  thoughts would be to amend as little as necessary.  -  Teb

Tab,

I don't disagree with your comment however, my recollection is that one of the main reasons we made the decision we did was because the commercial folks didn't want to have to reopen the agreement with a rate amendment.  The concern I though was that such an overture would possibly send the wrong message to the customer or possibly create a perception that the customer had some leverage.  My question is, not that we need to amend the agreement for other reasons should we add the discounted rate... do it all at once?  Please provide your thoughts.  Thanks.  Greg 

At a meeting held 2-3 weeks ago, it was decided that the P&C Agreements modified the terms of the base contracts and that separate rate amendments were not required.  I believe this was the consensus of the attendees in both Omaha and Houston.  Steve, Greg and others attended via videoconference in Omaha.

What is the status of getting the rate amendments executed?  if they haven't been done why don't we include both in with these?  MK

I believe these are all Negotiated Rate Agreements...

Oneok #27607 needs the receipt to be amended from East of Thoreau to Westar Ward, PPL#27649 needs to be amended from East of Thoreau to West Texas pool, and PPL#27641 needs to also be amended from East of Thoreau to West Texas pool for 4265/d...the balance of 15735/d will remain at East of Thoreau.  Can we get these contracts amended by this Friday?  Thanks.

We must be able at all times to fulfill our firm obligations through Station 6.  We do not have the option of reducing our certificated capacity without filing an abandonment at the FERC in which we would have to demonstrate that the abandonment would not impair our abilities to meet our firm obligations.

Talked to Buzz about the situation... It seems we "might" not have the option to leave the other 2 units alone due to Firm obligations.  Operationally we could probably handle using just one compressor.  However, we need 3 units fulfil our FT committments.

Teb,
Per our phone message, could you check on the tariff requirements for this issue.  In other words, do we have the option of shutting down 2 compressors @ CS6?  

Gary, Matt will be your contact for the CS#6 run time/unit enhancement issues we discussed. He is gathering the info and will get
in touch with you directly.  Thanks Dennis

I am not good at filing out forms online but please add my name to those supporting Alice for the Chairman's Award.

I am submitting Alice Johnson for the Chairman's Award and would like your input.  I think the leadership she has shown in support of the UNCF Walkathon demonstrates those core values that are the measurements for the award.   Attached is the Chairman's Award form.  Please complete as much of the form as you can in support of Alice, and return it to me by the end of this week.  Leonard Daily and myself (and any one else who wants to participate) will compile the responses into one form and submit it.

Thanks for your support. << File: nomination_form.doc >>

How Enron Blew It
Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: mon=
ey, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the mo=
st important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is be=
arish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like th=
e international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no=
 way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil c=
ompanies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with mod=
ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."=20
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.=20
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20
You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=
ade him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, =

The imbalance becomes part of thecumulative imbalance subject to book-out/cash-out.  The alert day imbalances are treated differently - the alert day imbalances are settled at 200% of the high (weekly) index for overburns on an overage alert day and 50% of the low ( weekly) index for underburns on an underage alert day.

I'm not sure how the mechanics work on OFOs.  I know that there is an OFO penalty bucket.  The customer is charged $10/dth that he is over/under the scheduled quantity.  Section 13A doesn't address how the imbalance on an OFO day is treated but 13.A.5 that states that after Pack/Draft, Alert Day, MSS... are calculated the rest of the imbalance is cumulated into the operator account for the monthly total(should I assume the OFO balance is included in the monthly total?).

In an underage or overage OFO the customer is charged the $10 for the under or over burned amount. Assuming that the customer was in penalty he has to pay $10/dth, but does the imbalance on the OFO day become part of the cumulative monthly balance that the customer can book/cashout?

Teb, is this correct?

Galen, can you have Larry Hill go behind the scene and to see how it was programmed (I know it's a busy day for invoicing but sometime this week?).

Thanks.

 

Rachel,

To recap one question/answer:

In an OFO situation, the customer faces a $10/Dth penalty.  What happens to
the volume imbalance?  Is it immediately cashed-out as with the Overage
Alert Day, or does it hit the monthly imbalance for cash-out/book-out?

Do I have it right by saying that in an Alert Day situation, the volume is
immediately cashed-out daily?

When you get a minute, please advise.  Thank you!

David

I got your telephone and e-mail.  I think 3% is the right amount. Gotta run - have a great day! Talk to you tonite.  Love,  Teb 

Morning, Teb:
I just found the message you left yesterday. Am sending you this email to
see if you can get it. Did you get my telephone message this morning about
retirement plan here at SDE? They put in 3% so I think I'll just have to let
that be all that's deducted from my paycheck for the time being. If you
think this is definitely a mistake, let me know. Please reply if you get

ernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, b=
rown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. T=
hey are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual unif=
orm of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Repu=
blic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the buildin=
g intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-=
size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of eleva=
tors, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets pe=
ople entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E ti=
pped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axi=
s; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffe=
inated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratula=
ting Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between e=
levator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: "From the World's =
Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!"
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself fro=
m a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000=
. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 per=
cent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 bil=
lion to $100 billion. "The very mention of the company in energy circles th=
roughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"=
 notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides ma=
rket intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determine=
d to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant b=
y then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old =
formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then =
selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a co=
mpany that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas=
 to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, E=
nron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorpor=
ation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If y=
ou were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning =
power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was =
new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first cra=
ck. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. T=
he company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech wo=
rld, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succe=
eded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, "was a great mar=
riage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking me=
ntality of the financial markets."
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the en=
d of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron=
 was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the Americ=
an economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a =
culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but t=
he best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those wh=
o could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in=
 the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a=
 company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of =
$80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's ene=
rgy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for=
 his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant pro=
ject in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications=
, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who o=
nce touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the cha=
nge in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncer=
tain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture tha=
t the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD "a totally different way of thinking about b=
usiness-we got it." At Enron, in fact, you either "got it" or you were gone=
-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that th=
e color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he =
once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahoga=
ny floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set=
 off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a b=
lack vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white mar=
ble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skil=
ling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after jus=
t six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (Gene=
ral Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in Ame=
rica (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unc=
hained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, "someone cou=
ld actually get killed." Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Chr=
istmas morning. "I had no idea what I'd let go of," Skilling says of all th=
e personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron.=20
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white=
 photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands o=
f working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorc=
ed, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwash=
er. He almost missed his brother's wedding. "Learning a foreign language-I =
never learned a foreign language!" he exclaims. He never once took his youn=
gest son to school. "I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifte=
en-minute scheduling." Travel: "You can't go to Africa for a week and get a=
nything out of it!" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design =
on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. "I'm not sure=
 that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job," he says, finally=
. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains it=
s pragmatic edge. "It would have been easy to stay," he says. "But that wou=
ld not have been good for me."=20
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, hand=
some in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assi=
duously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious=
 underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at r=
eporters who have labeled his resignation "bizarre" and associates who are =
bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the lim=
its of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put=
 upon. "I'm surprised," he says, "that people have so much trouble understa=
nding this."
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early ni=
neties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfo=
lding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine t=
o five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the prist=
ine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lur=
ked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked=
 hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in tho=
se days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with th=
at scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters =
in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with=
 the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with s=
uch humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighti=
es when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural g=
as turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies freque=
ntly enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a v=
olatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by fede=
ral deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanl=
y gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack=
 from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG wa=
s then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transc=
o chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doc=
toral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the V=
ietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwar=
dly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, H=
NG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the stat=
e of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover atte=
mpts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska =
pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies i=
n the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting=
 in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like =
Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled "the purchase" was being call=
ed "the merger" back in Houston, and before long, following some particular=
ly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gr=
avity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was ru=
nning a new company called Enron. "Over time it became clear that Lay had a=
 better vision of the future," says one person associated with Enron at tha=
t time. "He never fought change. He embraced change."
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive=
 debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had =
exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole =
new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got s=
tarted.=20
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling ha=
d spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he h=
ad been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, I=
llinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) "I l=
iked being successful when I was working, and I was smart," he told Busines=
sWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling =
wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he =
was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than w=
hat he would come to call "intellectual capital." He loved being smart, and=
 he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Meth=
odist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and too=
k on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of hi=
s class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-=
up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as =
a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985.=20
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless=
, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above=
 all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worr=
ying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he al=
one saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world w=
here credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he=
 called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and th=
e price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be =
a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the =
risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an inv=
estment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them "absolutely compelling." The=
n the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron exec=
utives. He had a one-page presentation. "Almost to a person," Skilling says=
, "they thought it was stupid." Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dej=
ected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and th=
en said, "Let's go."
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a=
 cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of doze=
ns of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of tho=
se divides that seem to define his life: "I believed this whole world would=
 be different, a huge breakthrough" is the way Skilling puts it today, and =
even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching=
, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's =
character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the=
 joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, "We were in=
." And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enr=
on as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just fo=
r him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit=
. After that, says Skilling, "we never looked back."
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it ha=
d a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that w=
ould make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of =
gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to domin=
ate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the b=
est access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted =
to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could b=
etter predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to m=
ake trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the p=
rice of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but wi=
th startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could =
have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had m=
ade: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading busin=
ess. The idea was to build a "knowledge-based business," which demanded a s=
kill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Mos=
t were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most o=
f them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an=
 industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed b=
older people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make =
money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. "Enron was going to=
 create a niche for itself or die," one former executive explains. "The peo=
ple who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had na=
rrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market."
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the s=
martest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And be=
cause his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he =
wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the big=
gest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First B=
oston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be "a=
ggressive." You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you w=
ere thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization.=20
You could see what he was looking for on "Super Saturdays" at the Houston h=
eadquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in betwee=
n-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one=
 day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving a=
bility, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called "a sense =
of urgency." People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest =
candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were t=
he types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing =
Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Ma=
ybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more =
than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lof=
ts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flun=
g suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-a=
nd-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for struc=
turing energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the g=
lobe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A com=
pany concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered=
 with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning th=
e house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enr=
on never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they cou=
ld use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were ov=
erweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Progra=
m. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until t=
en at night. "They were so cutting edge," rhapsodizes someone involved with=
 the company health care program at the time. "They really thought about th=
e psychology and what it took to keep these people going."
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts=
, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that thos=
e titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries a=
nd decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonus=
es-with no cap. "If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could=
 make a lot of money," says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years un=
til resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband div=
ision. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders =
with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus=
. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs join=
ed him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or of=
f-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a sp=
ectacular Mexican villa. "Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'=
d say," one loyalist says.=20
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas m=
erchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the b=
uzzword was "aggressive," that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay belie=
ved the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business.=
 Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better serv=
ice at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they bega=
n barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power compa=
ny presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly se=
rvice areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who wer=
e somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying effo=
rts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay m=

We have this room reserved though facilities for the rest of the year.

Discussion on review of the DVC meeting notes & allocation process.

ECS is technically part of the bankruptcy filing.  We are looking at our options in case ECS can't perform.

I agree.

My thought is that the Enron contract is probably going away anyhow so that it makes sense to set this up for Jan 1.  I think the charges should be recorded to the balancing tools account.  

I finally got a price quote of $1990 per year on a package deal for one user.  Platts doesn't sell the data without a subsciption to the daily publication. The package includes the daily issues and data(table) and back issues and data. 

Please let me know if you want me to go ahead and sign up for this package. I'll have to let Platts know the user's name and billing information etc...

Thanks.

Please add Blair Lichtenwalter to all Sun Devil distribution lists.  Thanks,  Teb

We have this room reserved though facilities for the rest of the year.

Kim gave this e-mail address to Debbie who forwarded it to me.  Just checking in to let you know you and your family are in our thoughts and prayers.  We are happy you have arrived - things must be going fairly smoothly.  I'm thinking that its a good thing that you got all of the negative experiences out of the way before your trip.  Everything can go well from now on.  I'm sure Kim and Chad will be glad when their ladies return from their adventure and things can get back to just the usual crises.  Rob, Steve, Blair, Christi, and Zelda all send their prayers and best wishes - I'm assuming Debbie will send you an e-mail also (she is off today).  Stay warm and safe  and come back soon!  --  Teb

Another tidbit to remind us that we see/hear Divinity all around us: 

Just remember, "Our God is an Awesome God!" 

READ This All the Way, and send it back please! 
This will give you the chills.....GOOD Chills! 

A young man had been to Wed. night Bible Study. The pastor had shared
about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice. The young man
couldn't help but wonder, Does God still speak to people?" 

After service, he went out with some friends for coffee 
and pie, and they discussed the message. Several different ones talked
about how God had led them in different ways.

It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home.
Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, "God...If you still speak to
people speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey." 

As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest
thought to stop and buy a gallon of milk. He shook his head and said out
loud, "God is that you?"  He didn't get a reply and started on toward
home. 

But again, the thought, buy a gallon of milk. The young man thought
about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how
little Samuel ran to Eli. "Okay, God, in case that is you, I will buy
the milk." It didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could
always use the milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and
started off toward home. 

As he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, "Turn down that
street." This is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection.
Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street. At the next
intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he
said out loud, "Okay, God, I will." 

He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop.
He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in a
semi-commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst
of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the
houses looked dark like the people were already in bed.

Again, he sensed something, "Go and give the milk to the people in the
house across the street." The young man looked at the house. It was dark
and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already
asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat.
"Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and, if I wake them up,
they are going to be mad and I will look stupid." 

Again, he felt like he should go and give the milk. Finally, he opened
the door.   "Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I will
give them the milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I
want to be obedient. I guess that will count for something, but, if they
don't answer right away, I am out of here. 

He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise
inside. A man's voice yelled out, "Who is it? What do you want?"   Then
the door opened before the young man could get away.    The man was
standing there in his jeans and t-shirt.  He looked like he just got out
of bed. He had a strange look on his face, and he didn't seem too happy
to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. "What is it?" The young
man thrust out the gallon of milk. "Here I brought this to you." 

The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway, speaking loudly in
Spanish. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the milk toward
the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was
crying. The man had tears streaming down his face. The man began
speaking and half-crying, "We were just praying. We had some big bills
this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our
baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some
milk." 

His wife in the kitchen yelled out, "I ask him to send an Angel with
some. Are you an Angel?"

The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he
had on him and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward
his car and the tears were streaming down his face.   He knew that God
still answers prayers. 

This is a simple test... 

If you believe that God is alive and well, send this to at least ten
people and the person that sent it to you! 

I'm doing fine.  We can't control all events external to ourselves but we can control our responses to the external events.  We all - especially those who still have jobs - have much to be thankful for and I truly am thankful for all my blessings.  Merry Christmas to you and your family.  -  Teb
Thanks for including me on this.  How are you doing through all this?  I hope you have a happy holiday.  Dari

inside. A man's voice yelled out, "Who is it? What do you want?"   Then
the door opened before the young man could get away.    The man was
standing there in his jeans and t-shirt.  He looked like he just got out
of bed. He had a strange look on his face, and he didn't seem too happy
to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. "What is it?" The young
man thrust out the gallon of milk. "Here I brought this to you." 

The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway, speaking loudly in
Spanish. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the milk toward
the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was
crying. The man had tears streaming down his face. The man began
speaking and half-crying, "We were just praying. We had some big bills
this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our
baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some
milk." 

His wife in the kitchen yelled out, "I ask him to send an Angel with
some. Are you an Angel?"

The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he
had on him and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward
his car and the tears were streaming down his face.   He knew that God
still answers prayers. 

This is a simple test... 

If you believe that God is alive and well, send this to at least ten
people and the person that sent it to you! 

Just talked to Debbie and she told me about the 2 week waiting period after the proceeding you are trying to get waived.  However it turns out, the end is in sight.  Everyone is still keeping you, Alina, Kim and Chad in their thoughts and prayers.  We can't wait to meet Alina in person, hopefully sometime shortly after the first of the year you can bring her up.  If she needs time to get acclimated before encountering downtown Houston and meeting new people we will understand.  I hope your various ailments are healed, or at least getting better.  Debbie talks to your Mom and Kim periodically, but we enjoy your e-mails when you get a chance.  Hang in there and you will soon be back telling many stories of your adventure.  --  Teb

Got it.

Hey Teb, let me know if this went through.

I do not believe we can make a single point a division in this case.  There is a definition of division on sheet no. 102B which seems to say a point must be interconnected with other points to be a division.  I know we treat single points as divisions in certain other contracts, but I believe these were set up prior to 11/2/92 and are "grandfathered". I also don't believe we are obligated - or able - to extend Sec. 11 rights to new points.  Frazier, what's your reading of this?

	Please see Buzz' feedback below and let me know asap what your conclusions are.  nb

I don't think we should give out section 11 rights here.  There were none before.
Physically, firm deliveries could be shifted out of this point, but none in.  
He can shift on an alternate basis.

Buzz, please give me your feedback on this situation.  nb
Chris Snyder with FPU called and asked if the New Smyrna point, poi 16160 on contract 100740 (which is the only delivery point on that contract that they permanently acquired through capacity release) could be made a division.  The point was acquired through a permanent capacity release transaction as a single point. 

The problem is that they requested to combine this point into their current dpoa, contract 5002 that has points behind divisions.  The allocation reports he gets do not reflect this point since it is not in a division.  Can we make a point a division just so the reports can "pick up" the point?  Chris also mentioned that he does not want this point in a separate dpoa because he wants to be able to take advantage of the section 11 rights with their other delivery points on their dpoa.  

Frazier and Teb, please let me know if we can do this so that we can make the appropriate changes in our system.  nb

He can net imbalances together by "booking out" the imbalance of one entity with the imbalance of the other entity.  In other words,  do a book-out with himself.  This can be done without adding the single point as a division to an existing divisional contract.

	I spoke with Chris Snyder this morning and his request is to add New Smyrna as a 4th Division to his existing 3 Divisions in order to have one Balancing Entity  vs.. Two Balancing Entities so he can net imbalances together. He is not looking for section 11 rights and he knows the New Smyrna lateral is constrained and he can not move any additional volumes there. Chris right now will have to deal with Two Balancing Entities and this is what he is trying to avoid. He will do what ever it takes on his end that we require/request. Please take another look with the one reason (Balancing) in mind. Give me your feedback. Thanks... John.

Rob - What format should this be in? 

Here is the revised ratings document.  Would you like the information put into slide format?
 

A backhaul capacity lease was proposed in the multi-party Mobile Bay projects and FERC did not seem to have any philosophical problems with the concept.  I will defer the second question to the real lawyers.

We are currently discussing several potential approaches for a "Phase VII" expansion project.  We have preliminary work underway on several potential scenarios, some of which might involve Gulfstream as an upstream transporter.  

As part of these discussions, Gulfstream has inquired about FGT's interest in providing a capacity lease for backhaul service (approximately 20-30 miles - they did not identify the specific market). 

My questions are:
	(1) Backhaul capacity lease with an interstate pipeline - Do you see any problems/issues?  The lease arrangement would be with Guflstream Pipeline.

	(2) If this backhaul lease capacity is used by Gulfstream to provide deliveries to an electric generator, would the FP&L Favored Nations Clause be triggered?
  

I cannot see a Time Approval on the screen I get when I log on.  I thought I had approved all time reports for Jeanette Doll.  Please advise.

Teb, 

Oops, we accidentally left you off this distribution list.  Your presence is most desired.  We hope you can make it.

Thanks, Kim.

We are planning on meeting on Monday, October 22nd from 10:00 to 11:00 to discuss the Southern Trails Pipeline West Leg data room.  We will meet in EN 1336.  During this meeting, we will discuss:

General description of the project

What data needs to be requested to be included in the data room

Assignments in the data room

Timing of visiting the data room

Please contact me if you are unable to attend or need to send a substitute representative.

FYI.... from the toaster abductors...

We have your toaster!!!  You'll get it back when our demands are met.
Leave 4 boxes of 8 1/2 x 11 paper (no damn 3 hole punch paper either)
under the TV on the west end of the 39th floor and you'll be toasting
away within a few hours.  This isn't from Craig; we've hacked into his
email...

Getting paper for the floor is out of my hands.  I have had three calls this morning plus a note left on my desk to order paper.

Our toaster that Rick Dietz bought when we moved down here is missing this A.M.  Has been reported to Facilities who will report to Security.  If anyone knows anything, would you please let me know!

	Tnx, Alma G.
  

We will never negotiate with toaster terrorists!  We will eat raw bread forever rather than turn over a single sheet of paper - or even a single chad - to those who would resort to such extortion.  If we give in now, we will only encourage such acts in the future.  First our microwaves, then our filtered water dispenser, then our refrigerators will become targets of these evil doers.  Rather, we will hunt down those responsible for this dastardly act, and bring them to justice or justice to them.  We will also go after any department supporting the evil doers as well as anyone who partakes of bread (or Eggos or pop tarts) toasted in the purloined appliance!

Hi Teb,

I am trying to verify if Jeanette Doll is still on assignment. Listed below are the Co #s and CC #s that Jeanette has been charging her time to. Could you validate if these cost center numbers are still active or inactive?. Is the Company Name and Department the same?   Also, please let me know if there are any cost center numbers that need to be added or deleted.

Our plans are to continue to use Jeanette as long as we are authorized to do so.  We recently sent a justification for keeping her indefinitely, but, as yet, have not heard anything back.  I can not give an end date because I have no plans to end the arrangement.  If we are forced to terminate this arrangement with Jeanette, we would have to add at least 1 full time position and the quality of our service would suffer greatly.  Please advise Rob Kilmer and myself of the steps we need to take to continue to use Jeanette indefinitely.  Her assignment is not related to a specific project but is to provide ongoing regulatory support to the Transwestern pipeline.  

Teb,

Regarding the end date, we are being required to put some sort of end date into our system.  We can always go back in to extend should the assignment go beyond that date.  Would you like me to extend it for 3 or 6 months, or through the end of 2002?

I'll wait to hear back from Debbie on the coding.  

Thanks for the update!

To EPLF and its sympathizers:   Unless the toaster is returned immediately,=
 SADIST will commence an escalating series of  actions designed to bring al=

1. All deliveries of new business cards will be suspended

 this paper?  What printers are you using?  Does IT have to support these p=

To avoid further delays in the negotiations, please deliver bribes in 6-pac=

I really enjoyed this and thought all of you might too!

Thought you might enjoy this.

An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The 
boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they 
went along they passed some people who remarked it was 
a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding.  
The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, 
so they changed positions.

Later, they passed some people that remarked, "What a 
shame, he makes that little boy walk". They then decided 
they both would walk.  Soon they passed some more people
who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a 
decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.

Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying 
how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy 
and man said they were probably right, so they decided 
to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they 
lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river 
and drowned.

The moral of the story?

If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss 
your ass good-bye!

Amy & Julie - I have sold my house and will be moving to an apt. near Kirby & W. Alabama before the end of the month.  I  am in the process of packing up my house and have several other obligations this weekend so I will not be able to arrange for the newsletter distribution.  I believe I gave Amy a list of the distributors - Deanna will not be able to continue and Martha and Pat have indicated they would like some relief also.  On the positive side, Lorraine(?) in the 300 block of Welch (with the new baby) has said she would like to help.  

I can't remember the new officers so could you all arrange for a transition to a new distributor?  

Thanks,

Teb

No regulatory problems.

All,

We are still working on all the details of the proposed interconnect with Questar Southern Trails in the Blanco Hub and will send you a copy soon for your review.  Since the interconnect is fully reimbursable, Questar is proposing to pay us according to the attached payment schedule vs. paying all of it up front.  

Please take a look at this attached schedule and provide me you comments.  If we allow them to pay "along the way" I am interested in making sure it at least matches the timing of our cash outlay of building the interconnect.  The total estimate of $702,000 includes the tax gross up, which may or may not be applicable, so each of these amount may be reduced by the tax amount.

Does anyone have any concerns with the timing of the payment schedule?  

Thanks, Kim.

better be ready.  I am coming in on Thursday night for the Georgia game and 
may stay in Birmingham that night...any vacancies?  I think we may play golf 
on Friday.

bring it.  I guess you are right, you don't need tickets, hope you don't need 
any the rest of the season.  I give you that whoopin at the bar this weekend.

for a vacation that is just us.  I think in time you will become more 
comfortable, and I will just wait for that time.

You need to talk to your mom and decide if we are going this weekend.  If we

in your company.  I'm very happy for you and where life is.  Now that I know
you're local, I'll e-mail you before I come down next time so we can
hopefully hang or where I can at least pop by.  I'd love to play with the
little one.  Allright bro, just wanted to share that with you,

Much love,

 P.S. Tell Dawn I was disappointed I didn't get to see her.  By the way I
gotta tell ya sometime about the night before the reunion, it was rather

Second Presidential Debate Transcript
>
>Jim Lehrer: Welcome to the second presidential debate between Vice
>President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. The candidates have agreed on
>these rules:
>I will ask a question. The candidate will ignore the question and deliver
>rehearsed remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters. The
opponent
>will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens

>into voting for him. When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper
>softly while he continues to spew  incomprehensible statistics for three
>more minutes.
>
>Let's start with the vice president. Mr. Gore, can you give us the name of
a
>downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that
>strains the bounds of common sense?
>Gore: As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made love
>the way we have so often during the 30 years of our rock-solid marriage,
the
>downtrodden have a clear choice in this election. My opponent wants to
>cut taxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans.  I, on the other hand,
>want
>to put the richest 1 percent in an iron clad lockbox so they can't hurt
old
>people like Roberta Frampinhamper, who is here tonight. Mrs.
>Frampinhamper has been selling her internal organs, one by one, to pay for

>gas so that
>she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me. Also,
>herpoodle
>has arthritis.
>
>Lehrer: Gov. Bush, your rebuttal.
>
>Bush: Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, crying
>with them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists.  I
>want to empower those crying people to make their own decisions, unlike my

>opponent, whose mother is not Barbara Bush.
>
>Lehrer: Let's turn to foreign affairs. Gov. Bush, if Slobodan Milosevic
>were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia, would you be able
to
>pronounce his name?
>
>Bush: The current administration had eight years to deal with that guy
>and didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do about
>that
>guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies. And then Dick would
>present me several options for dealing with that guy. And then Dick would
>tell me
>which one to choose. You know, as governor of Texas, I have to make tough
>foreign policy decisions every day about how we're going to deal with New
>Mexico.
>
>Lehrer: Mr. Gore, your rebuttal.
>
>Gore: Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly interested in.
>I served my country in Vietnam. I had an uncle who was a victim of poison
>gas in World War I.  I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian War.  And
>when that war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a
>way
>that any undecided woman voter would find romantic. If I'm entrusted with
>the office of president, I pledge to deal knowledgeably with any threat,
>foreign or domestic, by putting it in an iron clad lockbox. Because the
>American people deserve a president who can comfort them with simple
>metaphors.
>
>Lehrer: Vice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security
>system?
>
>Gore: It's a vital issue, Jim. That's why Joe Lieberman and I have
>proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to
>every
>senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny
>until
>the year 2250. In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion over the next
10
>years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free
>to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them
>with the child-proof cap.
>
>Lehrer: Gov. Bush?
>
>Bush: That's fuzzy math. I know, because as governor of Texas, I have to
>do math every day. I have to add up the numbers and decide whether I'm
going
>to fill potholes out on Rt. 36 east of Abilene or commit funds to reroof
the
>sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds.
>
>Lehrer: It's time for closing statements.
>
>Gore: I'm my own man. I may not be the most exciting politician, but I
>will fight for the working families of America, in addition to turning the

>White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me.
>Bush: It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no
>onebut Republicans.
>
>Lehrer: Good night.

Does Denise have any interest in learning to ski?  I think it is an absolute 
blast.  How are the negotiations going between Gwynn and the Padres?

Okay, I've been working on the Settlements forms and I've updated the 
schedules again.  There were some adjustments to the Fred variances as well 
when I reclassed liquidations out of financial and into physical.  Since I'm 
pretty much out of time, here is the latest, and most likely, final, schedule:

Cathy

I agree with you.  We are going skiing in January.  If ya'll want to come or 
come to a football game in the fall.  I am not sure if we can make it out 
there before the end of the year.  I have spoken for all of my vacation 
days.  Did you see the sorry Astros released Cami today?  The man gave up all 
of that cash for us and is sitting in rehab for dependency and we walk out 
him.  Typical Drayton McClain.  Talk to you tomorrow.
PL

I know what you mean.  As far as the bed goes, you should do what I do...Go 
around to the other side and push your wife into the wet area.

Is it 6 a.m. out there?  What in the hell are you already doing at work?

Done.  FYI, according to Trey, this does not go through ECC because it is 
physical..do you agree? I changed sitara as well.
PL

A vote was taken, and NY,NY was declared the winner.  I then went around to 
everyone and the were cool with NYNY because it was putting an extra $100 in 
everyone's pocket.  If you want to talk to everyone and try and convince 
them, let me know.  By the way, how do I get my high score weekly money?  DO 
I have to wait until the end of the season.

Did you see the first three games of the divisional series?  4 of the 6 
starters were former Astro pitchers - within the last three years.  Halama, 
Garcia for Seattle - Randy Johnson trade, Hampton and Kyle.  How sickening is

Sorry it has taken so long to get back with you.  Work has been real hectic.  
Trust me, I feel old as well.  The old body doesn't cooperate like it use 
to.  

Jackson and Ashley are doing great.  We got our tree up and he just rounds 
around pointing at the glass balls on the tree and yelling balls!!!!

This christmas should be fun.  When are you coming out here to visit?
PL

It was good to talk to you live.  I miss our chats, but this is the wrong 
time and place to discuss that.  Please do not fret at all about not asking 
me to stand up.  For what it is worth I didn't ask you either.  I think you 
are correct it would have been akward for both of us.  This week is a time 
when you need as little stress as possible to cope with al the people that 
are pulling at you.  So you know, do not worry about us, we are there to 
celebrate with you and meet your family.  Take care of the other high 
maintenance people, because you will be suprised how many there are.  Try and 
relax and enjoy it.  I am looking forward to seeing you in that dress.  See 
you soon.

Hey Phillip, I am in the office now...but will be leaving soon and will not
be working the rest of the week.  We should chat live.  But...as for as
Friday goes...I am giving each room a guest box.  And in the box is a
map/tour guide of things you can do.  The luncheon....well, other than my
brother (and not totally sure he is coming...but will know tonight) you are
the only guy invited...and Ashely of course.  If you were a girl (which I
am happy you are not) you would be in my wedding party....and the lunch is
a way to say thanks to those close to me.  If you and Ashley can't come b/c
Grandma, etc....I totally understand.  Please do not feel obligated.  But,
can you please let me know...I have to give the restaurant a head count.  I
am still working on Thursday night.  BUT....worst case...check with the
front desk.  I will leave where we are, or what the plans are if in fact I
am not there.  I'll try and call you tonight.  OK..I am not nervous...but I
am losing my mind right now!!  Too many things to do!!!  Anyhow...did want
to let you know that I really thought about having you in Jason's wedding
party....but then thought it might not be the most appropriate.  Might have
been a little weird.  Just wanted to let you know that I did think about
you.

I don't know if you are working any this week, but I will send an email any
way.  We were wondering what there might be to do in Denver on Friday?
Since we have all day, are there musuems or things unique to Denver to see?
I know there is some luncheon on Friday, is that for couples or just girls?
Wasn't really sure.  We get in about we land on Thursday at 5 p.m. and her
grandmother lands at 6 p.m. so we should be at the hotel by around 6:45.
Should we call your room or meet you somewhere?  Talk to you soon.
PL

Congrats on the future addition.  We are all doing good.  Jackson is 20 
months and walking and talking up a storm.  Definitely keeping us on our 
toes.  The program for people with Graduate degrees is the associate 
program.  The person to contact that is responsible for that program is 
Kristin Gandy, her number is  713-345-3214.  I have no idea what all the 
requirements are and when they recruit.  What type of position is he 
interested in - Treasury?  I have some friends down in Treasury that I may be 
able to pass the resume on if you guys would like.  Oil and Gas experience is 
not a necessity, just a plus.  Enron really encourages diversity in every 
form, even experience.  By far the best company I have ever worked for.
PL

Hey. How is everything going with you all?  Things are pretty good here.
Expecting a second baby in March.  Pretty excited. How are Ashly and
Jackson? Good I hope.  What is Jackson now, almost 2?  I bet he's alot of
fun.  I was also writing to ask you if you know anything about the program
Enron has for people with graduate degrees. Chris is furiously looking for
a new job and was just curious about that program that he saw on the Enron
web site.  I was also going to ask you if you knew of any positions there
that might suit Chris' qualifications.  Alot of what he sees on the web is
looking for alot of engineering or Oil & Gas experience.  I told him you
might have an inside track on some things there and that I would check with
you.  I am attaching his resume for you to look at.  If you know of
anything, please give me a call or e-mail me. I would certainly appreciate
it.  Take care and keep in touch.

Great article on what it truly means to be an Auburn Man

The ties that bind 
Friday night meetings have helped Auburn through hard times
10/03/00
By PHILLIP MARSHALL 
Times Sports Staff 

AUBURN - It started in dark and unhappy times for Auburn's football team.

Five straight games had been lost. Late in Tommy Tuberville's first season as 
head coach, the team was fractured, divided by the stress of almost two years 
of trouble, despair and losing.

More Auburn football | Talkin' Tigers Forum 

A bond began to grow among players young and old, black and white, starters 
and reserves. It wasn't so much about winning and losing or even about 
football. It was about matters of the heart.

''We may have had 15-20 guys show up that first night,'' senior whip 
linebacker Rob Pate said. ''Since then, it's just like another thing on the 
itinerary. It's not mandatory, but we have basically the whole team there. 
We've got five or six coaches. Coach Tuberville comes in there. People just 
lay out their hearts, whatever is on their minds.''

Auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that November 
night. Players say they've done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has 
grown ever stronger.

It has carried the 15th-ranked Tigers to a 5-0 record going into Saturday's 
Southeastern Conference West Division showdown at 20th-ranked Mississippi 
State.

Pate says they'll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in 
the most difficult times.

Pate knows about pain and even fear. A mysterious disease, now seemingly 
under control, threatened his senior season.

''When you see a guy at his weakest point and he's reaching out asking you 
for help, you know everything about a guy,'' Pate said. ''With me, it was my 
health. Before the first game, they set a chair in the middle of the room and 
every guy in there put his hands on me. We said a prayer together. Man, I was 
crying.

''It's like that every weekend. Somebody on this team is suffering through 
something. They share it. When you line up on Saturday, it's a lot easier to 
look at that person and know he is going to give it everything he's got.''

On the field, there has been little but happiness for Auburn this season. 
Tuberville says it started when Auburn players, strengthened by the bad 
times, put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for 
their teammates and their school.

''I've never been around a team this close,'' Tuberville said. ''They get 
along. We haven't always played as great as we wanted to, but we've had guys 
urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to 
get better.

''It's just a special group. They enjoy being around each other and 
understand what it's going to take for us to win.''

The change from not so long ago is striking, Simmons says.

''If you don't really know each other and everybody is in their own little 
group, things aren't going to work,'' Simmons said. ''If you have trust in 
your teammates, you can build a good team. Right now, we've got that going.''

It starts with the seniors, who have seen the good and the bad of college 
football. They went to the SEC Championship Game as freshmen in 1997. Then 
came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach, Terry Bowden.

They revel in their success, yet they know it can be ever so fleeting. They 
take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back.

No one understands better than fifth-year senior quarterback Ben Leard. He 
went from starter to third team in 1998, then won his job back in 1999 when 
hardly anyone thought he could.

Today, he has the highest efficiency rating of any SEC quarterback.

''We have been practicing since August and we have yet to hear anyone say 
'Man, I'm looking forward to playing in the NFL,' '' Leard said. ''No one is 
worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing status-wise. 
Everybody just wants to win ball games. The relationships we have on this 
team are like brothers.''

Leard says nothing that happens can change that.

''If we lose every game from now on, this will be one of the most special 
seasons I've ever had in my life,'' Leard said. ''We've got people excited. 
We're excited. The fun is back in it for us.

''It's a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to 
practice, to see the guys, to have fun and talk. There are no fingers being 
pointed anywhere. There are no individuals on this football team.''

Evans was one who showed the way, happily accepting the unglamorous role of 
blocker for tailback Rudi Johnson. Every Friday night, Evans is still the one 
who leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain.

''Heath is just like that all the time,'' Pate said. ''He's a great example 
of somebody who lives what he talks. He's a role model, not just for younger 
people but for all of us.''

what room?

Good to hear from you as well.  Last I heard, you were running a dating 
service...What happened with that?

I have been at Enron for close to 3 years.  Ashley and I have a 18 month old 
son, Jackson.  Mom is doing good, as we all are.

How do you like Enron so far?  I absolutely love it.  I am in the Risk 
Management Group for Natural Gas Trading.  Dealing with the traders can be 
fun, but is usually quite challenging.  Unfortunately we have a lot of late 
nights waiting on systems - like we are right now.  What group are you with? 

Where are you living these days?  We just built a house in PineBrook in Clear 
Lake.  We had our ten year reunion last weekend...quite strange.

I don't know if you know them, but several CL graduates work here.  Meredith 
Mitchell, Dawn Kenne, Mike Pyer.

Our curves just came out, so I am going to start calcing my P&L.  Talk to you 
later.

Ashley Lord@EES

PLove...is that you!!!!!!????  How are things going?  Last I heard you had a 
baby on the way... How is Ashley?  Your Mom?  The baby?  I just started with 
Enron at the end of August.  What about you?  Obviously you are not with UTMB 
anymore.  It is WONDERFUL to hear from you!!!! Write Back!

Could you please change the curve mappings on a type of trade for Robyn 
Menear.  THe trade is a GD Index swap for out months.  THe product type is US 
GAS Basis - GD/M Trunk WLA.  This is currently being mapped to a GDP curve 
adn we need it changed to TRUNKL/WLA-GD.  Robyn sets this curve everyday as a 
basis curve.  Thanks.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel 
free to shout.  
PL

Well, did you survive the week without your husband?  I am sure things are 
alot calmer now at home.  How is the little one?  Jackson is into 
everything.  Ashley had to go out of town to a meeting on Saturday, so he and 
I hung out all day.  I taught him how to smoke, drink and cuss.  Ash was real 
proud.
PL

done
PL

There are four of us that are not playing tomorrow?
PL

Are you the same Ashley Lord that went to Clear Lake High School.  I think I 
saw the Ashley Lord I went to high school with in the lobby and thought this 
might be you.  If not, please disregard my email.  Thanks.
PL

Check this out.  Can't remember if I have sent this to you before.

Please provide me a list of deal numbers that need to be changed.  From you 
email I gather you are saying that all deals done by ENA with a Canadian 
Counterparty need to be ECC/3rd party and then flipped to ENA 
book/FT-US/Cand/ERMS.  Is this correct?

I have rugby practice on Tuesday's and Thursday's.  I can do it before work, 
long lunch or Monday/Friday.  Let me know.

I like it when you call me sailor.

Tell him it is firm.  We are obligating ourselves no matter what.  And tell 
him thank you again.  See you tonight pretty lady.
PL

Per Bruce Mills - this goes through ENA
PL

According to the trader, this is a gas daily daily for the balance of month.  
This may be a hedge for them for a physical deal, but it is financial from 
our perspective.
PL

no thanks.
PL

I will be there.  It is bid week, remind me.
PL

I changed the first deal, the second one NZ3403, Kam got a call from credit 
that this should be with ECC.  We have a sheat from Bruce Mills that says all 
deals with Dynegy Canada should be through ECC.
PL

Ask Why....Why doesn't the Ask Why commercials work?

sure.  Just give me a shout.  Next week will not be good and I would prefer 
if we could do it before 2 p.m.  Let me know.
PL

sounds good.  We will have to start getting firm replies from people soon.  
Is the full amount still due on Feb. 15th?  If so, people will have to give 
us their money by then.

Thanks,

Sorry I did not get back with you yesterday.  We have been really busy around 
here.  I called the person that I gave your resume to and she is on a 
business trip until early next week.  Her assistant is going to have her call 
me when she returns.  Apparently she left the day after I gave her the 
resume.  I will keep you informed.  If you look on our website www.enron.com 
and you see anything that interests you, let me know and I will put the 
resume in.  Talk to you soon.
PL

I have put all of the liquidations for GD Central in the Fred Liquidations 
file.  There is a variance of ($13,950) on the gas daily between what we 
flashed and what detail we now have.  We will have to take this adjustment to 
the P&L(wil be expense).  I do not have detail for Basis Capacity Hedges or 
LT Transport.  I am under the impression that these numbers are given to you 
each month by Cernosek's group.  For Basis Capacity Hedges, we flashed 
($31,074) and for LT Transport we flashed ($130,735).  The detail in this 
file plus these three numbers should tie out.  If not, please let me know.  
Shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help.
PL

I bid $0 on New Orleans D

I bid $2 of Miami's D and $1 on Detroit's D

I passed it off today to someone in the Public Relations dept.  I will also 
look on our bulletin board and see what if anything is out there.

Done.

before you pass the resume along so you get credit.  Please try and do
this as soon as you can.  Thanks.

Scott

Cathy please seperate two items from your original list.  TAGG#N50101.C for 
$897,332 and TAGG#N70687.7 for $659,979.  These two liquidations relate to a 
NGPL storage deal on the desk that should have variances for several months.  
The net amount of these two liquidations is $237,353.  For now, please  put 
this item on the backpage on it's own line.  We will reconcile the other 
storage lines in the next few weeks and see what if anything needs to be 
added to this line.  At that time we will work out the necessary steps to get 
this item off of the backpage.  Scott is still looking at TAGG#N38268.L for 
$1,443,519 for the remainder of the balance for May.  Shout with any 
questions.
PL

	
	

Phillip,

Here is the detail for the open item related to lone liquidations for May for 
Central region:

NGPL Sales
N50101.B  581,059.89 *
N50101.C  897,332.09
N50101.D    10,048.22 *
N50101.E    15,518.59

Union Gas Sales
N38268.L  1,443,518.67

NGPL Purchase

N50101.Y      4,082.40
N70658.7  581,059.89 *
N70687.7  659,978.83

*offsetting liquidations-but I left them on the list because they were lone 
liquidations.

Thanks for your help,
Cathy

I like that.
PL

Please use the following two files as your detail support for finanical 
liquidations:

Previously, I believe you were given the capacity hedges file the 
pricebasisindex file and the pricebasisindex_revised file.  All three of 
these equalled the 3.7 million.  You should use the revised and the capacity 
hedge file.  When you use the two files listed above, you will come up with a 
variance going the other way of roughly $(817,385).  This amount should be a 
"desk adjustment".  We have accounted for the variance in our current month 
(0800) file and will simply reclass between the months.  Please shout with 
any questions.

Here is the email reminder of the curve setting process.  After you set your 
curves(do not hit finished file), go to the GD Pmgr tab and change the date 
in the left hand corner to two business days out(Friday set for Tuesday).  
Then go to the CurveFetch tab and place your file on automatic calc(can not 
hit F9).  Then hit fetch Prices button.  Prices should be brought in for 
current date.  Go to the AutoCurve tab and hit paste curves.  When this is 
done, hit finished file and the date will be updated so that I know your 
curves are ready to load in ERMS.  Please feel free to shout with any 
questions.  Thanks.

I just wanted to respond to your email and let you know the thought process 
of the book move for Ontario.  This move was requested by the trader 10 days 
ago.  We notified Curtis Smith and Bill Kasemervisz the following business 
day last Monday - July 24th.  For future reference, please let us know 
exactly how much notice is required and if you think there are other groups 
we may have missed notifying so that this does not become a problem again.  
Thanks for your help.

Kam asked that I email you guys about the FT-ONTARIO book move.  Please move 
the book for Price, Basis and Index from FT-ONT-CENTRAL to FT-ONTARIO.  This 
also encompasses splitting out the price and basis and fixing the curves in 
the curve table.  This needs to be done by Monday night, 7/31.  Thanks for 
you help and please shout with any questions.
PL

Please take both of these amounts and add them to the synthetic storage 
variance section in Economics.  I have added them to my spreadsheet that I am 
compiling.  Thanks.

This deal is booked correctly.  The external fee, labeled exchange fee is the 
.145 cents per mm that we owe them for the exchange.  The confirmation letter 
is wrong.  The fee per Geoff Storey the trader is .145.  This is also known 
as a spread fee.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call 3-7376.

You entered these deals in Sitara.  Could you please get with Chuck Jacobs to 
resolve this issue.  Please see his e mail.
	
	

Elizabeth,

Can you check out Deal #'s 411921 (Sale) and 411937 (Purchase)?  Looks like a 
buy/sell where we sold to Consumers Energy in October (1,000,000 total at 
5.20) and bought it back from them in November.  Both deals have 0 rates so 
that's not a problem.  The problem is - there's an exchange fee on both deals 
of $0.0725.  But it's a negative fee on the sales side and a positive fee on 
the purchase side.  That means I would owe them a netted amount of $145,000.  
Is that right??  Should the sale side maybe be positive so the two sides net 
to 0 - or do we owe them this money??
Also, the confirmation letter for the sales side mentions a "spread fee" to 
be paid by Seller (ENA) of $155,000.  Could that $145,000 netted amount be a 
part of that?  And if so, where's the other $10,000?

So many questions!!  I have copies of the confirms if you need to see them.  
Let me know...

...Chuck

Please correct the following deals:

Enron Canada purchase deal # 121397  Was 4.18427 should be 4.10185  This is 
due to a Buy/back at Chippawa which reduces our Sithe transport by 
$70,191.70   I normally book this manually (with Journal entry) but with SAP, 
it needs to be in Unify and this is the only deal I can book it to.  The 
Sithe transport is in Canadian dollars and this reduction is in US $.

Also I have the following deals which are scheduled different on our side 
that Enron Canada and causes me about a $500 out of balance each month.  We 
have netted this with other out of balances in previous months but with SAP, 
I can no longer do this. Here is what happens:

ENA Books:  Purchase Deal 290657  for 30,390  MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005 = $4,125,442.50
            Sale Deal 290652 for     ( 5,000) MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.0075=    678,375.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,067.50
                                                                        
Enron Canada Books:

            Sale                  for 20,000 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.-.005=   $2,715,000.00
  Sale                  for  5,390 MMBTU per day at 
Michcon.Citygate.GD.M.I.     =      732,501.00
                                                                              
  Total          $3,447,501.00

I don't know why we book a purchase and sale but it messes up the deal in 
SAP.  Can we change the ENA sale deal 290652 to posting -.005 and the ENA 
purchase deal # 290657 tier it for 25,000 at Posting -.005 and balance at 
posting.  Let me know as soon as possible.  I need to pay this AM on Monday.

Thanks, Jane

Looks like these are released status now.  Please let me know if you have any 
further questions.

Asa & Joy,

I just wanted to take a minute and thank the two of you for your generosity 
this past week.  My friends and I had a terrific time and everyone really 
enjoyed your condo.  The weather was terrific and the fish put up a 
formidable challenge.  We are very interested in renting the condo from you 
guys during the season this year.  I requested that the cleaning charges this 
time be put on my credit card.  Please let me know if  they charge you guys 
anything.  Thanks again.  We look forward to seeing you guys soon.

I looked into these deal and I have good reason to believe they should have 
been flashed by economics under CPR PIPELINE EXCHANGE.  They will fall out as 
a lone liquidation on the COMPARE REPORT, but only because CPR PIPELINE 
EXCHANGE, while flashed on the desk is not included in the CPR detail for the 
COMPARE REPORT.  They should be offset by the flashed detail or they should 
be put into the economics section as an adjustment to the desk.

I've identified the following deals that I believe are synthetic storage that 
I will assign to Gas Accounting as reclasses to future months.  Please let me 
know if you disagree:

Panhandle Eastern NG9695.3 1,479,927.04 looks like turnaround on leg 1 in 
08/2000

Northern Natural Gas NG4225.3 59,250.00 looks like turnaround on leg 1 in 
07/2000

I looked into these deal and I have good reason to believe they should have 
been flashed by economics under CPR PIPELINE EXCHANGE.  They will fall out as 
a lone liquidation on the COMPARE REPORT, but only because CPR PIPELINE 
EXCHANGE, while flashed on the desk is not included in the CPR detail for the 
COMPARE REPORT.  They should be offset by the flashed detail or they should 
be put into the economics section as an adjustment to the desk.

I will assign to Gas Accounting as reclasses to future months.  Please let me

Sorry man, I am swamped today.  Doing my book and Trey's and I have a 6 p.m. 
flight to Utah.  I will try and get back with you today.  The offer will 
definitely have to get sweeter to get the 2 pick overall.

Attached is the revised model with all of your transport deals from yesterday 
and the farwell deal.  Please review and let me know if you agree with this.  
If you agree, we will unwind/kill the TAGG deals and book the spreadsheet 
amounts.  We are still working on the spread option and foreign exchange 
being included in this model.  For the foreign exchange,  I took an average 
exchange rate for the life of each deal for now.  Thanks.
PL

I just added the swaps to these deals.  Sorry about that.  Thanks for letting 
me know.

Drew Bledsoe - $31

I wanted to let you guys know that I changed the files.  I had one deal with 
FT Central that was in the physical file that was financial.  I transferred 
the deal to Sheetal's file.  I also added the sitara numbers to the physical 
file.  Sorry for the mishaps.

If you have viewed your benefit elections on eHROnline, then you may of 
noticed the missing coverage amount for Child Life Insurance.   For Child 
Life Insurance, you will be able to see the coverage cost of $.42 per pay 
period.  However, the amount of coverage will reflect $0.00.  

During conversion to SAP, we discovered that there was no dependent child 
record created, we need immediate action from you

Please respond to this email by Thursday, June 29 by 3:00 p.m. with your 
child's name, date of birth and social security number.  Once we have entered 
all dependent data in SAP your amount of coverage will reflect $10,000 per 
child in eHROnline.

Thank you,
Ginger McCain

This deal was unwound with a paper ticket.  Trader did not mean to ok the

Here is my breakdown for the number of 890,000:

California Energy Hub Sale  702,122

Pacific Gas & Electric Purch    57,040
California Energy Hub Sales variance   282,570

Greg will have to give you the backup for the other two numbers - 131,440 & 
201,500

PL

Here is my breakdown of the December number of $1,460,000:
Fin Liq N05499.7    164,300

Pacific Gas & Electric Pur. Liq (N63900.5) (31,000)
Pacific Gas & Electri Pur Liq.(EV9437.7)  217,808

I have left out the California Energy Hub actual variance, because it nets 
with a PG&E Energy Trading(N05499.3) variance.

make it.  Thanks for the invite.

I apologize.  The deal confirmation group down here instructed me to book 
these deals this way.  I am in the process of rebooking these deals as we 
speak.  They will be fixed within the hour.

Can you unarchive a postid for me.  The number is 773500.  Thanks.

I agree with Bryan.  Judging by the number of email's he is sending, it looks 
like he doesn't have enough work over there.  I am sure the Texas boys could 
use his help on calcing the books.  I will try and limit my smack talking 
next week and I think someone else needs to jam Mick's finger before next 
week's game, it seemed to help him free throw shooting last night.

hey fool, why don't you let me send it and get paid - I will cut you a

to verify that they were in the flash financial liquidations.  Please tell me 
if you have these in the FT file, I have already checked Jim's intra physical

How are things in Denver?  I haven't heard from you in a while and I thought 
I would drop you a line.  I have the picture of all of us from that mexican 
food restaurant off of Westheimer under my mouse pad and I was thinking about 
you.

How are the wedding plans going?  Good I hope.  Have you adjusted to the new 
living situation?  It can be tough at first, but as long as you are patient, 
everything works out.  That was probably the most difficult thign for us.  

Have you been keeping up with the Astros?  They look absolutely horrible.  
They blew another 7 run lead last night.  At least the stadium is really 
nice, otherwise I would be very dissappointed that I got tickets.  I hope 
your parents are still enjoying the seats. 

Talk to you soon.

The price is $5.40 canadian dollars as referenced on TAGG #NI7771.2.  Due to 
TAGG constraints, the deal had to be booked as two legs in tagg to capture 
the canadian price.

I left Bob a message last week and again today that teh Utilicorp price is 
right in sitara and tagg, the confirm should have gone out at IF Ventura + 
.1825.  My understanding from the conversation with Bob was that the confirm 
had not gone out yet, however, the trader got a phone call today that the 
deal got confirmed at the wrong price.

Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.
PL

   
	
	

Hi Philip,

Is the price for Deal NI7771 5.40 or Index because TAGG = 0 and Sitara = 5.40.
Please advise.

Also, Bob Bowen has spoken with you on Friday regarding a confirmation that 
was sent with the wrong price, counterparty is Utilicorp.
Has the price been updated in the system and could you forward me the deal 
number and I will revise and re-send?

Thanks

His sister was older and she lived in New Jersey, no idea of the name.  
Unfortunately I was going to check on the internet for death records and any 
inmate records(he was a little wild).  Do you have any idea about that stuff?

Your career by the way sounds very exciting, I would like to hear more.  
Thanks for the efforts, I have really been wondering about this guy for a few 
years.
PL

I would definitely enjoy playing black jack with you till 5 in the morning

PL

FUCH - it is great to hear from you.  How did you get my address?  What have 
you been up to?  

You won't believe it, but I am married(about 4 years) and have a son 
Jackson(not named after Bo) that is 15 months old.  We finally sold our old 
house and moved into a new one, that is about a mile south of my mom.  
Everything is going great for us here.  We are enjoying our new Astros 
ballpark, which happens to be named after my company.  Unfortunately, we are 
not getting any free tickets(at least the little people aren't).

Where are you living?  Are your parents still in Auburn?  How about your 
lovely sister?  I bet she is married with several children.  We go back to 
Auburn every football season for about three games, if you are ever in town, 
we will have to get together.

Clear Lake is having our ten year reunion this fall.  Should be fun.  I think 
you and I are the only two from that school to ever go to Auburn. 

Talk to you soon.

Questions for Hunter:
1. What are the position limits for the traders on the central desk, maximum

3. How does a trader set their curves?  What information/knowledge is 
required?
4. What information or tools, besides NYMEX, do you use to gage the market?

Carrie, that is all I can come up with right now, I will keep thinking and 
let you know if anything comes up.

It was great to hear from you.  Things are going well for me at Enron. I am

paced and very educational.  

How is your family doing?  I hope it is still expanding with recent grand 
children.

I was sorry to hear of your leaving NSF.  They are definitely going to miss 
your expertise and committment.  I am sure however, that you are exciting

questions.  On 9911 look at the AVAR tab.  The deals highlighted in brown is

some of the same deal numbers here.  Let me know what you think.

Hi guys,

Could you please go through all your books and see if there are any ECC deals 
in them for April or May settlements.  I've gone through a few and here are 
some deals that need to be flipped before noon tomorrow at the latest as I 
need to invoice them tomorrow.

Please make sure that all these deals are flipped to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book 
before noon Houston time on May first.

Jeff,

Can you pass on the message below to all of risk.  For EnronOnline, no trades 
should be "reversed" in TAGG.  Simply kill the deal and we'll take care of 
the documentation.

thanks,
Joe Hunter

Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is 
the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating 
EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.  The trades should continue to be 
initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any 
unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual 
circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk 
for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same 
procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.

Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer 
and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination 
Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.

The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be 
terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.

If you have any questions, please call.

Too late....we had it for dinner last night.  Matter of fact, I think I saw 
the maids packing up the leftovers this morning and heading your way.  Enjoy.

importance of officializing all books correctly everyday.

Thanks

All of these deals had their facilities changed by logistics on the last two 
days.  I have reiterated to Lisa Kinsey the importance of her group letting 
us know when they make a change in facility.  All of these were physical 
basis trades, so they came at contract - the desk price difference is not 
more than .04 on any of the deals.  OA therefore should be minimal.

Hi guys,

Because of the EOL group putting in language to automatically flip deals to 
the P& book as soon as they are booked, the number of deals to be flipped at 
the end of the month has decreased quite a lot, but there are always some 
stragglers that are left behind.  Here is what I've come across.  Could you 
please flip these deals before the end of the week.

FT-EAST

FT-ONTARIO

G-DAILY-EST

GD-CENTRAL

As far as I know, these are the only deals that still need to be flipped.  
I've gone through all the other books that I could
think of, but I might have missed some.  Could you please make sure that I'm 
not missing any deals.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this, and please let me know 
when these have been flipped.

Thanks for all your help again.

Here is the most current orig file.
PL

here it is.

My suggestion for improving the process within the risk group is to do a 
better job of verifying all term deals are coming to the cash desk at mid.

I believe a large improvement can be made in the settlements area.  The forms 
are not accurate, the entire support is not attached and the form they are 
usign does not properly divide the variance between the three possible areas 
causing a variance, desk price, UA4, firm volumes.
PL

I still have two tickets.  Let me know soon.

I wanted to ask a favor.  Would you mind reminding your group to please let 
us know when they change a pipe or trading zone or add a location to a deal 
in sitara.  If we do not catch this change, the trader will be getting the 
deal at contract instead of mid, because the swap does not automatically 
update when you change the physical deal.  If the change is simply a meter, 
that will not effect the pricing of the deal.  Thanks for your help.

Muse: Bowden 'panicked' after Lowder told him his job in jeopardy
The Associated Press
3/18/2001 
MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- When Auburn's football fortunes took a turn for the 
worse in 1998, trustee Bobby Lowder told coach Terry Bowden that he would not 
be retained after the season, former university President William Muse said. 
When Bowden resigned on the eve of a game that fall, he said he was 
essentially fired. 
"Basically, Mr. Lowder told him he would not be around come the end of the 
season, and coach Bowden basically, in my opinion, panicked when he was told 
that and came and negotiated out of his contract," Muse said. 
More Auburn football | Talkin' Tigers Forum
Muse said Lowder did not consult with him before speaking to Bowden, whose 
team was off to a 1-5 start. Bowden said Thursday that Lowder actually did 
not speak directly to him, but went through athletic director David Housel. 
"That's how David and I worked," Bowden said Tuesday in a telephone interview 
from his Orlando home. "We would meet and he would tell me what Lowder wanted 
me to do. I felt like I could do everything I could do and it wouldn't be 
enough (to save his job)." 
Muse made his comments to faculty members March 15. A transcript of the 
meeting was made public Tuesday by Auburn officials. 
Muse said he was unable to reach Bowden until "the wee hours of the morning," 
then told him that Lowder didn't have the authority to fire him and "urged 
him to stay until the end of the season." 
Muse said that was "the most celebrated case" of Lowder taking such a direct 
role in athletic decisions, but "there are many others." 
Bowden often commented that "Mr. Lowder hired me" and that the coach had 
"regular contact" with the powerful trustee, Muse said. Bowden said he spoke 
with Lowder "weekly, if not daily" during his first two or three seasons, but 
"never felt it was a situation that he would tell me something and that I 
should do it." 
Muse said Lowder did not hand-pick the coach. He said an eight-member search 
committee, including Lowder, voted unanimously to offer Bowden the job in 
1993. 
"Let's just say I would not have been hired if Bobby Lowder had not wanted me 
hired," said Bowden, now a television commentator with ABC. "There's no doubt 
about it. Bobby Lowder controlled the committee that hired me at Auburn." 
Both Lowder and Housel have denied Bowden's contention that he was told his 
coaching fate was all but sealed. They also denied that Lowder was pulling 
the strings on that decision. 
Bowden "always believed ... that the only way he got that job was because of 
Lowder's influence," Muse said. "So he believed very strongly that he had to 
maintain that relationship." 
Muse said that relationship began to sour when Bowden fired longtime 
defensive coordinator Wayne Hall. 
Muse also said he is not sure what Lowder's relationship is with Bowden's 
successor, Tommy Tuberville, but that he believes basketball coach Cliff 
Ellis has "very, very frequent contact" with the Montgomery banker. 
Lowder was out of town and did not immediately return a call for comment. 
Earlier Tuesday he said in a statement issued by Auburn that the trustees' 
athletic panel he chairs will continue to provide "support and input" to the 
president and athletic director and that it's time to focus on positive 
accomplishments and "stop bickering." 

We will have a group class on OA tomorrow around 9:00 am in EB3268.  THis is 
an effort to get you guys up to speed on OA so you can review forms and I can 
take 3 hour lunches.  See you there.
PL

I am looking at having a party at my house for the group.  Let me know asap 
which date is better for you guys.  I want to do it asap before it gets to 
hot, so we can cook outside.  Here are the two dates I have in mind Sat. May 
5th(cinco de mayo) or Sat. May 19th.  Let me know guys.  Thanks.
PL

FYI - 
wanted to let you guys know about a few things:
1.  There is a central desk vacation calendar on my desk by the sun machine - 
it is a little black date book.  Please put any future requests in there so 
that we can keep track of who needs off when.  I would like to try and keep 
from having more than 3 people out at a time.
2.  Physical gas daily options - when booking these, please be very careful.  
These need to have daily swaps on them in sitara as opposed to monthly 
swaps.  This will insure that the physical deal comes to the physical trader 
at gas daily as opposed to mid.  This is very important to avoid OA variances.
3.  When booking deals in sitara, please look at your swaps when they are 
created to verify that they are coming at the right mid/gd price.  This is 
important because we have so many deals that are booked to new mids and I 
notice last night on a gd option, that the swap did not come at the correct 
gd curve.
4.  I am going to set up a mtg. for friday or monday to discuss OA, the 
process and how to prepare forms.
5.  Please take advantage of time that you can spend with your traders.  All 
the traders have expressed their approval for each of their book admins to 
spend a morning watching them trade to better understand why they take the 
positions that they do.  The only request I have had is that we sit there 
quietly and observe and ask questions after trading.  Please utilize this 
opportunity to build a relationship with your traders - this is good for 
career development.
6. I will try and set up individual meetings with each of you to go over your 
training plans.

Please shout with any questions.

cheating on their vacation, it is on an honor system with me.  I draw your 
attention to this matter because we always seem to have a problem at the end 
of the year with people having a bunch of vacation and only being able to 
carry over 40 hrs.  Please make sure to plan on taking at least all but 40 
hrs of yours so we do not run into issues at year end.  I have attached the 
site for your time sheets.  You will need your P# and password to access, 
contact security if you do not have either.  If you need help filling this 
out, let me know.  I think we are supposed to fill out a time sheet every two 
weeks, but I only fill mine out when I take vacation.  Thanks.

Dawn,
thanks for putting this information in the paper.  Hopefully a student from 
Haleyville that goes to Auburn in the future can apply for the scholarship.

A scholarship in memory of Dr. W.H. Burgess has been set up at the school of 
Veterinary Medicine at Auburn University.  The scholarship has been ear 
marked for students that are in need of financial assistance and have an 
interest in the area of large animal practice, an area in which Dr. Burgess 
dedicated much of his professional life in Haleyville, Alabama where he 
practiced for 35 years.

If you would like to make contributions to the scholarship in his name, you 
can do so as follows:
Auburn University Foundation

The tagg number for the january piece is QP7914.  This deal was put in after 
the fact - Feb.  so, we will have a variance in January that should be offset 
in February.  This is due to the information not getting to us in time to 
change the customer price in Sitara before we flashed Jan.  The sitara number 
that this all relates to is 543246.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks.
PL

Thanks for having us over.  We had a really good time.  It was great seeing 
you guys.  Drew is a really good kid.  We will have to make our way to Denver 
soon.  Take care.
PL

have a good weekend. we have tomorrow off and I am headed to a bachelor 
party....yee ha
PL

I did get the tickets in.  Don't worry about a check, just give me the money 
in NO.  I am totally siked.  Been a long couple of weeks and looking forward 
to hitting the fest early with my road dog to play some hacky and drink some 
beer before the crowd joins us.  
PL

We are getting close. Two weeks from today. Did you get the Jazz Fest
Tickets? If we need to send you a check

system...That was cruel...he will probably cry himself to sleep tonight...on

speaking of ethics, what is up with the Brooke situation?
PL

I will need a replacement for Chuck unless I get another trading track 
person.  I will also need a replacement for Ben Pham, for which Dave(bench) 
will also need a replacement.  
PL

Thanks for the invite.  We are going to JasonTidwell's wededding in Galveston 
Saturday - it starts at 6 p.m.  We are not planning on staying too long and 
should be back in Clear Lake before 8 p.m.  We will go pick up Jackson and 
shoot over if that is ok.

Who bought the house?  I hate to hear that they are leaving so soon.  When 
does your dad have to go back to the middle east?  

I do not care if what you guys have to drink, thanks for thinking of me with 
the no bud products.  

When do you guys get in?  I am off tomorrow, so give me a call at the house.  
See you soon.  Looking forward to seeing you guys.

Hi All!

Jason, Steve, Drew and I will be in town for the weekend and would love to
spend time with you all.  You are all (including kids, of course!!) invited
to my folks house on Saturday for a bbq.  I am thinking 5:30 ish (or before
if you want to hang out!!).

Most of you know, my parents purchased a house in Colorado.  Last week they
sold the house in Houston...actually some people who graduated in Phillip's
class bought it (Phillip - I need to ask you about this one!) and will
moving out at the end of May.  My Dad will be renting an apt. close to his
office (near the airport) until retirement (hopefully soon) and my parents
will commute back and forth b/t the two places.  For those who aren't able
to make it to Denver, this may be the last time to hang with the folks.

Please let me know if you and guests are able to come over and hang (food
and drink).  Also, any food/drink preferences (e.g., Phillip hates Bud
products).

Love you all,
Rach

I am in receipt of your OA forms for the purchase of gas from
Sithe for the month of December 2000.  These forms are not complete
in that they do not include the liquidations of the hedges that were
put into place to protect Enron from an unfavorable shift in prices.
These were power hedges

Addtionally, there were top-line entries that were flashed to more
accurately reflect what the actual prices were to be at the end
of the month. 

The top-line entries as well as the hedge liquidations all
need to be included to create a complete picture.  At this time I do
not have the tagg numbers or copies of the top line entries.  The
top line entries should be available from the flash files.

Please give me a call so that we can work together to resolve
this OA variance.

Tagg is currently working on a situation where the bridge is creating 
duplicate deals.  This started yesterday and we contacted the appropriate 
books to kill the duplicate deal.  Yesterday, there were a total of eight 
deals duplicating, so far today there are six.  They have narrowed down the 
problem and Mike Swaim and Oscar Rivera think it should be resolved this 
afternoon.  

Meanwhile, Oscar is running a query that will let us know the duplicate 
deals.  He will run this throughout the day and I will e-mail you the deals.  
Listed below in Bold is the duplicate deals from today (two are from late 
last night).  I have placed the risk book next to the deals.  Please forward 
this to the appropriate people in your group.  I was not sure who runs the 
Singapore book, if London could let me know I would appreciate it.

I will keep you updated on the progress.  Sorry for any inconvenience this 
may be causing.  Feel free to call me if you would like more information.

Thanks,

Going with the old hyphen huh???  How corporate of you.  

Hey, we got the beer.  Thanks alot.  Did customs give you a hard time for 
bringing a bunch of booze back?  Talk to you soon.

I meant to email you over the weekend to let you know it was on it's way.  
Just be sure to fill out the matching gifts form.  Please let me know if 
there is any hold up on that.  

Looks like we will not make it back to Auburn until the fall for football 
season.  I will give you a call a few weeks before we come in to set up a 
tour of the raptor center/vet school.  Thanks again for your help in 
completing this special occasion for my family.

Talk to you soon.

Phillip ... wanted to let you know the check arrived this past week and
I've taken it to accounting for deposit.  We will await the Enron match.

Thank you again, and especially for thinking about having Enron match the
family's gifts to this memorial scholarship. That will help it add up in a
hurry.

Do you know when you will be in Auburn next?

Attached is a file listing all of the curves we had that posted as 0 price 
for 3/31/01.  We need these pub posted as the same price as the 30th - prices 
are included in this file.  We need these pub posted ASAP so that we can 
flash march detail.  Risk does not have authorization to override an existing

The information you needed for 1100, roughly 310K, should be a firm book 
variance as well on the other side.  Portfolio accounting should have a 
variance that offsets this(hopefully we have not already taken it, I will 
look).  This means you will not have any actuals on it for FRED.  I will 
start looking for dec info you just requested.

Hi guys,

Here is a list of the deals that I've come across in the different books that 
still need to be flipped to the P& book by the end of today.

FT-CENT     

QU4059.1

FT-NORTHWEST

FT-ONTARIO

FT-WEST

GD-CENTRAL

NG-EXOTIC

QY3631.1

NG-PRICE

These were the only books that I found deals to be flipped.  I was looking 
for all deals that are to settle during March and April 2001 with ECC.  If 
you find any others that I might have missed, please flip them.  

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Thanks for all your 
help

Attached is the updated scores.  Please check your scores to verify 
accuracy.  As the scores stand now, Joey will win no matter what and the 
second place race is between Chuck and Wolfe.  If Arizona loses, Wolfe takes 
second and if Arizona wins, it goes to the tiebreaker.  The rest of us are 
out of it.  If you have 0 all the way out, it means you do not have any teams 
remaining.  By the way - nice score Lenhart(we will see if we can get you a 
charitable deduction for your $10).

Jeff and Kathy,

After much testing, the logic will be placed into production this evening 
that will book the two legs for the counterparties that have master 
agreements with ECC and hit a US product.  I have had Victor Guggenheim 
review the following deals in tagg stage but you may want to review as well 
and let me know if everything looks alright.

QT8025  Dynegy Canada
QT8034  TransCanada

This logic will create the two legs for the price and basis swaps when a 
counterparty with a master agreement with ECC hits a US product.  The first 
leg will be between ECC and the external counterparty and risk assigned to 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS.  The second leg is simply the flip from FT-US/CAND-ERMS to 
the appropriate US book (the book mapped at the product level).   These 
examples illustrate this logic.  This logic is also set up for the 40+ 
counterparties that have the master agreements with ECC.

If you see any problems with the example deals or in the logic described 
above, please call me before end of business today so we can stop this from 
going into production.  Please forward to you groups to inform them of the 
change.  Please let us immediately if something is not correct on these deals 
on Monday.

Thank you,
Dawn

What's up in the hood?  It sounds like you guys live in Compton instead of 
San Diego?  Make sure Emma starts packing when she starts kindergarten.  If 
she is strapped, she can shoot back at these SOBs.  Yet another reason Texas 
is better than Cali - we all have guns so no one shoots up schools because 
they know someone else has got heat and might put a cap in their ass.  

Do you guys want me to order you Jazz Fest tickets when I order ours?  I am 
putting in an order for alot of people because if I mail order them it only 
costs $3 total as opposed to ticket master's $3 fee per ticket.  Since I am 
ordering ours this way, I can order everyone's and they only pay the ticket 
price(I eat the $3 because I am doing ours this way anyway).  The tickets are 
$15 through the mail per day as opposed to $20 at the gate and $18 through 
ticketmaster.  Let me know.  I am ordering all three days for ashley and I 
hoping we go all three days.

Do you know the names of some good jazz clubs in Chicago?  I figure you spend

per Laura Luce, the director that is over all of the orig teams.  It is 
vitally important that we do two things with this file now.  We must fill in

sitting these days?  I am still on 32.  Talk to you soon.

Thanks anyway.  I have some information that Darron kept on Cilco, I am still 
having trouble finding any deals for 98 that can show me we definitely did or 
did not flash these deals wrong.  I am going to keep working on it.
PL

Per Laura's request, we have modified the orig schedule for Central.  I have 
attached the revised schedule.  Please note the following changes - on the 
1st tab - orig schedule, we added a column for deal value before origination 
was granted.  We will populate this field for all new deals as of yesterday.  
The other changes are the second tab.  The second tab provides a summary by 
originator of the total deals originated and total value originated.  We will 
update both schedules in the future for all deals originated whether value 
was originated or not.  We will then email this schedule to the three of you 
every time the schedule changes.  If you would prefer a hard copy, please let 
me know.

If there are any other changes or modifications you would like to see, please 
let me know.  Thanks.

it is now done.

FYI
The broker Amerex is no longer under the short name of AMERX in deal 
capture.  From this point on, the short name is AMERG, which stands for 
Amerex Natural Gas, Ltd.  AMERX will now default to Amerex Petroleum, which 
is incorrect.  Also, the broker Spectron is no longer SPECT.  The new short 
name is SPECI, which stands for Spectron Energy, Inc.

Hi 
If you've aleady received this, my  apologies. On the other hand, if not, 

please read and forward around the world. 

Nike now lets you personalize your shoes by submitting a word or  phrase 
which they will stitch onto your shoes, under the  swoosh. So Jonah 
Peretti 
filled  out the form and sent them $50 to stitch "sweatshop" onto his 
shoes. 

Here's the responses he got... fun and games with Nike...  

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *   
Your NIKE iD order was cancelled for one or more of the  following 
reasons: 

1) Your Personal iD contains another party's trademark  
2) Your Personal iD contains the name of an athlete or team we  do not 
have 
the legal right to  use 
3) Your Personal iD was left blank. Did you not want  any 
personalization? 
4) Your  Personal iD contains profanity or inappropriate slang, and 
besides, 
your mother would slap us.  
If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new  personalization 
please visit us again at  www.nike.com 

Thank you, NIKE iD 

Greetings, 

My order was canceled but my personal NIKE iD does not violate  any of 
the 
criteria outlined in  your message. The Personal iD on my custom ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes was the word  "sweatshop." 
Sweatshop is not: 
1) another's party's trademark, 
2) the name of an  athlete, 
3) blank, or 
4)  profanity. 

I choose the iD because I wanted to remember the toil and labor  of the 
children that made my shoes. Could you please  ship them to me 
immediately. 

Thanks and Happy New Year, Jonah Peretti 

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Your NIKE iD order was cancelled because the iD you have  chosen 
contains, as 
stated in  the previous e-mail correspondence, "inappropriate slang". 
If you wish to reorder your NIKE iD product with a new  personalization 
please visit us again at nike.com  

Thank you, NIKE iD 

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for your quick response to my inquiry about my custom  ZOOM XC 
USA 
running shoes.  Although I commend you for your prompt customer service, 
I 
disagree with the claim that my personal iD  was 
inappropriate slang. After consulting Webster's  Dictionary, I discovered 

that "sweatshop" is in fact part of standard English, and not  slang. 

The word means: "a shop or factory in which workers are employed  for 
long 
hours at low wages and  under unhealthy conditions" and its origin dates 
from  1892. So my personal iD does meet the criteria detailed in your 
first 
email. 

Your web site advertises that the NIKE iD program is "about  freedom to 
choose and freedom to express who you are." I  share Nike's love of 
freedom 
and  personal expression. The site also says that "If you want it 
done right...build it yourself." I was thrilled to be able to build  my 
own 
shoes, and my personal iD  was offered as a small token of appreciation 
for  
the sweatshop workers poised to help me realize my vision. I  hope that 
you 
will value my  freedom of expression and reconsider your decision to 
reject 
my order. 

Thank you, Jonah Peretti 

Dear NIKE iD Customer, 

Regarding the rules for personalization it also states on the  NIKE iD 
web 
site that "Nike  reserves the right to cancel any personal iD up to 24 
hours 
after it has been submitted". In addition,  it further explains: "While 
we 
honor most personal iDs, we cannot honor every one. 
Some may be (or contain) other's trademarks, or the names of  certain 
professional sports teams, athletes or  celebrities that Nike does not 
have 
the right to use. Others may contain material that we consider  
inappropriate or simply do not want to place on our  products. 
Unfortunately, at times this obliges us to  decline personal iDs that may 

otherwise seem unobjectionable. In any event, we will let you  know if we 

decline your personal iD, and we will offer you the chance to  submit 
another." With these rules in mind, we cannot  accept your order as 
submitted. If you wish to reorder  your NIKE iD product with a new 
personalization please  visit us again at www.nike.com 

Thank you, NIKE iD 

Dear NIKE iD, 

Thank you for the time and energy you have spent on my request.  I have 
decided to order the shoes with a different iD,  but I would like to make 
one 
small request. Could you please send me a color snapshot of the  
ten-year-old Vietnamese girl who makes my shoes? 

Thanks, 
Jonah Peretti 

As one forwarder writes: 

... this will now go round the world much farther and faster  than any of 
the 
adverts they  paid Michael Jordan more than the entire wage packet of all 

their sweatshop workers in the world to do... 

I normally avoid making a plea to pass on these things,  
but this time I say: 

JUST DO IT

If I do not get a tiebreaker from you and you tie for first, you will 
automatically get second and if you tie for second you are out of the money.  

Again, please verify your score and let me know of any discrepancies - 1 pt. 
first round victory, 2 pts. second round victory and upset gets seed 
differential.

Thanks everyone for playing.

We got them, the guy next to me was collecting and found them, I will send 
out an email later this morning with the scores.

FYI-
We need to be more careful with which of the two curves above we use for 
physical deals.  We have had some substantial OA for Jan 01 production 
because the basis curves for these two locations were .30 different.  Usually 
these are less than .05 different.  If you have a physical mich physical it 
should be Mich_cg-gd in tagg(which is michigan consolidated pipe in sitara), 
if it is consumers power, it will be mich/cons and cec pipe in sitara.  Any 
questions, ask.  Thanks.

I got the form from John with a note on it about lone liquidations.  This 
relates to a physical deal and I thought we went over the specifics 
yesterday.  This relates to 309136 for jan and 594576 for the remainder.  
This is a structured deal with John Griffith and we were unwinding a previous 
deal for 1/01-12/01, the remaining original term stayed intact.  It appears 
you are missing some liquidations that would remove this variance.  They are 
E00982.4 &.5.  

Please let me know if you have any more questions, this deal is a real pain 
in the butt.

OK - 
Here's the demographics on the south Florida voter - 

They can play 10 
bingo cards at a time and not miss a number. 

They can juggle 53 numbers and pick 6 for the Florida Lotto, as 
well 
as select their Pick 3, Fantasy Five, and Mega Ball numbers. 

They can read 5 papers, 4 scratch sheets, and handicap 3 horses in 
the 
Tri-fecta at the horse race. 

They can spot a shanked golf ball in an acre of elephant grass 
300 
yards away. 

They can eyeball a non-resident in a 1,000-unit subdivision at 
200 
yds. 

They can report a scarred manatee at 10 fathoms to the 
Greenpeace 
hotline. 

They can take 37 different colored pills every 
morning and never mess 
it up. 

But they can't read a 4-line 
ballot both published in the newspaper AND 

mailed to them a week in advance and pick one candidate... 

You 
figure it out !!! 

Suddenly Florida makes Alabama and 
Mississippi look like geniuses....

In order for EOL to support the Broker Client Application, we are requesting 
that EOL be removed from the broker field in Tagg on all previous EOL 
transactions.  We would like this "sweep" to be performed on Thursday 
evening, if possible.  What this means to end users is that they will no 
longer be able to query on the broker field to find EOL deals in Tagg.  The 
only way to search for EOL deals in the future will be to query on the EOL 
transaction number.

Please communicate this new procedure to your groups.  Also, I don't know if 
Ron/Joe cover the Canada confirmations, if not, please let me know who the 
confirmations contact is in Canada. 

Jeremy/Ron, please let me know if Thursday evening works for you to clean out

As Marina and I discussed this morning, accounting requests that we 
officialize several books weeks after they have been calced in order for them 
to run reports.  We do not officialize these post ids daily for two reasons: 
1) The deals in these post ids are related to transport hedges that are 
captured in our transport model(not in ERMS).  If we were to officialize 
these post ids and report them on the VAR, we would then be only capturing 
half of the picture, since the transport model in our P&L is not in ERMS.  2) 
All of the deals in these books are book to book and do not involve third 
parties.  

To keep this action from disrupting your group, the risk leads will forward 
an email to you when we officialize these post ids at accounting's request.  
The following is the list Rachel Crowell in Acctg. asked us to officialize on 
3/12/01:
1054100
1054684
1054685
1054686
1054689

Each month we (in accounting) pull the forward detail for the post ids which 
were officialized at month end.  For February 2001, these post ids are on the 
Report page in the FT Intra Ontario file but they are not officialized in 
RunM:

1054684

1054686
1054689

Were there other post ids which were officialized for these particular

Best regards,

due to firm book PMA's we recieve from Tiffany Miller.  In the future, we

Jeff,

I need your help with a few items.  In the DPR rolls for several books this 
month there were topside adjustments inserted.  It was my understanding that 
all topsides would be included on the associated roll schedules (Sch E and 
Sch C).  Investigating all of these is greatly increasing our reconciliation 
time.  Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.  Here are a few 
books that had topsides:

MTM Topsides that should have been on Schedule C
GD-Central
FT-Texas
FT-Central
Liquidation topsides that should have been on Schedule E
GD-Central
FT-Northwest
FT-Ontario

Let me know if you need more information or if there is anything we can do to 
help.  Thanks.

Thanks baby.

Sam-
Here is a little something about my grandfather:

 Dr Walter Herschel Burgess was a 1950 graduate of Alabama Polytechnic 
Institute, now Auburn University.  He practied vetinary medicine for 38 years 
in Haleyville, Alabama.  Dr. Burgess was blessed with 3 children, 2 
grandchildren and one great grandchild.  Dr. Burgess was an avid golfer and 
tremendous football fan.  He held Auburn football season tickets for 50 
years.  Dr. Burgess recently received the golden eagle from Auburn University 
in recognition of 50 years of alumni service.  Dr Burgess was a World War II 
veteran.  Dr. Burgess loved Auburn and sent all three of his children and 
both grandchildren to school on the plains.  Due to his love for Auburn that 
he instilled in his family, there will definitely be a forth generation 
Auburn graduate in the Burgess family.  Dr. Burgess was also a proud member 
of the OTS vetinary fraternity at Auburn University.  Dr. Burgess was born in 
Cullman County, Alabama and was a 50 year resident of Haleyville, Alabama.  

Please feel free to take some liberties and rearrange or omit some of the 
things I stated above.  Thanks again Sam for all of your help with this and 
the recognition this newsletter will give my grandfather.  Auburn is very 
fortunate to have such a great person raising money for the most important 
school within the University. Talk to you soon.

If you look in tagg, the sitara deal number is in the comments section - 
#372156.  If any of you guys want us to come up and show you how to use tagg 
or what we do to find these numbers, give me a shout.  The deal is 
liquidating in the Ontario book because the Ontario trader did the deal.  If 
that trader does a deal at a US point, the gas has to physically flow out of 
a US book, not a canadian book.  This deal is only for one month, so this 
will not make Jim Little's recurring list that he automatically transfers for 
you guys.  Let me know if you have any more questions.  I also got some 
message from Souad that you need some help with a People's deal.  She thought 
you said you emailed me on the deal and I do not have an email, let me know 
if you still need assistance with that issue.  Thanks.

Greetings All!

As most of you know, there is a Trader Web-site project initiative currently 
in progress to identify specific reports that traders have produced every day 
and to then automatically publish these reports to a web-site. 

We are in the initial stage of collecting requirements from the traders 
(identified by Steve Stock) to determine what reports and report information 
are to be submitted for publishing on a web-site.  Based on these 
discussions, the requirements listed below have been identified so far.  
Please review these requirements and let me know if you have any changes or 
additional requirements by EOB Tuesday, March 6.  Also, please forward all 
report templates, required report information, and security requirements for 
your region.  If you are not be able to provide this information by next 
Tuesday, please let me know. 

Trader Report Web-site Requirements:

1. Need a separate web-site developed and implemented (in the same manner 
that the Executive Report Viewer project, which is   being handled by Zhiyong 
Wei's team)
2. Web-site to be available 24 hours a day X 7 days a week
3. There are 5 Risk Regions: East, West, Central, Texas, and Financial
4. Each person leads a region as follows:
 Kam Keiser   / East Risk Region
 Darron Giron   / West Risk Region
 Phillip Love  / Central Risk Region
 David Baumbach  / Texas Risk Region
 Errol McLaughlin / Financial Risk Region
5. Jeff Gossett is the Project Lead for Traders
6. There are several traders within each region
7. Security -  All traders should have access within their own region.  
Security will need to be set up to only view each trader's  respective region 
(or any additional regions identified).  Security requirements need to be 
defined and documented by  each region lead, listing the name of each person 
that will be able to view what particular region/s reports.
8. All reports are currently in Excel and need a macro to export to the new 
web-site (formulas are within the spreadsheets).   Required reports are to be 
identified by each region lead, with sample report templates. 
9. A total of 15 reports are needed now and need more room for additional 
reports to be added in the future
10. Reports are to be automatically exported daily (reports are run each 
night) and to be published with "view only" capabilities on  the web-site
11. History - Need to maintain 30 days of history, and also every last day of 
each month beginning (starting from) 1/01/01 and  forward 

I will be meeting with Zhiyong next week to discuss these requirements, and I 
will schedule project meetings as needed going forward.    
Please contact me if you have any questions or need additional information.  
Thank you for your input and support!!

IN THE NEWS..."Kids Find Contested Ballot to be Child's Play,"
The Shreveport Times, by Don Walker

"It's a ballot that perplexed Florida voters but was no match for the wits
of first- and fourth-graders at Stockwell Elementary School in Bossier City.

"Disillusioned and upset by the lingering chaos of this week's presidential
election, fourth-grade teacher Lisa Burns pulled a sample of the
controversial Palm Beach County, Fla., ballot off the Internet on Thursday.
She then put her class of 9- and 10-year-olds to the test.  'I gave them a
ballot and had them take a blue marker to vote for Al Gore and a red marker
to vote for George Bush. Then I had them put their name on the bottom of the
ballot and turn it in.'

"Turns out this election was mere child's play. Not one of the 22 students
present in class Thursday was confused by the ballot. Each one was marked
without error.

"Well, if a fourth-grader could do it, how about a first-grader? Down the
hall in Stacey Robinson's class, the ballot was handed out to 6- and
7-year-olds. Robinson used an overhead projector to point out Gore's name,
then asked the class of 24 students to find his bubble on the punch-card
ballot.

"'It wasn't a vote,' Robinson said. 'I just wanted to experiment to see if
they could find the correct bubble.'

"When the ballots were turned in, 19 of the first-graders marked the correct
bubble for Gore, three picked Buchanan's bubble, one picked Bush's and one
marked the bottom bubble for the 'Natural Law' party.

"'If a first-grader can choose the correct bubble, there's no legitimate
claim. Anyone could have done it,' Robinson said. 'A grown adult who took
any time at all could find it.'

"Still, even in a first-grade classroom, vote tabulations were the subject
of protest and controversy. 'I thought we were voting,' Brady McCoy, 6, of
Haughton grumbled after he was told to find and punch the 'Gore' bubble. 'I
wanted to vote for George Bush!'"
 

just a little out of my price range.

you going to vegas in two weeks?

Please make sure to follow this.  I will try to get access to at least one 
person per desk during these hours.  I'll let you know.

	
	                           
	

Due to the significant amount of activity on EnronOnline, and the large 
number of users logged into the system during peak trading hours, please 
inform your respective teams that they should not use the EnronOnline 
applications (Reports, Product Manger, Profile Manager, and Data Manager) 
between the hours of 7:30am and 10:00am.  Only those actions that are 
absolutely critical should be performed (i.e. credit headroom adjustments, 
etc.).  

The IT group is reviewing the database in an attempt to make our queries more 
efficient, but until further notice, these guidelines should be followed.

Please call me if you have any questions.
Thanks-

I only flashed 41K for sithe, where are you getting the 59K?  I have the 
files for nov in the location you requested.  Thanks.
PL

we will take all of the amounts in the proposed adjustment categories for 
Sithe and People's.  i still have the people's forms and will be trying to 
get through them today or tomorrow.
PL

Kam had told me you were in.  We only have three in our room - you, goss and 
myself.  The room will be $200 per person total.  You can pay me when we get 
there or when we leave or send me a check in the mail.  I have only paid one 
night deposit.  I get in about 7:45 Vegas time on Wednesday, if you are 
getting there before me, let me know so that I can get the hotel your name to 
check in.  See you there.

Please let me know if you have any questions

 

I am happy that neither of those two things is a possibility.
PL

The only thing that I can find is Sitara #575092.  This is the only August 01 
deal we have with them.  This volume and price do not match up.  Sylvia does 
not recall the deal they describe and  has no paper work for it.  ANR Lebanon 
Ohio does not sound familiar.  The only thing that I can think of is that 
they send us a confirmation letter/or transcript from the tapes.  If they can 
prove to us a time and who they talked to we can then pull our tapes.  Let me 
know how I can further assist you.  Sorry.

I just came across a counterparty that needs to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book for all deals in Houston books.  ECC has now signed a 
Master Swap Agreement with Aquila Canada Corp., and all deals traded with ENA 
and Aquila Canada Corp. need to be settled with ECC in the P& book.  These 
deals are showing up in TAGG as settling with ENA, could you all please keep 
an eye out for deals with this company and flip them right away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks

All of these deals are yours except the last one.

the price is fixed.

Sorry for losing my cool with you earlier.  I have had a difficult few weeks

The tickets for HOB will go on sale around next wednesday.  I will call and 
get them.  I am starting to get pumped as well.  Luckily I have a trip to 
Vegas in March that will hold me over.  

I need to find my hand hacky sack so we will have a back up plan.  I have a 
couple of new chairs in a bag for us - full lounge chairs.  They even have 
beer holders in the arms.  
PL

P, we are getting close. Did the Tickets go on sale  for any of the concerts 
at the House of Blues?

Ontario 0011 synthetic storage:
QA1354.2 is offset by QA1354.4 - this apears to be missing from this line.
QA1354.5 is offset by QA1354.6 - also missing from this line.
What are the last two numbers for this line (2,032,081) & 166,921 - these are 
note in the notes.
Thanks.

Ontario:
Can you give me the details on the interdesk purchase variance $346K fir 
0010.  i.e. what desk the variance is with.  We will take the MtM prior month

CPR variance for 0011?  Thanks.

We will take the MTM variance for 0010 - 441K - this is partially offset by 
Central's variance.  This is related due to the changing fo the transport 
book from GD-Central to Intra-Ontario.
PL

we will take the aurora 310K variance - looks like the deal was flipped out 
for 09 & 10 2000.  THanks.
PL

Please take the variances through 0009 to the desk.  Thanks.
PL

All of our documentation says 4.78.  If they want to pay us a penny more, I 
will take it.  I changed the price for January.  If this same problem arises 
again in Feb, let me know.  I am curious why they agreed with 4.78 for 
nov-dec.  
PL

yes goofy.  Already taken care of.
PL

We can take the 265k if you find that we already took the existing variances.
PL

   
	
	

Phillip, 

I can reclass this to synthetic storage.  It looks like we may have netted 
the pre-existing synthetic storage valance with some other variances and 
taken it to the desk in the October,November time frame....

Phillip M Love
02/16/2001 09:21 AM
Also, in 0006 theres is a synthetic deal identified as NN4016 with NNG for 
$265K, this deal is in sitara 301891 under CPR Pipeline storage. The terms 
match and we should have no variance.  Please ask Gas accounting why we do 
not have a variance on synthetic line - probably Jim Pond.  Thanks.
PL

We will take the NGPL variances.
PL

   
	
	

The Aurora liquidation tagg is N65007.2

The NGPL variance is primarily the following:
                                                           
N50101.X                   2,221.50

NQ1900.1               (15,596.02)

0008 Lone liquidations can you please get the tagg number for the aurora 
liquidation tsf from the East
Is the NGPL purchase variance for roughly $109K part of the the N50101 - syn 
storage?

 WPS liquidation NV8650.1 is a option premium that is being paid on sitara 
#384296 12/00-2/01.  This liquidation needs to be seperated out to its own 
line and split accordingly along the months 12/00 & 01/01 - $116,250 and 2/01 
$105,000.  We should get oa forms on this deal for these months that this 
liquidation will offset.
Take remaining $7K
Thanks.
PL
 

Aurora N65007.2 0008 lone liquidation belongs to sitara #307241.  We should 
have had a form on this.  The deal came to the desk at mid and would require 
a liquidation.  You should have a variance on your compare reports.  If not, 
please have settlements get you a copy of the invoice for 0008 and we will do 
a form.  Thanks.

I think Ashley sent Fab some info on the fest.  We have had to lock into the 
rooms last week, so I do not know if we will be able to help her get a room 
unless they still have some available when she makes a decision.  

Sorry to hear about your work life stinking.  I definitely know the feeling.  
The way I rationalize it is that I will take a job that has better hours 
before Jackson gets into school.  

On a happier note, we are going to dinner with your parents this weekend.  
Should be fun.  Talk to you soon - don't work too hard.

Hey Phillip.....I am on a plane back to St. Paul (Sunday night).  My life
completely (other than Jason and Drew) sucks right now.  I can not wait
until this project is done and over with.  I have reached the point of
thinking about quitting.  Funny how only 5 weeks ago my career counselor
asked me regarding that same question...and I had zero intention.

Anyhow, I spoke with Fabiola..and she is still interested in coming out to
Jazz Fest....and was curious in speaking with you and/or Ashley about
rooms.  She is not 100%...but is curious in talking with you re:
possibilities.  Her email is fabiola_rock@hotmail.com...and her cell number
is 617-515-6760.

Give the little one love for me...

We will take the variance on Central back page for approx. $791K for prior 
month book balance in 1100.  1100 was the first month that we switched the 
central transport flash from GD central to Intra Ontario so we flashed it 
incorrectly.  Thanks.
PL

thanks for the info.
PL

Per reconciliation with TAGG, I have changed this price to be IF/NNG/VENT - 
.03.  If you have any more questions, please let me know.  Please let me know 
what the increased invoice amount was for 11/00 & 12/00.  Thanks.

I will attend.

We will take the DPR/Consolidated flash variance of 259K expense.  Thanks
PL

We will take this variance to the desk then.

Ok, Phillip, here's the story I was given by Jim Little, you tell me if it 
makes sense.  In January this liquidation was out of the intra-month book.  
Sometime betwen January and August, the liquidation was changed to the  
FTbook and we don't liquidate out of the FT book, so the expected offset 
didn't happen.

Phillip M Love
02/16/2001 01:10 PM
I am curious why N70012.Q is a variance in 0001 and N70012.R is not a 
variance in 0008.  If you look in the two fred files, 0001 has the liq 
flashed and not in the GL, and in 0008 the liquidation is in flash and the 
GL.  The counterparties in both are the same.  Jim needs to revise 0001 
file.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks.
PL

Just wanted to let you know that we are having global counterparties in 
Houston inactivate the spot contract we have with Sunoco Inc so that anyone 
that tries to book a deal to this entity wil have to get a contract in place 
or get this one reactivated.  This difficulty should send up a red flag and 
keep deals from flowing with this counterparty.  Please let me know if you 
need any further information.  Thanks.

Kam,

Thanks for the feedback.  I have corrected the column width issue in the 
attached template.  Please let me know if you find any other issues as you 
begin to use the template. 

Thanks,
Greg (37299)

I am going to try and capture the accomplishments I feel are relevant.  
Hopefully you will agree:
1.  Cleaned up oustanding Ontario operational analysis variances that 
extended up to 18 mos. of age
2.  Assisted in the transition of the ontario book to a US book
3. Resolved roughly 5 million in operational analysis variances due to 
synthetic storage
4.  Assisted in the training of new team members
5. Assisted in the modification of the Operational Analysis process(phase 2 
requirements and form completion)
6. Survived first six months in risk

PL

can you please get this right.

Military Courtesy Change
Government News Keywords: MILITARY COURTESY TO THE PRESIDENT Source: CNN
Posted on 02/15/2001 11:44:53 PST by Hurtgen
This morning CNN showed George W. leaving HM-1. The marine at the front step
saluted, GW returned it, and as he walked away, the marine executed a right
face to stand facing GW's back...something that was missing in eight years
of the Clinton presidency.
The traditional Marine Corps mark of respect was rendered to the new
president. That one goes back to the days in the rigging, when the marine
orderly to the ship's captain always faced him, no matter his direction of
movement, to be ready to receive an order.
Who says that enlisted men can't hold back when they don't respect someone?
..And for eight years, they did.

I have made a slight revision to the template regarding CPR Cash In and CPR  
Cash Out for consistency between Accounting, OA, and Economics.  

OA CODE 15 CASH IN  SALE
OA CODE 14 CASH OUT PURCHASE

Please replace the previous template with the one below.  

Thank You ,

Please replace your physical tabs in your P&L to the file format attached=

I am meeting monthly with each person in my group to go over their training 
plans and get feedback on things they would like assistance with.  I need to 
still meet with Souad for this month and need to get with Anna and go over 
the information that I have given her.  One thing that seems to have come up 
several times is the desire to continue the brown bag sessions.  Some topics 
that have come up are OA and  curve mapping.  I have talked with Kam about 
this and we are going to try and put something together.
PL

Sorry guys, this slipped my mind today, will you please email Joe hunter this 
information today before you calc.  Thanks.

Sorry for the late notice on this one.  
Can you provide MTM values as of Dec 29, 2000, for the short name of CROSS 
TIMBERS.

Thanks again,
Joe Hunter

To me, this looks to be a sign problem in the FRED model.  The variance in 
all cases is exactly double the flashed amount.  Jim please verify if this is 
correct.  Thanks.
PL

I wanted to pass along some items I would be interested in for Brown Bags:
Options
Greeks
End of month procedures

Thanks
PL

Looks good to me. - I noticed a note on an ECC purchase - Q29840 - sitara 
killed, the wrong sitara number is on that tagg - the correct number is 
430538.  I made the change in tagg.  The transcanada liquidation that are not 
highlighted are the exchange deals that are not showing up in the GL.  This 
is the huge problem that seems to not ever get resolved.
PL

Thanks again for your help this weekend.  I enjoyed hanging out with you.

This evening, the new improved bridge monitor will be migrated to the EOL 
production environment.  Several new enhancements were created to make this 
application more efficient.  Such as:

1.  The bridge will handle 20 messages/second, instead of processing 1 
message/second.
2.  The screens will no longer jump around! (Yeah)  You can select and view a 
transaction without having the screen update with new deals.
3.  Historical deal query - ability to select and process historical dates 
very quickly.
4.  Sorting capability - you can query any of the eight column headers by 
selecting the column and typing a risk book, trans. id, deal capture system, 
etc. and it  will filter to that section.

Please forward this e-mail to your groups.  If you have any questions or 
concerns with the new bridge monitor please contact me at 3-9353 or Tara at 
3-4523.  We hope this helps, I know it has made our lives easier while 
testing.  Also, feedback is much appreciated!

Thanks,
Dawn

Hey Phillip.....I am on a plane back to St. Paul (Sunday night).  My life
completely (other than Jason and Drew) sucks right now.  I can not wait
until this project is done and over with.  I have reached the point of
thinking about quitting.  Funny how only 5 weeks ago my career counselor
asked me regarding that same question...and I had zero intention.

Anyhow, I spoke with Fabiola..and she is still interested in coming out to
Jazz Fest....and was curious in speaking with you and/or Ashley about
rooms.  She is not 100%...but is curious in talking with you re:
possibilities.  Her email is fabiola_rock@hotmail.com...and her cell number
is 617-515-6760.

Give the little one love for me...

take the cilco 44K from 0003
PL

I am curious why N70012.Q is a variance in 0001 and N70012.R is not a 
variance in 0008.  If you look in the two fred files, 0001 has the liq 
flashed and not in the GL, and in 0008 the liquidation is in flash and the 
GL.  The counterparties in both are the same.  Jim needs to revise 0001 
file.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks.
PL

The desk will take the lone liquidations for 0007 - $130K
PL

 
 - 15call.jpg

Take the variance for 0006 lone liq - $31K
PL

That is what I had for your address, just checking.  We had a blast with your 
uncles as well.  We were wqanting Bobby, Carl and John's adresses.  I guess 
we also need there wifes names, even though we did not meet them at the 
wedding.  I don't know what we will do when your parents leave houston.  I 
guess we will have to make more frequent trips to Denver.  Since I have a 
small family and Ashley is so far from her family, it is nice to have special 
friends that you consider family.   Plus, you know how special you have 
always been and will be to me.

Sounds like work is going great, glad to hear it.  Sad to hear you are 
working my kind of hours now.  Work is the same for me, learning a lot, but 
counting the days till my rotation to a new group.

Talk to you soon.
PL

When are you coming down to Auburn?  Your brother and I are going tonight and 
may set up the tent on Friday.
PL

0008 Lone liquidations can you please get the tagg number for the aurora 
liquidation tsf from the East
Is the NGPL purchase variance for roughly $109K part of the the N50101 - syn 
storage?

 WPS liquidation NV8650.1 is a option premium that is being paid on sitara 
#384296 12/00-2/01.  This liquidation needs to be seperated out to its own 
line and split accordingly along the months 12/00 & 01/01 - $116,250 and 2/01 
$105,000.  We should get oa forms on this deal for these months that this 
liquidation will offset.
Take remaining $7K
Thanks.
PL
 

0009 Lone Liquidations:
NU2698.2 is an EMW liquidation and goes with Sitara #359527, tsf this to the 
EMW line should clear both variances.
We need to take the Phillip's liquidation just like 0010 - deal killed
Desk will also take the remaining $1,500 variance
PL

0010 Lone Liquidations:
Phillips N45554.3 is a take to the desk, deal was killed in sitara
PGL&C should be transferred to the Peoples desk - tagg has the book as 
FT-Peoples.
Take remaining variance.
PL

0011 Lone liquidation variances:
CES-Dynegy - these tagg numbers are EFP deals and we had variances show up in 
forms and we should have used these to clear.
ECS - this tagg number has a sitara deal - 309408 that did not flow.  The gas 
that was suppossed to flow on this deal, flowed on 310637 - Northern 
Natural.  This tagg should be part of that variance for settlements. 
Reliant Energy - that is a synthetic storage deal that flowed, sitara 
#456560, again, no variance to the desk.
Move WPL variance to its own line and we will take the remaining variance to 
the desk.

Let me know if you need further info on this category.
PL

Also, in 0006 theres is a synthetic deal identified as NN4016 with NNG for 
$265K, this deal is in sitara 301891 under CPR Pipeline storage. The terms 
match and we should have no variance.  Please ask Gas accounting why we do 
not have a variance on synthetic line - probably Jim Pond.  Thanks.
PL

We will also take the interdesk variance for 0011 - $123K
PL

looks like my boy.

We need to keep this for Jackson.

The Paul Harvey Philosophy

These things I wish  for each of you.....
We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that  we made them worse.
For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like  for them to know 
about hand-me
down clothes and homemade ice cream and  leftover meatloaf sandwiches. I 
really would. I hope you learn humility by being  humiliated, and that you 
learn honesty by being cheated.

I hope you learn  to make your bed and mow the lawn and wash the car. And I 
really
hope nobody  gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen.

It will be good if at  least one time you can see puppies born and your old 
dog put to
sleep. I hope  you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in.

I hope you  have to share a bedroom with your younger brother. And it's all 
right if  you
have to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he wants to  crawl 
under the
covers with you because he's scared, I hope you let him. When  you want to 
see a movie
and your little sister wants to tag along, I hope  you'll let her.

I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your  friends and that you live 
in a
town where you can do it safely. On rainy days  when you have to catch a 
ride, I hope
you don't ask your 'driver' to drop you  two blocks away so you won't be seen 
riding
with someone as uncool as your  Mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad
teaches you how to make one  instead of buying one.

I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read  books. When you learn to use 
computers,
I hope you also learn to add and  subtract in your head.

I hope you get teased by your friends when you  have your first crush on a 
girl, and
when you talk back to your mother that  you learn what Ivory soap tastes like.

May you skin your knee climbing a  mountain, burn your hand on a stove and 
stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.  I don't care if you try a beer once, 
but I hope you don't like it. And if a  friend offers you dope or a joint, I 
hope you realize he is not your  friend.

I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandma and  go fishing 
with your Uncle.

May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy  during the holidays.

I hope your Mother punishes you when you throw a  baseball through a 
neighbor's
window and that she hugs you and kisses you at  Christmas time when you give 
her a mold of your hand.

These things I wish  for you: tough times and disappointment, hard work and 
happiness.
To me, it's  the only way to appreciate life.

Send this to all of your friends that  mean the most to you but, don't send 
it back to
whoever sent it to you. They  have already read it and you don't need to show 
them that you are a good friend.  They already know!

"We secure our friends not by accepting favors but by  doing them."

Paul Harvey - "Good Day"!

The feeling is mutual.  Things are going good, even better if I could get out 
of here at a decent time.  At least I don't have Susan's hours.  Are you 
coming to her happy hour tonight?  Talk to you soon.
PL

   

He got dairy queen coupons?  Mine wasn't even that good?

told it should have just been some dairy queen coupons.

liquidations coded in puke green, bright pink, blood red and blue.  These 
items will resolve our variance within 60K.  We will take the 60K expense.  
Please try and resolve those issues before close of 0201.  Let me know if you 
get resistance or need help.  Thanks.
PL

Can either of the two distinguished Jim's from accounting help me with a 
financial liquidation problem from 0007.  I have a deal NR2989.1 that is 
showing up in my actuals for the beloved FRED file for this production 
month.  When I look at the deal in TAGG, the deal is an annuity booked to 
NG-Price.  I do not believe this should be in the central region.  Any 
assistance in clearing this is much appreciated due to the fun meeting we had 
yesterday regarding financial liquidations.  Thanks for your help guys.  
Cathy this should clear/address all of our issues in 0007 for fin. liq.
PL

As is the case will all FT-Ontario deals done at a US point, the deal must 
flow physically from a US book eventhough the canadian trader gets the long 
term income/loss from the deal.  This is a commercial decision that risk has 
to abide by.  The OA group, specifically John Valdes has given Jim Little the 
deal numbers in the past that comprise this problem to eliminate repeat 
performances.  This deal in question began in 11/00 and since you are doing 
december OA I would assume this one has not yet made the list.  I suggest 
forwarding to Jim LIttle/John Valdes to eliminate future problems.  Thanks.
PL

FYI, 
Please book all future GD priced tiered deals as two deals in sitara.  The 
reason for this is eventhough we put a swap on the deal for the volume that 
should be at index, the swap looks at the volume as a monthly volume as 
opposed to a daily and gives the monthly volume to the desk at mid.  What 
typically happens is the total volume for the first half of the month comes 
to the desk entirely at mid.  This is causing some substantial OA variances.  
If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

Attached is the updated spreadsheet, which provides the additional 
information that you requested.  The Region Code for each book and your 
previous evaluation of the book status' have been included.  I hope this will 
help your group more easily identify which books are theirs.  As you are 
aware, Sally considers this a high priority project.  I would appreciate it 
if you could return this spreadsheet to me by Wednesday, the 14th.  

Please refer to the previous memo about the rules for each field that needs 
to be updated.  If you have any questions, please call me at x33102.

Thanks for your help on this.

Hey...it looks like we aren't going to be able to make it.  Jason told me
to go with girlfriends.....and I really thought about it.  I remembered
that I had a wedding in April (girl at my wedding from Tampa) and found out
yesterday that it is April 21.  So..if I am traveling every week and am in
Tampa the 21 (Jason is not going)..and then Jazz Fest the following
week...it will be three weeks that I don't see him.  I just don't think
that is a wise move on my part.  Although I really want to go!!

Does this put you in a weird bind re: not enough people in the rooms, etc.?
If it does, please let me know.  I know Fabiola was leaning on going...so
maybe I could follow-up with her.

I am the last one to have a problem with people throwing balls around.  
However,  Frank Vickers had a client from another firm here today and people 
were shooting baskets while the clients were looking on.  I'm sure 
professionalism is not the first thing they thought of as they were watching 
this.  While it is important that everyone have fun,  it is more important 
that we are a seen as a professional organization.  We are on the same floor 
as the originators and therefore there will be many clients coming through 
here in the future.  It would be a shame not to get business because someone 
in our group was firing jumpers.  Thanks for your help in ensuring that this 
doesn't happen again.

I got an update from Bryce.  In the back of the publication for 1/2/01(page 
7), there are prices for the 30th & 31st.  It appears the 30th & 31st got pub 
posted at the first page of the 1/2/01 publication.  Therefore, we are going 
to see OA on these deals.

FYI,
I wanted to let you guys know of an OA problem that I am seeing on the 
central desk for december 2000.  It appears deals that are gas daily priced 
deals are being priced incorrectly in Unify.  Two gas daily publications came 
out at the end of the year.  The publication on the 29th was for trans. dated 
the 28th and flowing the 29th.  The next gas daily publication  came out on 
the 2nd of Jan. and was for trans. 29th flowing the 1st adn 2nd.  We flashed 
gas daily prices for the 30th & 31st that equalled the GD publication of the 
2nd.  This is correct, we should pay sat. and sunday based on Monday's 
price.  Settlements paid the 30th & 31st at the 29th's price.  I am going to 
give Bryce a call, I just wanted to share this with you since you should be 
seeing OA forms starting today for Dec production.  If you disagree with my 
logic, please give me a shout. Thanks.

Just wanted to give you guys a reminder when it comes to new deals out of our 
traders notebooks.  Please check each morning when you copy the new deals for 
the current day that you verify the prior day's last deal was entered.  It is 
very easy to miss a deal the trader does after four and the trader's do not 
always remind us that they did a deal late.  I spoke with hunter this morning 
and he wants these mistakes to stop.  This doesn't happen often, put it is 
very easy to miss these types of deals in the future.  Thanks for your help.
PL

Please email me with requests for central deals.  Thanks.

A Texas grad I work with found this on one of his alum sites.  The guy that

funny.

I would say track it down with volume mgmt.  As far as I can tell, this deal 
ended 12/31/00.
PL

Please inactivate the FT-INT-CNT-TRAN book in TAGG.  All of the sub books 
associated with this should also be inactivated, i.e. Price, Basis, Index and 
GD.  The trader responsible for these books has been gone for over 6 months 
and all the deals in that book have now rolled off.  If you need any further 
information, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks for your help.

I think I have 35,000 continental miles also.  I think that it is only 20,000 
for a free flight.  You decide.
PL

The $33.82 rate I was qouted was after tax.  I specifically asked this 
question on the phone and at the airport.  Not a good way to do business.

Kulic starting tomorrow.

These deals are not even on my desk.  All but the physical forward belong to 
the Price Desk.  the physical foward is a Texas desk deal.  You should 
contact the leads of those two risk groups - Errol McLaughlin and Dave 
Baumbach respectively.  Sorry I can't help.
PL

Thanks for your prompt assistance with these books.

Brian McKnight isn't too bad either.  Although, overall, I was nto that 
impressed with the schedule this year for either weekend.  I wil however 
still have the best weekend of the year.
PL

he is taking his.  There is a pc on the desk next to kam already.
PL

I got this from elizabeth.  IF you really want to change the date let me 
know, it is scheduled for next Friday.  When the move occurs, we can take the 
PC on palmer's new desk and move it to mick's old desk.  I will move that.

EY3999.E is a northeast deal.  If you look in teh liquidation file under 
peoples sales, you will see this liquidation.  The point in tagg is a

Phillip M Love
02/05/2001 03:08 PM
Ruth, I wanted to give you the details of how we placed these numbers in 
Sithe's P&L.

1.  Instead of reducing the purchase price in Sitara(we would capture this 
revenue in the P&L in two months with OA, we want to complete the transaction 
in the current P&L) we have written a physical annuity between ENA and Sithe 
Power QP7914.2.  Please settle this with January's physical purchase.
2.  Sithe then receives 50% of this incremental revenue, this was booked in a 
financial annuity QP7914.1, this should also be settled with January's 
invoices.
3.  We have placed the Power portion of the revenue in  Schedule B in the 
FT-Ontario book(this is due to the Sithe P&L limitations, we will be 
modifying the book set up for any future deals such as this).  A financial 
annuity was then written between Sithe and Ontario to recognize the schedule 
B item in the sithe book and keep Ontario flat(TAGG#QP7914.3).
4.  The final $550,919 was then granted out to you via origination from the 
FT-Ontario book(same reasons as above) and an annuity was then written to the 
FT-Ontario book to keep it flat.(TAGG#QP7914.4).

These four deals in TAGG will keep the sithe book flat and should accomplish 
the goals of your email below.  If you have any questions or concerns, please 
feel free to contact me at 3-7376.  Thanks.
PL

   

Kam--

There was a typo for the gas volume that was used in Stacey's worksheet
to calculate the gas price.  The original spreadsheet had 11,240 Dth/day
and a gas price of $11.126/ Dth.  When you use the correct volume of
22,263 Dth/day, the gas price drops to $5.6172 for Day 1 in the attached
file.  This corrects the double-counting I told you about this morning. 

The spreadheets you sent to me calculate the power keep whole expense
on the "Gas Price" sheet.  On the sheet, it is the sum of $3,880,560 ( i.e. 
the correct
number if Day 31 is actualized rather than estimated by the power curves).

Unfortunately, Stacey's calculation does not include the transport commodity
savings, the tax expense and the amount of sharing due Sithe.  Those numbers
were provided in my memo on Friday.  If we do one of these deals again, we 
can provide Stacey with the additional expenses and revenues so that it can
be perfect calculation.  

Call me if there are any questions,

Ruth

what is the word on the tickets?  Have you heard from your older brother?  I 
think he is planning on spending the night at my house tomorrow, but I have 
not heard from him.

Sounds like fun man.  Do you ever do any bay fishing?  If you want to, let me

There were two negative originations in the central gas daily book.  One in 
August for $489,600 and one in Sept for $258,000.  The GDCentral book got the 
credit/income for these through our top level origination entries.  

Thanks,

Misty and/or Todd

Are you aware that the Central desk is expecting negative originations for 
July through September to cover demand reimbursement on Natural Gas Pipeline 
for July through September?

Thanks,
Cathy
	
	

Originations are not booked to the GL.  They are entered in the CS module of 
SAP by the portfolio group.  Jim L. then incorporates them in his OA's.  
Misti Day or Todd Warwick would be the one to contact.

   
	
	

Jim

It is my understanding that the Central desk is expecting negative 
originations to cover demand reimbursements for Natural Gas Pipeline for July 
through September 2000.  The amount is approximately $300,000 per month.  Are 
you aware of this and is there anything I can do to help clear this variance?

I've shown Sherry Dawson a quick way of finding deals that might be missed in

Hey Phillip-

I am really sorry to hear about your grandfather.  It must have taken alot
of courage to say the eulogy, and I am sure that your grandfather would
have been proud.  If you do want to talk about it in "real life" please
call.  I am on a plane to St. Paul for the next three days, but can be
reached on my cell phone.  That number is 303.669.2296.  I am glad that I
was able to give you some sort of peace, even if it was in a dream.  I
always hate to hear someone I care about is hurt, especially when I can't
do anything about it.

Easter is only 2 1/2 months away........

My grandfather actually passed away on Thursday afternoon and we had the

Hey Phillip-

I talked with Jason...and I think we have to lean towards not this year.
We (Jason, Drew, I) are coming home for Easter weekend (April 15) and
staying for appx. 5 days.  We can probably only do one....and have already
promised Drew that we would take him to Houston (he's never been).  If I
were single, or w/o child I would be all over it!!

Hope everything turns out ok in Alabama....I'm thinking of you.

Man, I wish you could have made it to the reunion.  We had a really good time 
and it was good to see everybody.  What are you doing in Norway for a job?  I 
am still enjoying Enron.  I am headed to Auburn this weekend for our last 
home game of the season.  Should be fun.  If we make it over to Europe any 
time soon, we will look you up.  We will probably wait until Jackson is a 
little older so that he will enjoy it more.  How is your Pop doing?  I bet he 
hates having you so far away.  Did you purchase a new bronco when you got to 
Europe or have the old one shipped over?  Boy did we cruise in that thing.  
Stay in touch.
PL

I have no seat for him until Feb 15th when Palmer leaves.  I will see what I 
can find out in terms of Kam moving.
PL

After meeting with Larry Joe Hunter, we will not be granting tagg access to 
his group.  They were wanting access to change deals that were booked to the 
wrong counterparty.  The problem here lies in that they were wanting to do 
these changes in the afternoon while we were calcing.  This is not an option.

Therefore, the resolution is we are responsible for these corrections.  We 
must get the deals entered into the system with the correct counterparty 
initially.  Our credit risk exposure is the bottom line. If we do not have 
all the deals to the right counterparty each day, we may not be receiving 
enough money on Letter of Credit from CP's.  FYI, this is going to be a 
highly visible area for us to make mistakes.  If we continue to make these 
mistakes, we as a group will catch severe fire.  To help us do this 
correctly, Bianca will be handing out a revised and updated counterparty list 
on a monthlly basis.  We will still have emails sent denoting CP name 
changes, I reccomend writing these down on your sheets to keep for future 
reference.  If all else fails and there is something you are not sure about, 
please call Bianca Ornelas at  5-3782.

If you have any questions, please give me a shout.  Thanks.
PL

I have forwarded this message to Global Facilities, they set up locations, 
after they set up the location, then we can map the curves.

Can you please set this new location up, Nipsco/NGPL, with curves the same as 
the original point, NGPL/Nipsco.  I believe they are as follows: gas daily 
should be GDP-CHI. GATE, the intramonth should be NGI/CHI. GATE, and the Mid 
should be NGI/CHI./NIPSCO.

Please shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help.
PL

	
	

Phillip, Please move the following two deals from their current location, 
NGPL/Nipsco, to a new location Nipsco/NGPL.  We are setting up Nipsco as it's 
own pipeline so as to better track positions. Please make the change 
effective Feb. 1.

Thanks, George

I deleted the file.

Tell you what Chad, you win.  I really am tired of banging my head against a 
wall talking to an irrational person.  I was not trying to make fun of your 
school, you chose that route.  I was trying to make a simple point that 
recruiting at Enron does not make a school elite.  Does NASA recruit at LSU?  
Does IBM?  Who cares? The point once again, we were talking about SPORTS!!!!  
See you in Baton Rouge in September.  Go ahead and respond, so that way you 
have the "last word".

This should have been cc to you.  I think development made a mistake and cc

Thank you.

Ashley and I need your address again and your uncles' addresses for Christmas 
cards.

How is married life treating you?  Good I hope.  What are you guys doing for 
Christmas?  Are your folks coming in?

We are staying in Houston.  Should be nice and quiet.  We are going to have a 
few people over for new year's, but nothing special.
PL

I plan on attending.
PL

Did you not hear me.  I said I was talking athletics.  Do you want me to 
break out academics with you?  I will be more than happy to discuss Auburn.  
Top 15 schools for your money, US News & World Report.   Behind the service 
academies, more astronauts than any other university.  Top ten among 
universities in terms of fortune 500 CEO's, Fortune Magazine.  

The point, don't try and act like LSU is the best school in the land.  Just 
because Enron doesn't recruit at some schools, doesn't mean they are inferior 
academically.  I would much rather have a degree from Tulane than LSU or 
Auburn, in terms of academic stature.  You should know that recruiting at 
Enron has and will always be political.  You have to have someone from that 
school in upper managment request trips be made.  I can promise you in the 
next 2-3 years they will be recruiting at Auburn.  I and anothe alum have 
already discussed it with HR. 
PL
 

I responded, I just did not copy anyone.
PL

Please do not try and compare Louisiana to Alabama.  There is only one 
university in Louisiana.  You can not hold it against Auburn that 
Napoleonville has only been able to support one university.  Tulane is 
strictly academics and we are talking sports.  
PL

Chad, do you even know what is coming out of your mouth?  When did you become 
such a football expert?  I recall Blanchard and the boys having to teach you 
about the game.  

touchy,touchy.  seems like the frustration of three straight top 5 recruiting 
classes with nothing to show for it are getting to you.  It will be ok.  
Hopefully Mack can get some coaching in their to go with his powers of 
persuasion.
PL

FYI, please also know that if the change is simply a meter change, that does 
not effect the value.  Only the Pipeline and trading zone will effect the 
value.
Thanks again.

I have a favor to ask.  Would you mind asking your team to email or phone me 
when they make a location change on a deal in sitara.  We had a case 
yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal 
and for the hedge.  The point was incorrect and a person in logistics 
corrected it.  The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the 
locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will 
then value the deal in the trader's book at mid.  If the locations are 
different, it will value the deal at the customer price.  This could 
potentially have a large impact on the trader's P&L.  It does not seem 
pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing 
deal locations due to time constraints.  We will be more than happy to make 
the changes, and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first 
place when we calc our books.  I would greatly appreciate your groups help in 
cutting some of these issues off at the pass.  If you have any questions or 
concerns, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks.
PL

Your just pissed because I was right about that recruit all along.

this is the kid from opelika correct?  I heard when he committed last week, 
all the publications took him from a 5 star to four star.  SOunds like a 
little biased alabama propaganda.

I talked with the guy at the vet school today about donations in PaPa's 
name.  He was telling me to call him anytime I am down there and he will get 
us a tour of the eagle's new digs and the entire raptor center.  Sounds like 
a lot of fun.  Let me know if you are interested during football season.

Make absolutely certain that positions are correct tonight.  That means all 
roll-off and roll-in positions are correct.  We have been doing this long 
enough now that this should not be an issue anymore.  

Thanks

I agree with that totally.  Jeff should we get a meeting set up with LaGrasta 
to discuss this with him.  Please let me know your thoughts.
PL

FYI,

I have been notified by Hunter again that any future srew ups are my behind.  
So, please verify your P&L's nightly for accuracy, mainly curve shift and new 
deal problems.  Curve shift reports should be run for all of your P&L's and 
new deals should be tied out before calcing.  I know you guys almost always 
do this, I am just giving you a friendly reminder since Hunter is going to be 
watching us even closer now.  

Also, please remember when we change any deals in sitara to notify the intra 
month trader.  I also heard this request from Hunter.

Thanks again for everything while I was out and keep up the good work.
PL
 

We have had a problem arise today with some deals that are being booked in 
sitara by originators and deal tickets/notebooks are not being communicated 
properly to ensure entry into TAGG & Sitara for prompt month deals.  Would 
you mind forwarding this email to your groups and asking them to copy the 
other desks on any originator notebooks that they get that involve pipelines 
on other desks.  For example, Nelson Ferries writes all of his deals on one 
sheet and all deals by pipeline are on one page.  This would simply be an 
additional step to verify all deals are being captured.  Hopefully this will 
eliminate any future problems.  If you have any suggestions for ways to 
better handle this, please let me know.  Thanks.

Can we go ahead and take the unexplained amount (numbers at the bottom of 
your schedule) for Ontario thru 0008.  It appears that the number will be 
roughly 25K in income, making the number 255K unexplained and that will be 
for the months 0009-0011.

Can we also do the same on Central through 0006, this will be roughly 56K in 
expenses.  This will clean up that as well.

Please shout if there are any problems.  Thanks.
PL

The room is $440 per couple for the four nights or $220 per person.  The fest 
tickets are $15 a day and people usually go 2 of the three days.  there is 
also a Harrah's casino across the street from our condo.  The condo's have 
kitchen's in them so people and buy groceries and stuff and eat there mainly.

We go every year and have a blast.  If you are interested let me know.
PL

have you heard  anything from Jim on these?  How are we looking on back 
pages?  Let me know and I can take some time with you to help and clean them 
up further.  Thanks.

I don't know if this is true but I know I am going to check it out for
myself.

A friend sent this to me and I just wanted to pass it on. I know I'm going
to clean out my medicine chest. Before I forwarded this message to anyone I

wanted to make sure that the information was true.  I checked with Rachel's

pediatrician and she verified that all drugs containing Phenylpropanolamine

are being recalled. I also happened to be at CVS Pharmacy and they have a
sign stating that all drugs containing Phenylpropanolamine have been pulled

from their shelves.

You  may want to try calling the 800 number listed on most drug boxes and
inquire about a refund.

Please read this carefully, as I know that some of you use some of these
drugs (Alka Seltzer Plus for one).  Also, please pass this on to everyone
you know.

Stop taking anything containing this ingredient. It has been linked to
increased hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding in brain) among women ages 18-49 in
the three days after starting use of medication. Problems were not found in

men, but the FDA recommended that everyone (even children) seek
alternative medicine. The following medications contain
Phenylpropanolamine:

Acutrim Diet Gum Appetite Suppressant Plus Dietary Supplements
Acutrim Maximum Strength Appetite Control
Alka-Seltzer Plus Children's Cold Medicine Effervescent
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold medicine (cherry or orange)
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold Medicine Original
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold & Cough Medicine Effervescent
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold & Flu Medicine Effervescent
Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold & Sinus Effervescent
Alka Seltzer Plus Night-Time Cold Medicine Effervescent
BC Allergy Sinus Cold Powder
BC Sinus Cold Powder
Comtrex Deep Chest Cold & Congestion Relief
Comtrex Flu Therapy & Fever Relief Day & Night
Contac 12-Hour Cold Capsules
Contac 12 Hour Caplets
Coricidin D Cold, Flu & Sinus
Dexatrim Caffeine Free
Dexatrim Extended Duration
Dexatrim Gelcaps
Dexatrim Vitamin C/Caffeine Free
Dimetapp Cold & Allergy Chewable Tablets
Dimetapp Cold & Cough Liqui-Gels
Dimetapp DM Cold & Cough Elixir
Dimetapp Elixir
Dimetapp 4 Hour Liquid Gels
Dimetapp 4 Hour Tablets
Dimetapp 12 Hour Extentabs Tablets
Naldecon DX Pediatric Drops
Permathene Mega-16
Robitussin CF
Tavist-D 12 Hour Relief of Sinus & Nasal Congestion
Triaminic DM Cough Relief
Triaminic Expectorant Chest & Head Congestion
Triaminic Syrup Cold & Allergy
Triaminic Triaminicol Cold & Cough

I just found out and called the 800# for Triaminic and they
informed me that they are voluntarily recalling the following medicines
because of a certain ingredient that is causing strokes and seizures
in children.

Orange 3D Cold & Allergy
Cherry (Pink) 3D Cold & Cough
Berry 3D Cough Relief
Yellow 3D Expectorant

They are asking you to call them at 800-548-3708 with the lot number on the

box so they can send you postage for you to send it back to them, and they
will also issue you a refund.

If you know of anyone else with small children, please pass this on.

My grandfather actually passed away on Thursday afternoon and we had the 
funeral on Saturday.  I had to give the eulogy and boy was it difficult.  I 
bet a stood there for 1 minute without saying a word, unable to hold my 
emotions.  I hope I never have to do that again.  Thanks for your thoughts.

Talk to you soon.

We (Jason, Drew, I) are coming home for Easter weekend (April 15) and
staying for appx. 5 days.  We can probably only do one....and have already
promised Drew that we would take him to Houston (he's never been).  If I
were single, or w/o child I would be all over it!!

Hope everything turns out ok in Alabama....I'm thinking of you.

Phillip,
The Price Report file will display the information in the same columns as it 
does on the site, so the format  should be the same.  I don't think it is a 
problem to get it to the O:/ drive by 2:30.  The price reports will start 
going to the folder on Monday, February 5.  

To make things easier for now, is there a folder that you already have access 
to on the O:/ drive that we can have this file sent to everyday?  Please let 
me know when you get a chance, so we can get that folder name into the 
scripts.

Thanks.

In order for the physical desks to roll out positions into TDS,  a mapping is 
required between the Org region code used in Portcalc
for the physical calc and the related Tagg book code that is used for that 
region.

An example would be similar to:

Org Region Code                             Tagg Book Code
CENTRAGULF                                  
FT-INTRA-GULF                        This is just an example and might not be 
a valid grouping

 TDS knows the Tagg books to pick up, it just does not know which physical 
region codes that are related to it.

Can you provide for your desk all Org Region Codes used on your desk, and 
what Tagg Book it would relate to.
If you could send me the list, I will forward them to the TDS developers.

Any questions or concerns, please call me.

Thanks

have about 5 couples going right now and the room rate is $440 per couple for 
all four nights total.  Let me know if you are interested, we have to have 
the rooms paid for by 2/15/01.  Talk to you soon.  Thanks.

We have had a few recent instances where deals have been unwound in TAGG and 
not in Sitara.  This, has,  in all cases resulted in a negative financial 
impact.  Going forward,  no long-term physical deals will be unwound without 
my signature,  and that of the physical trader responsible for trading the 
area for which the deal was done.  Also,  all unwind tickets will require  
the old TAGG and Sitara deal number to be written on the ticket.

Thanks,
Genaro

Please add Victor Guggenheim to your list.  Thanks for the email.  FYI, I am 
sure that Fletch and Martin appreciate your email last night as well.
PL

Good to see.  Thanks for forwarding.
PL

This deal is ok for now because it only has a volume in for January.  If the 
trader changes the volume for the out months, we will need to have it in 
tagg.  thanks.
PL

I suggest not watching this after eating or drinking too much.

Thanks for your help.  This sounds like a good fit for us.  The only issues I 
have or need addressed is for this file to have the same name and have the 
curves in the same cells so that we can just link to the file in our curve 
file.  The other concern is that the data be there by 2:30 p.m. 
everyday(prices for the next gas day).  Thanks so much for your help.
PL
 

I am hoping you will be the right person to talk with.  Rahil Jafry referred 
me to you.  I am the risk management lead for the Central Gas desk.  
Currently our traders utilize an EOL weighted average gas price report on EOL 
to set their curves for the next gas day, i.e. their curves set today for 
tomorrow's gas flow.  I was first inquiring with EOL if they could possibly 
provide this report in downloadable format(excel) and they sent me to Rahil, 
who then sent me to you.  Is this possible?  Please feel free to contact me 
for any additional information or if this is really confusing.

Please let me know if you are not the right person to contact and I will 
start over with EOL.  Thanks for your assistance in this matter.

Attached is a file we put together with the daily figures on them for Central 
1 & Central 2.  The total page should tie to what I gave you last week.  I 
highlighted the five days on each month the highest absolute value change.  I 
then attached those days P&L top sheets.  Please review this information and 
let us know what type of detailed support you will need.  Thanks.

Can you please set this new location up, Nipsco/NGPL, with curves the same as 
the original point, NGPL/Nipsco.  I believe they are as follows: gas daily 
should be GDP-CHI. GATE, the intramonth should be NGI/CHI. GATE, and the Mid 
should be NGI/CHI./NIPSCO.

Please shout with any questions.  Thanks for your help.
PL

	
	

Phillip, Please move the following two deals from their current location, 
NGPL/Nipsco, to a new location Nipsco/NGPL.  We are setting up Nipsco as it's 
own pipeline so as to better track positions. Please make the change 
effective Feb. 1.

Thanks, George

FYI, all new deals that are at NGPL/Nipsco, need to be in sitara at 
Nipsco/NGPL.  Please shout with any questions.

These two deals, 249262 & 565833 are changed for February out.  I will tell 
the risk team that all new deals at NGPL/Nipsco should be at NIPS/NGPL - 
9260.  Is this correct?

I forgot to tell you last night, Ginger called and said Tori will be there.  
I thought there were possibly going to be other kids there as well.  What 
about just going out to eat at Lupe's with your mom and nonnie?  That sounds 
good to me.  We do not have to have a party with Brian/Rebecca, Kim and Ev 
and then they feel obligated to bring a gift.  No big deal to me and I am 
sure no big deal to them.

What are we doing for dinner tonight?

PL

That is all fine with me.  Just ask mom what she wants to do.  She will not 
flip out again, I think.  We can see if she wants to do anything on his 
actual birthday.  What are we going to actually do after the Gymboree thing, 
are we inviting anyone else over?

FYI - Barry was not there last week.

I have a few concerns about this.  We are suppossed to be the only point of 
contact for changes in tagg.  This is an internal control issue that leaves 
all responsibility for errors in tagg with risk.  If other people are 
touching deals in tagg, any errors will then have to be investigated further 
and thus take longer to resolve.

I guess my main question for you is, does a problem exist in the current 
system?  Is risk not addressing your issues and needs on a timely basis?  If 
so, we need to readdress that issue and resolve it in a more timely manner.

Please let me know if the others disagree with me.

Thanks.

Make sure your group is looking out for this.  

1. If copying post ids to run mini books they need to take the TDS flag off
2.  Since not everyone will do #1 - they should watch their position loads to 
make sure they are bringing in the correct post ids (they are listed in the 
load statement)   After they have closed this screen there isn't a way of 
seeing this.

Note I have changed working hours & currently come during lunch.  If you have 
questions concerning TDS systems call Bill Fortney x39952, or you can talk to 
Russ Severson.

Thanks,
Bill

The PortCalc screen has been changed in production to copy the TDS position 
load flag as is,
instead of setting it to 0.

It seems after some discussion the prevailing wisdom is to change the way the 
TDS flag works when copying a Post ID.

Risk would like to have the TDS flag copy to new Post IDs.  

Please make the change when possible.  I would put the Meta Calc having the 
flag a higher priority.

Thanks,

Bill

The TDS position load flag has been added to the PortCalc screen in
production. Please close your PortCalcs screens and bring up new ones 
to access this feature.

(The field is labelled TDS, and is located in the middle, left side of the 
screen.)

Thank you,

Jeremy Wong will be moving the TDS position load flag onto the Port Calc 
screen Thursday morning.  

Kenny Ha will then move the new release of TDS to use this flag into 
production Thursday night.  

Risk will have to flag their books with the new flag Thursday night so the 
trader positions will load correctly into TDS for Friday.  I will talk to 
everyone about the change on Thursday & send out a notice of other changes.

I just wanted to update you guys on the status of the EMW reports for 
Hunter.  The EMW Positions_1 file is now updated and accurate.  Every night 
when Kevin finishes his P&L file and updates the EMW Positions file, he will 
email the entire central team.  If one of us is still here, we can print out 
the necessary reports and leave them on Hunter's desk.  If no one is here, 
the first person in will need to print these reports out and give them to 
Hunter with the Var report.  

For the time being Hunter will be the only one needing these reports, I will 
communicate any change in distribution that he requests.  Also for the time 
being, we will be going into Kevin's P&L file, which is in the same location 
as our intra month P&L's that we sign off on, and printing the four tabs that 
he has identified in the email attached.  When Hunter has time to review this 
format with me, we may make changes to the reports we print out.  The EMW 
positions_1 file is in the same location as our CE Positions_1 file.

Please as always, shout with any questions or concerns.  Thanks for your help.
PL

This is just a guess for what Hunter is looking for.  I would start with the

Exec Summary
DPR
P&L Without Sharing
P&L Summary

In addition,  I think he wants more detail on the positions.

In my hedge strip file (same directory as everyone else - name is HS_IM-EMW) 
I would think he would
like to see the Financial Book Position, NSS1, FT-Enovate, and TP tabs.  
These are the only tabs with 
positions.  (Will be changing shortly).

Just when you thought you knew everything (no, it's not an anti cola add  
;-)...  

1.In many states the highway patrol carries two gallons of Coke in the truck  
to remove blood from the highway after a car accident. 
2.You can put a  T-bone steak in a bowl of coke and it will be gone in two 
days. 
3.To clean a  toilet: Pour a can of Coca-Cola into the toilet bowl....... Let 
the "real thing"  sit for one hour, then flush clean. 
4.The citric acid in Coke removes stains  from vitreous china. 
5.To remove rust spots from chrome car bumpers: Rub the  bumper with a 
crumpled-up piece of Reynolds Wrap aluminum foil dipped in  Coca-Cola. 
6.To clean corrosion from car battery terminals: Pour a can of  Coca-Cola 
over the terminals to bubble away the corrosion. 
7.To loosen a  rusted bolt: Applying a cloth soaked in Coca-Cola to the 
rusted bolt for several  minutes. 
8.To bake a moist ham: Empty a can of Coca-Cola into the baking  pan;rap the 
ham in aluminum foil, and bake. Thirty minutes before the ham is  finished, 
remove the foil, allowing the drippings to mix with the Coke for a  sumptuous 
brown gravy. 
9.To remove grease from clothes: Empty a can of coke  into a load of greasy 
clothes, add detergent, And run through a regular cycle.  The Coca-Cola will 
help loosen grease stains. It will also clean road haze  fromyour 
windshield.  

FYI: 1.The active ingredient in Coke is phosphoric acid. It's pH is 2.8. It  
will dissolve a nail in about 4 days. 
2.To carry Coca Cola syrup (the  concentrate) the commercial truck must use 
the Hazardous material place cards  reserved for Highly Corrosive materials. 
3.The distributors of coke have  been using it to clean the engines of their 
trucks for about 20 years! Drink up!  No joke. Think what coke and other soft 
drinks do to your teeth on a daily  basis. A tooth will dissolve in a cup of 
coke in 24-48 hours.  

I have not seen the increased volumes.  I will ask andy tomorrow about them.  
The original 13K and 30 K are in Sitara.
PL

Please send me more information on book G5.  The person that runs that book, 
FTOC, is not aware of this book.  Please send me the book name and we will

Jim,
Please adjust the sithe storage account to a price of $0, instead of wacog.  
This adjustment should not have to go back any further than 11/99.  The 
Pipeline is Union Gas Limited and the storage contract number is 96041510.  
Please shout with any questions.  Jennifer, this should eliminate the current 
outstanding variances and create a variances for all past months that have 
been cleaned up.  The P&L impact of the new variances should be minimal due 
to the small volume nature of these transactions in the past.  I believe the 
variances will be a gain.
Thanks for you help guys.

One of the saddest parts of the demise of Alabama coach Mike DuBose is his
growing inability to control the bad apples in the program.
A few of Alabama's players, sensing DuBose's lame-duck status, have been
acting like thugs. The latest example of the inmates running the asylum:
On the final play of the Tide's loss to Central Florida, senior fullback
Dustin McClintock blocked Central Florida freshman Commer Rucker to the
ground, sat on him and reportedly punched him several times in the face.
DuBose told one reporter he didn't want to comment until he spoke to
McClintock.
According to media reports in Alabama, DuBose is "concerned" that something
like that had happened for the second week in a row. Concerned enough to
take harsh disciplinary action such as suspending the guilty party for part
of the next game?
Cheap shots are getting to be a habit at Bama. In the closing minutes of the
Tennessee game, Alabama's Hirchel Bolden took out his frustrations with a
shot to the chin of UT punter David Leaverton, who was nearly 45 yards from
where the punt was rolling on the turf. Leaverton required 9 stitches to his
face.
Because no penalty was called, some Tide supporters defended Bolden. The
following day, DuBose said such behavior wouldn't be tolerated. However, his
threat rings hollow because he never backed it up with stiff sanctions.
McClintock obviously never got the message. His actions and DuBose's
reaction (or lack thereof) speak volumes about the state of the Tide's
program.

Who in the hell is getting married in Cabo? That sure is different.  You will 
have to go to Jazz fest with us next year.  Just let me know.  We reserve the 
extra rooms around Jan. and have to pay for them by Feb. 15th.  How is your

ask you.  Oh...I think Jason and I will be in Vegas the same weekend as

that is correct.

plove,

I'm looking in the _Converted folder in NetCo.  i count 6 files.  pls confirm.

thanks

Please do this ASAP...I have to head out of town for a few days and we need this done ASAP.  Thanks.  Curves are under NW and SW in the netco directory - ask Kam for help.  Thanks.
PL

The curve files for Netco will need to be modified before they are used in the new environment.

    1)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to ermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7525
Change the Network Address on the 5th row to ;239.44.16.1;     

2) Then hit the  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

3)	Save your curves as normal

4)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call 

done.
PL

Again, let me know if you have not been taken care of.

Executive recruiter in the energy and telecommunications industries.

Per an email from Mike Grigsby, I understand we are splitting the west into two regions.  You are going to be doing the SW and socal per Mike's email.  I am attaching the curve files we have created.  Please take a look at them and make sure I am not missing curves or have included wrong ones.  We are only going to be setting published locations initially.  I am sending you the curves in three parts due to the size of the files.  The Index file has phys index and GDY, and the Phy file has BOM phys and GD.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
PL
  

 

We have just decided to divide the western region into two groups.  I will be heading up the Rockies/NW and Northern California, while Phillip Allen heads up the Southwest and Southern California.  Think about whether or not you  would like to change how you serve our groups going forward.  We will need to divide the curve files to reflect the separate regions.  The Southwest will be defined as EP SJ and EP Permian.  P&L summary reports will be separated into two groups.

attached are the curve files for your part of the West - basis, index, GDY, phy and gas daily.  Please take a look and make sure I have not put a curve in the wrong region.  Due to size, I am sending them in three different emails. Thanks.

I feel confident I can sell them on EBay for at least $25 a sleeve, so I will go at that way.  Thanks anyway.  Good luck.
PL

I can get the Titleist Enron for $45 per dozen..
I will pay $40 per dozen for your pinnacle. Prices are
going to drop fast on these so time is very important.

I figure you are going to turn around and sell them on Ebay(current price is $77).  So, I will sell you the two pinnacle cases for $250, roughly $31 a sleeve.  I now have two cases of the titleist golf balls that will also sell at the same price.  I can send you a picture tonight, when I get home.  I can ship tomorrow or Saturday, I will pay for the shipping.  If you are interested, let me know.  Thanks.
PL

yes, I am interested in your Golf Balls..
Please email your best price for all of them shipped
priority mail insured. Priority mail usually runs $5
for a dozen plus $2 for the 1st $100 of insurance.. I
can send payment via paypal for them.
If you have a picture showing the boxes that would be
great also.

Isn't it crazy.  Someone is selling a risk management book that they gave us in a class here for $900.  Unbelievable.  I am putting stuff out there tomorrow when it comes in.  We have a signature shop here that we can buy that same sleeve of balls for $4.

That is funny.  I just ordered some more to sell on EBay, I can buy four sleeves for $16.50 and they are going for $40 a sleeve on EBay.  You might want to sell them.  We were actually a skit last week on Saturday Night Live.  Pretty funny stuff.  Keep working on your wife about Jazz Fest.  Ash is working her too.

You guys are going to end up as a skit on Saturday Night Live. Also I forgot

I apologize, we have been a little delinquent on the thank you cards this year, we are usually really good about it.  He got those horses and absolutely loves them.  We got him a fisher price farm for Christmas and he had just opened that when he opened the horses.  We couldn't get him to open another give for half an hour playing with those horses. They go great with the farm and plays with them all the time.  Thanks.  

On second thought, I'll trade you our cup for two dozen Enron golf balls. Also, Karen is driving me crazy wanting to know if Young Jack got his horses and if he likes them. Please let me know, I don't have too far to go on the crazy part. Love, Steve

The IT group would like to turn off the replication of curves tomorrow.  Have all the ESTATE curve files been converted per the 
instructions below.  Any file that has not been updated will not be able to load curves effective Thursday.

If there is any problem with this timing, please contact me.

Thanks
Russ
x37386
Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new Estate environment.      

Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the  << OLE Object: Picture (Metafile) >>  button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

Can I take Fri. off?

here is the file.  You would change the two curve tabs and the publish tabs are linked up.  The BOM file is unchanged.  The two basis files now only have basis curves in them.  Let me know any changes you would like.  Thanks.
PL
 

Just to be more clear.  The file will combine the Gas Daily index and the Physical Index curves.  The Gas Daily BOM can remain in a separate file.

Thanks,
Mike

absolutely.  I will make the changes and have something to you this afternoon.
PL

Thanks.  Can we combine the file for Gas Daily and Physical Index curves - I will be updating this file and the Balance of the month file.  Keith Holst will update the CA basis, while Frank Ermis updates the ROX and SW file.

Mike

Attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily.  I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.  I figure you will want to keep your model and I can pull info from there as well.  I simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs.  Please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it.  Thanks.

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.
PL

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

I need all of your official post ids from your old books for the date of 11/30/01.  Please email them to me ASAP.

Please modify the curve files you are currently loading to incorporate the database changes.  These changes need to be made today.  Please ask myself or Russ if you need any help.  Thanks.
PL

Currently the curves are being published into the old production database and are being replicated to the new environment.      

Here are the steps to migrate the Curve files to the new env.

1)	Load new ODBC driver utilizing script provided
      A) Go to ( Start\Programs\System Utility Applic \ Installation&Diskette Creation)
     Double click on "ODBC DSN Entries for ERMT & ESTERMTP"
              This will load the correct ODBC on your machine
  
  2)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to estermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7550     

3) Then hit the   button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

4)	Save your curves as normal

5)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call

absolutely.  I will make the changes and have something to you this afternoon.

Thanks.  Can we combine the file for Gas Daily and Physical Index curves - I will be updating this file and the Balance of the month file.  Keith Holst will update the CA basis, while Frank Ermis updates the ROX and SW file.

Mike

Attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily.  I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.  I figure you will want to keep your model and I can pull info from there as well.  I simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs.  Please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it.  Thanks.

The West books should be GD and GDY for Canadian deals.  I would think that the central books should have two set up, one for P/B/I and one for GD.  I believe I had called you and said that the books should be set up like FT-ONT-GDL for the gas daily books.  This is correct.  Thanks.
PL

Phillip/Kam,

The following new Canadian gas books are all assigned to "MC" but a canadian book can either be price/basis/index or gasdaily but it cannot be both (otherwise cause problems in PortCalc).  I remember we discussed about this last time and I was told to use FT-ONTARIO as the example, but there are a lot of FT-ONTARIO books like FT-ONT-CENTRAL and FT-ONT-GDL with different setup.  

For example, 166860 has all P/B/Idx/GD checked which it shouldn't be.  And 166859 has GD checked so does it mean it should be set up as a Canadian gasdaily book?  Then if 166860 - 166877 are Canadian price/basis/index, another book code should be assigned instead of using MC.  Please advise.

should be Nicor and Northern Illinois.   If you want to round up the deal numbers/invoices and such, we can get together and I can show you the deals I am showing a variance on.  I took an adjustment to the desk for 5.7 million and that is for Jan 00 - Oct 01. production only.  Let me know.
PL
 

Oh it's noticeable alright!!  Nicor Enerchange, LLC shows an AR balance of $2.3M; Nicor Gas Company has a balance of $6.9M and Northern Illinois Gas Company has a balance of $7.7M.  Which one of those are we talking about??
CJ

I was under the impression that there was an outstanding A/R and A/P balance on this counterparty in the 4-5 million dollar range.  Should be pretty noticeable.
PL
 

You might want to call her and see if she can tell you anything.  I was assuming this was the totals still sitting on the ledger, but maybe not all of it.  Let me know if you can't reach her.

In a word - NO!!  Can you clue me in on what you need?  I have Lisa's email address and phone number if you don't think we can find it...

Chuck, Do you know the figures to give to Phillip?  I wasn't sure if Lisa filled you in on any of this before she left.
The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on Lisa to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.
PL
 

How is this going?  Jennifer Lee is OA is questioning the impact and is trying to understand everything so I sent her copies of our communications.  Any further communications need to copy her on since Lisa V. is no longer here.
 
Thanks,
Marlo

still working.  I hope to have it completed before the week is out.  As I am sure you are experiencing as well all the fire drills that are currently going on around here, I have been running since I got back from vacation.  Believe me when I say this is a high priority for me as well because of all the potential P&L fallout for the traders who have been entering this information.
PL
 

How are things going with this.  We need to give updates to our leads.

 

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.  

PL 
  

Here's what we have done for all the month's involved.  I'll have to copy the Nicor invoices and get them to you.  I will bring those down to you tomorrow morning.

 << File: NICOR-rec.xls >> 

can you get me the info on August for Nicor, according to Cora Pendergrass I need to see august numbers because some of July's invoice has august volumes.  I would like a copy of all the stuff you guys gave me for July.  Thanks.

PL

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo 

Phillip is working on NICOR. I will work on NIPSCO. Marlo's e-mail was the first I have heard of this and it does not really describe what the issue is. Can somebody clue me in with the details? Thanks.

Scott 

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.

Thanks 
Darla Saucier 

I think there is also some stuff under a subsidiary of NICOR, Northern Illinois.  Make sure both are included.  If you guys can get the balances and which deal numbers are outstanding I think we can match up with the CPR reports that I have.
PL
 

I can run the A/P for my side.  I don't know how much on the settlements side is all part of this issue since there are some true purchases and sales, I just don't want to give you figures that are not correct even though I know the majority of the balances belong to the cleanup.

Here's what we have done for all the month's involved.  I'll have to copy the Nicor invoices and get them to you.  I will bring those down to you tomorrow morning.

 << File: NICOR-rec.xls >> 

can you get me the info on August for Nicor, according to Cora Pendergrass I need to see august numbers because some of July's invoice has august volumes.  I would like a copy of all the stuff you guys gave me for July.  Thanks.

PL

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo 

Phillip is working on NICOR. I will work on NIPSCO. Marlo's e-mail was the first I have heard of this and it does not really describe what the issue is. Can somebody clue me in with the details? Thanks.

Scott 

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.

Thanks 
Darla Saucier

The Raiders have always been my team. The Chargers are my Home team.
I will ask about the Vegas weekend.

What????  I thought that was your team?  I am a big raiders fan and I hope
Chucky gets that ring this year.  Hey, FYI, we are getting a guys trip to
Las Vegas for the first weekend of March Madness if you are interested -
March 13-16th.  Got a room at the Mirage and it is $120 per person for the
three nights.  I figure air fare is pretty cheap from SD, let me know if
you are interested.  Take care.

Attached is the curve file for phys and gas daily.  I made this extremely simple on our first pass, but I left in the tabs that were in the old/current file.  All you would do would be to go to the fin tab and hard code balance of month price for each of the curve locations(yellow column).  This will then set the gas daily curve.  We will continue to true up to gas daily each day.  You may want to also reset the next day's curve as well, since this is a hardcode, you simply type over the previous day's load.  The phys tab pulls from the fin tab and adds the phys prem to it.  We can increase the complexity of this file by adding formulas or tabs if you like.  I figure you will want to keep your model and I can pull info from there as well.  I simply wanted to start out at a baseline and build it to best fit your needs.  Please let me know what you would like to see changed and we will do it.  Thanks.

Thanks for the EOL products email.  I am attaching the curve files. The CA Basis is the California markets and the West Basis is Rockies and SW.  The third file is the GDI curves.  Please review and let me know if we need to make any changes or additions to this file.  They are pretty simple and straightforward and do not link to anything currently.  Let me know what you think.  I am sending them in three different emails because of the size.  I will have the physical/GD curve file to you by Monday.  Thanks.

thanks for the file.  I am attaching the basis curves we have set up and the GDY curve file as well.  I am finishing the physical as we speak.  Please look at these three files and let me know if you would like any changes.  We are only putting the published curves in the files, at least to begin with.  West Basis is the rockies at southwest curves and CA basis is the california markets.  Thanks.

As you mentioned, not all of these products will roll out initially, but we wanted to go ahead and map them in the system.  I have put in the old trader's names in a column(column F).  If you could check out the list when you get a chance and let me know if you want to change the traders on any of the products and who will be trading the products for the traders that are not moving over(names highlighted in green).  Also, there are no current products under Jason Wolfe, Matt Smith or Jane Tholt.  Please let me know if we need to create products for them or if we will be moving existing ones to them.  Please also let me know which traders need to also have a physical book.  The list I gave you this morning is the financial books we set up.

Is this value on these deals rought 8K?
If so, tell portfolio acct to put them in and generate a PMA for the gas books.  It is not worth investigating for such a small number and the deal ended 12/01.  Are these the only four deals you have with the gas desk?  
PL

This is CGAS Price as of 12/31/01. Merchant Portfolio hedged this position thru the gas desk - then the gas desk hedged with third party.

Per John Lavorato, we killed all desk to desk deals on Dec. 13th.  That is why this deal was killed.  You mentioned that you had price deals that were not killed.  Can you give me deal numbers for those as well and we can take a peak and see why they were not killed.  It is our understanding that all desk to desk(book to book) should be killed because no cash actually changes hands.  Should this deal have been with an external counterparty?

Phillip,

Below is the information for the CGAS book that was killed on 12/13/01.  This book should have liquidated in December.  Can we get this deal back?

Thanks,

If we can set up new ones for NETCO, I do not see why we need the old ones.

Do you want to keep any of the old TRV files for Netco for any reason.  We can create new ones once it is set up.

As far as I know(see previous email), this is the most current list.  I would also use this list to verify the basis options are up to date - per our conversation earlier(Pat & Chance).

If you or your group have trouble printing, it may be that they moved a bunch a printers to \\nahou-psecn01v server. If you are on the the old server, you have to delete that printer from your printer set up and reinstall it by going through Start/run and typing in \\nahou-psecn01v, then select your printer. Thanks.

Done.

Thomas is setting up a new NGP&L file and would like us to save a copy of each P&L to Netco\2002\0102\region#0102.  Once you decide how you are going to break them up, one file for each book or combine them together, can you save them out there so he can start linking them.

I think that for the physical regions it may be easier to keep each book separate because people could be moving around a lot.

Russ,

The west desk logistics people that will need access to sitara in NetCo are: Patti Sullivan, Suzanne Christiansen, Jackie Adams, Shelly Mendel and Shannon Groenewold. 

Thanks,
Patti

Would you mind sending Russ the list of your people that will need access to sitara in NetCo.  I have send him the list of traders.  Thanks.
PL

Security access for the "Estate" will be the same as Production currently is.
Access for "Netco" will have to be set up from scratch.
Can each of you give me a list of the people that should have access to  "Netco".
Access is still preliminarily being set up on a West, East, Central and Texas regional basis.
Included in the list should be Risk, Logistics, Trading and anyone else that you know of that you want to have access to your region..

The plan is to have a large mass set up,  additional updates will be handled under eRequest, under the new application region code "Houston - Netco"
(This name will be changed later)

Any questions or comments, please give me a call.

Phillip,
Last week we discussed me spending time with you one morning to see exactly what it is that I will be doing.  I imagine it will be more of an observing lesson than anything else, but I would like to stop by Thursday morning.  If you are available, what time should I come down there?

I have set up the new basis curves for West and the are based off the old curves, so they are in the old format.  They are located in the Netco Directory under west/curves/CA BASIS NEW and WEST BASIS NEW.  I am still working on GDY and Phy/GD.  The Phy/GD is in the new format and will be located in the same directory as the above, with the title West phys curves.  GDY will be in the same location as filename West GDY and it is also in the new format.  The phys/GD file will be complete tomorrow and the GDY will be done today.
PL
 

Due to changes to the database relative to the change to "Netco", the curve files will need to be upgraded.  The majority of the files
will be able to be upgraded by each individual with a minimal of effort.  Older files will take extra effort.  Can you have your people 
identify how many old files we have.  The old files can be identified by looking at the "Publish" tab in the Admin box located at F2:G3.

The old files will only have the button  (Reset Rows/Columns)

The new files will have 3 buttons   (Reset Rows/Columns)
                                                  (Load Modules)(Re Init)

Knowing which files still have the old format will help the IT group plan for this migration.
If you could have your people check and get back to me as soon as possible, I would appreciate it.

Thanks
Russ

The desk took the adjustment and we were waiting on Lisa to verify the amounts on the A/R.  We need to know the variance on the A/R by month to compare to my analysis and we can then change the prices in Sitara.  The desk took a 5.7 million dollar expense PMA.  Please let me know if and when you guys have the info and we can get it fixed in Sitara.  Until this gets done, OA will have a variance on flash to actual because the desk already took the adjustment - we wanted to get it in for year end.
PL
 

How is this going?  Jennifer Lee is OA is questioning the impact and is trying to understand everything so I sent her copies of our communications.  Any further communications need to copy her on since Lisa V. is no longer here.
 
Thanks,
Marlo

still working.  I hope to have it completed before the week is out.  As I am sure you are experiencing as well all the fire drills that are currently going on around here, I have been running since I got back from vacation.  Believe me when I say this is a high priority for me as well because of all the potential P&L fallout for the traders who have been entering this information.
PL
 

How are things going with this.  We need to give updates to our leads.

 

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.  

PL 
  

Here's what we have done for all the month's involved.  I'll have to copy the Nicor invoices and get them to you.  I will bring those down to you tomorrow morning.

 << File: NICOR-rec.xls >> 

can you get me the info on August for Nicor, according to Cora Pendergrass I need to see august numbers because some of July's invoice has august volumes.  I would like a copy of all the stuff you guys gave me for July.  Thanks.

PL

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo 

Phillip is working on NICOR. I will work on NIPSCO. Marlo's e-mail was the first I have heard of this and it does not really describe what the issue is. Can somebody clue me in with the details? Thanks.

Scott 

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.

Thanks 
Darla Saucier 

We need to take the central off before the NY, NY Market, southeast curve files.  We need to add the GDI East curve file.  Also add the two east phy/gas daily curve files - o:tds/tds curve/east/intramonth & gas daily files/eastprodnewstyle and eastmktnewstyle.  Sandra's curve file is o:tds/tds curve/east/fteast.

Are there any other files/directories that the estate people in risk will need to use to do their jobs.  IT will have to go into each macro and change the database that it is using to the new one they are creating this weekend.  I don't know if any of you are still using any exotic spreadsheets other than the transport model.  Please let me know if there is anything I'm missing.  (curve files)

Here are the files that use ERMS that the estate will be using.

We just wanted to let you guys know of some changes in order to keep the te=

e this is true, Darron and I have transitioned from handling these requests=
.  Greg Couch is going to be leading the estate risk effort and Pat Ryder a=
nd Chance Rabon will be handling all termination list issues.  Please send =
these lists to these three people in lieu of Darron and I.  As a side note,=
 could you send an updated financial termination list(if this list has chan=
ged since you sent it to me Kim) to these guys so that they can verify deal=
s are moved to the proper book.  It is probably a good idea for future term=
ination scripts to come through Greg before going to IT because of several =
book moves we have made to facilitate reporting to Ed McMichael.  For examp=
le the price book has been basically split into three books.  Please shout =
with any questions or concerns you may have.  Thanks.
PL

You know you got me all fired up now, I am going to put on the full court press to keep the tradition alive.  I am attaching a map from El Cajon to Houston for driving directions.  They say it will take 24+hours, I calculated the time and I think the jilly mobile can do it in 20.  Ashley is probably going to drive the Burban over to NO and I am going to fly because of work.  So you guys only have to drive to Houston and she will do the rest.  Sounds like a good idea to me(yeah right).  I will even throw in a Love trip back to SD this summer/fall if I can get a visit in April.  Two for one baby, you can't get a deal better than that except at Costco.  Plus, I almost forgot the best part - we have a little TV for the burban so you could get a little MLB 2001 action on the way.....(give me enough time and I will keep it coming)

We are doing good. I hope all is well with all of the junk you are going
through.
It looks like Steve went out on top! I think that the Chargers are too cheap
to hire him. Emma
is doing great. I liked the pictures that Ash sent. Jackson has a hat on and
there is a joker
on a pogo stick. Also the picture of J Bug and Tory was great. Trying to
impress the
ladies with his musical talents. I think that the tradition may end this
year. I know that
if we came we would have to drive. Denise will not fly.
We are going to miss you this year. There will probably be some great acts.

Talk to you soon.

What is up my California buddy?  Staying out of trouble?  Things are going
pretty good here.  You believe Steve Spurrier?  IT is a great deal for
Auburn and the SEC.  Time for a new dog to get on top.  What is my little

you guys coming to the Fest this year?  Just to offer you a little
encouragement, I found a special fare for you out there on southwest non

looks like Florida will not be very good next year.  They are losing their best players to the draft.  All three of their receivers and their best cornerback and offensive linemen have now declared for the draft today.  Add to that they can not get a coach to sign on.  Shanahan just turned it down, they are now going to New Orleans offensive coordinator.  See what happens.  Did you get your pool cover fixed?
PL

I've been following the story in the paper since last week.  If you look
real close at the story though, you'll see that all these national
offensive leads were for small schools (NAIA, Division 1AA, etc.).  But,
still good news.  I forget the name of the Jaquars quarterback, but he
has nothing but praise for Petrino.

Now, if we can just get a defensive coordinator.  Wouldn't hurt to have
some defensive players too.

Saw this morning we hired Petrino.  I did not realize how successful he
has been at the college level.  Three times his offenses have led the
nation in offense.  He also did a good job with Quarterbacks.  He has
three playing in the NFL now that he developed.  I think this might be a
real good move.  How are things there?
PL

done.

Zhiyong needs to get a list of all curves we will be loading for Netco. by tomorrow.   

When you all are done identifying those curves could you please get me a list of the curves by risk type?

Thanks

I fixed 1127631, the other deal , I do not have a confirm from you on and it is already priced at NX1 + basis.  Please let me know if you need something further on these deals.
PL

Phillip,

Co-Steel is claiming to have triggered two deals for Nov-01 production - 1127631, 1131418.  However, these are not triggered in the system nor can I ascertain who the trader is.  Will you verify / change these deals accordingly, please.

FYI - I have done the west and I have resaved this file out there.  I highlighted the rows to be changed in yellow.  If we all do this, we should be able to use the same list.  I added a column to the file and put IM S/B, LT S/B and Daily S/B.  
PL

The sitara mapping table is saved in the Netco file named CurveMappings.xls

Check your regions and if you see any locations mapped to curves we won't be setting anymore, make a list of those and what the new mappings should be.  Once the new database is set up we will get with Russ to have those changed over.

Thanks

KK

I only show that we should have triggered 1127631 for December and they did not trigger 1131418 at all.  They will need to provide documentation to us - i.e. signed confirms that show this was done.  Is the trigger price they are suggesting in our favor or not?  If it is in our favor, I am sure we will change it ASAP.  Please let me know.

I got a Canon Elph 100
Talk to you soon.

My thoughts exactly about Woody.

What kind of camera did you get?

>>> <Phillip.M.Love@enron.com> 01/04/02 10:49AM >>>
I hope it is not Woody, Vandy sucked at offense and defense.  He is
horrible and I would hope we would go after somebody else.  We need to
get
someone in there soon so they can put the offense/defense in and the
players can start studying it to get a head start on next year.  I am
afraid if Tubby doesn't turn it around next year he may be gone.

I got a digital camera for Christmas that works real well, I will get
some
pictures to you.

    -----Original Message-----
   To read the articles about Auburn, Tubberville says HE made the
decision
   they should go.  Yeah, right!  I'm sure he was told by Lowder that
   either they went or he did.  So, they were given the opportunity to
   resign, and both chose to do so.  There's already 3 or 4 candidates
to
   replace each.  They expect to have the offensive guy in the next 2
   weeks.  Maybe a little longer for the defense.  Only remember 1
name:
   Woody Weidenhofer from Vandy for offense.  Can't say that I've ever
   heard of the others.

   Oh well, we'll see how it all pans out.

I have tried to contact you guys three times today and have been on hold each time at least 20 minutes.  I cancelled my service with you over a month ago and asked that you keep from sending me a bill.  My service was cancelled immediately and I was told I would receive a bill from you and I would then have to call and dispute the bill to have my account credited.  I asked at that time since I had waited on hold that time for 30 minutes that this matter be taken care of immediately so that I would not have to call back and sit on hold again for half an hour.  Your customer service manager, very rudely I might add,  said that was impossible and I would just have to do it anyway.  Since I have had to wait on hold today for so long I want this email to serve as my dispute and have my account closed and the balance due removed since you terminated my service and I did not get the use of my phone.  

Just a word of advice, I would hire more customer service representatives if you plan on keeping customer to serve.  This is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever had with a company and I will make sure all of my colleagues and friends know of this experience.  I understand that you don't really care about giving good customer service to your ex customers, but I assure you make a fatal error when you assume those people will not share there experience with current and future potential customers.

from tim blanchard:

You gotta love LSU fans.  My brother told me a story of an Illinois fan who was bitching and moaning in the bathroom over his team's performance (and the fact that playing in the Superdome  equates to a home game for LSU - which is funny considering that the 20,000 fans that did show up in the dome would be considered a sellout in Champaign.)  Several Tiger fans jumped in the guys face, told him that Illinois sucks at every sport, called him a p---y, and took his orange shakers from his pocket, threw them into the urinal and pissed on them.  All to the delight of tens of Tiger fans yelling "Tiger Bait."  It could be the same fans that called Illinois Coach Ron Turner's room and yelled the same the night before the game.

given your love (jealousy) of LSU fans, i thought you'd find this amusing...

Just wanted to let you guys in on a few things we have talked with Gossett about.  Today we officially begin the process for the New Company.  That being said, we now have to tighten the ship a bit.  From now on, please refrain from playing games and surfing the internet all day.  If you are bored and don't have anything to do, please look for things to do that are work related.  This is a good time to improve your skills and learn about things you are not absolutely proficient in.  Read some options books, study macros in the P&L's, etc.  The key phrase here is work to improve your skills so that we can shake off some of the rust we have developed in the last month.  All of this is coming from Goss and it is serious, to be a part of the new company you have to show that you are willing to contribute and are the best of the best.  

I know this sounds harsh, but we have all had a nice vacation and I am sure most of you are like me and looking forward to not having such a boring job.  It looks as though bidders will be in this week, so we will have some reports and demonstrations to give.  

Please pull me aside or email me if you have any further questions.

Thanks and Happy New Year.

Change the Network Address on the 5th row to ;239.44.16.1;     

2) Then hit the   button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

I talked with Cecilia and she has changed this in ERMS/TAGG effective today to be GJ/CAD.  Not sure how this happened, but it is fixed now.  Should not have any problems, there is nothing in this book currently.  Let me know if we need to calc these when I get back on Wednesday.

Bernice - please set up the attached book request and notify when complete.

Francis/Cecilia - I will be out of the office Thursday and Friday (Dec 20 and 21).  Please handle the Erms side once Bernice sends out the notification.

James,

Please change the price in Sitara for deal no. 876975 for November 2001 at POI 25306 to $3.2359.

Thanks,

standard reply is that we will be working on the last day and no one knows what it will be like.  Make a reservation and we will do our best to get you out.  The problem is I am sure everyone wants to get out for New Year's Eve so you might generate hard feelings.  I have nothing to do because I consider it to be the most dangerous night of the year and I always stay home.  You decide what you want to do and we will work around it.  If you stay here, I have always heard the Hyatt has a great party and room rate all included.  I am sure other hotels have the same.
PL
 

I'm trying to figure what kinds of plans to make for New Year'sEve, but i hear conflicting stories about work on Dec. 31...I hear that it's a half day of trading and half of zero is zero so I'm trying to understand what could make it a long night...Ideally I'd fly into New Orleans New Years Eve and com back the next day...What are the possibilities of making an evening flight out...
 
If I can't make it to N.O...what kinds of things do you know of to do around her for New Years? Remember, my little woman is not yet of legal drinking age so bars are out of the question...

TBG Cogen Partners is disputing the rate invoiced by ENA for November 2001 gas. ENA invoiced a rate of $3.4367 for deal # 22957. The customer claims the rate should be as follows: first 4,000/d @ $2.25, remainder over 4,000 @ monthly index of delivery location + $.025. Please review and advise.

Thanks,
Genaro

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank cred=
it lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu=
idity.=20
Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of =
outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a=
 person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy c=
oncern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptiv=
e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access =
to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its=
 banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But, "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last =
few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," s=
aid an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial o=
fficer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we are mak=
ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate=
 liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the natio=
n's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all e=
lectricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involv=
ed in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it=
 reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder =
equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange =
Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction=
s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, And=
rew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, pu=
t Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor'=
s, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investor=
s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. =
In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have t=
o fall several notches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enro=
n was down six cents at $16.35.=20
Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes mo=
re than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enr=
on's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $=
884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999.=20
The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und=
erperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.=
5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India=
. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs =
of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, parti=
cularly in today's slower economy.=20
The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha=
t have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealing=
s with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents r=
elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu=
ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected =
to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclose=
d its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of =
the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other em=
ployee-related entity known as Chewco.=20
Chewco was established in 1997 "with approximately $400 million in capital =
commitments" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the pa=
rtnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were =
purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions =
for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a manag=
ing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the docum=
ent.=20
Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em=
ployee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any =
comment regarding its dealings with Chewco.=20
Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t=
o run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person =
at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In respon=
se to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that "Micha=
el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron." Mr. Fastow repeatedly h=
as declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partn=
erships in July.=20
This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar=
ding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to repor=
t any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves "any director or execut=
ive officer." By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that =
category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumab=
ly wouldn't have.=20
However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo=
ard seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. =
According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a "mate=
rial" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The=
 statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents i=
n charge of major business units and "other persons who perform similar pol=
icy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of =
management."

Deals & Deal Makers: Enron Officials Sell Shares Amid Stock-Price Slump
By Theo Francis and Cassell Bryan-Low
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financi=
al officer are under regulatory scrutiny, have steadily sold sizable amount=
s of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this yea=
r.=20
Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 millio=
n through July, as the stock fell to less than $45 a share from $83 at the =
start of the year. Since July, the stock has plummeted an additional 63% to=
 $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week.
Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed =
in shares for $25.7 million so far this year, usually in transactions paire=
d with options exercises. He sold 429,614 shares, leaving him with some 2.8=
 million shares as of July, the latest data available on his sales, accordi=
ng to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics.=20
The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr. L=
ay's sales of Enron shares for 2000, which reached $30.7 million. In 1999, =
he sold shares for a total of $26 million.=20
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying=
 the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate off=
icials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by compan=
y insiders and called the sales "a personal decision." Many sales by Enron =
insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon afte=
r option exercises.=20
Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines =
should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research dire=
ctor of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on in=
vestment ideas.=20
Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman=
 and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice=
 has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning =
in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skillin=
g -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during =
the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares.=20
Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment.=20
Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they s=
old 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3=
.4 million shares for $123.1 million.=20
Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company s=
hares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron=
's chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Secur=
ities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the=
 company and Mr. Fastow.=20
Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each=
, or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based=
 on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composi=
te trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Fi=
nancial/Lancer Analytics says.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment.=20
On Monday, a New York law firm filed suit in U.S. District Court in Houston=
, alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose=
 problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down th=
e value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr. Fastow. The s=
uit, which seeks class-action status, also says Enron insiders sold $73 mil=
lion of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001.

Credit Markets
Enron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Cre=
dit-Rating Concerns

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock=
 amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse.=20
Not for long, some bond traders say.
In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million =
issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on=
 the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% d=
rop during the past two weeks.=20
That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct.=
 16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resu=
lting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's pric=
e translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. gove=
rnment bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two we=
eks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of "=
spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of singl=
e B or lower.=20
Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing=
 late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit l=
ines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, =
investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yes=
terday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in b=
onds, a small percentage of a typical trade.=20
Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating con=
cerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of=
 troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investiga=
tion, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer.=20
"Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest," said Harold Ri=
vkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N=
.J.=20
In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect thems=
elves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a "default swap" -=
- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at fac=
e value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit be=
ing insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lu=
cent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology com=
pany's troubles earlier during the year.=20
Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-=
rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above=
 the noninvestment-grade level.=20
Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possib=
le downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last we=
ek. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of pu=
tting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its lon=
g-term ratings outlook to "negative," citing concerns about the company's f=
inancial flexibility.)=20
Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for=
 the worst. "These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward dis=
tressed levels," said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an =
independent fixed-income research firm in New York. "They aren't distressed=
 yet, but they are headed in that direction."=20
If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the c=
ompany's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade s=
ends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to=
 make good on its commitments.=20
Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known fo=
r trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in =
the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacit=
y and steel. As a market maker matching buyers and sellers, Enron handles a=
bout a quarter of all the trading in the nation's energy and gas markets.=
=20
Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating=
, the cheaper it can hedge, or offset, its positions in all these commoditi=
es markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers. Without th=
at credit rating, the cost of this high-margin, high-volume business starts=
 to rise. A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to, or derive=
d from, that of an underlying security or asset, such as a stock, bond or c=
ommodity.=20
"Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating, the perceptio=
n that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses," s=
aid Mr. Reynolds at Credit Sights Inc. "Any prudent risk [manager] at Enron=
's counterparties" -- any institution on the other end of a financial agree=
ment with Enron -- "is going to be examining their exposure to Enron, and l=

Heard on the Street
Most Analysts Remain Plugged In to Enron
By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron: Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so=
 little about.=20
In recent years, Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critic=
s would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron, even as they acknowledge n=
ot always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted f=
or its soaring profits. Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i=
ts most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't fig=
ure out.
In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede=
d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif=
ficult to value the company. The company's "lack of disclosure and transpar=
ency," he says, is "a longstanding Enron hallmark."=20
So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did =
bump Enron off its "U.S. Select List," which consists of a few dozen top st=
ock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's la=
rger but prestigious "Recommended List" of 200 or so favored stocks, where =
it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993.=20
"Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . =
. . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze =
it' or `I can't figure it out,' " says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclos=
ed number of Enron shares. "If that were the case, there would be an awful =
lot of industries we couldn't follow."=20
Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week.=20
"Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a=
 black box," says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, =
who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiti=
ng from its fall -- throughout this year. "It was really a trust-me story, =
when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l=
evel of trust."=20
True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts lo=
ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly=
 on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had.=
=20
But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still rec=
ommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practic=
es are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend tha=
t others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operatio=
ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable?=20
Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the=
 issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago b=
y bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time =
and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger=
ing questions about the company's various partnership transactions.=20
Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th=
e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings.=
=20
Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darli=
ng, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and=
 level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the=
 stock, 10 had a "strong buy" or equivalent rating on the stock, according =
to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a "buy," thoug=
h not strongly.=20
Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a "se=
ll" rating on Enron.=20
The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile exampl=
es of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospe=
ct seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warrante=
d.=20
Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general coll=
apse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- part=
icularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the compani=
es they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis=
ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees an=
d other revenue.=20
Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, fo=
r one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Bost=
on, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette=
, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.=20
"Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that=
 hasn't been involved," says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer=
, who still rates the stock a "strong buy" with a $40 price target. "They p=
ay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street."=20
He adds, "We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Ar=
e we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to pro=
vide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation o=
n the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p=
erformed."=20
Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron,=
 calls his holding "a meaningful investment" that is "not small." But he di=
sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer sa=
ys his clients "are happy to know" he has a stake in Enron, because it show=
s he puts his money where his mouth is.=20
In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosur=
es of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficu=
lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, =
he wrote that he and many other investors historically "have given Enron th=
e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings" and position a=
s an industry leader.=20
"There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accura=
tely where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make =
their money, but every quarter they do," he says. "It's hard to get inside =
to know all the transactions, but they do deliver."=20
CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasio=
nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the=
 financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron=
's partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains=
 "confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] an=
d an ultimate recovery in the share price."=20
"I know I'm wrong on the stock," Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these=
 prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even =
in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue =
as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stoc=
k doesn't have much further to fall.=20
Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. "Even in relative terms=
, analysts remain very bullish on this stock," says Chuck Hill, director of=
 research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock o=
n Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a "buy" rating. Enron scores a 1.6=
. "This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad=
 news is out," Mr. Hill says.=20
In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i=
t to "sell" from "buy," with a brief stop at "hold." While she is the only =
analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her rece=
nt downgrades come "too little, too late."=20
Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the co=
mpany's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives=
 are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance=
, she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un=
der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said "no,=
" she says.=20
In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC "inquiry," she=
 asked Enron about the previous denial. "They told me it is an inquiry, not=
 an investigation," she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned=
 of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose stock has
fallen on concern about the largest energy trader's transactions
with affiliates, drew down $3 billion in credit to restore
confidence in its financial strength.

     The Houston-based company will use about $2.2 billion to pay
off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash,
spokesman Mark Palmer said.

     ``Nothing instils confidence like cash,'' he said.

     Enron's shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as
investors worry that the company's credit rating will be cut after
$1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments.
Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading
partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in
liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell Enron assets.
Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the company $35 million.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

     Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35 yesterday.

Enron Liked By Analysts Despite Complicated Dealings, WSJ Says
2001-10-26 06:12 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is liked by many
Wall Street analysts despite lingering questions about the power
trading company's complicated partnership transactions and the
techniques used to record earnings, the Wall Street Journal
reported in its ``Heard on the Street'' column.

     Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst David Fleischer, who owns an
undisclosed number of Enron shares, said that even though
inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the
company, that doesn't mean he will write off the industry or not
analyze Enron.

     Of the 17 analysts who follow the stock, 10 had a ``strong
buy'' or equivalent rating, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call, the paper said. Five rated it ``buy'' and one had a ``sell''
on Enron.

     Most analysts have stuck by the company, publicly dismissing
questions about Enron's accounting practices and level of
disclosure, the Journal said.

     The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about
partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.

Enron Draws Down $3 Billion From Its Credit Lines, WSJ Reports
2001-10-26 00:28 (New York)

     New York, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. drew down about
$3 billion of its available credit, the bulk of its bank credit
lines, to restore confidence in the financial strength of the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

     The energy trading company, whose shares have fallen 52
percent since Oct. 16, will use part of the money to redeem about
$1.85 billion short-term commercial debt, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.

     Enron is talking to banks about a new, multi-billion line of
credit, the paper reported, citing the unidentified person. The
steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it
has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is
disrupted, the paper said.

     Enron said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire that it
drew on its credit lines to provide more than $1 billion in cash
liquidity. The steps come a day after Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission
probe of partnerships he ran.

Corporate US on track for bailout

Battered corporate America will receive an immediate Dollars 25bn (pounds 1=
8bn) tax rebate under a Dollars 100bn eocnomic stimulation package just app=
roved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.=20
The controversial package, worth an estimated Dollars 212bn over three year=
s, includes Dollars 70bn for companies next year alone. It was approved by =
the House late on Wednesday by 216 votes to 214, but faces significant amen=
dment in the Senate, which is now under Democrat control.
It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans, who favour cor=
porate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession, and=
 Democrats - who, in a reprise of the Roosevelt "new deal", prefer to see i=
ncreased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects.=20
Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on=
 Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars 6.3bn =
to the 14 biggest corporations - which, they say, are renowned for paying l=
ittle or no tax.=20
The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative=
 minimum tax, or AMT, introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid=
 all tax payments. This, strongly supported by President Bush, would be mad=
e retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded.=20
The lobby groups and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service calcul=
ate that this would give a Dollars 1.4bn boost to computer group IBM alone,=
 while General Motors would get back Dollars 833m and General Electric Doll=
ars 671m.=20
Others to benefit include TXU, the Texas-based utility that is the US's thi=
rd largest energy supplier, which would would be given Dollars 608m. United=
 Airlines, the US's second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy=
 - would receive Dollars 371m, and Enron, the energy trading group forced t=
o sack its finance director this week, would be given Dollars 254m.=20
Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dis=
like other proposals to boost firms, which include a 30% tax break for capi=
tal investment over three years worth Dollars 39.3bn this year alone. They =
say these amount to a "giant corporate giveaway".=20
Mr Bush and other Republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would h=
elp companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay-offs=
 and invest more, prompting an economic recovery that, at best, is likely t=
o start in the new year.=20
"Businesses are America's employers. They're the hardware store, the diner =
down the street, the gas station on the corner. They're not the enemy of wo=
rking families," the author of the plan, Representative Bill Thomas of Cali=
fornia, said.=20
Democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package's=
 provisions for the growing numbers of jobless, arguing that much of the Do=

ates.=20

Harvey Pitt's S.E.C.: From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy?
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

CAN the new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws=
 and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy?=20
Harvey L. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he =
is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Ins=
titute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior lead=
ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's =
reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h=
is predecessor.=20
From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a =
respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing wa=
y.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no =
doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev=
en the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt=
's concerns about improper management of earnings.
On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement acti=
on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t=
o report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one=
 could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a =
fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised qu=
estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th=
an a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the ac=
counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff me=
mber, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer.=20
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is goi=
ng to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is crea=
te an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C=
. ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.''=20
A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client t=
o restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, a=
re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much i=
n favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview=
, ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state=
ments and restatements.''=20
Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which woul=
d certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more ag=
gressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like =
a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors=
 who try to resist misleading accounting.=20
In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization =
that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pi=
tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence.=20
The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess a=
t Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. I=
t will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accountin=
g was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai=
n -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made wi=
th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer=
.=20
''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whe=
ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur=
es.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week

1. United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest
Rule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse.=20
Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief J=
ames Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company "will pe=
rish" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have wors=
ened since the terrorist attacks. "Today, we are literally hemorrhaging mon=
ey," he wrote.=20
In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL =
(UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders=
 have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,0=
00 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expecte=
d to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings.=20
But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeli=
ng that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24=
% off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, =
UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulti=
es to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one un=
ion have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked.=20
Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but s=
ometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either=
. Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise.=20
2. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War=20
Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our an=
nihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy so=
me DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car?=20
That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that C=
ongress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism ef=
forts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded=
 the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the eco=
nomy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. "The economy is per=
haps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the wa=
r on global terrorists," says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. "Wa=
r bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism."=20
For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just su=
perfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savin=
gs bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by t=
he federal government.=20
In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war =
bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the =
same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bo=
nds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books.=20
3. Enron Again
Last week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - co=
mmentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, =
following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. =
Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the =
company on what's delicately termed a "leave of absence."=20
In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly =
reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his invol=
vement. Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake =
of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowle=
dged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confid=
ence.=20
But that won't be an easy task, given the resentment about Enron's disincli=
nation to explain its problems. One analyst called Fastow's departure "unse=
ttling," noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the =
day before. Sounding a note of exasperation, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase,=
 Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock. And th=
ere could be more trouble to come: The Securities and Exchange Commission h=
as issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions.=20
4. Gold Diggers=20
It's understandable that investors felt panicky in September. Unfortunately=
, some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds. Accordin=
g to Financial Research Corp., which tracks fund flows, the specialty preci=
ous-metals category was the best-selling equity category during September, =
with net inflows of $101 million.=20
Granted, that's not a huge sum in the mutual fund world. By comparison, dur=
ing the same month, large growth funds saw net redemptions of $7.4 billion.=
 But the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is notew=
orthy, given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long.=20
Sure, under the bizarre circumstances of late, they've enjoyed somewhat of =
a pop. According to Morningstar, the average precious-metals fund is up 10.=
08% year to date. But over the past five years, the same category lost an e=
mbarrassing 14.68%. By comparison, even large-cap growth funds -- everybody=
's favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return. In the same =
period, they were up 7.13%.=20
Moreover, circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades=
 -- a combination of attacks on the U.S. government and war -- still don't =
seem to have boosted gold prices significantly. Despite an initial surge in=
 prices after the terrorist attacks, they're again approaching their pre-Se=
pt. 11 levels. It's too early to say, but it's likely the gold bugs will co=
nfront disappointment once again.=20
5. Amazon Amazes Once Again
Amazon (AMZN:Nasdaq - news - commentary) still maintains it will become pro=
fitable by the fourth quarter. Well, at least it will post a pro forma oper=
ating profit.=20
OK, so maybe that wouldn't include Amazon's service on $2.17 billion in lon=
g-term debt or extraordinary charges. In fact, a pro forma operating profit=
 is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy, meaningle=
ss aura of minor triumph. The company still hasn't said when it will turn a=
n economic profit.=20
For that matter, even the fourth-quarter prediction is iffy. After announci=
ng the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit, CFO Warren =
Jenson added the humble qualifier, "There are no guarantees." Amazon simult=
aneously lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue, predicting that s=
ales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10% compared with a year ago=
.=20
Third-quarter trends weren't encouraging. Though sales overall were up slig=
htly in the third quarter from a year ago, revenue from the company's core =
books and music business actually fell 12%. At least the company has made p=
rogress in cutting costs: A spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses =
have decreased by 20% over the past year.=20
Incidentally, in the wake of Amazon's earnings report, two analysts made th=
e belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock, which has fallen 93% =
from its high back in December 1999. Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget an=
d SG Cowen analyst Scott Reamer downgraded the stock to "neutral" from prev=
ious buy ratings. "We thought there might be upside to our estimates," note=
d Blodget. "There wasn't."=20

NEW YORK, Oct. 25 -- Selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled=
 the stock market higher today, reversing a morning slide triggered by a pa=
ir of grim economic reports.=20
Shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly=
 well, as did energy traders, led by a surprisingly strong performance from=
 Williams Cos., a Tulsa-based energy firm that had an 83 percent jump in th=
ird-quarter net earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed rose at 9448.78, up 103.16, reversi=
ng an earlier deficit of 167 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.29,=
 to 1767.83, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was rose 12.79, to 1097.99=
.=20
Earlier, a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the=
 fallout from last month's terrorist attacks to send stocks lower. As in re=
cent sessions, however, investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good=
 news regarding individual companies.=20
Williams Cos. surpassed analysts' estimates for the third quarter and raise=
d its forecasts for full-year earnings for 2001 and 2002. Investors rewarde=
d the company by driving its shares up $1.42, to $27.32, bringing several o=
ther parts of the energy sector along with it.=20
Even the shares of Enron rose, a day after the embattled company dismissed =
its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from=
 within the company. Enron rose 28 cents, to $16.69.=20
Semiconductor shares also rebounded, led by industry bellwether Intel, up 4=
4 cents at $25.92, and Applied Materials, up $1.35 at 36.69. Leading data-s=
torage maker EMC rose $1.06, to $13.54.=20
Traders said the Senate's passage this afternoon of an anti-terrorism measu=
re also helped lift investor sentiment. Late Wednesday, the House passed a =
$100 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrori=
st attacks on the economy.=20
A surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily o=
n the market in the morning, as did poor earnings results from American Int=
ernational Group and WorldCom.=20
The Commerce Department reported orders plunged in September for the fourth=
 consecutive month. The 8.5 percent decline was far worse than the 1.3 perc=
ent dip many analysts had forecast.=20
The Labor Department also reported that the number of newly laid-off Americ=
ans filing for unemployment benefits rose by 8,000 last week, to 504,000, t=
he second-highest figure in nearly a decade and a level that is generally a=
ssociated with recessions.=20
Other Indicators=20
* The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.88, to 562.96; the Ame=
rican Stock Exchange index rose 5.10, to 828.67; and the Russell index of 2=

* Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones by 9 to 7 on the NYSE, where =
trading volume rose to 1.38 billion shares, from 1.35 billion on Wednesday.=
 On the Nasdaq, advancers outnumbered decliners by more than 3 to 2 and vol=
ume totaled 2.2 billion, up from 1.84 billion.=20
* The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose $4.38 per $1,000 invested, =
and its yield fell to 4.54 percent, from 4.59 percent late Wednesday.=20
* The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and the euro. In late New York t=
rading, a dollar bought 122.87 yen, up from 122.76 yen late Wednesday, and =
a euro bought 89.25 cents, down from 89.42 cents.=20
* Light, sweet crude oil for December delivery settled at $22.01 a barrel, =
up 32 cents, on the New York Mercantile Exchange.=20
* Gold for current delivery rose to $277.80 a troy ounce, from $275.90 on W=

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines in Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidi=

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Embattled Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available=
 bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strengt=
h and liquidity, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.=20
Enron (ENE) will use part of the money to offer to redeem around $1.85 bill=
ion in outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- accordi=
ng to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder used to provide=
 a cash cushion. This person also said that Enron was talking to its banks =
about a new multibillion-dollar credit line. Some observers thought the mov=
es were a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidit=
y should its access to bank lines be interrupted.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last f=
ew days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," sa=
id an Enron spokesman. In a prepared statement, the company's new chief fin=
ancial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we=
 are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than =
adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitme=
nts."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading firm in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's=
 largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all elec=
tricity and natural-gas trades. Thursday, for example, Enron was involved i=
n about $4 billion worth of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. It has report=
ed a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity =
of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commiss=
ion is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it di=
d with entities run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow=
, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency, Fitch=
, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade while Standard & Poors chang=
ed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Servic=
e has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade. In order to fall =
below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several no=
tches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, E=
nron shares were down six cents at $16.35.=20

NEW YORK (AP) - As it grew over the past decade into the country's largest =
natural gas and power marketing company, Enron Corp. became the de facto ba=
rometer of health within the energy trading sector.=20
Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enron's competitors based in part on=
 the huge success of the Houston-based company's business model. Now, execu=
tives and industry analysts hope to prevent Enron's internal tumult and fre=
e-falling stock price from undermining investors' confidence in the sector.=
 They say the Houston-based company's problems should be viewed in isolatio=
n and not as a broader indicator of the marketplace.
"The marketplace for natural gas and power trading is as vibrant as it was =
yesterday, a week ago or a month ago," said Jim Donnell, president of Duke =
Energy North America, a division of Duke Energy Corp. that generates and tr=
ades power.=20
That opinion appeared to gain acceptance on Thursday as shares of Dynegy In=
c., El Paso Corp. and Duke Energy Corp. rebounded from losses on Wednesday,=
 when Enron's latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of i=
ts rivals.=20
Enron's stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week (and nearly 80 p=
ercent since January) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytim=
e soon.=20
The latest troubles began Oct. 16 when Enron reported third quarter earning=
s, and a longtime concern among Wall Street analysts that executives were n=
ot entirely forthcoming only got worse.=20
First came reports that some of the company's losses stemmed from partnersh=
ips managed by Enron's chief financial officer at the time, Andrew Fastow. =
That raised concerns about a potential conflict of interest and touched off=
 an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission.=20
Then on Wednesday, one day after Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay defended Fastow=
, the company ousted him and said he would take a leave of absence.=20
"They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test=
 and they didn't come through with flying colors," said Christopher Ellingh=
aus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group in New York.=20
Enron shares have been falling all year for reasons new and old, which have=
 little to do with the company's wholesale energy business, which accounts =
for roughly 80 percent of profits.=20
Analysts insist wholesale energy marketing can be profitable even in the fa=
ce of an economic downturn and falling natural gas and electricity prices.=
=20
"Even though (Enron) shot themselves in the foot, the basic business is sti=
ll sound and not likely to disappear," Ellinghaus said.=20
UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone echoed that sentiment.=20
"The collateral damage to the rest of the space - Dynegy and El Paso - is o=
verdone," Barone said.=20
On Thursday, Williams Companies Inc. of Tulsa, Okla., reported net income o=
f $760 million and Reliant Resources Inc. of Houston reported $133 million =
in profits.=20
"It's business as usual," said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel.=20
Not for Enron, whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when =
its nascent high-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype. The dow=
nward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from =
power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of then-chief=
 executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of $638 million in the third quarter,=
 taking a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to investment losses,=
 troubled assets and unit restructurings. Excluding the charge, Enron earne=
d $393 million on $47.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending Sep=
t. 30.=20
Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enron's competitors were brought down Wednesd=
ay because of "dire" speculation that Enron's troubles might be so bad that=
 it could have difficulty paying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of r=
eceivables to companies such as Duke and Dynegy.=20
"All I'm hearing is doomsday type stuff and doomsday is not reality," Ellin=
ghaus said.=20
Enron did not return calls seeking comment Thursday.=20
Donnell of Duke Energy said the Charlotte, N.C.-based company is paying clo=
se attention to the Enron situation and that there has been no indication o=
f receivables not being paid.=20
"They continue to be one of the best functioning companies as it relates to=
 credit," he said. "They've never missed a deadline."

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-term
credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by
Standard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell
49 percent in the past week.

     S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of
``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.

     The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the
possibility that Enron won't generate enough money from selling
assets outside the main trading business to repay debt. S&P did
say that ``the strategic direction of the company is likely to
become more credit-positive in the wake of recent management
changes.''

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses from investments
outside the principal business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew
Fastow resigned yesterday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission asks for information about related-party transactions
he conducted.

     ``The S&P write up was very positive,'' said Dorothea
Matthews, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., a research firm. ``It
seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and
calm things down.''

     Shares of Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35.

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

     (Adds new Enron CFO in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will run
short on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doing
business with the largest energy broker, customers say.

     The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power and
natural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energy
risk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complex
derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of
fluctuating commodities prices.

     Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at
Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's
long-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third-
quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needs
good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from
demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron is
handling less business, Kilduff said.

     ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a major
problem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital if
things really broke down because the numbers are that big.''

     Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund for
the wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the
1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. More
than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billion
to avoid a collapse.

                         Needs Cash Daily

     Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and other
commodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments to
hedge against price swings in the goods.

     ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said.
``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demanding
different terms than before.''

     Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every
day to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with Enron.

     Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall,
while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does one
or the other every day, and someone pays the difference.

     ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,''
Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''

     Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough
money to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion in
bank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined to
protect the credit rating, Enron has said.

     ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios at
this point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.

                        Investor Questions

     Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he
ran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35
million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit,
replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.

     Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. They
fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all rate
the company's debt at investment grade.

     The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3
billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed
to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.

     The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to
meet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the sale
proceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make good
on any shortfall.

                            Little Time

     Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750
million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut
out of the money markets.

     Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short-
term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. The
company, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficulty
finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC
investigation was announced, the traders said.

     Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percent
yield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.

     ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough
time to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright,
senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates.
``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think to
pacify the market.''

                           Ripple Effect

     Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book of
hedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves so
many partners, participants and companies that a failure would
pose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-Term
Capital Management's.

     ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counter
party to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said Jeff
Caughron, manager of $400 million in investments for Tinker
Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, there
could be a big ripple effect.''

     The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won't
be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine
Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said Chris
Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group,
shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.

     ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are
fueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companies
selling power to Enron are suffering.''

     All four companies said they're trading with Enron as they
have in the past.

                         Market Maker

     Enron supplies services some customers consider
irreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges
weather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.

     The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay
Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate
at peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the dams
can't operate as well, Enron pays the district.

     ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, that
agreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.

     Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves from
electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it
helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little
rainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing so
would trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.

     ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balance
sheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.

Enron Broadband Services executives have quietly begun to inform employees =

"It's a way to structure the business to fit the opportunities that are out=
 there in the market now," Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Terrie Jame=

The London office has 20 or fewer employees, James told Dow Jones. The Sing=

Americans working in the offices would probably choose to relocate in the U=

ees.=20
James didn't know how much money Enron might save by closing the offices.=
=20
The decision by Enron, the leading bandwidth market-maker, shows that inter=
national bandwidth markets are having tough times like the U.S. market.=20

Calpine:No Exposure To Enron; No Calif Pwr Contract Talks

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Calpine Corp. (CPN) has no credit exposure to tradin=
g partner Enron Corp. (ENE), Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conferenc=
e call. And the company hasn't been contacted by the state of California ab=
out renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the=
 company signed with the state earlier this year.=20
Calpine's diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share =
compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year. Setting Calpine's co=
nsistent earnings growth aside, Wall Street analysts in Thursday's conferen=
ce call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry, li=
ke Enron, California, and whether the U.S. will have a surplus of electric =
power stations in a few years.
Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of=
 the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this=
 week. Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure t=
o Enron.=20
"We continue to assess the situation, but right now don't have any net expo=
sure to Enron," said Calpine's vice president of corporate risk management,=
 Paul Pasoli. "We continue to trade with them. We will adjust our credit th=
reshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating."=20
When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be ha=
lted immediately, Pasoli said that, in fact, Calpine would owe Enron a litt=
le money.=20
In another energy industry area of concern, Calpine was asked about the sta=
te of California's stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars=
 of long-term power contracts. Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under=
 those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now th=
an when California bought this past winter and spring.=20
"Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif cont=
racts. In general, we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties t=
o do so as well," said Calpine cheif executive, Peter Cartwright. "If there=
 are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win, we would be =
happy to look at that, if California asks. We've done that many times."=20
As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its p=
rogram to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is abo=
ut three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capac=
ity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the d=
ifference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said tha=
t difference, or "spark spread," has grown the past few months. Furthermore=
, the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all pr=
ojects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment.=20
As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually thr=
ough 2005. Calpine will fund near-term cash needs in the debt markets and w=
on't issue new stock until its stock price rises substantially.=20

Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. Files Class Action Suit Against Enron Corp=
oration

10/25/2001
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Spector, Roseman & Ko=
droff, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the=
 United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston D=
ivision, against defendants Enron Corporation ("Enron" or the "Company") (N=
YSE: ENE), Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behal=
f of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between Janu=
ary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").=20
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of =
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,=
 by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J=
anuary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the pr=
ice of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron i=
ssued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and=
 operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Servi=
ces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan=
y's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with =
success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that=
 the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of th=
e Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with ce=
rtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financ=
ial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets=
 on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surp=
rised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring ch=
arges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the=
 third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently,=
 Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind=
ing of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled =
by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin=
g more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o=
f the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the =
price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period,=
 Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron=
 common stock to unsuspecting investors.
If you purchased Enron securities during the Class Period, you may, no late=
r than December 21, 2001, move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff in this =
class action. A Lead Plaintiff is a representative, chosen by the Court, th=
at acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. The P=
rivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 directs Courts to assume th=
at the class member(s) with the "largest financial interest" in the outcome=
 of the case will best serve the class in this capacity. Courts have discre=
tion in determining which class member(s) have the "largest financial inter=
est," and have appointed Lead Plaintiffs with substantial losses in both ab=
solute terms and as a percentage of their net worth. If you have sustained =
substantial losses in Enron securities during the Class Period, please cont=
act Spector, Roseman & Kodroff, P.C. at classaction@srk-law.com for a more =
thorough explanation of the Lead Plaintiff selection process. If you have r=
elatively small losses, your ability to participate in any recovery will be=
 protected by the Lead Plaintiff(s), and you need take no affirmative steps=
 at this time.=20

Enron Draws Down Credit Facility

10/25/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) drew on committed lines of credit t=
o provide cash liquidity of more than $1 billion.=20
In a press release Thursday, the energy company said it has "more than adeq=
uate" liquidity to fulfill business commitments.
Enron said the credit action is a step to restore investor confidence, and =
it plans to update investors in several days regarding plans to maintain it=
s long-term credit rating.=20
Earlier Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its long-term ratings outlook f=
or Enron to negative due to concerns that the company's significant drop in=
 market capitalization has hurt the company's flexibility and could impair =
plans to rebuild the balance sheet.=20
Over the past week, Enron's shares have fallen more than 40% amid negative =
news from the company.=20
The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares closed Thursday at $16.=
35, down 6 cents, or 0.4%, on composite volume of 39,212,300 shares. Averag=
e daily volume is 7,832,606 shares.=20
Early last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss, re=
sulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. Enron also disclosed a $1.2 billi=
on reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminati=
ng certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed=
 by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.=20
On Wednesday, Enron replaced Fastow with Jeff McMahon, effective immediatel=
y.=20

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some bond traders believe En=
ron's bonds won't continue to hold up better the company's stock.=20
The company's five-year bond has decreased about 16% in the past two weeks,=
 much less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 di=
sclosure of the $1.01 billion charges.=20
But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage po=
ints above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is widening from about 3=
 percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron is still an investment-gra=
de credit, that kind of "spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with=
 a credit rating of single B or lower, the Journal said.=20
On Wednesday, Fitch put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downg=
rade, following a similar move by Moody's Investor Service earlier this wee=
k.=20
Several energy trading companies said Thursday that although they have conc=
erns about Enron's credit quality, they have made almost no changes in poli=
cy concerning the company.=20
Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) said they have=
n't changed their credit policy concerning Enron, which accounts for about =
a quarter of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets.=20
The Journal reported that bond traders expect Enron executives to meet with=
 rating agencies, debt-trading desks, big bond holders and banks next week.=

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)
2001-10-25 18:41 (New York)

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)

     (Company corrects structure of standard compensation package
in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,
employees are sharing the pain.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to the
bulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensation
package, most employees get stock options equal to
5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman Meredith
Philipp said.

     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the end
of 2000, all at average prices above the company's current share
price. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.

     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said.

     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options in
December or January. Employees can't cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. At
the end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,
the board set a strike price of about $80.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.
They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.

     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, who
was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. One
partnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62
million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO late yesterday.

                         Unvested Options

     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employees
hadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million of
them, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 a
share. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.

     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries, such as technology and telecommunications, say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options.

     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuantic
Buck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensation
consulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, and
it's a continued disincentive to them.''

     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice its
employees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock option
grant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role as
the company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15
years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.
Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.

     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent of
employees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but was
exercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above
$36.88 since Aug. 29.

Once again, it appears we have changed a price desk deal without letting them know.  I hope everyone understands how bad this makes our entire team look.  This issue continues to be brought up in the staff meeting and we are always the cause of it.  This is the second time in less than a week and we have gone over this several times.  Next time this happens, someone is liable to get an exit early pass from the floor for good.  To keep this from happening we will now practice the following Rule:
Anytime a price desk deal that involves the central desk needs to be changed, the person that runs the central book will not leave the floor until Errol or Joey tells you that there book is ok.  If that happens to be midnight, sorry.  That is the rule and there will be absolutely no exceptions.  Sorry I have to be a jerk, but it is obvious that being nice about it has not worked.  Thanks for your help in eliminating this in the future.

That works out to $500 a couple for the week(6 nights).  That will give us 5 days to ski(or 4 on 1 off).
Continental flys directly to Steamboat for $300 roundtrip.
Need to know interest level ASAP. We have to pay 50% upon booking the house and %50 within 30 days of arrival.
I will pay the %50 up front, I just want a firm committment that you will be going.
Take a look at the house:

It is the bettger house
PL

Here in lies the problem.  These fix price locks are not deal specific - rather counterparty specific.  Therefore, we can not modify prices until the end of the month when we know which deals flowed volumes and which did not.  This means we have to do this the last two days of the month along with all of the other things we are doing.  For every month since May - except September we have been able to do this.  It just so happens the one time we do not do it, we had the most locks.  The problems we had in previous months were due to liquidations hitting central that should have hit Chicago.  Same deals, different issues.  Thanks.
PL

Can we get the fixed price lock-ins with Peoples both corrected for previous month and booked correctly going forward?  Who actually does this?

John

I think the confusion with this lies in the fact that last month we had the same issue and I thought you put these deals that are desk to desk in tagg back on my region.  These relate to fixed price lock ins with Peoples.  I think what happened last month happened again this month which is settlements and the risk person did not get the fixed price lock ins done until the following month.  We will have to try and work on this for this month.  The problem is that they can take their volumes on several deals and we have to wait until it is completely scheduled.  Sorry for the confusion.
PL

Melba and Phillip,

What has changed on the Peoples region that would lead you to believe these deals that we previously determined to not belong on your desk for the months of June - August now in fact belong to your desk?  These deals are the same deals that represent the 3.8 MM adjustment that cleared off those three months.

Thanks,

Jim

Guys:  Just a reminder to have everyone check their physical Index deals carefully.  We have been discussing this issue with Tara and thought that it was a one time issue that had been resolved, but today, Tuesday, we found that EOL is still booking certain Fiz Index deals incorrectly.

Look for a 0.00 in Basis.

On most of ours the deals did not show up in any of our calcs because the Nymex reference is not populated.

Bruce Mills called me.  He said you told him to work on it with me.  I left him a message on Friday, but I haven't heard back.  Below is my spreadsheet of the variances.  Why don't you take a look at it and let me know if you have any questions.  I have compared what Consumers invoiced to what we have in Unify.  I haven't made it through 1999 yet, so that tab is blank.  I need help on the deals that have differences and the ones that Consumers did not invoice me for.  I have tried to highlight them all in red.  I can come down in the morning to go over it with you, if you have time.

Megan

 

I can not remember if I called you Friday or not.  Let me know when you want to get together and go over the consumers stuff.  Sorry if I forgot, the mornings are the best for me.
PL

Just let me know when you're ready and I'll come down. 

how about Friday?

How is this week to look at Consumers?  I have a spreadsheet put together back to Jan 00.  I have not made it to 1999 yet, but I'm working on it.  I'm available any time this week.  You name the time and place and I'll be there.

unfortunately, I do not have any information about these deals.  With these being IT day deals, the schedulers and traders will have all of your information.  sorry.
PL

I am not sure if they have confirmed either deal.  However, deal #1034254 was never pathed by us, whereas 1027152 was.  Therefore, nothing billed out under 1034254.

Bonnie - I am including you on this note in case you can add anything about the pathing of the two deals mentioned in this note.  Niether CMS orgaination shows anything on Trunkline that matches this.  We spoke briefly about this last week.

Phillip - I am including you in case you can add any clarity or determine who we did this deal(s) with.

Thank you,
Scott
5-7213

if they are not confirming this deal are they confirming 1034254?

Tom,

In contacting our scheduler and subsequently a CMS scheduler, neither CMS Field Services nor CMS Marketing, Services, and Trading are able to identify the deal.  Currently, I am preparing to fax a copy of our confirmation on the deal to CMS Field Services,  Again, it is not an executed copy, but I am assuming they may not have sent it back.  Furthermore, the CMS Field Services scheduler has told me that they don't even schedule any Trunkline deals.

Considering all of this, I am assuming the worst - that unless we can provide a trader name etc. they will short pay on this deal.  So, do you know who represented us with CMS on this deal any one that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  We are getting ready to settle for Sep prod so any help asap would be appreciated.

Scott
5-7213

They do not recognize that deal at all.

The most recent name and number is a Conoco trader.  I have a confirmation on this deal with CMS.  However, it is not an executed copy (i.e. sent back or confirmed by CMS).  Is there some one who represented us with CMS on this that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  I will attempt to contact the scheduler in the mean time but any help would be good.

thanks.

I never talk to these people so the numbers I have are old. Do they not recognize this deal?  It was scheduled so I assume the counterparty is correct. I have another number for Mike at 281-293-2203.  It could be old also.

Tom,

The below number is for a Duke Energy trader.  So, either this deal is booked wrong or this is not the correct trader name.  Please advise.

Tony ? at 713-6276215

Tom,

Please inform me of the CMS Field Services trader on deal #1027152 plus any additional information that you might have.

NXAVC is just like nymex, it settles as one price for the entire month.  I don't know what you mean look for pricing for 9/11-9/14.  NXAVC is a monthly index.  Please clarify.
PL

Phillip,

Agave had several days incorrect and has corrected them, however my counterpart informed me that they have not been able to confirm the pricing for days 9/11 - 9/14. Those four days were priced at $29.53. Is there anyway to find out if the crude guys can provide support for those day? I would think there may have been some special pricing provisions after the events of the 11th.

Thanks,
Genaro

see this spreadsheet, you will see that previous months match.  This spreadsheet comes straight from our crude guys.  If the counterparty continues to disagree, get documentation from them and we can take it to the crude guys.  Thanks.
PL

Philip,

The attached file contains settle prices for crude.  The NXAVC code price is in cell "D48" which I have highlighted in yellow.  There is also historical data in the file where you can verify prior months.  If you have any other questions please ask.

I am not familiar with Wyatt Howell, but I have been away from Winston

would like to get this over with as soon as possible, so please proceed with
the attorney of your choice.

Dianne Love

Dianne

I have not received any information from Jeff Mobley.   I have  called his
office as recent as today.  The petition for removal is ready to sign but I
have got to retain local counsel in Winston County for the purpose of filing
as it will be cheaper than having me drive to Winston County.  Are you
familiar with Wyatt Howell or his firm.  That is the firm I would like to
associate.  Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

Tammy

Just touching base to see where we are with Daddy's estate.

no response.  I have prepared a petition to have your sister removed.  I
will get it to you for your review prior to filing same.

Just touching base to see if you heard from Jeff.

Legally I cannot contact her since she is represented by an attorney.  I
will follow up with Jeff.

I can also provide you with my sister's contact info if you need it.

I have heard nothing.  I have been out of town for about 12 days and have
just returned today. I thought there might be a response from Jeff but none.
I will follow up.

Tammy,

I'm just touching base to see if you have heard anything from Jeff.

just think if he came to camp on time how many yards he might have.  I am a big Lester Hayes fan, I wish they still let them wear stick em!!!  I think he called it stick em and he just ran his hands through his hair.

I am sorry, but that will be the only game the chargers play the rest of

FYI :
When entering deals with Canada, please remember to have the counter parties in a financial deal to be ECC and Riskmantra and a physical deal it will be ENA to ECC.
Also remember on gas daily out months(2 legs) that the book on the gas daily swap leg needs to be INTRA-CND-WE-GD not INTRA-CAND-WEST(this book is for basis piece).

ALSO:
Please remember to check your new deals completely every day, this will help eliminate future OA variances.  Do not rely on your trader to catch mistakes.

Thanks.

This report just in on the wire.....
3 students at Louisiana Tech have been detained on possible immigration violations, their names:
Bin Losin, Bin Cryin, Bin Whinin
 
They were captured at a football game between La Tech and Auburn University
 

Latest news reports advise that a cell of 7 terrorists has been operating in the Alabama area. Law enforcement officials advised earlier today that 6 of the 7 have been detained.

The FBI stated that the terrorists bin Fishin, bin Huntin, bin Drinkin, bin Cussin, bin Fightin, and bin Dippin Skoal have been arrested on Immigration charges. 

The FBI advised further that they can find no one fitting the description of the seventh cell member, bin Workin.

Police are confident that anyone in Alabama who looks like he's bin Workin will be very easy to spot.

I have a pre existing meeting on this day, I can attend the Monday session.

Russ/George - has this new location been mapped to the same curves as the previous location - PGLC/NGPL?  From my standpoint, I think that is the only thing that needs to be done with the exception of changing/adding swaps on these deals.  Please let me know.  Thanks.

We have moved november deals to the new location?? is that going to be a problem??  They were previously on PGLC/NGPL/909285 and they were moved to PGLC/NGPL/TTP.  These deals will need to be moved to the new trade zone of TTP.    Is there anything else we need  to do for Sitara?? and if so who do we need to contact?   THanks!!

COra

 It is important to note that no deals can be moved to this new location until this location is mapped in Sitara,(mid, notional, and gas daily curves)
otherwise any deals booked there will error out in CPR.

Thanks
GG

FYI

Ok i am getting with Patrice.  We were thinking that it would be November 1 but I think Patrice wants this set up ASAP
I will get back with you as quickly as I know.  Thanks!!!

Cora, 
	George Grant has set up the new Trade Zone, TTP, for Meter No. TTP, on PGLC.  He has told me there are 44 deals behind Meter No. 

TTP with the Trade Zone of PGLC.  Please let me know when a good time to change the Trade Zone is.

Thank you,

Mr. Grant,

	Cora Pendergrass is  asking for a Trade Zone in PGLC to be created.  She also would like me to change the Trade Zone on meter 

TTP to this new Trade Zone.  She has told me she has already changed the deals behind the meter to match the new Trade Zone.  

I will change the Trade Zone with your final approval.

Trade Zone:	  PGLC TTP		Meter:	TTP		Pipecode:      PGLC

Please let me know as soon as possible.

Will you please take of this.
Effective November 1, 2001 we need to set up a new trade  zone for PGLC.  The new zone should be called PGLC TTP.  The meter number TTP should be mapped to this new trade zone.  It is currently under NGPL.  We have moved deals for November 1, 2001 to this new point on ENA, EMW and ENV.  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Also we are trying to get to a point to upload this file for next month so when this is updated can you let me know?  Thanks for your help!!

Cora

attached is a file from the IT team for the tagg numbers that are in the Enovate books.  Please shout if you have any questions.  Thanks.
PL
 

Here is a list of the types of deals that always fail:
GDD Dawns deals EOL#2054274
Physical dawn deals fail - EOL will only let one trader map their deals to one physical book(don't think you can fix this one) EOL#2047749
Mich basis swaps EOL #2054712

This should be a comprehensive list.  Thanks.
PL

see this spreadsheet, you will see that previous months match.  This spreadsheet comes straight from our crude guys.  If the counterparty continues to disagree, get documentation from them and we can take it to the crude guys.  Thanks.
PL

Philip,

The attached file contains settle prices for crude.  The NXAVC code price is in cell "D48" which I have highlighted in yellow.  There is also historical data in the file where you can verify prior months.  If you have any other questions please ask.

This was sent to me by a friend who also has a  senior at CHS.  It was put
together by Jamie Wax and Paul Taranto and is  truly profound.   Please
take the time to view it and make sure your  sound is on, the music makes
it.

Vicki

Be sure to visit this  sight.  It is very well done.  Some of you know
Jamie Wax  and  others will have heard the name Taranto because Darlene,
who taught Hank and  Mamie and will, hopefully, teach Mak in 5th grade is
Paul's wife.  Paul and  Jamie wrote the musical "Evangeline" (based on the
Acadian story of Evangeline).   The music is from that play.

Take Care

I have seen several tributes -- but this one is really special.  New photos
of the WTC
disaster - such an unbelievable nightmare.  Take a few minutes to watch
this.  It's worth it.
-- Jarja

A  guy in Baton Rouge -- Mason Wood -- put together this incredible
montage of the images from 9/11/01 that is incredibly poignant and well
presented.  You've got to see it to appreciate it.  It is set to music
written by Jamie Wax and Paul Taranto from the musical "Evangeline".
They didn't realize what a profoundly appropriate backdrop it
would make to express a country's sentiments.  Put it on and turn it
up!  Then send this on.  I did.

maybe it was over the internet that the bread was so expensive.  You guys still have charger fever out there after a few loses?
PL

That is cool . The price per loaf in SD is about $ 2.95 at Cost co . The
soup would be a good idea
as it is starting to get cold. I think we tried on line and it had to be
bought in the store.

Jilly

We have actually been able to find that bread here at Sam's, so we are
absolutely set man.  If they stop selling it, we can get it over the
internet, it is just a little pricier.  You need to get us to start buying
it here and shipping to you man - Sam's has it for less than $4 a loaf.  I
think Ashley said it is close to $6 in San Diego.  We still need to get you
some soup don't we?

Hey Phillip give him the book and portfolio names...........

I think we know the problem...now we just need to fugure how to get it fixed.  Easier said than done man!!!!!!!

 The log file on Web does not have any error on these three curves. What is the book name ?

 I think there is something else there . Let me know the book and real-portfolio name.

 Nilay

Yes Nilay I thought the curves below had been mapped to OMICRONS.......why has nothing happened to her VaR?  Nilay let me or Burton know what we need to do....this is urgent!!!

Bharat

Bharat,

We never had to map curves to Omicron.  I thought that it was done by either RAC or IT.  What is the process?  Let's know ASAP so that VaR can be re-run.

Can you map the following three curves to Omicron curves.  Nilay did his side and I need you to do the other side according to the IT guys.
GDP-St.CLAIR		Omicron 14
GDP-NGPL(IA-IL	Omicron 11
GDP-MONCHY		Omicron 11

Can you let me know when this is done so that I can get Souad's VaR rerun.  Thanks for your help.  You also need to let me know if you guys can go to lunch on me on Friday.

Hey Phillip,
These are the unmapped curves.  Please let me know what OMICRONS they should be mapped to and I'll have Nilay do it.  This is your problem.  Large hedge benefits are not being captured in her books.

Phillip,

I have a Central region OA variance with AEC Marketing which involves TAGG # EC3704.P. I can not find which deal this TAGG goes with. Can you provide me with a deal # for TAGG EC3704.P.

Thanks,
Genaro

Do not suspend this CPID, because we have physical and gas daily deals that are active in this book.  Sorry for the delay.  Thanks for your help on this.
PL

Phillip:

Can you please review these archived RisktRAC book ids and determine if we can archive this CPID.  I noted that there is a PHY book which is receiving a PostID, but I do not know if it has any active deals against it.  Please consider that in order to SUSPEND a CPID there can be no active deals in any deal entry system.  If we can not archive all Risktypes then we can not "SUSPEND" the CPID.  Please read the information below in the original document for additional data.

Please send the following to the regional controllers as they look at these books on a daily basis.

Thanks

All:

Attached please review a detail of books marked as "To be Archived" on the Active/Inactive website.  These books have already been archived on RisktRAC, so no positions will be captured going forward.  In order to close the Risk Loop we need to have these counter parties SUSPENDED on the various deal entry systems.  By changing the status of the Counter party codes we do not impact the data related to these counter parties.  The data will still be there and edits of existing deals will be allowed, however no new deals would be allowed for these counter parties.

Please review the list of books and send an email approving the status change to "SUSPENDED" on the deal entry systems for the books related to your own Business Units.  Please note that in order to "SUSPEND" the counter party code all risk types for that code must be suspended (i.e. IDX,BAS,PRC,GDL,GDI & PHY).  If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at ext 54751.

Due to the urgent nature of this request, I kindly ask that you reply by Friday Oct 5 or at your earliest convenience.   

Thank you for your time and assistance in completing this task.

Thanks,

correct.  The information contained in this book matches the information that is in another book that you capture in our P&L.  Thanks.
PL

Please bare with me.  This means that this book will not feed into the NGP&L because it is for position purposes and has no P&L associated with it, so I do not need to run it during close.  Right?

Thanks  -A

This book simply replaces a book that we were officializing for position purposes only.  We have a separate gas daily calc that is for value that goes into our P&L.  Nothing has changed with that book.  Please shout with anymore questions.  Thanks.

Phillip,

Is this new book (?Y) going to roll into the Intra Ontario DPR or have its own?  We just want to make sure we pick up these new gas daily rolls.

Thanks,

Amanda,

Can you check with Phillip and find out the details on this book.  From the description, it looks like they are trying to get spreadsheet information into RiskRAC, however I am not sure how this will impact our process, if any.

Another question...last month "Z was set up (Michigan Gas Utility).  Jad told me that it was inactive, and I wanted to check if that was still the case.

Thanks again,
Amanda

I checked with Phillip Love and he said that it will be its own book, but that it needs to remain inactive until we start putting deals into it.  He just wants the book set up so that we can start putting deals in when we're ready.

Philip,

I have set up a new position called Central - ENA-IM MGU. When you have time see if you can access it, that way when we do decide
to roll it up into the overall Central position, we will know that there shouldn't be any security issues to contend with.

GG

Yes it will.  This deal is still in the structuring stage.  We simply wanted to get the books set up in TAGG and Sitara for if and when this deal goes live.  I will keep you posted.  I think that logistics is also going to be setting up a pipe called MGU that will have all of these deals on them.  I will get with you when I hear the final so that we can map the correct curves to these locations.  Thanks.

A new Central desk has been set up "ENA - IM MGU" in Sitara.

Attached is a book request for two new books - one for Lavorato and one for Cuilla.  Due to the problems we had last week/this weekend that you guys helped us try and resolve, we are going to have to go the route of Canada on these Aeco deals and book a spreadsheet for VaR purposes.  Please set the two books up like Calgary's book(Sheet 1 on the attached file) We need to start doing this tonight, because Hunter and Lavorato want their VaR reported correctly tonight.  They both plan on altering their positions and utilizing all of their VaR.  I apologize for the short notice and appreciate all of your help so that I can get this fixed for tonight's VaR.  Please let me know any additional information I can provide you.  Thanks.

FYI, I will show you how to work this spreadsheet, just call this guy and tell him what you are going to name the file and why.  Tell him it is like Brian Gillis' file in Canada.  He needs to know the prefix you are going to call the file and then you attach the current date in the MMDDYYYY format.
Thanks.

Note that you must also get Wei Hu to set it up so that it will accept the spreadsheet - he will need a name that you will use - an example is CAND_ED10122001.xls

I am in

Our game is at 6 this week. Let me know if you're in.

I think the only other solution is to post two curves, one with an SP and one with PR.  You should be able to simply set up the same curves as risk type PR and have it look to the SP curve.   Then you would publish two curves with the exact same name and value, just two different risk types.  The only other option I see is to change the deals back to the "old" aeco curve that we used prior to this.
PL

Brian,
Please help us resolve the issue around curve:

GD-AECOCD/FRWKD

The issue is that this curve is only for risk type "SP" as well as having prices posted for only one 1 reference date, i.e. today.

There are only two solutions:
1.	We need you to rename it from risk type "SP" to risk type "PR" 
a.	Post prices for balance of month, currently you are only posting a price for one day.
2.	Or, we need you to put out a brand new curve out tonight for this deal.
a.	Book admins would have to move all positions to this new curve today
b.	This new curve would have to have Book type code M, and curve type code PR
c.	Map it to omicron 9, primary curve mapping AECO/Basis, vol group CGPR/EMPRESS
d.	Prices have to be posted for daily term structure.  

This is urgent as Lavorato has a position on this curve and is rather firmly demanding that VAR be captured.

To all, am I thinking about this correctly?

Thanks,
Frank

PS.  If Brian is unable to post curve, maybe we can post it here.  (i.e. we cannot have VAR without price and vol curve)

Kam Keiser suggested I give you a call, the auditors have requested all the deals for the Chicago office books.

As most of you already know, it has been a crazy weekend for some of us.  I'm going to address why all this happened, what we have done, and the ongoing problems we are having?

About 8 months ago Martin Cuilla took a position on a curve called GD-AECOUSD-DAIL.  On Friday he wanted to move this position to another curve called GD-AECOCD/FRWKD.  We had being seeing the position come in on the bench report but apparently VaR was not being captured on it.  It was not in the Primary/Secondary curve mapping table in Risktrac and was not mapped to an intra-month curve either (OMICRON).  

On Friday evening I asked Burton to map the new curve in the primary /secondary table and Virendra to map it to OMICRON_9.  If this would have worked we expected Cuillas VaR to fall by approx. $800K given the risk structure of his positions.  But the desired results were not achieved.  

On Saturday with the help of Ramesh, Virendra and Burton we tried several different combinations of mappings with no positive results.  The positions do not seem to be coming in as we are not picking up the book in Component Var.  The book should be INTRA-ONTARIO-CAD2.  It exists but, there are no positions in it.  

The only reason this would happen if the curve had no Volatilities or Prices associated with it.  We need to find out why this is so?  Understand also that AECOCD/FRWKD is a derived curve so it has no Prices and Vols of it's own but takes it from AECO-CDN/IM.  We have also mapped AECO-CDN/IM to CGPR-AECO/BASIS and to OMICRON_9 but still are not getting any changes.  

Ramesh, Burton Virendra, and Bruce have all worked very hard this weekend, despite having other work related commitments, to try to resolve this, and have gone over and above what was expected of them.  But despite all our efforts this is still a problem that needs addressing.  

Cuilla is very concerned about this because Lavorato is watching him.  I have to answer to him tomorrow and cannot use systems issues as an excuse.  I want us as a team to look at this tomorrow and in the short-run fix Cuillas VaR.  We also want curve mapping to become a more front-end solution (with very few users) because of their (the front office) knowledge of where the different curves need to be mapped.  Kam Keiser will help us with this.

In the long-run I don't want any of us to have to do this again and want to identify a solution.  Ramesh has rightly pointed out that this will take time and resources on his side.  Given the speed of the work in this place none of us have either extra time or resources but, we have to find a way and, most of all be patient while we address these issues.

Please understand that tomorrow may be a little hectic for all concerned parties but to be patient while we try to reach the root of the problem.  Nilay we will need your expertise about curve mappings, and OMICRONS, for this?  

Thanks again for all your help this weekend.......

Can you do the same thing with a different book id?  Instead of book counterparty FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankruptcy book from NG-Price.  Financial deals only.  Thanks.  Let me know if you need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterday, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yesterday.
PL

Deal moves has been completed and retranslated.

Cecilia

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

Thanks

Please move the following book to book trades with Canada from NG-Price to Bankruptcy:
FT-Cand-Termin
Ft-Cand-Gone-PR

Pleae let me know when this is done, we are waiting to calc today on this.  Thanks.

IT fixed the curves and Burton fixed them on his side, the VaR should be virtually nonexistent.  I am also noticing a high VaR for Virawan Yawaponsiri, can you also run one on hers please.  Sorry to continue to bother you with this, Jeff Gossett just wants this resolved ASAP.  Thanks.
PL

You know what he's talking about.....?  Talk to Burtaon Mcintyre if you don't.....
It will get fixed

 Bharat ,
 I've done the mapping of omicron but you need to contact book administrators to do the sec-prim. mapping as I don't have permission to do that.

 Thanks.

Lets make it for like an hour.  I think once we get together we are going to find that we all have a lot of questions.  How about next week?  Like Wednesday afternoon.  Thats the only day that I can do it.

 What do you think about setting up a meeting between your group and mine in which each of us gives a short 15 minute presentation on what we do and how things other groups do affect our group.  If you think we will need more time, maybe we set up two meetings.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

sure.  I will have it to you in the morning.

Another request - can you provide a report that breaks out the monthly physical volume for the NSS 2 program starting in March 01.

Question for NetCo employees:
The new corp id's xfer to UBS is being considered for this Sunday.  Hence, no start menu access to estate.  You will still have access to NT estate drive data to copy.
Does anyone have the need to retain a estate id for support estate application during the last week?  Exceptions have to be authorized.
Wanted to get a preliminary need analysis...
 
This was sent by an IT manager, let me know your thoughts... O

sorry to keep bothering you.  It looks like Souad's VaR continues to go down, but her net positions 5 contracts and her VaR is over $300K.  Can you verify that it is her Aruba book that is causing all of the VaR.  She only has positions at about 5 locations and they should all be mapped to the same omicron curve and either NG or Chi. Gate.  I would think that there would not be that much difference between NG and Chi Gate.  Any assistance is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

thanks.  FYI - we will have a pretty big book move for you around lunch tomorrow and need it before 3:30 if possible.  We will be moving third party financial deals(ENA is the Enron counterparty) from NG-PRICE to ENA-FT-WC-SJ.  I will get you the list before lunch tomorrow, just thought you could get started on the script.  Thanks again.
PL

Deal moves has been completed and retranslated.

Cecilia

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

Thanks

Please move the following book to book trades with Canada from NG-Price to Bankruptcy:
FT-Cand-Termin
Ft-Cand-Gone-PR

Melba and I just noticed there are two lone liquidations for Texex Energy Partners Ltd for August 2001 production that are linked to Sitara deals that say they are for August 2002.  Which year is correct?

Sitara 848155	August 2002	Tagg VG6573.1	August 2001
Sitara 848158	August 2002	Tagg VG6577.1	August 2001

The exposure on these two liquidations together would be $67,911	expense to the desk.

Let me know what we should do.

this post id for FT-IM-CENTR-CAD-GDL and it is official.  For some reason it is not coming through risktrac.  There are no deals in this book.

2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG

5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

FYI, 
I spoke with the erms team about the problem we have with curveview going through runm.  If you open runm on your PC instead of a sun machine, you need to open curveview first.  If open curveview before any other applications, the screen will be blue and all others will be set up correctly as well.  According the Erms guys this is an ancient program and they are unable to fix the logic.  Pass this on to your groups.

I think it would look very good if you attend, I only caution you to pay close attention because the two guys have been known to ask tough questions.

According to our benchmark guys up here, it looks like the Central Transport GDL book did not make it into risktrac under souad.  The book is named FT-Central-opt-gdl.  I also should have asked you to send the FT-Peoples-GDI book over to Souad.  It appears that the remaining FT-Central-Opt- books (PRC,BAS,IDX) are under Martin Cuilla, these should be under Geoff Storey.  Can you please make these changes.  Thanks for all of your help.
PL 

The only FT-Central-Opt book that should move to her is the GDL.  The others should remain with Geoff Storey.  She also needs to have the INTRA-CNT-TRANS-PHY book.  Sorry for the mistake.

Aruba-Sply is an active book, there are just a few deals and there are two with external counterparties.

Phillip

Please take a look at the emails below and let me know what you think about the ARUBA?

Thanks

Keith
Keith -

Anything in risktrac that is "-PHY" is intra-month.  Anything with "-PRC",  "-BAS", "-IDX", "-GDI",  are all "term" books.  There are some rules around "-GDL" where it is intra-month for all but two days at the end of each month.

The OIL-NG (Lavo's) book would only have internal deals.  That may be why his book is not in credit.  Not really sure what the deal is with ARUBA-SPLY.  You should probably give Phillip Love a call.

Jeff-

I'm looking with the AGG-CREDIT portfolio to determine if the portfolio content is complete/correct.  In doing a comparison between AGG-CREDIT and AGG-PROD-DPR-BU, the following books are shown as active in AGG-PROD but not included in CREDIT.  Any thoughts on whether or not these should be included/excluded?  Based on the book id, I assume they are not intramonth - thus should likely be included.  

ARUBA-SPLY-PRC	US Gas Central		
OIL-NG-HDG-C-CA-GDL	US GAS Financial		

Separately I heard that there are books labeled as intramonth that include forward positions & vice versa forward books that contain intramonth positions.  Do you have a listing of these?

Thanks

separate region.  It is within the Mich P&L.  Also starting in October, Central transport will no longer be in FT-OC, it will be in Aruba and needs to continue to roll up to Central.  Do I need to call you back?

work with ed on this and please do this asap.  Check the rest of your books as well please.  Rember this will be any deal with Transcanada and any other canadian counterparty.  Or search in TAGG for your book with ECC as the Enron counterparty - should take 5 minutes.  Thanks.

sounds good, I heard from Bruce that the booking is not going to well.  I don't think it is that complicated, but I will be happy to do it tomorrow.  Any luck on getting it into an existing book and not having to calc another book from here on out?  Hopefully we can do it tomorrow since it is not going live until 11/01.  Talk to you in the morning.

We do not receive this information currently - Jackson Logan forwards the email to us currently.  I would appreciate having myself added to the list for email notification.  Since there will be an allocation to my cost center, please limit access to this to myself - Bruce Mills does not need access.  Please call if you have any questions.
PL

Jackson Logan mentioned that you need access to information from Canadian Enerdata.  We are currently in the process of renegotiating/renewing our agreement and I am trying to identify users who need continued access to this data.  Are you currently
receiving the data?  If so, would you like to continue receiving it in the future?  Please read my initial message below.

Thanks,
Julie

I am not certain as to weather they are on the list or not.  The best thing to do would be to call them.

Thanks,

Jackson Logan

Thanks.  Do you know if they are currently receiving it?  They were not on the list that the vendor provided.

Julie

I do not need to receive this publication anymore, however, I am aware that Phillip Love and Bruce Mills need to receive this.

Thank you,

Jackson Logan

You are listed as receiving information either by email or fax from Canadian Enerdata.  Our agreement with Canadian Enerdata is up for renewal and we need to identify whether or not you need continued access to this information.  Upon renewal, if you are a continued user, a portion of the cost will be allocated to your cost center.

Please respond to this message and let me know if you need continued access.

I appreciate your help.

I have never heard of this location.  I only see a basis and index curve for this, no intra month, Storey has this location in his curve file.  We have no deals at this location.  Does Canada?  We do not do the pub posting on Mich_CG-GD, rates does this one.  I would think they should post the NGI as well.
PL

Is there a problem with this curve?

This is TIGHT!!!!!

Happy shooting!!

http://www.fieler.com/terror/

If you want an updated value on the deal, give the ticket numbers that need to be modified/deleted to Bruce and he can get it taken care of.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
PL

This is an update to keep you posted on recent changes:

The October start has been waved-off.  November is now the firm target.  Russell is planning to have the contract executed a week from today, Oct 5th.

The Mich vs ML7 and Consumers vs ML7 basis spreads have been moved back into the main body of the summary sheet.  We are going to use those tickets.

Geoff said to drop the two NYMEX fuel hedge tickets.  He is not going to put that hedge on with the NYMEX desk.

The contract language hasn't evolved in a manner that supports the 2nd and 3rd winter Mich and Consumers FPPrgm.  Therefore, that volume will revert from FPPrgm to Mich index sale.

The treatment of summer injection cost still has not been resolved.  If MGU agrees to bear that cost adjustments will be required to our Mich index sale ticket.

There's probably more but that's all that come to mind right now.

Let me know if you have any questions.

we should be in Auburn in plenty of time for lunch, but I would like to get
your phone number so that I can call you if we get held up in traffic or
flight delays.  We arrive in Atlanta at about 9:30 auburn time and should
be to Auburn well before noon, but with everything going on, I an not sure
of our arrival time.  Looking forward to it.

   I checked with Joe ... 1 p.m. will work fine.  Our new $500,000 worth of
   construction will be finished and in use by then, so I'm really looking
   forward to showing you the place.

   If you guys would like to get together for lunch before that, Chuck's
   barbecue is right around the corner from the Raptor Center.  I could
   meet
   you there.  Let me know.  Just learned our Miss State game will be on

   at 6 p.m.  I hope we put on a better show for TV than we did the other
   night.

   You are right, that game was very difficult to watch.

   I know we were scheduled to take a tour around 3 p.m.  I was wondering
   if
   we could move it up to around 1 p.m.  We are going to be getting into
   Auburn before lunch time on Friday and we have some friends coming that
   have never been to Auburn and we would really like them to see the
   Raptor
   Center.  Even if Tiger is not going to be there, we would still like to
   have a look if that is feasible for you.  Maybe if we move it up to 1,
   she
   will still be there.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks and look
   forward
   to seeing you in a couple of weeks.

      Phillip ...  hope all is well there in Houston.  We are still
   wondering
      what we ran into at the Carrier Dome.  I thought Lawrence Taylor had
      retired, but apparently he is still playing and wears number 54 for
      Syracuse.

      In any event, I have learned that the School of Nursing is having a
   fund
      raising event on Friday, Oct. 12, from late afternoon through the
      evening,
      and Joe Shelnutt will be taking War Eagle to that event.  That of
   course
      means he and  Tiger won't be at the Raptor Center at the time we had
      planned to go out there.

      Do you guys want to try it on another trip to Auburn?

Let me talk to the trader and I'll get back to you.  Usually the Risk Group is responsible for putting all of these various pricing issues on the tickets.
Mark
I'll forward to Phillip also,  someone in his group may have a Confirm sheet with the details on it.

Mark:
I am starting to make my way through the Consumers balances and I have some February issues that I thought you may be able to help me with.  We have sale deal 618840 which is for Consumers contract 5040-82-42.  It looks like the deal is priced correctly, but Consumers also invoiced us for a demand fee that we don't have.  It was for 500,00 at $0.0175.  They show it as a take or pay deal.  Do you have this confirmation or can you tell me if we have this deal booked right?  I also have several other deals that look like receivables for Enron, but they've never been paid.  They are 244662, 636507, 636515 and 387756.   Should we have billed Consumers?  I don't have any Consumers the confirms for Feb, so I can't check the deals.

A violation is a violation.  I suggest that you go big time next time in order to get your money's worth.

Gosh , Kimat, this is so unfair... I get penalized for exceeding VAR by 1,000, and Derren by 1,000,000 and it's both 10,000!!!!

I'm trying to get a feel for everyone's desire to play PAINTBALL in the next few weeks.  This would obviously not be sponsored by Enron b/c Enron doesn't have enough cash to buy anything right now.

Could you all please review the attached list and see if these are any of your books (or if you know anything about them)?  If they are, could you please let me know if they should be included in the new RisktRAC hierarchy?  We ran a comparison from the active book list that I received from you all to what is currently shown as active in RisktRAC and came up with these differences.  Please let me know either way if any of these are your books so that I won't harass you anymore!  I need a response ASAP.

Alejandra gave me a 5 min. crashcourse through the four calc sheets she updates at the end of the month.  I know that Kam knows about them so I'll just check with her but Alejandra also recommended splitting up these four sheets among everyone else to lighten the load...just a thought for next month.  Also, after training Michelle on Gd-Central and Gulf I definitely feel (hopefully not a false sense) ahead of the curve about the things i've learned...a compliment to your work also.

I received your name from Kam Keiser.  We are both managers in risk management at Enron.  Kam had mentioned that you are in the process of recruiting for several clients in the energy industry.  I have roughly 4 years experience in the industry with 2.5 of those years in risk management.  Prior to employment with Enron, I worked for a big six accounting firm and in the healthcare industry for the University of Texas.  I am interested in staying in the energy field.  If you think one of your clients might be interested, I would like to send my resume on to you.  If they or you are not interested, I apologize for taking up your time today.

As I am sure you are experiencing as well all the fire drills that are currently going on around here, I have been running since I got back from vacation.  Believe me when I say this is a high priority for me as well because of all the potential P&L fallout for the traders who have been entering this information.
PL
 

How are things going with this.  We need to give updates to our leads.

 

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.  

PL 
  

Here's what we have done for all the month's involved.  I'll have to copy the Nicor invoices and get them to you.  I will bring those down to you tomorrow morning.

 << File: NICOR-rec.xls >> 

can you get me the info on August for Nicor, according to Cora Pendergrass I need to see august numbers because some of July's invoice has august volumes.  I would like a copy of all the stuff you guys gave me for July.  Thanks.

PL

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo 

Phillip is working on NICOR. I will work on NIPSCO. Marlo's e-mail was the first I have heard of this and it does not really describe what the issue is. Can somebody clue me in with the details? Thanks.

Scott 

Hi Phillip, 

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.

Thanks 
Darla Saucier 

hope this is what you were looking for.  Please let me know if you need anything else.

Attached are the October 2001 variances between the Risk P&L and the General Ledger.  Please review the items and make Schedule E adjustments for the items that belong to you.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

In future months, I will provide this at least one week prior to month end.  I apologize for the delay this month.

I look forward to working with you,

Phillip:
The accountant that took the Consumers account from me last month has left the company this week without getting them paid for October.  I am now trying to tie out their October invoice.  Please let me know the correct pricing for the deals below.  

Deal 1086060	Consumers billed all of the gas at 0.03.  We have various prices.  Consumers Contract 5030-82-99
Deal 1029516	Consumers billed 0.05.  We have 0.025.  Also, I think the sign is wrong on the price.  It should be negative.
		Contract 5030-82-97
Deal 1075510	Consumers billed 0.03.  We have 0.015.  Also, I think the sign is wrong on the price.  It should be negative.
		Contract 5030-82-96

Also, they billed us for contract 5030-82-98 which I do not see in the system --  2,000 @ 0.01.

There are also some deals in the system that Consumers did not bill us for, deals 1029566, 881687, and 1087206.  Please let me know what I should do with these.

I will not be in the office next week, so please respond to Lisa Valderrama.

we are not sure yet if we are going to copy these deals or simply move them completely to this new book(remove from old books).  You can move them to a new root portfolio if you want.  I do not know what that means though.

Phillip - Keith mentioned this morning that deals from existing books would be copied to the new bankruptcy books.  If so, this could cause a duplication problem.  Would it be safer to create a new root portfolio to place them under?  Please advise.

Check out this article about Tuberville that was published today.

Bryan

(Taken from the Mobile Register)

Tub doing a lousy job

12/04/01

Walking into Tiger Stadium at dusk Saturday, amidst a whiskey river of LSU
fans, a friend looked at me and screamed over the cacophony of chants:

"I don't know what to make out of this game," he said. "I don't know if I'm
going to be more upset if we (Auburn) win or we get blown out again."

  <http://www.al.com/images/spacer.gif>

The meaning was clear: Under Thomas Hawley Tuberville, you never really know
what you will find under the big tent, whether Dr. Jeckyl or Mr. Hyde?

Well, after three hours in the sea of debauchery better known as Death
Valley, where fans, chomping (Tuberville induced) cigars and yelling
profanities and vulgarities, it became crystalline where the state of Auburn
football lies right now.

Under water.

Perhaps, the most amazing conclusion of the long evening on the Bayou is the
Auburn football program actually has accomplished something I never dreamed
possible: It showed less class than the LSU fans, who have earned a
reputation as some of the worst in college football.

I had to laugh afterwards when Tuberville, with a straight face (he is a
riverboat gambler, after all), talked about this program exceeding
expectations with a 7-4 record. Give me a break. I picked Auburn to go 7-4
in this space on Aug. 14 and so did many others. Of course, nobody predicted
this team would mail in several games without any effort.

On Saturday night, this football coaching staff was like the gang that
couldn't shoot straight. A national television audience witnessed some of
dumbest coaching decisions ever.

What a total lack of class for the Auburn players to be dancing on the LSU
logo before the game. What has this group accomplished, other than winning a
trip to a bowl game that no one cares about? What about the totally
classless act of the kicking team getting in the way of the LSU marching
band at the end of halftime? One is tempted to criticize the players. But in
the end, you really can't.

They are just a manifestation of a head football coach, whose frat-boy smile
about everything and inability to get the bigger pictures has a trickle down
effect on everyone -- especially the players. Tuberville always talks --
doe-eyed -- about his mentor Jimmy Johnson. Apparently, some of the Johnson
mystique has really rubbed off, when it comes to classlessness and thug
behavior.

Tuberville loses by 24 to Alabama and instead of taking the blame, he makes
fun of the opposing coach for starting the wrong quarterback all year. Nine
days later, he finally apologizes to the Auburn family, that is, in a mea
culpa that reeked of Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky affair.

This is a head football coach being paid $1.3 million a year. But if you
think Tuberville earned his money this year, think again. And word is he
can't believe the unhappiness in the ranks. He wonders how people can turn
on him after the job he has done.

What has he done?

In three years, he has gone 5-6, 9-4 and now 7-4. Add it up: 21-14 (.600).
Bob Davie got fired Sunday for going .583 at Notre Dame. Of course, among
those 21 wins are victories against Appalachian State, Idaho, Central
Florida, Wyoming, Northern Illinois, Ball State, Louisiana Tech (twice) and
Vanderbilt (twice). That's a total of 10 wins against an industrial-sized
pack of creampuffs. So in legitimate games, he is actually 11-14.

Tub is 1-2 against Alabama (1-6 lifetime) and in the last 13 games, managed
to lose five by double digits (Florida by 21, Syracuse by 17, Arkansas by
25, Alabama by 24 and LSU by 13). Does that give some clue there is a
problem?

Of those 14 losses Tub has suffered at Auburn, 10 have been by double
digits. At Ole Miss, Tuberville's overall record was 25-20. Of the 20
losses, 14 were double digits. Among those 25 wins, Tuberville beat such
heavyweights as Indiana State, Tulane (twice), Memphis (twice), Idaho State,
VMI, Arkansas State (twice), Central Florida, SMU (twice) and Vanderbilt
(four times).

So, if you look at it objectively (the school was hampered by NCAA
limitations), against legitimate teams, his record was 9-20.

Of his current squad, Tuberville talks of them being young. Well, Tommy,
enough already, please. This is your third year. If you can't stand the
heat, call your agent and tell him to find you a new job. I'm sure there's a
big market for a coach who has done as lousy a job as he has in the past few
weeks.

The funniest rumor last week going concerned Tub replacing Nick Saban of LSU
(they share the same agent), believed to be heading to the Indianapolis
Colts. Based on what I heard Saturday night in the Bayou, LSU fans would
burn Tiger Stadium to a crisp before accepting Tub as their head coach.

Assuming Tub graces Auburn with his presence next season (everyone please,
cross your fingers in unison and hold your breath!), he faces a critical
recruiting class and pivotal slate of games. I still think he is a capable
head coach. But things must change.

Before the Iron Bowl, there was a lot of talk about how the pendulum in the
state had shifted. And the prognosticators were correct. Except they missed
one important element. The pendulum has shifted in this series -- toward
Alabama. Despite all the hardship and distractions, Dennis Franchione
appears to have Alabama heading in the right direction on all sides of the
ledger -- including style and class.

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Tommy Tuberville and his Auburn
football program.

(Paul Finebaum's column appears Tuesday and Saturday in the Mobile
Register).

here is the new deal PB&I for NUI.
PL
 

no thanks necessary - you have done a great job - now keep it up.  The courts are going to rule if some bonuses can be paid out - there are no guarantees, so I would not count on them approving it.  They are supposedly negotiating to have us stay on 5 & 6.  Nothing really new on those fronts.
PL
 

There were a few more questions that I had about the new developments but i figured it would be easier than going to a conference room to talk about it...
 
First of all, i am glad that i get to remain in this group of people...i think that there could be plenty of good opportunities surface from this.  Second, i appreciate you, or whoever it was that chose me, having the confidence and faith in my ability to get the job done.  I definitely take that as a compliment and a challenge to continue to perform well. Who was it that bought us?  Didn't you mention something about going to the courts looking for money for performance bonuses for those of us who are continuing on to SwapCo?  How soon will we know if we'll be able to remain in the same building?  
 
that's about all that i can think of...if you get any more news today, please send it my way too...

 
See you Monday...

here it is.
PL
 

I am still here.  I have a contract through March 1 of next year, so I should be here at least until then.  The absolute destruction of the company has been pretty brutal - some of the people lost everything in their 401K.  I guess they really believed in the company.  We should still be in town in Feb. just let us know when the party is and we will be there.
PL
 

whats up man?

How are things with you?  Hearing all the news about Enron and all, figured
I see how you are fairing.  I really hope that your not effected by all the
bs.  We are doing well here.  Getting cold, but hey, its Norway right?  We
have starting building a house and its going well.  I figure it will take
about a year to get it all done. I would like to do as much of the work
myself, but I will see how long that goes.  Anyway, The Family and myself
will be in Houston in late Feb.  We are having a small reception in Clear
Lake and would love to see yall there if you can make it.

Let me here from you soon, hope all is well with you and the family.

Tell your moms whats up from me.

Tommy

I see the changes coming through, but I have one more problem.  PSEG terminated their contract on 11/30, so we only need to bill them for 29 days.  Can you change the volumes on the demand fees for Nov. only to a monthly volume?  I have detailed the changes below.  Thanks.

change 1,700/day to 49,300/month
change 2,500/day to 72,500/month

Jeff was able to create a Netco file under O:\erms\erms_adm without an erequest.  There is a file for each region out there now.  I will save the new p&l to each region but could each of you please pick an p&l from your region as a back-up just in case. 

these are the files I know of

FYI - the west is wanting to split the region into two regions.  Stephen, I know you have been working on mapping the P&Ls for reporting purpose, the attached file breaks down those two regions.  We want to call then Southwest and Northwest.  They will be headed by Phillip Allen and Mike Grigsby respectively.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
PL
 

here is the list.  Thanks.

We lost about 15% to layoffs and we lost about 40% to the estate (staying with Enron).  The remaining people are going to UBS.  We will see what happens.  How are things with you?  Talk to you later.
PL

Glad to see that you are still working.  Was the fallout big on the floor?  Who's still around?

I am booked on a flight 1 week from Friday 8th of February - I land in Birmingham at 9 a.m.  I should be to Huntsville by 11 a.m.  I am staying until Sunday.  I think Ashley and Jackson are going to stay here for now unless you report granddad is doing much worse next week.  We will see how that goes.  Talk to you soon.  Did you call last night?
PL

the book is ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL.  Answer to question 2 & 3 - yes
Commodity code NG
Move deals as of 1/1/02
Do not understand question number 6 - other side should remain counter party
PL

Darron,

Please confirm the following:
1. I can't find the book ENA-WT-SOCAL in Estate database (please provide the CP ID)
2. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PRICE (CP ID 11360)
3. Move active Financial Deals from NG-PR-OPT (CP ID 92649)
4. Commodity code: NG or NGGJ?
5. Please provide the cutoff date to determine active deals (e.g. instr_end_dt > ? 1-jan-2002?)
6. Use ENA CP ID 1305 as the other side counterparty?

If I can have all the answers soon then I think the deals move can be completed around 3:00p.m.

Thanks,
Cecilia

Cecilia,
In addition to moving the deals detailed in my previous email, please move only financial deals with the same counterparties from NG-PR-OPT to ENA-WT-SOCAL.  I realize it's a big list, but how long will the entire process take?  If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.

DG

Attached is a long list of counterparty names to move from NG-PRICE into ENA-WT-SOCAL.  Please move only financial deals only.  Please let me know when this is complete.  Thanks.

done.  You now have 2,000 shares and $1,000 cash in your account.
PL

The company is Nuerotech.  Their symbol is NURO.  They building/market
modular hospitals internationally.  They should be selling at $0.25. Buy
2,000 shares or $500 worth.  I should have the cash in my account from the
Enron sale.

not sure if this got done yesterday by Francis and Sanjeev.  Can you let me know.  Thanks.
PL

I was out sick yesterday.  Let me know if this has not been taken care of.  Thanks.

Can you do the same thing with a different book id?  Instead of book counterparty FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankruptcy book from NG-Price.  Financial deals only.  Thanks.  Let me know if you need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterday, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yesterday.
PL

Deal moves has been completed and retranslated.

Cecilia

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

Thanks

Please move the following book to book trades with Canada from NG-Price to Bankruptcy:
FT-Cand-Termin
Ft-Cand-Gone-PR

Pleae let me know when this is done, we are waiting to calc today on this.  Thanks.
PL

Do you mind sending this guy that mouse pad on the desk?  Thanks.  The priority mail boxes are behind the filing cabinet in the office, you will need to use one of the larger ones.  I would stuff it with newspaper or something like that to keep it from sliding around.

my dad told me about this a few weeks ago.  That is crazy.  I had not seen the pictures until now.
PL

These pictures are from an accident that involved an 18 wheeler carrying
fuel through Birmingham.  Supposedly, a car trying to exit onto an off ramp
cut in front of the truck from an interior lane.  The rear quarter panel of
the car hit the truck sending it out of control.  The driver of the car was
not injured, but sadly, the truck driver died when the load exploded.  Here
are the results of the fire to the roadway.  Unbelievable!

Attached is a file with the CP's that are terminated per Kim's list and had been sent to IT to move to the bankruptcy book.  There are six CP's on this list.  I will send the legal names to Cecilia to get these moved today(with 7,000 lines, I am afraid it would take at least a day for risk to move manually).  We will then recheck the book tonight.  As you will see on the summary page, the total value of these deals is $(61.6M).  If there are any questions, please let me know, I will bring hard copies to the 11a.m. meeting.  Thanks.

I have some good news and some bad news.  The good news is that I invested all of the league dues in the stock market over the last few weeks.  The bad news is that I invested it in enron stock.  So, needless to say I am going to have to default on this year's payouts.  

Sorry guys

2-5, so much for the nice machine

From the way it is looking now ... I gave my money away anyway.

thanks.  We talked with Martin Cuilla last night and he thinks we are missing some transport usage tickets that will offset a major portion of our gain.  Thanks for your help.

We agree with the number you are seeing on the deal, Phillip.

I found it.
Economics are -$565,067

Chris, Phillip is wanting to confirm that as of yesterday's calc we show ~$600k loss on Sitara deal #581028 (it's a physical deal at Empress for November) - can you confirm that please?

I do not unless I start working for you and have to worry about accounting issues.
PL

We are setting up SAP for the new UBS sign-on. Do any of you guys need to have SAP?  Let me know by the end of the day so we can set up.  If there is anyone in your group, please let me know about them as well.  Thanks.

Can you give me a list of all of the deals that have been put into Sitara for the Chicago office - the book/counterparty name will be Enovate.  The Arthur Anderson auditors have requested this information.  They are doing an audit of Enovate and want a list of all of the deals since the book started in order to get a sample size for their audit.  you should not have to go back farther than 01/00.  Thanks for your help and shout if you need anymore information.

looks like this deal got zeroed out and rebooked on #1019677 look and see if you see this - CP should now be CPR pipeline exchange.  No variance should occur.  Thanks.

I'm still showing an open item for Union Gas Purchases - Liquidation 972214/VU3457.1 in the amount of $635,999.94.  Any info on this yet?

we flashed this as Union, they subsequently moved the volumes on GL to CPR pipeline exchange.  you have to look at both to get this to reconcile.  Does this make sense?  If not, give me a call.  Thanks.
PL

I do have this deal under CPR Pipeline Exchange but if I move this $635,999 liquidation to Syn Strg I end up with a variance exposure of $1,237,227 on Syn Strg.  Our flash for Syn Strg is volume of (189,279) and ($1,058).  No volumes have been booked yet.  Should there be another liquidation?

Just a couple of points that I am not sure I mentioned to you:

1.	I suggested to Glenda in January after Daddy died that she lease the
house with the option to purchase due to the economy in Haleyville.  She
obviouly has not done that.

2.	The day after Daddy died, we went to the bank to get his will to
take to Jeff's office for him to read to us.  Glenda tried to cash in
Daddy's CD at that point and told them that she was the executrix of his
estate.  They refused because she did not have a death certificate and had
not been formally appointed.

3.	Glenda told me that she had told Dr. Cashin that she wanted him to
pay off the note on the purchase of Daddy's practice immediately.  I'm
surprised that he has not since the interest rate on the note is 9%.

With regard to Jeff Mobley wanted to work something out without going to
court, I am fine with that.  However my terms are:

1.	The money in Daddy's checking account, saving account and CD are put
back in to the estate.

2.	The estate 1099's Glenda for the forgiveness of the note.

3.	The value of Daddy's truck that she gave away comes out of her
distribution.

4.	The repayment of the $5,000 that Glenda borrowed from me in April
1996 is repaid to me at 8% annual interest from Glenda's distribution of the
estate.

5.	If the estate is not settled by the first anniversary of Daddy's
death, that an independent third party is appointed administrator.

6.	Any excessive administrative fees paid to Glenda for her work as
executrix of the estate are repaid to the estate.

7.	Glenda agrees in writing to discontinue her harressment of me and my
family.

I am willing to give on the forgiveness of the note to Daddy.  I am willing
to allow her to continue as executrix until the anniversary of Daddy's
death.  Twelve months is ample time to settle an estate as simple as his.  I
will allow her to keep my grandfather's single shot shotgun that Daddy left
to me, but that she and her husband stole from my father's bedroom while he
was in the hosptal dying.  I would even be willing to not make her repay the
value of Daddy's truck or return the extra $1,000 that she sold his car for,
but that she did not put in the estate.

I mailed the $1,000 check today.  Sorry for the delay.  I've just been very
busy.  If we are going to file to remove Glenda as executrix, I'll need a
new one with the correct date of Daddy's death to execute.

I'll be in Auburn from tomorrow night until Sunday.

I have not received any information from Jeff Mobley.   I have  called his
office as recent as today.  The petition for removal is ready to sign but I
have got to retain local counsel in Winston County for the purpose of filing
as it will be cheaper than having me drive to Winston County.  Are you
familiar with Wyatt Howell or his firm.  That is the firm I would like to
associate.  Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

Tammy

Just touching base to see where we are with Daddy's estate.

no response.  I have prepared a petition to have your sister removed.  I
will get it to you for your review prior to filing same.

Just touching base to see if you heard from Jeff.

Legally I cannot contact her since she is represented by an attorney.  I
will follow up with Jeff.

I can also provide you with my sister's contact info if you need it.

I have heard nothing.  I have been out of town for about 12 days and have
just returned today. I thought there might be a response from Jeff but none.
I will follow up.

Tammy,

I'm just touching base to see if you have heard anything from Jeff.

 
 

We can now calc the price book and we will cross reference the list with a fwd detail of the price book to verify there are no deals with terminated counter parties.  Because of the translation to the bankruptcy book, we can not calc the bankruptcy book for a while, so we will cross reference those in the morning.  I will keep you posted.

The deals associated with the counterparties below have been moved to the bankruptcy book.  The deals are currently being retranslated.  There are more than 10,000 deals and it's going to take a while to complete the retranslation.

   3.      Glenda told me that she had told Dr. Cashin that she wanted him
   to
   pay off the note on the purchase of Daddy's practice immediately.  I'm
   surprised that he has not since the interest rate on the note is 9%.

   With regard to Jeff Mobley wanted to work something out without going to
   court, I am fine with that.  However my terms are:

   1.      The money in Daddy's checking account, saving account and CD are
   put
   back in to the estate.

   2.      The estate 1099's Glenda for the forgiveness of the note.

   3.      The value of Daddy's truck that she gave away comes out of her
   distribution.

   4.      The repayment of the $5,000 that Glenda borrowed from me in
   April
   1996 is repaid to me at 8% annual interest from Glenda's distribution of
   the
   estate.

   5.      If the estate is not settled by the first anniversary of Daddy's
   death, that an independent third party is appointed administrator.

   6.      Any excessive administrative fees paid to Glenda for her work as
   executrix of the estate are repaid to the estate.

   7.      Glenda agrees in writing to discontinue her harressment of me
   and my
   family.

   I am willing to give on the forgiveness of the note to Daddy.  I am
   willing
   to allow her to continue as executrix until the anniversary of Daddy's
   death.  Twelve months is ample time to settle an estate as simple as
   his.  I
   will allow her to keep my grandfather's single shot shotgun that Daddy
   left
   to me, but that she and her husband stole from my father's bedroom while
   he
   was in the hosptal dying.  I would even be willing to not make her repay
   the
   value of Daddy's truck or return the extra $1,000 that she sold his car
   for,
   but that she did not put in the estate.

   I mailed the $1,000 check today.  Sorry for the delay.  I've just been
   very
   busy.  If we are going to file to remove Glenda as executrix, I'll need
   a
   new one with the correct date of Daddy's death to execute.

   I'll be in Auburn from tomorrow night until Sunday.

   I have not received any information from Jeff Mobley.   I have  called
   his
   office as recent as today.  The petition for removal is ready to sign
   but I
   have got to retain local counsel in Winston County for the purpose of
   filing
   as it will be cheaper than having me drive to Winston County.  Are you
   familiar with Wyatt Howell or his firm.  That is the firm I would like
   to
   associate.  Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

   will get it to you for your review prior to filing same.

   Legally I cannot contact her since she is represented by an attorney.  I

   I have heard nothing.  I have been out of town for about 12 days and

Can you do me a favor similar to Kam's previous request:  Can you add to my current profile all the books that Scott Palmer currently has calculation access to.  Could you also set Bruce Mills, Kristen Clause and Edward Brady up like Scott Palmer.  Additionally can you also set up Ashley Worthing like Anne Bike.  Thanks for you help and shout with any questions.

Thanks.  It has also been a pleasure working with you.  I am sure our paths will cross again in the near future.  Thanks for all of your help the last year.

How much time(in terms of hours) do you guys spend reviewing/correcting/analyzing Settlements forms each month?  

John

absolutely
PL

It turns out that Stepehn Harrington has agreed to buy us a PC to replace our SUN machines.  Are you all ok with that still?

Kam

FYI - here is the info I have.  As she said, not exactly the answer we wanted.  I am still waiting on a final list to cross reference with our calcs.
PL

Stacey Richardson is researching additional transactions & we are receiving daily updates from legal regarding counterparties who have terminated either their agreements or specific transactions due to the bankruptcy. However, the deal count should begin to reduce.

Not the answer you were looking for, but the best I can give for today.

Cyndie

Is this the last list we are going to get?  Jeff Gossett wants to know if we are done so that we can assure Don Miller that all of the CP's have been taken care of.  Thanks.

Thank you!

I just want to be crystal clear on the file you sent.  We need to move all of these deals to the Bankruptcy book?  Thanks for your help.
PL

The attached deal list are the deals behind those contracts, for those deals that are currently not included in the bankruptcy books. Please note that there are still several deals that I am trying to reconcile back to Sitara numbers. Assuming that I can do so, I will send supplemental information tomorrow afternoon.

I really would like to see the contract to verify things are not being booked correctly.  I spoke with Patrice and she does agree that we should not have a large receivable balance.  Try and get me the contract and I will see what I can do.  Thanks.
PL

Have you been able to look anymore into this?

Marlo

It has been Sylvia's understanding that Nicor Gas Company is a hub which is a storage facility, not the inverse.  We believe there has been a misinterpretation as to what has been stated.  In fact, these contracts have been setup since 1995.

Attached please find the contracts for Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company.

 << File: Nicor Gas Company Contracts.xls >>  << File: Northern Illinois Gas Company.xls >> 

These contracts have existed in the Global Contracts system.  Per the letter dated January 23, 1998, Northern Illinois Gas Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company.  It indicated that any existing contracts did not have to change its name to Nicor Gas Company.  Thus, the contracts remained under the name Northern Illinois Gas Company.  Further, these existing contracts were Parking, Storage, Transportation and Pooling Service Agreement.

We suggest that you setup deal tickets and if necessary, we setup new contracts with the service of Balancing ,Wheeling and Loan.  These contracts will feed to Unify accordingly.  Some of the contracts already have deals, which is indicated on the contract title or you can run the Sitara Report to locate the deals behind the contracts.  

If you need our assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Thank You.

Marlene D. Hilliard 
That will be good going forward if all goes well, however we still need to address the outstanding issues in order to clear the Receivables and Payables.  I will be giving Marlene a copy of the tariff and see if she can get contracts setup.

Let me know how the test goes.

Thanks,
Marlo

We are changing how we put in these tickets effective November 1 to be on CPR exchange tickets.  When I get my reports for October we will go out and set up storage contracts for what we have right now and start using them accordingly.  Part of the problem has been in the way we have to send Nicor on an EDI process.  I am going to revisit and see if we can test in stage doing it thru CPR tickets and if that works then there should be no problem.  Please keep me posted and anything I can do to be of assistance please let me know. 

Thanks,

Cora
We, Vol Mgmt and Settlements are still trying to get the Nicor/Northerin Illinois Gas deals cleared through Unify.  Kam had tried to help Kathy Kelly and I last year with putting in storage tickets for the deals that address the Balancing/Wheeling/ and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month.  These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.

Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.

Thanks,

Darla and I tried to go out on the livelink to view some, but it errored on us and wouldn't let us view them.  I have also requested assistance from Mark Thorne that handles the physical files to see if he can help, but have not heard back from him.  If you have another way of getting a copy you might try it as I am not having much luck today.  The only other thing I have was a copy of the tariff and if you want it let me know.

Please pass on the condolences of another part of the Auburn family to Mr. Walker.  We are all truly hurt by the passing of his mother.  From the recent articles I have read in the Alabama papers, it appears she was a phenomenal mother and friend.  We were also pleased to see his positive comments regarding his teammates, fellow students and alumni of Auburn.  The auburn spirit is special and it means a lot to those of us who spent time there to hear current players and students share the same beliefs.  We are sure he will continue to honor his mother and her memory by his outstanding play on the field and dedication in the classroom.  Thank you Mr. Walker for making us all proud to be an Auburn Tiger.  Please respond via email to let us know if the University or anyone else has set up a memorial fund or scholarship in her name.  We would really like to donate money in her name.  Thanks and War Eagle.

We were also pleased to see his positive comments regarding his teammates, fellow students and alumni of Auburn.  The auburn spirit is special and it means a lot to those of us who spent time there to hear current players and students share the same beliefs.  We are sure he will continue to honor his mother and her memory by his outstanding play on the field and dedication in the classroom.  Thank you Mr. Walker for making us all proud to be an Auburn Tiger.  Please respond via email to let us know if the University or anyone else has set up a memorial fund or scholarship in her name.  We would really like to donate money in her name.  Thanks and War Eagle.

Can you let your group know that we have made some changes in responsibility in Risk Management.  Kam Keiser will be responsible for the West Desk, Scott Palmer will now be responsible for the Central Desk and I will now be responsible for the East Desk.  Please pass this information on and direct future inquiries accordingly.  Thanks.

Please pass on the sentiments of at least 3 Auburn Alumni.  The students that appear in the pictures from Halloween dressed in racial costumes should be immediately expelled from the University and their respective fraternities should be permanently removed from campus.  We also think that PartyPics.com should be disciplined and removed from the vendor list for the University.  Auburn University and it's related organizations should not contribute money to organizations that are willing to take pictures of such insulting behavior and try and profit from them by selling them to disgusting human beings that would participate in such offensive behavior.

As graduates of Auburn University and Athletic and Academic Scholarship donors, we are appalled by these students behavior and demand immediate action be taken against them.  The longer this issue is not dealt with, the worse our University looks in the eyes of the world.  Please take action and help save Auburn's reputation.  Thanks for your assistance.

I wish you would come back - it would give our stock price a shot in the arm...press release...DK is back at work!!  I will talk with DG and get with you on a date, we are pretty busy around the holidays, maybe we can hit something up during the week.  Does Gary get home at a decent time during the week?  I now am over the east desk, so my hours recently increased.  We will see.
PL

Let's work around y'alls schedule because we have no life now that we have a
baby!!!  Just kidding.  We are open to any evening.  What works best for you
guys?  Let's plan a date so I don't forget about your genorosity....

still do not have anything from a contract standpoint.  I will try and put some time into it today.  AS of last Friday, I now have responsibility for the East desk instead of the Central, but I will include Scott Palmer in my work since he now is over the Central.  I am not abandoning you, it is just that my workload has drastically increased trying to wrap up central desk issues, get Scott up to speed and get myself up to speed on the East desk.  We will get a resolution ASAP.  Thanks.
PL

Were you able to find what you were looking for?  Let me know if you need any additional information from me.

Thanks,
Marlo

I actually was just wanting a copy of the confirms or contracts that we/they signed in order to verify the prices and volumes.  I will try and work on asap tomorrow.  Thanks.
PL

Darla and I tried to go out on the livelink to view some, but it errored on us and wouldn't let us view them.  I have also requested assistance from Mark Thorne that handles the physical files to see if he can help, but have not heard back from him.  If you have another way of getting a copy you might try it as I am not having much luck today.  The only other thing I have was a copy of the tariff and if you want it let me know.

Marlo

I really would like to see the contract to verify things are not being booked correctly.  I spoke with Patrice and she does agree that we should not have a large receivable balance.  Try and get me the contract and I will see what I can do.  Thanks.
PL

Have you been able to look anymore into this?

Marlo

It has been Sylvia's understanding that Nicor Gas Company is a hub which is a storage facility, not the inverse.  We believe there has been a misinterpretation as to what has been stated.  In fact, these contracts have been setup since 1995.

Attached please find the contracts for Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company.

 << File: Nicor Gas Company Contracts.xls >>  << File: Northern Illinois Gas Company.xls >> 

These contracts have existed in the Global Contracts system.  Per the letter dated January 23, 1998, Northern Illinois Gas Company changed its name to Nicor Gas Company.  It indicated that any existing contracts did not have to change its name to Nicor Gas Company.  Thus, the contracts remained under the name Northern Illinois Gas Company.  Further, these existing contracts were Parking, Storage, Transportation and Pooling Service Agreement.

We suggest that you setup deal tickets and if necessary, we setup new contracts with the service of Balancing ,Wheeling and Loan.  These contracts will feed to Unify accordingly.  Some of the contracts already have deals, which is indicated on the contract title or you can run the Sitara Report to locate the deals behind the contracts.  

If you need our assistance, please do not hesitate to contact us. 

Thank You.

Marlene D. Hilliard 
That will be good going forward if all goes well, however we still need to address the outstanding issues in order to clear the Receivables and Payables.  I will be giving Marlene a copy of the tariff and see if she can get contracts setup.

Let me know how the test goes.

Thanks,
Marlo

We are changing how we put in these tickets effective November 1 to be on CPR exchange tickets.  When I get my reports for October we will go out and set up storage contracts for what we have right now and start using them accordingly.  Part of the problem has been in the way we have to send Nicor on an EDI process.  I am going to revisit and see if we can test in stage doing it thru CPR tickets and if that works then there should be no problem.  Please keep me posted and anything I can do to be of assistance please let me know. 

Thanks,

Cora
We, Vol Mgmt and Settlements are still trying to get the Nicor/Northerin Illinois Gas deals cleared through Unify.  Kam had tried to help Kathy Kelly and I last year with putting in storage tickets for the deals that address the Balancing/Wheeling/ and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month.  These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.

Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo James

Kam and Phillip,

I understand you all have been a little busy lately.   When you get a free moment would you please send me an updated copy of your Cost of Inventory schedules for Central and East.  We have until late tomorrow to book the value.  One nice thing about the West Desk is no storage COI.

Thanks,

Dear Phillip-

In an effort to clean up RisktRAC, we have created a new hierarchy structure in RisktRAC that is currently in the testing phases.  I have attached a spreadsheet that contains the new hierarchy structure for Central Gas (please look at all the tabs).  Also included is a list of your books that are linked to the lowest level portfolio of the hierarchy structure.  

Could you please review the proposed hierarchy structure and let me know of any issues (i.e. all traders are captured or that we don't have any "extra" traders reflected.)  
Additionally, could you please review the "books" tab and ensure that the book list is complete and accurate and that the book is linked to the correct trader (please note - if more than one trader trades out of the same book, the book should be assigned to the most senior trader.  Please ensure that this has been done correctly).  Please advise us of any missing books as well.
Finally, I would like to get an understanding of what reports/hierarchies you all are currently using in RisktRAC and for what purpose.

 I would like a response ASAP, but by Monday at the latest.  Please call me to discuss at your convenience or email me your response.  Thanks, Phillip.

I forwarded this to Scott Palmer, he is the new lead of the Central desk.

Will you forward this to Palmer?  I can't find his email address.....

Palmer,

I'm out for Sunday.  I threw my back out, and there's no way that I can play.  Sorry.  There is a guy on our desk, Mike Olsen, and another guy, Jay Smith that want to play if you need a replacement for me.

Bryan

I am sure you guys will be on your way home be the time us risk guys leave.
PL

we are going to happy hour at Ruggles Enron - dynegy  Field after work.   
any interest? 

and for those that are email challenged(Scott Palmer) you sent it twice.  Don't worry, we do not have to worry about O'Neal, Sunday is not daylight savings time.  I got them to move the tournament two weeks so we could count on O'Neal for the first game.
PL

Our first game is at 9:00 with the TechnoSapiens on field #3. A map is attached. I paid the $10.00/person fee today. If you could give $10.00 between now and the tournament, I would appreciate it. 

Again, for those who have difficulty with the time of day (O'Neal), that was 9:00 am. See you there and let's have fun.

 << File: img16[1].gif >> 

can you get me the info on August for Nicor, according to Cora Pendergrass I need to see august numbers because some of July's invoice has august volumes.  I would like a copy of all the stuff you guys gave me for July.  Thanks.
PL

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo 

Phillip is working on NICOR. I will work on NIPSCO. Marlo's e-mail was the first I have heard of this and it does not really describe what the issue is. Can somebody clue me in with the details? Thanks.

Scott

Hi Phillip,

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.

Thanks

PL

Hey Philip!

What's up? I have mixed feeling about you going to
ND...I', jealous! This year is out for me
unfortunately.  I have some friends that have gone to
games this year...I'll get the skinny on scalping.  It
shouldn't be much of a prop.  However, despite there
records, it's still ND and Tennesse. It will be sold
out.  But you can get tix.  I know this much. You
can't (or it's against school policy to )get tix on
campus. However, there are plenty of scalper on roads
leading to campus.

Sites to see.  Definietly check out the campus.  Make
time to see the lakes, go by the dome etc. It's
awesome. Also, it may be one of the games of the
week...so, look out for espn, nbc and all the rest.
The hype is great when networks other than nbc show.
Lots of small bars...avoid the linebacker, unless you
want to test that you have the endurance you had in
undergrad. College Football Hall of Fame is
there...downtown.  Tailgating is great....like I said
make sure you get to the game early. That way you'll
get the whole experience. Lots of tradition game day,
for example the Band marches from the dome to the
stadium....it's awesome.

I'll give you a call at work..

Later,

Steve

sorry I did not get back with you last night, we were up in Navasota all weekend with some friends enjoying the clean and quiet country air.  We also went to the Renaissance Festival.  Things are getting pretty hectic around here.  There are a number of individuals who are responsible for destroying one of the best companies in America in less than a year.  It is all pretty amazing and really still has not sunk in.  We are all just trying to continue with business as usual and hope for the best.  If I do get laid off, I just hope to get a really good package.  

How are things in Denver?  Good I hope.  How is that baby?  Is she getting bigger?  I hope so.  Drop me a line and let me know what is going.  Thanks for the call.

Hey.  My friend Chad (i think you remember him) just moved back here from Houston and is currently in job search mode.  He is in the same field as you..and worked for Raymond James in Houston.

can you get me copies of the August Invoice.  Cora is very confident we have done everything correctly and I am still disagreeing with her(agreeing with you guys).  This is pretty confusing and they did not keep spreadsheets or data about these, so I am having trouble tying all the volumes.  Could you also get me copies of the pipeline statements for August.  It looks like I am also missing one of the pipeline statements from July as well.  I do not have the statement for the loan of 73,416.  Thanks.  I am sorry this is taking a while, this deal is very complex and traders/schedulers have not kept good records.

Right now the parking and loaned deals that we did or do with NIPSCO are not being booked correctly in Unify.  The volumes are coming over onto Supply Verifications or Sales Invoices depending what we are doing.  These deals should be coming over to the service side so that I can be paying for these deals.  However, I do not have anything on the service side.  Therefore, I have a had to pay (paper) manuals to pay NIPSCO and Darla has outstanding A/R & A/P items since we do not invoice or pay NIPSCO for these deals.  I have requested that Marlene forward the service contracts that are currently in the system to verify what we have setup so that you can make sure the deals are setup and we can get these corrected in Unify.  I need to get my payables issues cleared up as well for the manuals I had to do to get them paid as interest was also charged.  If you need to meet up with Darla and I to show you what we have, please let us know.  The sooner we can get these resolved the better.

Thanks,
Marlo 

Phillip is working on NICOR. I will work on NIPSCO. Marlo's e-mail was the first I have heard of this and it does not really describe what the issue is. Can somebody clue me in with the details? Thanks.

Scott

Hi Phillip,

I saw your emails to Marlo James on the Nicor issue that said Scott Palmer would be taking over the Central desk.  I just wanted to see if it would be possible to put this on the highest priority.  Due to the current situation, we need to get this matter resolved ASAP to be able to clear off the balances left sitting on our A/R and A/P.  Let me know if there's any additional information that you would require from me. Again, I stress the urgency of resolving this.  Thanks for your help.  Please update me on any progress as soon as possible.

Thanks
Darla Saucier

yep

Phillip,

Could you open our publish list for the EMW files and update your email address?  Everytime I publish now your email comes back as undeliverable.  

Thanks
Robin

Can each of you please set up minibooks for any deals in your books that are with any Dynegy counterparty.  We have not gotten the request yet, but we expect Lavo to ask Gossett at any time for this info and we want to be prepared for a quick turnaround.  Thanks.  Shout with any questions.
PL

Per our discussion in the staff meeting.
PL

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Kind of makes you feel warm all over, doesn't it?

i have to forward you this article if only because of my friend eva's response! haha, at least it made me laugh!

Enron's Lay could get $80M from deal 
Lay's employment agreement with Enron, which is set to expire Dec. 31, 2005, allows the executive to terminate his employment with the company 60 days prior to the Dynegy merger and receive a lump-sum payment of up to $80.8 million, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.
According to the terms of the employment contract, if Lay quits before a change of control at the company, he is entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of years left in his contract multiplied by $20.2 million.
The agreement also allots an amount to Lay for any tax-related penalties if the lump-sum payment is held to constitute an "excess parachute payment," according to the Securities and Exchange Commission filing.
Lay's original employment agreement with Enron was amended in August when he became CEO after Jeff Skilling resigned.
Enron's shares fell 4 cents to $9.20 in recent trading.

Just wanted to send you an FYI - due to problems that are caused for RAC, please roll your P&L's each day from your daily file and not the regions file.  The RAC group looks at our P&L's in the region files each morning to determine rho and drift and this causes a problem if you have saved your P&L after rolling(it appears as though you have data already captured for current day because it copies and pastes formulas from the prior day to current day).  Thanks for your help and shout with any questions.

FYI - notes from a conference call today
PL

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.

much more informative than Lay's email last night

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.

 FYI - not sure if you know this yet, but you need to become verified on PayPal before your payment can go through.  This usually entails you getting the two amounts from your bank account that they drafted - usually pennies.  Once you are verified, I will receive the funds and I will mail out the cube.  Thanks.

HOOK'EM

Norman (AP)

Oklahoma University Athletic Director Joe Castiglione announced today that
due to recent developments, the renovations at Owen Field are well ahead of
schedule and will come in under costs. Seems over 71,000 fans shit a brick
during the fourth quarter of the bedlam football game, providing the
necessary materials to begin work right away.

As I said, take it up with EBay or the individual you outbid.  I see your max bid says $1600, an obvious mistake that you had to approve unless EBay made a mistake.  For the last time $61 is obviously not out of the price range for those balls this weekend, you won by a dollar.  You can cancel your bid before the auction ends and you did not.  Per the attachment I sent, you have another 5 days to decide to pay or get Ebay to adjust it or I will seek payment through them.
PL

IF YOU OPENED MY ATTACHMENT YOU'LL SEE MY BID WAS 16.00 NOT 61.00
I would suggest you take it up with EBay.  See my attachment regarding
EBay's policy on Non Paying Bidder.  I have tried to contact the person
that you outbid - the person that bid $60.  He has not responded.  I would
suggest you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest
bid.  I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to
confirm your bidding amount.  I would be more than willing to change your
payment if the price got way out of wack.  $61 is actually cheaper than
some of the balls were going for this weekend.  I hope the person that bid
$60 will respond and "get you off the hook".  Otherwise, EBay will have to
intervene on your behalf.  I guess it is possible, their system messed up,
but it looks like you approved a bad bid.  Sorry.  Good luck.
PL

|--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    -----Original Message-----
   NO I'AM NOT GOING TO PAY 61.00. PLEASE EXAMINE THE ATTACHMENT AND YOU'LL
   SEE
   WHY
   ----- Original Message -----
   I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid
   at
   $6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am
   sorry if
   you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these
   balls
   were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or
   higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an
   adjustment,
   but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are
   planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If
   not,
   I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as
   possible.  Thanks.

your too late shit head alredy got this email, at least the sooners are above 500

HOOK'EM

Norman (AP)

Oklahoma University Athletic Director Joe Castiglione announced today that
due to recent developments, the renovations at Owen Field are well ahead of
schedule and will come in under costs. Seems over 71,000 fans shit a brick
during the fourth quarter of the bedlam football game, providing the
necessary materials to begin work right away.

I would suggest you take it up with EBay.  See my attachment regarding EBay=
's policy on Non Paying Bidder.  I have tried to contact the person that yo=
u outbid - the person that bid $60.  He has not responded.  I would suggest=
 you try and contact him to have him pay for the item at his highest bid.  =
I have bid on items before on EBay and it clearly asks you twice to confirm=
 your bidding amount.  I would be more than willing to change your payment =
if the price got way out of wack.  $61 is actually cheaper than some of the=
 balls were going for this weekend.  I hope the person that bid $60 will re=
spond and "get you off the hook".  Otherwise, EBay will have to intervene o=
n your behalf.  I guess it is possible, their system messed up, but it look=
s like you approved a bad bid.  Sorry.  Good luck.

auction for as many bidders as necessary. That is, you cannot go back and f=
ile additional Alerts if you have more non-paying bidders from the same auc=
tion.  Special note to bidders: If you are a bidder and believe you receive=
d an unfair warning, you may appeal it by using eBay's Non-Paying Bidder Ap=

NO I'AM NOT GOING TO PAY 61.00. PLEASE EXAMINE THE ATTACHMENT AND YOU'LL SE=
E
WHY

I have you down for $61 plus shipping, not $1,600.  I show that you bid at
$6.99 and at $61.  There was no bid for $19.99 listed at all.  I am sorry i=
f
you did not mean to bid $61, but it is hardly out of the range - these ball=
s
were selling this weekend for $80-90.  If your winning bid was $200 or
higher I could understand your complaint and we could make an adjustment,
but $61 is not an unreasonable amount.  Please let me know if you are
planning on paying the $61(I will pay shipping if you use PayPal).  If not,
I need to contact EBay for resolution.  I need a response as soon as
possible.  Thanks.

way) of becoming an addicion for me.  Give me, give me, give me...I need, I 
need!  Glad you found someone to take my spot in the limo...NOT!  How would

Mike,

Here is the proposal we had discussed today.  Please look it over and I will contact you early next week to discuss it further.

Thanks again
Paul

 

Max,

Please look this purchase proposal over and forward it on to the applicable parties.  This proposal is completely open for negotiations, you can reach me at (303) 575-6474 to discuss this proposal further.

Sincerely,
Paul Lucci

 

Here is some more bullshit from CIG.  I wish they could get these tie-ins going!  I'll be out of the office Wednesday returning Friday late morning.  I'll be calling you but if you need me call me on my cell (303) 810-5708.  Tell Matt "Broncos all the way!"

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

Based on your concerns and requests for additional notice prior to
commissioning each additional segment, we are adopting the following
procedure for placing segments in service:

We will notify you when we have filed each segment with FERC for approval.
Based on our experience with the tie-ins to date, we are now anticipating 4
days for approval.  Upon receiving FERC approval, we will notify you of the
contract in service date for that segment of capacity. The contract will
start at the later of the following dates:  1) two days following the date
of FERC approval; 2) 4 days following filing with FERC; or 3) at least one
week following the last in service date.

For example, we officially filed for the second segment approval (61
Mdth/day) September 25 (today) and anticipate filing the next segment (79
Mdth/day) on October 1.  If we receive FERC approval tomorrow, we will
notify you, but the contract will not become effective until Sept 29.
However, you would have additional capacity available a couple days early at
$.1434.

Hopefully, the above procedure will help you to plan for your nominations by
providing more flexability and notice for each additional commissioning.
Please call me to discuss or with any questions.

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

We do not anticipate FERC approval of the second tie-in until later today,
so WIC is revising the schedule for contract in service as set forth below.
We will notify you if there are any further delays.  Judy Warhover will be
sending a replacement page reflecting the revised dates early next week.
Please call with any questions or concerns.

This is why I like blondes!

Three blondes died in an accident trying to jump the Grand Canyon. They
are
  at the pearly gates of Heaven. St. Peter tells them that they can enter
the
  gates only if they can answer one simple religious question.

 The question posed by St. Peter is - "What is Easter"?

 The first blonde replies, "Oh, that's easy! It's the holiday in November
  when we all get together, eat turkey and are thankful."

 "Wrong!, you are not welcome here, I'm afraid. You must go to the other
  place!" replies St. Peter. Then he turns to the second blonde, and asks
her
  the same question - "What is Easter?"

 The second blonde replies, "Easter is the holiday in December when we put
  up a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate the birth of Jesus."

 St. Peter looks at the second blonde, bangs his head on the pearly Gates
  in disgust and tells her she's wrong and will have to join her friend in
  the other place; she is not welcome in Heaven.

 He then peers over his glasses at the third blonde and asks, "Do YOU know
  what Easter is?"

 The third blonde smiles confidently and looks St. Peter in the eyes, "I
  know what Easter is."

 "Oh?" says St. Peter, incredulously.

 "Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish
celebration
  of Passover. Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and
  Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one  of his
  disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the
  side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with  nails
  through his hands and feet. He was buried in a nearby cave which was
sealed
  off by a large boulder."

 St. Peter smiles broadly with delight.

 Then the third blonde continues ... "Every year the boulder is moved aside
  so that Jesus can come out and, if he sees his shadow, there will be six
  more weeks of winter!

I'm leaving for Wyoming tomorrow and will be out all week.  Let's try and get together some other time.  How are things with you?

Lunch this week?  I promise I won't bring Natalie!

 

Mike,

Here is the proposal we had discussed today.  Please look it over and I will contact you early next week to discuss it further.

Thanks again
Paul

This is updated.  I'll be using this hot list.

You are not bothering me and I will tell you if you are.  Your right I don't like to gab on the phone for long periods of time, but I like talking to you. I like to keep everything short and sweet. So, tell me when I'm going to see you again.  You will miss the big Limo party on Saturday.  Too bad the car is full.  And, even with a bad ankle I can still dance.  

Just wanted to say hello.  I have much more free time on my hands than you,

I know I whant to find THAT girl!

Why don't chicks think like us....wouldn't the world be a better place?

Dear Mr. Abby:

Q: My husband wants a threesome with my best friend and me.

A: Obviously your husband cannot get enough of you! Knowing that there is
only one of you he can only settle for the next best thing - your best
friend. Far from being an issue, this can bring you closer together. Why
not get some of your old college roommates involved too? If you arestill
apprehensive, maybe you should let him be with your friends without you.
If you're still not sure then just perform oral on him and cook him a nice
meal while you think about it.

Dear Mr. Abby:

Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex on him.

A: Do it... Sperm can help you loose weight and gives a great glow to your
skin. Interestingly, men know this. His offer to allow you to perform oral
sex on him is totally selfless. This shows he loves you. The best thing to
do is to thank him by performing it twice a day. Then cook him a nice meal.

Dear Mr. Abby:

Q: My husband has too many nights out with the boys.

A: This is perfectly natural behavior and it should be encouraged. The man
is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. A night out
chasing young single girls is a great stress relief and can foster a more
peaceful and relaxing home. Remember, nothing can rekindle your
relationship better than the man being away for a day or two (it's a great
time to clean the house too)! Just look at how emotional and happy he is
when he returns to his stable home. The best thing to do when he gets home
is for you and your best friend to perform oral on him. Then cook him a
nice meal.

Dear Mr. Abby:

Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is.

A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess with
it, do it in your own time or ask your best friend to help. You may wish to
videotape yourself while doing this, and present it to your husband as a
birthday gift. To ease your selfish guilt, perform oral sex on him and coo
him a delicious meal.

Dear Mr. Abby:

Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay.

A: You are a bad person for bringing it up and should seek sensitivity
training. Foreplay to a man is very stressful and time consuming. Sex
should be available to your husband on demand with no pesky requests for
foreplay.  What this means is that you do not love your man as much as you
should he should never have to work to get you in the mood. Stop being so
selfish!Perhaps you can make it up to him by performing oral sex on him and
cook him a nice meal.

Dear Mr. Abby:

Q: My husband always has an orgasm then rolls over and goes to sleep never
giving me one.

A: I'm not sure I understand the problem. Perhaps you've forgotten to cook
him a nice meal.

Good morning, I do feel better today.  I think being outside yesterday brought out the worst in my cough.  Good luck in your talks!

Hey handsome, hope you're feeling a little better today.  You sounded awful 
last night.  Thanks for being a friend, I really enjoy spending time with 
you.  Can't wait to start working and keeping my days busy.  Bob is supposed

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

This morning, WIC requested authorization from the FERC to place the
Medicine Bow Loop project (pipeline and compression) into service.  We
requested and anticipate approval next week, and assuming that approval, the
project will  be placed in service late next week.  Under the terms of your
Medicine Bow Loop contracts, the reservation rates and your initial first
month MDQ's will become effective December 1, 2001.  I will update you on
any developments and notify you when we have received and accepted the
approval requested above.

For Medicine Bow Lateral Shippers, your MDQ's will proceed as set forth in
your contracts, and you will see a reduction in your rate for November to
12.6 cents per dth (to reflect total MDQ's exceeding 350 Mdth/day) and for
December to 12.0 cents per dth (to reflect the Medicine Bow Loop
in-service).

Please call me if you have any questions.

This is a Gas Daily call deal.  The deal is still alive and underway.  The volumes have been taken to zero due to the fact that CSU has not called on any gas, lately.  Please get with Tyrell Harrison on the confirmation as this deal is still valid.

Thanks
Paul 

Gentlemen,

What's happening with the above deal ? The term is 11/01/01 - 03/31/02, I can see the volume has been changed to 0 - is this only temporarily or has this deal been killed ?
We show this deal as Pending and I wanted to remind you that we have never confirmed this transaction. Please advise.

Heidi,

Here is my vacation schedule for the remainder of the year.  I should have 4 days to carry over once you take all these days into account.  Please tell me if this is correct.

Thanks

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, "it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new." 

Paul

PS  I have signed the document and have Fed Ex'ed it back to Houston.

yes, completely crippled.  he had to leave his car and take a taxi!

Expires After: 12/11/2001 00:00

did your boy williams get crippled by that stuff.  I know Whitt was
rendered useless.

CJC

The existing position with these guys is that we have been buying gas month to month.  1,500/d from England Energy, and 15,000/d from Dominion E&P.  I'll keep you posted on additional conversations.

Paul, thanks for the note... do we have a position with these guys today either in the form of MTM or payables/receivables? 

Like everyone else, the street continues to pick it's spots on new dealings with us but I wouldn't mind knowing what our existing exposures are to them.

Hello,

Thanks for sending me an email.  I appreciate the interest and found your profile to be interesting as well.  But, I feel I'm at a disadvantage due to the fact that your profile doesn't contain a picture.  Are you sending a picture over later, or making me guess as to what you look like?  Drop me a line and we can hash this out.

Paul

Hi - I'll be honest - I thought you were cute.  Hopefully you are as interesting as you are attractive :)  

Take a look at my profile and send me an e-mail if you'd like.  Hope to hear from you!

I never thought I'd be using a "dating service". But I'm open to trying new things - so let's give it a try. I'm an outgoing, positive, fun person. I LOVE to travela nd experince new places and cultures. I'm always learning something new - right now it's the guitar. I'm also really happy being alone with myself to read, write, or just putz around. I love kids, and they love me - probably because I'm pretty much a kid at heart still. I'm very close to my family and have probably too many good friends - I spend a lot of time keeping up with them all.

Hey what are you guys doing partying without me.  Yes I have been traveling, in fact I have been gone almost all October, up through the 15th.  But I'm finished.   When are you thinking of getting together?  

Hi Paul,
 
Ran into "Tim" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our "get together" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be. 
 
Take care,
Debbe.

Oh by the way I figured out why the water is so harsh on your skin.  So, I will need to fix that ASAP.   It's giving me a rash, at least I hope that's what is giving me a rash.  See ya!

Hey call me tonight at home, so we can catch up!

Hello!  Just wondering what you're up to the rest of the week?  I've got my company x-mas party on Friday downtown at the Hyatt, and need to kill some time before the party.  Are you up for a couple of drinks after work?  I have to tell you I had a dream about you last night.  YES, you were a cowboy!  I rode you like a...Just kidding!  No the real story is you decided on a new "look".  You showed up in wranglers, boots and hat, and best of all a RED flannel shirt!  It was hilarious.  OK, OK it was just a dream, and I won't tell anyone.

Thanks for the email.  I have finally picked out a car, it's the BMW 540i.  I'm looking for a Black car, 2000 or newer.  Thanks for all your help.

Hi.  Sorry I didn't call last night.  Didn't get you reply until today.  Can I call you tonight?

Now here is fine one!
Paul, 
Thanks for writing, This is definitely a source for amusement. I too have been playing with this for a short time (about a week). I don't use my computer that often in my work, so I'm kind of new at this stuff. I don't even know how to put my picture in my profile. 
      Sometimes I think I moved to the sleepiest town in Colorado. Everytime I tell someone where I live they say "Superior? Where's That?" 
My favorite Italian Restaurant is in Broomfield, Original Pizza on Midway. Have you been there? 
Yeah lets meet. A drive around the city sounds great and a drink always  helps. 
Wait, How do I know your not the freakish type that might try and take advantage of me. After all, you know this city better than I do. Humm, This Could be Trouble. 
Why don't you give me a call and I can try to size you up on the phone.

Carole,

Wow you are really bringing me down!  No I don't feel uncomfortable giving you my information.  I do want you to know that you have always been a pleasure to work with and I hope we can continue working together in the future.  If you get some time off, hopefully time off with pay, come to Denver and I'll take you skiing!

That's so weird, I'm been running around the office all day today yelling; we're done, we're done. But only for a different reason.  Do you want your old job   back?  Congrat's on school.  Come down here and buy us a drink! 

I'm done!!  I'm all done!!  Remember when I left you guys a message after
having my eyes done?  Well this is the same feeling.  It's just so great, I
had to share it with all of you.  It's a tremendous feeling.  I can't stop
smiling.  Thanks for all your help on my many little projects for school.

Talk to you guys later.  Take care,

Jess

We ARE working!  But we don't know if we are getting paid.  We are in the process of moving due to the construction we are doing.  But after that who knows?  They are laying off over 80% in Houston.  We are just standing-by waiting on the next piece of information.  
 
What did you do this weekend?  Did you go out with your "friend" JP?

Hey guy.  Are you working?  What's going on?

Hey you.  I just came back to my office, the one I'm moving into once all the construction is over.  Only the contractor pulled out and all construction has come to a stop!  The contractor, Todd, isn't acting all that honestly in this bankruptcy stage.  Where and what time do you want to meet tomorrow?

Good morning!  another busy day at the office.  i almost bagged the gym
today to sleep in, but dragged my butt out of bed at the last moment and
went in to do cardio.  i have been a machine lately at the gym.  I think
I've worked out every day except two in the last couple of weeks.  tomorrow
will be another early morning with my trainer.  Did some volunteer work
with the junior league last night for a couple hours.  we did some crafts
with the families over at Warren Village, a single parent housing project.
It was eye-opening, to say the least.  I need that every once in a while as
a reality check on my "charmed life".  Have been working furiously to make
arrangements to fly to Asia for the holidays.  Plan to fly to Hong Kong,
then spend Christmas in Vietnam and New Year's in Shanghai.  All this is
last minute, so it's costing a bloody fortune, but it should be
spectacular.  wish i had saved up $$prior to making this decision.  now my
camera is broken so i'm trying to possibly buy a new one before the trip.
i guess what i'm trying to say is that i'm broke and will be going into
debt unless i decide to sell some stock (at a loss).  Got any Enron stock
on ya?  kidding.

Saw Larry Bevins last week at Marlowe's and he gushed on and on about what
a great guy you are.  I didn't believe a word he said, but I'm wondering
how much you're paying him.  Or perhaps other favors are exchanged?

Definitely up for a drink tomorrow after work.  will call later.

kt

Call me on my cell 303 810-5708.  I want to know what's up with tonight.

What is UP my brother?  Yes the executive management of Enron blew the company up.  The largest bankruptcy in the history of the WORLD!  I don't know why these numbers 
are coming up.  So, all I do is wait around and do personal shit.  I am in for skiing, I've been looking for a deal on housing but so far they are only publishing the discounted rates for the coming two weeks.  I need to get dates from Mike so I can look to book something.  He is still talking to those Brazilian chicks so maybe we have action!  How's everybody doing?  OU really hit the skids late in the season.  What's up with that?   Ask Mike about the naked pictures I've got.

Later for now
The Looch

So what's up with you?   I hear that your company is going through a little change to put in mildly......
 
So you are still set from what Mike told me.    Dang it..... I guess you're still the rich one and I'm the pretty one..... I guess I can't be both...
 
So how is everything else? Still up for a ski trip????? I sure hope so. I don't know which I look forward to more, the ski trip or Vegas baby......   Snow Skiing is my favorite sport type activity.... unless you count Olympic "Belly wrestling"..... But the trip to Vegas was fun.....Sun and fun- plus the women are wearing less.
 
Check out the new bed I made for my guest room. I sold the last bed.  I hope Mike won't break this bed with his big women action... Oh sorry that's Brian that likes the "Full figured" women.
 
Later Heavy-D

Hell No!  Ever since last weekend when you made up some bogus excuse about having to celebrate Natalie's birthday and not being able to party with me, I've been sulking!  What's up for the weekend.  Here's what I have going on; Friday Night-Office Christmas Party, Saturday Night-Hot Tubing with random chicks (any interest?).

You don't call, you don't write...are you over me???

Check this out it goes on for ever.
> Saludos..........

Well maybe next time I should lay off the free drinks!  I've been screwing off all week.  I went to the AV's game last night and I'm just getting into the office now.  Man I love this job!

Paul

I have to tell you, you were a hit at the party the other night.  People
are talking.

How are you today?

Hey where's the happy hour?

Great job with Ty!  Now what about the rest of us?

Police arrested Malcolm Davidson, a 27 year old white male, resident of
Wimbledon, in a pumpkin patch at 11:38 pm Friday. Davidson will be
charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public
intoxication at the County courthouse on Monday.

The suspect allegedly stated that as he was passing a pumpkin patch, he
decided to stop. "You know, a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and
there was no one around here for miles. At least I thought there
wasn't," he stated in a phone interview from the County courthouse jail.
Davidson went on to state that he pulled over to the side of the road,
picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purposes, cut a
hole in it and proceeded to satisfy his alleged "need". "I guess I was
just really into it, you know?" he commented with evident embarrassment.

In the process, Davidson apparently failed to notice the Wimbledon
Municipal police car approaching and was unaware of his audience until
officer Brenda Taylor approached him. "It was an unusual situation,
that's for sure," said officer Taylor. "I walked up to (Davidson) and
he's...just working away at this pumpkin." Taylor went on to describe
what happened when she approached Davidson.

"I just went up and said, "Excuse me sir, but do you realize that you
are screwing a pumpkin?" He got real surprised as you'd expect and then
looked me straight in the face and said, 'A pumpkin? Damn... is it
midnight already?"

I received your email but I could not get to your profile.  I'm getting an error message when I try and bring it up.  I hope you receive this email, if you do see if you can correct the problem on your end.

Hello!
I'm a fun, 33 year old Boulder native, CU grad and work in advertising.  I'm funny, independent and outgoing.  I love my life but desire to have someone to share it with, now since most of my friends are married and starting to have children.  It makes the social opportunities less available and spontanious...I'm sure you can relate.

I love my life and own my own place in Boulder which I share with my adored dog, Buddy.  I'm a huge Buff fan and wish I could go to the Fiesta Bowl for new years.

WHat about you?  WHere did you go to school?  Do you love working in Denver?  The social scene is so great!  Lots to do, great restaurants, fun bars.  I worked there prior to taking my job here in Boulder...I really miss it.

Anyhow, I hope you are having fun and a good repsonse from your ad.  You have a great smile and eyes!  I hope to hear back from you so I can learn more about you!

Take Care,
C

Hi,

I did make the cut and I'm one of the three, in fact I've got to stay around for a certain period of time before Enron will let me go.  I think I'll stay put through the holidays and then see what happens during the first part of January.  I hope your flight went well!  It looks like the weather will be nice on Friday and cold and snowy on Saturday.  Enjoy your time on the slopes and I'll talk to you soon.

Paul

Hey-- 

Well, as far as I know, the phone number works! :-)  Talking next week would be fine. I'll be back in Philly as of Sun evening. ie: EST, 2 hours ahead of Denver :-) 

I'm not sure if I should be offering my congratulations or not, you failed to mention whether you were one of the 3 who made the final cut... regardless, you sound like you're hanging in there. 

I'm sitting in the airport, on my way home and thrilled to be doing so. 

Talk to you later!

Hey,

Thanks for the phone number, I hope it works! It's a little crazy for me this weekend also. Why don't I call you during the first part of next week and see if we can set something up. What time zone will you be in?

As far as the job goes, three in this office made the final cut. So we are waiting around for our next set of orders. I'll explain more later. Take care.

A fire fighter is working on the engine outside the
station when he notices a little girl next door in a
little red
wagon with little ladders hung off of the side and a
garden hose
tightly coiled in the middle.

The girl is wearing a fire-fighter's helmet and has
the wagon tied to a dog and a cat.

The fire fighter walks over to take a closer look.
"That sure is a nice fire truck," the fire fighter
says, with
admiration.

"Thanks," the little girl says.

The fire fighter looks a little closer and notices
the girl has tied the wagon to the dog's collar and
to the cat's
testicles.

"Little partner" the fire fighter says, "I don't
want to tell you how to run your fire truck, but if
you were to tie
that
rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go
faster."

The little girl says, "You're probably right, but
then I wouldn't
have a siren.

Don't worry I'm not going to do it.  Don't I still need to collect from you for the loser's pool.  $60.00

can you send it on by tomorrow before the game starts?

No need to apologize! I figured you were busy doing something.  We did not go skiing yesterday, it seems that even though we are in a period of "No Work" something always comes up and needs to be done immediately.  I will be around tonight.  I would of tried you later Monday night but I didn't get back to my house until after nine and last night I was at the Nuggets' game watching the San Antonio Spurs, my hometown team, have their way with the Nuggets.  I'll call you after 8:00 pm MST.  If it works tonight great if not I'll keep trying.  You can fill me in on your job.

Paul

Hey Paul-- 

OK, first, I'm sorry I missed your call Mon night--I was looking forward to talking to you! Secondly, sorry I didn't follow up your call with an email... It's been sort of a strange week in that I thought it was going to be really slow, but then have been busy not only during the day, but have had work obligations every evening, too--including this evening. While I'm usually happy to go home, I'll be particularly so this week. I just can't believe that Christmas is next week already. Ugh. 

Did you make it up skiing yesterday? If so, where'd you go? How was the snow?  While it did snow last weekend, it didn't start until Sat afternoon and we went back to Denver Sat night--in the midst of the snowstorm--so really didn't get to enjoy any of the fresh snow... just the headaches it caused. 

I'm glad to hear that at least your boss is optimistic about your future options...I'm less so about my own future, but at least being unemployed now would mean more time on the slopes. 

In any case, I have a dinner this evening with my team, but should be home (hotel home) around 10ishEST. If you're around this evening,  maybe we could try to talk then?  I'm dying to hear your theories on Elvis... 

:-)

Hey,

Got your email, I'm sorry your weekend didn't turn out as well as you might have expected, at least that's the message I'm getting. I thought about you this weekend when the weather turned out to be nice, and we had fresh snow on Saturday night. I hope you didn't get hurt skiing.

I think I'm skiing tomorrow. There isn't anything going on around here and probably won't be for awhile. Our boss was here Friday night for our Christmas party. He thought once everything was finalized we would like this new deal. So I hope he's right, it's still way too early to tell.

I'll try and call you this evening. I'm looking forward to the conversation. Remember keep your sarcasm in check, you know how sensitive I am.

Topics Open for discussion;

1.) Solutions for solving world hunger
2.) Is Elvis still alive and if so where is he. (I have a theory or two on this on! e)
3.) NSYNC or the Backstreet Boys, which group is more GAY
4.) Is Britney Spears really Madonna's love child

Take Care

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

I still want, and I'm planning, to go to the concert on Friday night, so don't count me out.  We will have to do dinner some other time.  Make sure we talk on Friday because I have an open house from 3:00 to 6:00, and I'll start drinking and forget the plans.  How is everything else going.  I had a GREAT time on Saturday night, so I hope you did also.

Hi  Paul. How are you?  Just trying to plan the rest of my week.  Are we still on for dinner?  I've got my final flag-football game tonight, happy hour tomorrow night, and the 38-Special concert on Friday night, so Thursday night is the only night that really works for me.  Do you still want to go to the concert Friday?  Yes, the puker will be there!  Let me know.  Bye for now.

Zen Quotations:
1. Do not walk behind me, for I may not lead.
..........Do not walk ahead of me, for I may not
..........follow. Do not walk beside me, either.
.........Just leave me the hell alone.

2. The journey of a thousand miles begins with
..........a broken fan belt and a leaky tire.

3. It's always darkest before dawn, so if you're
..........going to steal your neighbor's newspaper,
..........that's the time to do it.

4. Sex is like air. It's not important unless you
..........aren't getting any.

5. Don't be irreplaceable. If you can't be replaced,
..........you can't be promoted.

6. Always remember you're unique.
..........Just like everyone else.

7. Never test the depth of the water with both feet.

8. It may be that your sole purpose in life is simply
..........to serve as a bad example.

9. It is far more impressive when others discover
..........your good qualities without your help.

10. If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try
..........missing a couple of car payments.

11. Before you criticize someone, you should walk
..........a mile in their shoes. That way, when you
..........criticize them, you're a mile away and you
..........have their shoes.

12. If at first you don't succeed,
..........skydiving is not for you.

13. Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day.
..........Teach him how to fish and he will sit in a
..........boat & drink beer all day.

14. If you lend someone $20 and never see that person
again,
..........it was probably worth it.

15. Don't squat with your spurs on.

16. If you tell the truth, you don't have to
..........remember anything.

17. If you drink, don't park
..........accidents cause people.

18. Some days you are the bug, some days you
..........are the windshield.

19. Don't worry, it only seems kinky the first time.

20. Good judgment comes from bad experience,
..........and a lot of that comes from bad judgment.

21. The quickest way to double your money is to
..........fold it in half and put it in your pocket.

22. Timing has an awful lot to do with the outcome
..........of a rain dance.

23. A closed mouth gathers no foot.

24. Duct tape is like the Force. It has a light side &
..........a dark side, and it holds the universe
          together.

25. There are two theories to arguing with women.
..........Neither one works.

26. Generally speaking, you aren't learning much
..........when your mouth is moving.

27. Experience is something you don't get until
..........just after you need it.

28. Never miss a good chance to shut up.

29. We are born naked, wet, and hungry.
..........Then things get worse

So, if I have made payment under this plan will these new CD's I've ordered be free even though they have initially been accessed a charge?  Can you just check my account to see how this new order will effect it.  Is there any way you can provide me with a phone number to speak to someone?  

Thanks
Paul

I won't be able to go with you Friday night, I wasn't even invited.  Keep in touch and we will figure out a time to get together.

I'd LOVE to be your personal assistant.  What would you like me to do first? 
  Saturday night is looking rough because my daughter Brigette, leaves for 
Sea Camp on Sunday morning, for an entire week.  Any possibility that you 
may come to the cocktail party on Friday?  Today kinda sucks, but it's 
expected right?

Don't worry he has made up his mind so no matter what I say I can't change it.  What are you doing later this week?  Now that you have a job you can take me out.

Yo Bubba!  You better not be trying to change his mind, I don't want to hurt 
you (or put you up in a flea infested "No-Tell"  type motel the next time I 
book your travel arrangements!)  Heard any good jokes lately? - Moi

I just hung out yesterday and worked around the house and watched football.

Yea you sent that one out and I actually have had it sent to me before!

Whats up!  Today I am feeling tired...Did you do anything yesterday!  I
think I need a complete week of detox in order to feel normal?  I actually
ran the last two days but instead of the comfort feeling I just feel ache!
I hate mon and tuesday because they are such long ass day10-8?  Well at
least the game is on tonight!
Later

After I got you message I blew off the trip downtown.  Instead I watched football and worked around the house.  I was able to get a couple things done that have been left undone for awhile, so it was worth it.  You are leaving town for a couple of weeks?  Where are you going?  I'm free every day except Wednesday.

Hi Paul, sorry I bailed on you yesterday.  Did you find any good deals?  When can I get you your ski pass?  I'm leaving town for a couple of weeks starting Saturday, so let me know.  I'll talk to you later.

Who got spanked?  Hopefully Natalie!  We are partying on Halloween.

We got crazy at Cool River.  Smokin Cigars, drinking heavily...there was even a little spanking going on!  You missed it, man.  Still up in the air about Halloween.  What's the fun single thing to do?  

What you had a birthday without telling me about the party!  What did you do?  What are you guys doing for Halloween?

This is the beginning of the busy season for my industry, so things have been hoppin at work.  Celebrated my 31st birthday last weekend.  Very fun!  Been wanting to get some golfing in before it gets too cold.  What about you?

That's too bad, I would have come down and met you.  What has been going on with you?

Hey, welcome back.  Sorry I missed you last night.  I was down in Cherry Creek having some drinks with friends, and didn't hear my phone.  Hope you had fun.

I'm free everyday except Wednesday.  So it's up to you.

Hey baby!  I just love it when your little messages "pop" up.  I don't know 
if Mark's made up his mind yet, but I have a pretty good feeling about it.  
If (when) I officially have the job, you ought to take me out to lunch, 
seeing how you'd be one of my big, bad bosses!  Not to mention, I'm reduced 
to a poor working woman again.  Is there a dress code in the office?  What 
are your plans for later this week?

Yeah, let's do lunch on Thursday!  Who are you going on your vacation with?  

Yeah, I'm taking off on a road trip to California.  We're planning to go to Lake Tahoe, then down into Sacramento and San Fransisco for a couple of days, then off to wine country, and back down the coast, finally stopping in Vegas on the way back.  Should be a blast!  I soooo need a vacation. Would you like to go to lunch on Thursday?  I can come down town.  I have a meeting up north at 2:00 so that would work well for me.

After I got you message I blew off the trip downtown.  Instead I watched football and worked around the house.

above?

Saturday and Thursday night, what else do you want from me?  Where were you thinking of meeting, what theater?

Ok, I know what I'd like.  I'd like to meet you at the movies on Thurs 
night, unless you've already made plans.  Say around 7ish?  I really would 
like to see "Shallow Hal".  What cha think bout that?  (tried to cancel this 
first e-mail to add:  call me) Sorry if you got 2 copies.

Why not Saturday?

Ola girlfriend!  I was thinking of meeting in the middle, like Denver
West?  They have a nice new theatre.  So I don't monopolize too much of your 
precious time, would you rather just hang out on Thurs and skip Sat this 
week?  Let me know, oh evil one.

Ruth,  Attached is a redline and clean version of the amendment.  I added the language we discussed on the phone.  I also added paragraph and associated changes to make it clear that this pricing doesn't comment until December 1, 2001.  

  

Oh I can handle it!  Can you?

Well lookie here, lookie here!  I just love promptness.  I just thought you 
were suggesting that you couldn't handle 2 times in one week with me!

Contact me directly, I always want to be involved!

On Tuesday, November 13, 2001, the Douglas Station will be out of service for approximately 8 hours.  Throughput during the work will be reduced to a rate of about 360 MMCf/d with a total daily throughput estimated at 450 MMcf/d.  

As this will directly effect all gas coming out of the Powder River, please contact your marketer directly as to how much gas they will be able to deliver into WIC on that day.  Allocations will be based on WIC allocations methods.

when you get a sec, would you kindly send me the symbol(s) for Enron.  I'd 
like to check them out stock wise, and is there a good web site I can look 
at you find out a little more about the company?  There are quite a few 
different Enron's, and I'm not sure who's who.  Tanks a latte!

Did you get my voice mail about the logistics of tomorrow night?

Mark and Rachel Reinert and Marc and Sheri Bokelman will also be at the
concert tomorrow night.

Yes you are!  So does that work, for me to meet you at the restaurant at 6:00?

yes, how convenient for you to have me drive so you can get liquored up at
dinner and the concert!  Always thinking of others aren't you?  Just
kidding.  I realize I'm the more responsible one and a much more logical
choice given the options!

Here is the latest on our search for a new condo.  Search Over!  Due to the recent drastic fall in the Enron stock price, $90 in Jan. to $8.50 today, we have postpone our search.  So we will have to look for a place to stay.  Rental rates may be too expensive in Vail, so we may have to look else where.  We are off to a late ski season this year, it's November 7th and it is very warm here.   I'll start looking for leads on housing.  I also have a paid trip to Cancun in February the 21st - 24th.  Keep me posted on everything.
 

I just recevied my reply from the Brazilian ski team and it looks like we're on between 16 Feb - 3 Mar.  Let's
start thinking about when we want to go and get something booked.  Paul, start thinking about where we
would want to stay in Vail.
 
Later
 

H i Michael, good to rear from you.How are you and the guys doing?Did you pratice enough to ski with us again?Ii t will be great to meet you again.

In despite to be insane  thinking in traveling to USA at this moment, we are buyin our tikets this week and also hiding our passports so our parents will not forbt us to ski.Everybody says we are crazy and we are,crazy for ski...

We will be in Vail from feb 16 till march 3,the first week we will be in an apartament and then we will move to another place, probably in Eeagle,25 miles from Vail were I know a small hotel very cheap

How  the life is going on with all this mess? Are you affraid?

I hope you can set-up the dates ,it is so nice to meet someone and keep seeing even living so far.See you soon, take care,P

Hey Jack needs to only talk to me.  And, what color are you wearing?  I would hold on Enron stock for now.  I think it is a long term buy but I don't see anything good on the immediate horizon so I think you may get a better price if you wait.  Are you wearing Jeans tonight.

Jack Vaughn is in our office right now.  He just walked into my office and
said (like always) "Hey, Gorgeous!  Wow, that's a great color for your
eyes."  And my boss still doesn't quite seem to get it when I tell him it
is often difficult for a woman to be taken seriously in this industry.

Is Enron stock a good buy at $8?

Yes I'm going to the luncheon today.  I also brought jeans, but I too am wearing a skirt so I won't deprive YOU of a look at MY legs.

I'm wearing green today.  No, I'm not going to wear jeans tonight.  I
thought about it, then decided against it.  I didn't want to deprive you of
a good look at my legs, so I wore a skirt.  Are you going to the COGA
annual meeting/lunch (I only go because of the free food) today?

Hello;

How are you today?  I talked to Alicia she is going to talk to you then provided everything is cool, which I think it is, she'll buy the tickets and I'll pay Mark.  So, I've got you covered.  What do you have going on Friday.  Want to come over to my house and play?  I'll be out the majority of the day but write me back.

Paul

What is the plan for tomorrow for lunch.  Do you want to meet me downtown?  I'll be out the majority of the day.  Talk to you soon.

Paul

The concert was great!  We had box seats so we drank for free, which is always a plus.  As far as Enron goes we definitely need this Dynegy deal!  What's up with you this weekend?  We are going to the wine tasting thing on Saturday, right?  What about Friday night want to play doctor?

Just wanted to see how the concert was and find out what you think about 
Dynegy possibly buying out Enron.  Is that a good or bad thing, or does it 
even matter?

I briefed Scott, +8 into WIC & +1 CIG Wind, both at the mid.  I'm thinking about the 2000 A8, they start in the low 50's.  I think I'll take out a loan and secure it with Enron stock and stock options! 

Paul--

I know its early and prices are way down, however in preparation for the Lost Creek Members Meeting, could you please give me an idea of the spread across Lost Creek for December baseload deals?

Thanks bro.

 The Weakest link'
 ..

 Are you the weakest link???

 I am going to ask you three questions.

 And you have to answer them instantly.

 You can't take your time.

 You have to answer immediately.

 O.K.?  Don't  cheat.

 Let's find out just how clever you really are

 ........... ........

 Ready?

 ..

 GO !!!!!

 ..

 First Question

 ..

 You are participating in a race. You overtake the second place runner.

 What position do you finish?

 ...

 NOW! See the answer below..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 Answer

 ..

 If you answered that you finish first, you are absolutely wrong!!!

 Why? Because when you overtake the second place runner and

 you take his place, you finish in second place!!

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 To answer the second question, don't take as much time as you

 took for the first question.

 ..

 ..

 Second Question:   If you overtake the last runner then you arrive...?

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 Answer: If you answer that you arrived second to last, you are wrong
again.

                   Tell me, how can you overtake the LAST runner !!!!

                   The question is wrong!

                You're not very good at this are you???

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 Third Question

 ..

 Subject: *Very, very tricky math!

 Note:   This riddle must be done IN YOUR HEAD ONLY

                and NOT using paper and a pen.

 ..

 Try it.

 ..

 Take 1000 and add 40 to it.

 Now add another 1000.

 Now add 30.

 Add another 1000.

 Now add 20.

 Now add another 1000.

 Now add 10.

 ..

 What is the total? (scroll down for answer)

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 ..

 Did you get 5000?

 ..

 The correct answer is actually 4100.

 ..

 Don't believe it? Check it with your calculator!

 ..

 The decimal sequence confuses our brain that always jumps to the

 highest decimals (100s instead of 10s).

 ..

 This should have you in a bad mood for the rest of the day!!!

 ..

 You are the weakest link. Goodbye.

 ..

Do you want to meet for lunch Wednesday?  Then spend the night, or at least until you have to leave?  WE can hot tub!

Hey you, Thursday is actually a bad night for me this week.  I'm available 
for lunch anyday this week, or possibly dinner tonight or tomorrow.  Any 
ideas?   -Moi

Sorry I have been out of the office on vacation and business.  I'll call Basler ASAP.  What about you, what's up?

Lucci,
What's up big daddy? Any word on Basler?  

-Dan

I was meaning for you to come down Wednesday night.  I have lunch plans already, sorry.  Is that ok?

I would LOVE to meet for lunch on Wednesday!  I am so bored and lonely 
today, glad you shot me an e-mail.  Planning to go to the club later tonight 
so hopefully I'll be in prime hot tub condition!  I know I keep bugging you, 
but I can't help it.  I feel so completely isolated at times and I just keep 
reaching out.  Hope you don't mind coddling me every now and again.  I had 
such a great time last friday when I came into town for the so called 
"interview".  So nice to meet new people and hang out.  Can't wait to come 
to work with everyone, it seems like a great office.  Ready to get into an 
early morning workout regime as well, but mostly I just want something to 
fill my day.  Don't I sound pathetic today...yuck!

Hey, where are you?  Did you get my last email?

Paul

I was wondering where you were.  I've got tickets to the Broncos' game on Sunday, would you want to go?  Also, I need to get back to working on buying gas delivered off the Jonah system, so can we talk about delivery points and rates?

I was in Wyoming Monday/Tuesday of this week.  Just got your messages.
Toured the Jonah Field (essentially four big compressor stations plus the
JT plant) and the Opal plant.  It was very cool to see everything and meet
some of the operations people out there.  They are fun to hang out with.

As for my weekend, it was good.  I had a group of friends over Saturday
night.  I cooked for everyone and we had margaritas.  I made homemade
salsa, chicken enchiladas, a salad and then creme brulee for desert.  I
rarely cook, so I know two of my friends just came out of curiosity.
Sunday I did yard work then went on a bike ride at the park with my friend
Rene.  We only rode about 17 miles, but I hadn't been on my bike in quite
awhile and I think I felt every single mile.
Talk to you soon.

                                                                                                                    
                    "Lucci, Paul                                                                                    
                    11/13/01 02:42                                                                                  
                    PM                                                                                              
                                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                    

Hey, where are you?  Did you get my last email?

Paul

Hey what are you up to today?  Are you still planning on meeting me for dinner?

Paul

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

I'm looking forward to it also.  I may not do the ski training class tonight, I'm worried about my ankle.  So, if I don't I'll be ready around 6:30.  I'll keep you posted.  Let's talk later.

Hey you...I was still planning on coming down for dinner, unless you've made 
other plans.  Looking forward to it!

When you get a chance call me.

What you had a birthday without telling me about the party!  What did you do?  What are you guys doing for Halloween?

This is the beginning of the busy season for my industry, so things have been hoppin at work.  Celebrated my 31st birthday last weekend.  Very fun!  Been wanting to get some golfing in before it gets too cold.  What about you?

That's too bad, I would have come down and met you.  What has been going on with you?

Hey, welcome back.  Sorry I missed you last night.  I was down in Cherry Creek having some drinks with friends, and didn't hear my phone.  Hope you had fun.

Dear Abby says; call her, hunt her down!  If you don't want her I'll take her or at least I'll take her after you.  

Big tits and Paul....one of the same...Hey dude you know that chick I meet
at the Stampede...well she called me last wednesday 3 times but I had the
chick form NY at my house for 3 nights and so I could only call her on
friday while Denice was in the shower.  I called her again and the number
is now disconnected....The caller Id when she called my house is from her
home....DO I call her there....hummm...I will try that number tonight!
Later

The latest at Enron is Business as usual.  At least that's what they want us to believe.  I think we will be effected eventually, but it will take time for Dynegy to figure out what they have.  I don't think anything will change for us until at least the middle of next year.  Hopefully they send some of these Enron directors to jail!

Nothing new with me.  I've got pictures of Robin, she's the girl you met at the Rock Bottom in Broomfield, I think you should see!

Hey Looch!!

Funny e-mail.   What's the latest at Enron?   Have you heard anything that
could affect your status here in the Denver office?  I sure hope
not....unless its good news of course.

Jared is done with football and has already moved onto basketball.   His
first game was last night in Limon.   We lost 45-27 but I think his team has
potential.   They should do ok.

What's new with you?

I promise.  In fact why don't you and Bob take us to the Rio on Friday so we can drink, I mean forget about our troubles.

Glad to here it! 

This may sound a little dramatic, but if there's anything I can do to help
you , please count on me to help.   You've been a terrific friend to me a
time when I really needed help this past year.  You're not the type of
person who expects a lot in return, but always know your generosity was...as
is...appreciated.   You're a good person.    (Regardless of what the rest of
the industry thinks of you!!!)        ...............just kidding.

Thanks for all your help and promise you'll call on me if you ever need help

I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.

PS  I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen, but I feel that I am very close!

heard last night that forest oil is marketing through aec again in
december.  also heard they have been instructed not to sell to enron.  aec
has also received directives not to sell to enron.  are you hearing that a
lot?

sorry to open with negative news.  hope you're doing well today.  i'm a bit
tired.  was up late for the avs game last night then got up early for my
training at the gym this morning.  may require high amounts of caffeine
today.

might do a quick drink with a friend tonight.  are you working out after
work?  if you have no plans maybe you could meet us for a drink.  it will
be an early night for me.

have a great day

Hey thanks for the Thanksgiving invitation!   I thought I would die from exhaustion if I had to drop one more hint.  I'll either whip up one of my famous gourmet dishes or stop off at the liquor store for wine, and if I do bring wine it will be the very best box wine 7/11 has to offer.  But in either case I will not be bringing any of my hotties, I'm having them all sent out for chemical bathes so they will be clean for the holidays.

Thanks Again

Paul

PS  At dinner, see if you can seat me next to Nadine, I'll owe you!

themselves...sheesh!  -moi

I thought you might appreciate the following article in Energyfax.  Read Ken Lay - Honest Man.  Apparently overstating earnings and misstating financials for years while at the same time exercising options and making yourself over $100 million is a sign of virtue.

Well at least that was all you guys buried!  I know you don't like these types of jokes, but I couldn't resist.

had lunch with our friend, bob, today.  decided it was time to bury the
hatchet.

That's too bad, I would have come down and met you.  What has been going on with you?

Hey, welcome back.  Sorry I missed you last night.  I was down in Cherry Creek having some drinks with friends, and didn't hear my phone.  Hope you had fun.

Did he or didn't he?  You decide!

Many of you, I know, will appreciate this.

PHILOSOPHY 101

A philosophy professor stood before his class. He picked up a large empty
mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks.  He then asked the
students if the jar was full?  They agreed that it was. The professor
picked up a box of  sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand
filled up everything else. "Now," said the professor, "I want you to
recognize that this is your life.

"The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your
health, your children - things that if everything else was lost and only
they  remained, your life would still be full. The sand is everything else.
The small stuff.

"If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room  for the rocks.
The same goes for your life. If you spend all your  time and energy on the
small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to
you."

But then a student took the jar which the other students and the professor
agreed was full, and  proceeded to pour in a can of beer. Of course the
beer filled the  remaining spaces within the jar making the jar truly full.

The moral of this tale is: That no matter how full your life is,  there is
always room for BEER.

I found the perfect costume for that upcoming Halloween party!

Ruth,

This is a revised copy from Gerald.  Please disregard the last copy and review this one.  I'll call you to make sure you get it.

Paul
Paul,  Disregard the prior version and use this one.

  

Hey you back!
 
I'm sorry that I made you feel that way.  Don't take it for anything other than I was very busy.  I have no problem being friends and even getting together, whenever.
Right now I'm in a position in my life where I just want to do what I want to do, I know that's very selfish but truthfully that's how I feel.  I think after you get through with all the BS that's going on in your life you will understand where I'm coming from.  So for now don't take anything I do personally, and feel free to call whenever you want.  And, yes I wuld like to get together.....
 
Paul
And you too have a great day!!!
 
 
 

Hey You!!!
 
I don't usually do the e-mail thing but I am tonight....
 
Listen I felt a little strange talking with you the other
day....you seemed a bit stoic or maybe a bit too business
like.....Is everything ok with you??  I realize you are very 
busy right now after coming back from a lot of time off....
But it did feel strange......
 
I just want you to know that I did not call to get together
with you I just called to see how you where doing....I seems
to me that you felt obligated to tell me that we would get
together sometime.....Don't do that.....Really I just need 
a friend sometimes to chat with....I realize I can be quite 
hard to get along with and not real appealing at those times..
 
So I guess my bottom line is that I think you are a great person
inside and you are a blast to be with.....It would be great to
get together with you just to have some fun....but please
don't feel obligated ..........
 
Anyway, I am not sure if I got my point across or not but
it would be nice to hear from you...
 
Always........
 
Robyn

See Ya
Have a Great Day!!!!

I'm very very good.  But, acting very very bad!

Do you deserve one?  Have you been very good, or very bad?  I need to know 
what kind of spanking to give you!

Gerald,
 
Eric, in structuring, has this question on the wording of the Kennedy Amendment.  I told him you "the master of wording" was ok with it.  What do you think?
 
Paul
 
 
PS   I hope it closes today! 
 
 
Paul,
The language regarding the volumes still has the phrase " up to" implying the customer may own some put rights. Can we remove that language and just say 10,000 MMBtu/d, etc?
 
emoon

Here is the latest. 

<<Kennedy Amd2.doc>> 

P.S.  I was kidding about Bob, I want your adrenaline to flow.  I thought it would help wake you up.  Gotcha!!

I'm glad you had a good time.  I did also.  Yes, keep me posted on your happy hour.  I talked to Bob this morning and explained your frustrations and that you have him on your S___ List.  So he said he would like to talk to you.  So you see, once again I have served you well.

Good morning.  Just wanted to say thanks again for dinner last night.  I
had fun.

4:30 came early this morning.  It always does.  Of course I didn't make it
to bed until 10:30 again so I only got 6 hours of sleep.  Makes for a "many
coca cola afternoon".

Will call you tomorrow to let you know when/where we'll be.

kt

Bob,

This week I pick the Colts!  I'm meeting Karen tonight for dinner, so I'll tell you how that goes.  She made a comment about you yesterday, your name came up and she said "that Bob."  I said "I thought you and Bob were friends."  And she said "Oh that Bob!"  So I figure she's mad at you for, you know the "twins."  Anyway I won't say anything, so don't worry.  We moved the happy hour to next Friday 26th, so you better be there.
Maybe even "Cool River."  

Paul

Here is the latest.

 

Ruth,

Here is the amendment to the purchase contract, please look it over.  It contains all the transportation options we have talked about and provides us the flexibility we need to re-price the CIG Index piece if there are additional future opportunities.  I will be giving you a call to make sure you have received this amendment and to answer any questions you may have.

Paul
 

 

Beer is fine with me.  So you have to drive Greg around all day Saturday.  That should be a perfect time to talk to him about his wife's fondness with other men.  And since Russ is going to the party will there be a fight?  This party is going to be exciting!

What do you want to drink?  I think Greg (Corinnes husband) is 
getting a Keg, Scotch and alot of wine!  I have wine and Vodka at my 
house (gotta have a pre-party cocktail), so if you want something 
else tell me now!!  Other than that, I am bringing Brie, and I think 
that will cover our part.  If you can't get ahold of me Saturday 
afternoon, call my cell, because Greg cannot drive and I have to take 
him on some errands for the party.
-- 
NGFC, tcooper@ngfc.com on 17/10/2001

I'm looking forward to Saturday, thanks for inviting me!  Since you don't want to be the first person at the party you can kill time by giving me a tour of your house.  I printed the email that has all the information, so I'll plan on calling you sometime Saturday and then meeting you at your house at 5:00.  Let's talk Saturday, here's my home phone number (303) 469-6768, and my cell (303) 810-5708.  Should we bring anything?

5:00 would be just fine.....I don't like being the 1st person to show 
up at a party anyways!!  It should be alot of fun....they are fun 
group of people.

NGFC, tcooper@ngfc.com on 17/10/2001

Steven changed jobs.  Email Whitt for his new numbers.  Any hot chicks at your party.  I was out voted Saturday night in favor of Opie Gone Bad at the Little Bear.

Yea nice try.  The Giants did you in.  Hey do you have Steve Jernigan's # I
can't e-mail him for some reason.  Thanks

I would like to shut it down.  So send me my pro rata share.  How was
your party?  And hot chicks?

We lost 4 of the 9 remaining players this week.  If the 5 players want
to
shut it down and split the $$ we would each get $102.40.  Call me and
let me
knwo what you think.  720 956-3005 <<losers pool.xls>>

Ok, I'm in!  Should I just show up at your house, at 5:00?

Canadians always start their parties early!!  We only have the 
clubhouse until 11:00 and then who knows where it will end up....I am 
hoping its not my house!!  Is that too early for you?  I think they 
have invited 50 - 60 people.

NGFC, tcooper@ngfc.com on 17/10/2001

please send them again so we can line them up.

Most of what we'll see are properties I have already sent you, but I can send them again if you like.  What time did you have in mind.  Anytime is good for me.
 
Randy

Let's look to try and meet early rather than later, but who knows.  Also what about lining up properties between $200,000 and $350,000.  Thenw eeding them out based upon age and number of bedrooms (3).  If you can shoot us the listings first so Mark and I can narrow them down to around 10.
 
 
Thanks
Paul 

Paul,
 
Sunday's good, let me know if you need to change, otherwise I'll set up about 8 or 10 places to see.
 
Randy

Please disregard all previous emails this is the right one ......I hope.

 

 

4:45 isn't that early.  What kind of a party will this be?  Will there be a lot of people, and what time is it over?

Is 4:45 OK?  Take 128th over to Washington and go North on Washington 
to 136th.  East on 136th to High Street (I think it is the 3rd right) 
Take a right on High street and go to your third street, 135th Ave 
(the development is called the Meadows at Hunters Glen)  and take 
another right.  My address is 1825 E 135th Ave. It is like 8 houses 
down on the right...will be the first house on that side with a 3 car 
garage.  My home number is 303 457-3705 in case you get lost.

Here is what about we have been showing Kennedy Oil.

 

What time should I meet you at your house on Saturday?  I'm not going to the reception tonight.  Shoot me back directions to your house.

I live in Hunters Glen....just east of 136th and Washington.  The 
Club House is about 6 blocks from where I live so that is 
good....walking distance if needed!!  The IPAMS reception is tonight 
at Maggiano's from what I hear.  Are you going?
-- 
NGFC, tcooper@ngfc.com on 17/10/2001

Please look this deal over throughly as we are getting very close to closing with these guys.  I will be giving both of you a call this morning to answer and final questions you may have.

Thanks
Paul

Please disregard the prior version.

 

Yeah that party sounds fun, count me in.  Where do you live and what night is this IPAMS reception?

-- Yeah, its the same gal.  She is alot of fun, even though she does 
bad things!!  All of her friends are fun too, so it should be a good 
time. Canadians always put on fun parties  I think she invited Russ 
Moran too.  Give me a call if you would like to go and maybe we can 
just meet at my house and go from here since it is right up the 
block.  Are you going to be at the IPAMS reception tomorrow night?
Talk to you soon
T
Tia Cooper, tcooper@ngfc.com on 10/16/2001

What's up?

That party on Saturday night sounds fun.  I've got plans Friday but nothing on Saturday.  Is this the friend that was dating all those guys while she is married?

Things are good....busy as usual.  Let me know about lunch.  If you 
are not busy this weekend, its Corinnes b-day and we are having a 
party over at the Hunters Glen Clubhouse where I live on Saturday 
night with about 60 people, so let me know if you are free.
Have a good night.
-- 
NGFC, tcooper@ngfc.com on 16/10/2001

Yes I'm still alive.  And if you want let's think about lunch next week.  I just got back in town last night and I'll be busy all week.  If lunch dosen't work out next week, we are having a happy hour on the 26th.  I don't know where yet but tell everyone.  How are things with you?

-- Just checking to make sure you were still alive!!!  How are you 
doing?  Are you free for lunch anytime soon?
NGFC, tcooper@ngfc.com on 16/10/2001

That's funny!

Funny one.

Excuses, Excuses the reason you lost was that your team scored less points than the team you were playing.  It's that simple.  Anyway as for dinner, what about staying downtown and meeting around 6:45 pm, if that's too late we can meet earlier.  The only thing I know that is healthy is Sushi, which isn't my favorite but I'd go if that's a big thing for you.  Or, we can come up with other ideas, I'm wide open. I'll eat anything except for Thai.  

The lady I'm dealing with at Petrogulf is clueless.  The guy I used to deal with is gone and she is new to this area of the business.  Since I'm so nice and receptive to her feelings, I decided to help.  But I'm sure you already know this about my personality.  I'm really not trying to BS you with my emotional side.  I will tell her I can buy the gas into Questar, if you believe that to be the case. All those other delivery points need processing arrangements.  Don't tell Richard Stewart anything about this conversation or YOUR buying dinner!  

Paul,

The A&M game was tragic.  My friend Tim and I went to watch it at a sports
bar and, needless to say, I was the only Aggie fan in the crowd.  We had a
chance to tie it or win it in the last two minutes.  We had driven the ball
from our own 9 yard line to about the CU 30 yard line.  We had a first down
and were going for it when we fumbled ($%&*!!) and they took it back for a
touchdown.  The waitress felt sorry for me and bought us a shot of I don't
even know what.  I'm headed to Texas in a couple of weeks to see the Aggies
Beat the Hell Outta Iowa State at Kyle Field.  I haven't been to Kyle Field
in ages so I'm really looking forward to it.

Petrogulf's agreement indicates they have access to all major delivery
points except Opal until the expansion is in place.  These other points
would include QGM, MGR, OTTCO and QPL.  It's a bit curious to me that they
would have QPL and OTTCO now since they have to go down the 20" to get
there.  Seems like these would be in the same boat with the Opal option, so
maybe this is not a true, current option.  Can't Petrogulf tell you this
stuff?  It's not my place to do it, and the only reason I am is because
you're going to drop a large sum of money taking me out to dinner
(kidding!!).

As for dinner, yes I'm still available.  As for the place, don't feel like
you need to drop a bunch of cash (although cash is thrilling, isn't it??).
I'm happy eating just about anything.  I'm trying to be on a new health
kick, so healthy fare sounds appealing.  My only condition is that I can't
stay out late because I have a 5:30am appointment at the gym with my
trainer Thurs. am.  It's brutal.  I leave the house at 5am.  Want to stay

Hello,

I'm back in the office today.  Well I see you have to eat crow!  I
didn't get a chance to watch the game but I saw CU play Kansas St. and
CU looked good. I even think CU has a good chance of beating UT in
Austin this weekend.

As far as Petrogulf goes, in the mean time before the great expansion,
do they have the right to go to Questar or any other interstate pipeline
delivery points.  I think they can take their gas in kind at
Questar/Bird Canyon, but I'm not sure.

And finally, are you still available for dinner Wednesday night.  I just
got paid so I'm looking to take you some place nice.  Yes, I am bribing
you!

Paul

Paul,

Once the expansion is completed (in the next couple of months),
Petrogulf
will have access to all delivery points off Jonah.  They currently don't
have access to Opal.  I think that's all the super secret information I
can
divulge.

Hope you have a great weekend.  I have a small wager with Shari Wojta
that
the Fightin' Texas Aggies will Beat the Hell Outta CU tomorrow.  Hope I
don't have to eat crow.

See you next week.

kt

I will call her.  I need to give my hair about two weeks to grow out.  Has she started to date again.  I thought she had given up on men after her divorce?  When are you going to get your hair cut?  I've got a date with Karen this week, well at least I think I do.  Have you talked to Larry about Friday?

I can't do lunch this week.  Why don't you plan to pay me at the Halloween
party.  You are a stud at picking teams.  Have you been to see Brandi yet?
You need to call her and set up a hair appointment, 623-4222.  Bob

Bob,

What about me picking two winning teams last weekend.  Can you send me
the latest updated version of the pool.  Also what about lunch later
this week so I can get you your money.  Tell Larry we are going to party
Friday, so he better go along.

Paul,

I do not know where Dead Horse is but as far as Glen Rock is concerned, I believe the Index market to be around CIG Index minus $.05.  We are currently trying to do these sort of Index deals for the winter and one year time periods.  Anything after that is anyone's guess.  If you need anything else don't hesitate to ask.  Hope all is well, and watch out for CU!

Paul

What kind of CIG pricing can a PRB producer get for selling gas in the Powder if you were to buy gas at Deadhorse and Glenrock?

Thanks,

Paul

The deal was done with Field Services and we should change our deal ticket "counter party" to reflect that.

Thanks 
Paul

Paul,

We have the above Sep-01 production deal on WIC pipeline in the system under CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company.  However, the counterparty is billing us under CMS Field Services, Inc.  These two counterparties settle differently.  Please confirm the correct counterparty name if possible.

I would like to shut it down.  So send me my pro rata share.  How was your party?  And hot chicks?

We lost 4 of the 9 remaining players this week.  If the 5 players want to
shut it down and split the $$ we would each get $102.40.  Call me and let me
knwo what you think.  720 956-3005 <<losers pool.xls>>

When I first saw the picture I did think it had a chance of being real, until everyone else said it was a knock off.  I was a little puzzled as to how anyone found the camera.  So at least I had my doubts.  So you want to stay in Calgary another year?

I hope you didn't buy it the first time around.  

We've been having meetings the last couple of days on our Canadian Hunter acquisition.  It's all very exciting.  It will probably mean I
stay here a little longer which is good with me.  I have more friends here now than I did when I was in Houston so I'd like to stay a while
longer.

I'm going home for my 15 year high school reunion this weekend - should be interesting.

What's new with you?

That's funny I saw that original picture and was wondering what the hell
was ging on.  We thought it was BS.  Now I know.  What have you been up
to?

You have probably seen the first picture before.  Other stunning events

Paul
 

My pick for this week is the Vikings.  When are you setting me up with your hair dresser?  

We buy San Juan. But we do not have any gathering.

I forgot to ask in the last e-mail if you guys buy gas in the San 
Juan Basin on EPFS, and if you do, do you have gathering?

I'm sure you guys know about Clay Basin.  Anyway Kitchen just called and said we have 30 days to get all the gas out of the interruptible storage account about 36,000.  So get your F@%&*+ing gas out of the ground.

Paul

And you know at that age those girls put out.  Unfortunately it's their hip that puts out, or should I say "gives out."

That's really bad.  You just want to go down there and get laid by one of
her easy 60 yo friends.  You dog.

My mom is having a party.  She has this party every year, the average
age of the party goers is about 60.  At least I can get drunk on my mom
nickel.

THe A&M game is this coming weekend.  What is going on in SA?
JW

What weekend?  I will be in San Antonio, TX from 10/12-10/15.  So if
it's this weekend I'll be out of town.  But, if not let's party!

I will be coming in next week for the Texas A&M/CU game.  Are you up for
going to it??  THere is a group of us that get together for the game and
party afterwards.

I totally agree, I was extremely stupid.  I'm not kidding, I already have a funny sensation just like I used to get when I was back in OKC.  What was I thinking?

Paul,

I hope you're kidding, but you should probably go get your stuff
checked just in case.  While you're at it you might want to get the prostate
checked too; depending
on your doctor is can actually be a great experience.  My doctor is a hot
blonde female with long
skinny fingers.  Oh I think I'm feeling sick and should go see her again
soon!

Lesson learned, "If you're not going to sack it, take it home and wack it."

Later

I think that chick gave me something!   I serious.

Hello you guys,
 
Well I hope you have Dad doing some of the cleaning!  You know how he always has an opinion but yet no participation.  Anyway I hope you're doing fine.  I'm fine and about to depart to Dallas TX for the weekend.  I'm meeting some of my old military friends for a big party this weekend.  I'm really looking forward to this party, it's due to a college football game (Oklahoma University vs the University of Texas) and has been going on for about six years now.  The guy throwing the party is working hard to make it a tradition and so far he has done a very good job.  The party gets bigger every year and I think this year will be the biggest.  There are people flying in from all over the country.  Flying now after everything that has happened isn't scary to me but now the waiting period for both check in and security has increased substantially.  It's a big pain but obliviously needed.  I'll talk to you guys soon.  Go UT!
 
Paul
 
PS  We haven't found a place in Vail, but we are still looking!

Jealous, you shouldn't be jealous.  I'm about to hit the road from Friday through Monday the 15th (11 straight days), when I get back let's look to get together.  By the way you looked great Monday night.

I mean it was bizarre to run in to you there.  There were thousands of people there and I see you and Robin!  I want you to know I was very jealous by the way!

Wyoming was great and it was good to see YOU at the game.  What do you mean about odds?

Hey, good morning.  How was your trip to Wyoming?  Did you have fun at the game the other night?  It was good to see you.  What are the odds!

Dear Medicine Bow Shipper:

We received notification that the 5th segment to gate valve 6 providing a
total firm capacity of 495 Mdth/day was approved by FERC today.  Based on
the feedback some of you have provided today, and since this is late notice
on a Friday afternoon, the contracts will be effective on Monday, October
29, but the capacity will be available tomorrow and Sunday.  We filed the
6th segment to gate valve 5 this past Tuesday (October 23) and are prepared
to file the final segment as soon as one currently being reviewed is
approved.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Paul & Stan

Here is our purchase proposal we have been sending out for renewal on our purchase agreements.  We have left it somewhat open ended to account for differences in the individual gas packages.  Please review this proposal, as I will be calling you shortly to discuss any changes or questions you have to the proposal.  You can reach me at (303) 575-6474.

Sincerely,

Paul Lucci

 

Wyoming was great and it was good to see YOU at the game.  What do you mean about odds?

Hey, good morning.  How was your trip to Wyoming?  Did you have fun at the game the other night?  It was good to see you.  What are the odds!

Yes, I will ask someone from Denver office to create package... Gas Management, Market Intelligence.. gas flows.. etc.

BT 

Timely note, and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here.
They are getting ready to drill CBM this fall. I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.
Can I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.
Timing is next few days.  I'd like to get this to them by sometime Friday if possible (not the end of the world if it's early next week). 
Thanks.

Eric, did Suncor every get any drilling completed in the Rockies...? 

Jay,
 
We are looking to transact with this customer on a two year index purchase.  I need to discuss the details with you, but in the mean time here are the financials that they have provided.  Take a close look at them and realize this is a very rich man and he can have very bad things done to you.  So, let's keep that in mind when we are working through all the credit requirements.

Hey have you eaten lunch yet?  And when do I get Stacy Mack?

Hey,

It has been brought to my attention that the waivers has not been working
correctly all the time so I have it set up now so that you can pick up
playersTuesday through Saturday but it will rank each day individually.  I
have to approve all adds or drops which I will do every evening.  if more
than one team gose after a player then it will go to the team with the worst
record and then with the least amount of points.  If you have any other
questions let me know.  

Thanks,

Scott  

I'll give you my first round pick next year, you give me Trent Green.

We'll give you our 3rd round pick next year

We can cover the airport so you don't have too.  Just tell everyone we will be at the airport between 1:00 and 5:00ish.  

Guys,

Looks like Will & Paul will be arriving @ DFW around the same time on Friday.
Gonzalo was planning on picking up Paul and I think Rob's going to pick up Will,
perhaps you might want to consolidate and have 1 person pick up both Paul & Will, just
a thought.

I'm just throwing this out as an idea, but you guys work out all the details.  I have to be home between
1:00 - 4:00 for the margarita machine delivery, so I won't be able to pick anyone up.

Paul's Info:
Airline: United
Flt #:  1670
Time: 1:00 pm 

Paul's Pager:     888.773.1942
Paul'sMobile: 303.810.5708

Will's Info:
Airline:  Continental
Flt #:  3801
Time: 2:34 pm
Will's Mobile: 757.589.7180

Gonzalo's Cell Phone:
512.627.8405
webb@cisaustin.org

Rob's Cell Phone:

See you guys Friday.  Please get fresh haircuts and shower before you arrive on Friday; and as always dress to impress.

Later,
Michael

Ok, and yes!  Send me a picture of you so I can remember what you look like.  I mean what you really look like!

I'd LOVE to go to dinner sometime.  Maybe we could go to your place 
afterwards for some dessert?  Miss me yet?

Make note, if there are any screw ups heads will roll.

Barry,

Here is a list and the status of the customers I'm dealing with concerning the El Paso Transportation;

Texaco-I have sent the presentation to my rep (Mike Duval) he is trying to arrange a telephone conversation with the appropriate parties within Texaco
Devon-I have sent the presentation to Devon and have had discussions on the subject.  They seem to be somewhat interested but will be slow to move.  They have committed all their San Juan production until April 2002.
Amoco- Talked to my rep who referred me on to the San Juan trader, these two are not very interested, however Dave Fuller has a contact at Amoco who seems to like the theory.
Reliant-I have had multiple conversations with these guys they are not very interested in this capacity.

I will continue to work with Dave on Amoco, as well as Devon and Texaco.  As new information develops I will pass it on.

Paul

 

Paul, can you please advise as to who you are directing these packages to and the status of their interest. 

BT 

Once again, HELP ME!!!!!!!!!!!!

Paul,
Have you heard anything from Gerald?  We need to get these contracts signed.
I am having problems reconciling with Thersa's invoices.  I have paid the
amount reflected on the invoices even through I did not agree for April,
May, June, and July.  I short paid the August invoice.  This is not a good
situation to be in without a contract.  I am not sure where Greeley and
Enron stand with each other especially in light of the difficulties I am
having reconciling the invoices.  
I do not want either party(Greeley or Enron) to find themselves in a
situation that would end up in arbitration.  Talking on the phone or
exchanging worksheets has not proved to be the most efficient way to settle
these differences.  Do you have any sugestions on how we can get the
contracts executed and the invoices reconciled before the deal terminates at
the end of October?   

Thanks...Robert

I will talk to Theresa and Gerald.  I'm sorry for all the confusion and will get back to you ASAP.

What do you mean bummer, didn't you pick Oakland?  How was Teddy's?

Dude!  What a bummer on the game?  How many people are left in the pool?
Does he ever send a list of people who are left and there picks for the
week?

Joey

What's up you two losers, and I mean losers!  Anyway, since I have to take time out of my busy schedule and lower myself to your standards here is my itinerary so pay close attention.

I arrive Friday October 5th
	Airline:  United
	Flight:	1478
	Airport:  DFW
	Time:	2:21 pm (arrive Dallas)

I leave Sunday at 12:50 pm

I booked two rooms at the Holiday Inn Express, they are in my name but are not paid for yet.  I'll give them a credit card when I get there.  One of the rooms has a King only and the other room has two beds but it's a smoking room, that's all they had.  So smoke um if you got um!  Both rooms have an additional pull out bed, FYI.  I'm looking forward to this weekend, go UT!!!!!!!!!!

Your Master

Paul

PS  I haven't been going to the gym since I started getting laid by this girl.

No, Mark is going to Portland, and he just left.  You got our picks on Friday right?  I also need Karen Taylor's phone number, she's hot for me again.  I rally like her little assistant Laura.

7 people out 1 didn't send a pick at all, 5 picked Indy, and 1 picked
Jacksonville.  We now have 19 left.  Bob  Hey are you going to go to
Portland?

Hey what's up?  How many people picked the Colts this weekend?  I talked
to Todd Gilcrease I guess he's back.  And this time without Kimery.

not sure.  why?  so you can harass me?

are you coming to the front porch

you are killing me

whatever, I understand your embarrasment in getting caught

will you get it in your little skull that this time it was a guy.  that's why i immediately asked you.  and how would you know if i was staring, which i wasn't, unless you were?

would you stop lying about the guy, Im not going to hold it against you for staring

i think that you want the male looker to come

just you baby

Can i bring your male admirer?

do i need to come and slap some sense in you?

I already did in the previous e mails

Why don't you tell me what the real truth is.

I think we both know the real truth

Not nasty.  Just truthful.  :)

you dont have to be nasty

you are a nut!  ok i'm sorry.  i admit it.  i am attracted to men who always have really red eyes and who talk bad about me behind computers!  how did you ever figure me out?

the first step to recovery is admitting it

oh shit you are saying that i have a crush on you?  i am finally catching on.  don't make me come down there and kick your butt!

just admit it

on yourself?

ok a crush

what's an infatuation?  you being a brat?  that will never pass

dont worry it is probably just an infatuation that will pass

that makes you an eve bigger brat.

I know

YOU ARE A BRAT!!!!

whatever, ok if thats what you want me to believe

quit flattering yourself.  it was a male looking at you and he told me!  how do you feel about that?

stop lying, you dont have to be embarrased, I understand

then i guess it is a fact that a male was staring at you.  

i am laughing so hard!!!! :)

I wasnt accusing you I was just stating a fact

i can't tell because then you would acuse them of staring at you too.  

no I dont know how it works, and who told you

don't you have messenger

nobody told you, dont lie

damn you caught me.  and for your information, i didn't notice it...someone told me about it!  so whatever to you mr. allergy man!!!

if you werent always staring at me you wouldnt notice my eyes

you too

poor you.  bye.  have a good night.

not really we are moving again and its kind of a nightmare, i am taking off i will talk to you tomorrow

well i am running it over here.  see you could have had me over there, but oh well.  ha ha for you!!!!  are you cranky?

great

you know that joey is running your book don't you?

what do you mean

k.  guess who's book i get to start running....yours and mr. smiley zipper face!!  :)

i just got out of a meeting, i wont stand you up, around 11:30

i would feel privledged to go to lunch with you tomorrow sir.  that is if you aren't going to stand me up!

i dont know i have been away three of the last four weekends, why dont we go out for lunch tomorrow

um excuse me sir, but i think that you stood me up twice and you never call me back.  so i just decided to stop being part of your enterage.  wade and i are trying to work through things, but i guess that we are getting along a little better.  we have one more hole in our wall and i haven't broken any phones lately so i guess that is a good sign.  we still have a long way to go.  so why haven't i heard from you little one?

i do but i havent heard from you either, how are things with wade

nope.  i am in the old building on the 32nd floor.  i think that is where we all used to be.  it is depressing over here.  and we are actually having to work.  i miss being over there.  so, why don't you talk to me anymore?  

i cant figure that out yet, are you still on the 5th floor

not much.  just over here working on the estate, which is so much fun!  how about you?  do you think that you are going to like ubs?

we are so so, what have you been up to, i was in the cafeteria,

were you in the cafeteria earlier?  i thought that i saw you, but it was from far away.  how are you and sarah doing?

I already did in the previous e mails

Why don't you tell me what the real truth is.

I think we both know the real truth

Not nasty.  Just truthful.  :)

you dont have to be nasty

you are a nut!  ok i'm sorry.  i admit it.  i am attracted to men who always have really red eyes and who talk bad about me behind computers!  how did you ever figure me out?

the first step to recovery is admitting it

oh shit you are saying that i have a crush on you?  i am finally catching on.  don't make me come down there and kick your butt!

just admit it

on yourself?

ok a crush

what's an infatuation?  you being a brat?  that will never pass

dont worry it is probably just an infatuation that will pass

that makes you an eve bigger brat.

I know

YOU ARE A BRAT!!!!

whatever, ok if thats what you want me to believe

quit flattering yourself.  it was a male looking at you and he told me!  how do you feel about that?

stop lying, you dont have to be embarrased, I understand

then i guess it is a fact that a male was staring at you.  

i am laughing so hard!!!! :)

I wasnt accusing you I was just stating a fact

i can't tell because then you would acuse them of staring at you too.  

no I dont know how it works, and who told you

don't you have messenger

nobody told you, dont lie

damn you caught me.  and for your information, i didn't notice it...someone told me about it!  so whatever to you mr. allergy man!!!

if you werent always staring at me you wouldnt notice my eyes

I think we both know the real truth

Not nasty.  Just truthful.  :)

Mike,

It was nice to meet you last night.  At PanCanadian, I'm the gas options
trader, where much of my work is focused on clearing stuff for customer
business.  If you have the opportunity, let me know of any new options
products you guys are working on that I might be able to sell to our
producer, pipeline, and LDC customers for hedging.

I will get it this afternoon thanks

Andy & Mike,

If you bring in your parking cards, you can get a parking spot in the new garage.  They have space available for you.  You have to give them your current card, in order to get your new card.  Please let me know if you would like to bring your current card this afternoon, or if you just want to bring it in the morning.  Someone can go down to the Parking & Transportation office on the 3rd floor and exchange it for you.

Thanks,
Laura

Luara, in Ina's absence can you handle this?

Thanks,
Tammy

Ina, fyi

1.) Andrew Zipper was offered a space on Monday, August 6,2001 at 10:54 a.m.. But never replied to the e-mail.

2.) Mike Maggi was offered a space on May 18,2001 at 2:52 pm.. But never replied.

I do have two spaces available in the new garage for Mr. Maggi and Mr. Zipper. In exchange, please have them return the other parking card to the Parking & Transportation desk located on the 3rd floor.

Thanks,Louis

Louis,

We are moving on to the 6th floor Trading area in the new building.  I have two financial traders under John Arnold who would like a spot in the garage (not reserved) and have not been offered that choice as of yet.  One is currently in the Allen Center and one is in the Clay Garage.  Please help me out on this if at all possible.  I would really like to make their day.

Their names are Mike Maggi and Andy Zipper.

Many thanks, 

Ina Rangel

Thanks for moving quickly on this one.

Hi Jeff,

I'm preparing the letter agreement regarding payment.  Can you help me with 
the name and address to use? 

Thanks,

Kay

This is very helpful.
	
	

Per my voicemail, attached is a list of business items that need to get put 
in place in order for Midwest Energy Hub LLC to be fully operational.  There 
are probably others that I have missed and would welcome any additions you 
may have.  One thing I did not include was any internal Enron approvals, 
(DASH, Legal risk memo) that may be necessary.  

Call me when you have a chance to talk through the list.

Thanks,

Gregg

Everything went fine.  I hope Dan is ok.  Did the antibiotics not work?  I 
know he has been worried, but I thought he was feeling better. Now I'm 
worried.

How old would you mother have been today?

I was wondering about Karen.  I wasn't sure what her title was before.  

I haven't checked voice mail yet.  Heather called on my cell phone, which was 
fine.  

I hear the Mark (NYC) is VERY nice.  I hope to get back earlier than 600 on 
Friday, but not early enough to come in.  I'll figure it out tomorrow.

Ciao,

Kay

Congratulations!!!!  You should be proud.  I am!  

I suspect that it wasn't recorded.  My bad.

   
	
	

Kay,

I don't have a copy of the Memorandum (or even an executed copy of the 
Option).  The Memorandum of Option would have been the document that would 
have been recorded in Edgecombe County and it may be that we used outside 
counsel to record it.  I will root around Keenan's files to see if he has a 
copy.

K-

I'm not at the office today, but I probably have a copy of the Option.  I 
don't recognize the Memorandum of Option to Purchase.  Do you have a copy of 
it to see if it gets my memory working?

   
	
	

I am trying to find: (i) an executed copy of the Option to Purchase Real 
Estate; and (ii) recorded copy of the Memorandum of Option to Purchase Real 
Estate in connection with the Edgecombe County NC property (between North 
Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency and Tarheel Land Development Company, 
L.L.C.).  The option extension is due at the end of the month and I would 
like to get the extension documents ready.

Do either of you have copies of these documents?

Thanks - 
Kathleen

Hi Guys,

Enron policy requires that the assignment of tasks to outside counsel go 
through (or at least be coordinated with) the legal department.  In the 
future, please let me know what you need so that there can be some order to 
the process.

Did the Fehrs and Ledfords sign the option agreements?

Thank you,

Kay
Kay:

This morning, Rusty requested that we prepare an Option Agreement for the 29
acre parcel west of the Livingston Energy Center.  This property could be
used as a construction laydown site, but more importantly would provide a
sound buffer for the project.  It is our understanding that the Option
Agreement is to be presented to the property owner at some point next week.
We will forward a draft of the agreement to you no later than Monday,
October 16, 2000.  Please feel free to call me or Don Shindler
(312-368-2175) with any questions regarding the agreement.  Best regards.

Here is some more info. regarding the Affiliate Master Purchase and Sale

Attached is a draft agreement prepared by Simon Halfin at Peoples.  It is 
based on the 3rd party contract that Jeff Hodge is working on with Peoples.  
The agreement is intended to be a master contract that would facilitate a 
blanket of structured term transactions between the utilities (Peoples Gas 
Light and Coke Co. and North Shore Gas)  and MEH.  It will be filed with the 
Illinois Commerce Commission for approval.  My understanding is that the 
transactions will still be subject to the annual prudency process of each 
utility.  I am not sure your strategy on this one, but would think that a 
combination of you, Jeff Hodge, and Boyd would be most effective.  I 
understand that Dynegy and Nicor filed a similar agreement as part of their 
Hub Agency Agreement that Boyd has reviewed.  I am sure he can confirm that 
or not.

Thanks,

Gregg 

I didn't know there were 5 things to get clogged.  What a blessing that he 
had the surgery before he had a heart attack.  Somehow I'm not surprised that 
your dad is a quick  healer. Still, going home today is amazing.

Kay

   
	
	

My dad is doing absolutely wonderful!!  I got to Amarillo at midnight on 
Thursday, he had surgery on Friday (5 bypasses and veins taken from both 
legs), and on Saturday was sitting up and going for short walks and will 
probably go home today.  The nurses said he was the 2nd fastest recovery they 
have ever had!  What a champ huh?  His heart muscles were in great shape, the 
arteries were just clogged as hell.

K-

How's you dad?  I hope everything went well.  Did you make it in time to see 
him before the surgery?

Kay

You know how I hate to have originals.  Please take them from me!!!!!

   
	
	

Can I have them so I can include them in my scanning project?  I will leave 
copies with you.

K-

I found the originals, so please disregard my question about same.

Michael has been peppering me with questions lately:

Do you have to be rich to run for president?
Do you have to follow in your father's footsteps when you grow up?
How would it be if I kicked the ball through the clouds and God caught it?
Can you see God?
Where is God?
Why did Dolly die (pathology, not philosophy)?  Was it fleas and worms?

And when he was  mad at Neil:  Mom, you picked the wrong husband.

I'm sure there have been more - this was just Sunday and Monday!

Kay

Once I get the draft I will set up a conference call with the people who can 
provide the input on the document.  If it would be better to have the call 
before let me know, and I will try to set it up.  I'm free tomorrow am if 
that is a good time for you.

kay

Kay -- We've started on a draft of the Credit Agmt, but it will have a lot of 
holes in it.  Have there been any further discussions re:  the specific terms 
of the loan (financial covenants, etc.), how the guaranties will work, etc.?

Thanks!  Heather

I have the September 13th invoice.  Could you fax me the rest?

Thanks,

Kay

PS.  I feel like I had previously approved at least one of these invoices.  
We have changed accounting systems and invoice processing personnel, so just 
about anything is possible.

FYI.  I've discussed this with Mark and he didn't have any problem with it.

I've already discussed this with Mark H. and he thought it had already been 
done. I haven't found any indication that it has been done.  I'll follow up 
immediately.

Kay, as we discussed previously:

Effective immediately, I would like Ben Jacoby to have signature authority 
for his team's expense reports as well as all documents whose capital 
commitments are not greater than $250,000. Most documents will be 
confidentiality agreements, exclusivity agreements, permit applications, and 
land/equipment option agreements.

Please forward this (if need be) to the appropriate internal individuals who 
get this set up. Thanks Kay.

I think the easiest way is a power of attorney.  I've talked to Deb Korkmas 
about it (I hear she's the one to handle such things), and I've asked 
Kathleen to identify the most active development entities so that we deal 
with as many as possible at once.

As for the expense account, I figure she can just tell Ben to sign her name 
to the reports.  ANy other ideas?

Kay

Does any formal documentation need to be prepared to accomplish this?

   You gave me my laugh for the week!

on this PPA.  Could you give me a call at your convenience?

Thanks,

FYI.
Kay -- I expect to have a preliminary draft of the Credit Agmt and a related 
closing documents list to you tomorrow morning.  Once you get that and have a 
chance to look at it and forward it to whomever else needs to look at it, 
let's set up a call.

Attached is the most recent draft I have of the change order for the ESA 
stuff.  I think we need to add the info on drawing numbers and delivery dates 
for the options, much like we did on change order #2.

Please let me know what you think.

Kay

It will escalate over time. That's how it worked for me.

   
	
	

I'm not really discouraged, but some of the time I don't think I'm really 
earning my keep, if you know what I mean.  These Options are really keeping 
me busy, and they are interesting.  After working with Deborah, I guess I'm 
just used to doing more.  So, I guess I'll just relax and enjoy the new job!

K-

Hey, don't get discouraged yet.  There are lots of interesting things going 
on around here.  The stuff I'm working on is very interesting as far as I'm 
concerned.  Now, it isn't always as WEIRD as what you were used to.

Kay

This is more like it.  If my flight is on time, I should be able to pick up 
Michael.

opps I read it wrong.  Darn.

I am scheduled to be in NYC and Danbury, Connecticut as of tomorrow 
afternoon, through the remainder of the week. I'm assisting with the 
negotiation of a contract for the purchase of fuel cells.  This is a Jeff 
Ader/Ozzie Pagan/Heather Kroll deal.

Don't know if you guys like to keep up with such things, but I'm glad to keep 
you informed.  

Kay

Kathleen,

Please call Karen Way at Piper Rudnick and follow up on the points you 
raised.  October 2 sounds good to me for an effective date, but you might as 
well check with Karen to see if there is a reason she didn't date it.

Good job.

Thanks,

Kay

   
	
	

Kay,

When the Ledford's and Fehr's signed the Option Agreements, they did not date 
on the signature page however, October 2, 2000 was inserted on page 1 (the 
Cover Sheet).  Can I insert October 2, 2000 as the effective date on the 
signatue pages?

Also, Paragraph 15 of the Option Agreements refers to a Memorandum to be 
executed and recorded in the office of Recorder of Deeds.  Do you know where 
these documents are?  It may be that outside counsel has them and will record 
them.  If not, I guess we should follow up?

Kathleen

Anything to get ONE thing off the "to do" list....

Sounds like you have a good plan.

This was sent to me by one of the developers.  I believe it relates to an 
expansion (or new interconnection) of the Caledonia facility.  I don't know

anyone claims it. Chris thought that someone from Power Trading may have been 
working on it.

Deb,

Let's go ahead with POA's for Ben F. Jacoby for ENA, Tarheel Land 
Development, Edgecombe Development, and Titan Land Development in accordance 
with Janet's request and ENA standard practice. Deb, I have the impression 
that this is something you typically handle, although I'm glad to volunteer 
Kathleen for the task if that would help.

There will be other companies, but we can add these as we go.  Kathleen, 
please advise if there are any which you see as most active at this time. For 
instance, what are the names of the Florida development companies?

Your assistance is greatly appreciated, as Janet is eager to get this done.

Thanks,

Kay

Deb,

I'll get you the particulars, but you get the general idea. I'll have to 
check on the expense account stuff.

Kathleen, you  haven't done any thing with this request yet, have you?  Could 
you get the  names of the active development companies so that we can address 
those, as well as ENA?

We can always do the POA's after the fact, if necessary.  There are something 
like 45 development companies, so I hate to do them all at once.  I would at 
least ask Ben to identify key regions. However, you do need the names of the 
companies anyway, because they are mostly your companies!

Please call Mike and Kent directly.  Thanks.

Found it.  It was buried beneath a stack.  Looks good.  

I would add something to the effect that the appointment terminates if Ben 
leaves the company's employment.

I'm glad you mentioned that fact.  I'll keep you advised of anything I come 
across that relates to a peaker. 

Speaking of which, are you generally aware of a warranty claim against 
Westinghouse for the Gleason project? I've been helping Mitch out here and 
there on it.

Kay

Would the party that claims responsibility please advise me on the 
anticipated improvements in Caledonia?  Because of the potential disposition 
of our 99 and 2000 peakers, I need to have a working knowledge of all related 
matters.  Many thanks.

Kay and Stuart

I'm not working on this project but the forms of agreements are modified from 
forms I prepared and had reviewed by outside counsel in Mississippi and 
Alabama for legal sufficiency.    I prepared the basic forms for Steve Walton 
in March of this year after he had contacted Steve Van Hooser for assistance 
in drafting real estate documents on the Caledonia project.  Steve Walton 
then provided them to Robert Shaw to use for acquisition of property in ENA's 
name.  I haven't heard anything about the project since then.

Kay,

Per Karen Way, October 2 is the effective date of the Agreements.  No 
Memorandum was prepared (but Karen would be happy to prepare one for us).  I 
know it is Bart's practice to execute and file Memorandum's for third party 
notice and I personally think it is a good idea.  If you would like, we could 
prepare 2 Memorandums from Forms of Memorandums we typically use and send to 
Karen for approval of the form of Memorandum for use in Illinois and to get 
signed for us.

Please advise.

Kathleen

Kathleen,

Please call Karen Way at Piper Rudnick and follow up on the points you 
raised.  October 2 sounds good to me for an effective date, but you might as 
well check with Karen to see if there is a reason she didn't date it.

Good job.

Thanks,

Kay

   
	
	

Kay,

When the Ledford's and Fehr's signed the Option Agreements, they did not date 
on the signature page however, October 2, 2000 was inserted on page 1 (the 
Cover Sheet).  Can I insert October 2, 2000 as the effective date on the 
signatue pages?

Also, Paragraph 15 of the Option Agreements refers to a Memorandum to be 
executed and recorded in the office of Recorder of Deeds.  Do you know where 
these documents are?  It may be that outside counsel has them and will record 
them.  If not, I guess we should follow up?

Kathleen

Ed,

Would it be possible to designate which is East/West, as opposed to just 
deleting the West entities?  That way, us Easterners will know when we are 
encountering a Western entity.

Thanks,

Kay

Matt:

Kay Mann and Kathleen are putting togther a corporate resolution to grant 
signing authority to Ben Jacoby in the EAST, subject to a dollar amount 
limitation.   To assist them, please create a new version of your project

Kathleen.   
Additionally, please forward your original Florida entity files to Kathleen. 
She will handle all future matters regarding Florida.

When the executed resolution becomes available, please send a copy to Matt

Debbie Chance forwarded me a memo from Sutherland Asbill about environmental 
and other permits and approvals for peakers to be sited in Georgia. I assume 
one of you retained Sutherland for your department's account and that it is 
not a project- specific local or other counsel per se. I came in late to the 
Georgia projects and we have retained another firm ( Kilpatrick & Stockton) 
for Athens ( being worked on by Raimund Grube)  and for some other Georgia 
site acquistions ( being worked on by Debbie Chance ). I had intended, to the 
extent called upon to work on Hartwell, to utilize the Kilpatrick Stockton 
firm and not Sutherland Asbill. Please let me know about  the scope of 
Sutherland's engagement. 

Good idea to give them a heads up.

Janet and Dave:

As I believe you both know, the generator for the former CALME 501D5A for 
which we are now responsible was damaged beyond repair during shipping. Under 
the turbine purchase contract, I believe we have a strong LD claim against 
Westinghouse which could amount to a couple million dollars or so. I am 
currently in the process of working with EE&CC on transitioning commercial 
responsibility for this turbine and any LD claims from EE&CC / CALME to ENA 
East Originations. Unless you direct me otherwise, I intend to pursue the LD 
claim we are due under the contract. Of course, I will be working in 
conjunction with ENA legal (Kay Mann) and EE&CC.

I wanted to make you both aware of this as one or both of you may receive a 
phone call from EE&CC who might have a different view as to the appropriate 
course of action.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Regards,

Ben

Please call Bruce Silvers with Bingham & Dana in Hartford, Conn, and tell him 
my trip has  rescheduled.  Please see if he is available to meet on Monday 
afternoon, preferably in New York (although I'll confirm later).  I think it 
might be helpful if Nick Palatin was available as well.

Thanks,

Kay

Forgot to mention that.  Please ask Bruce to check his availability.

fyi.  I'll respond later.  Back to the contract....
	
	

I spoke to Fuel Cells and here is my suggested schedule for the negotiations:

October 11, 2000--We redraft purchase order and send it to FuelCells.

October 12, 2000-We hold a conference call with FuelCells in the morning to 
walk them through the P.O. and give them our thoughts (probable length 1-1.5 
hours).  We continue to work on P.O.
 
October 15, 2000--Kay flies to New York.  We have a conference call with 
FuelCells in the afternoon to discuss their initial comments on P.O.  Kay 
meets with Bingham to get work assignments started (i.e., permitting work, 
start drafting construction agreement, changes to Development 
Agreement...etc).  Scott takes 'red-eye" flight to N.Y.

October 16, 2000--Meet with FuelCells in Bingham's offices.  Continue 
negotiations on P.O.

October 17-19, 2000--To be determined based on progress of meetings.  If need 
be, we could continue negotiations in Houston or have Kay patch in by the 
telephone or do all the negotiations by telephone.  

What are your thoughts?

We might want to consider meeting with the  FuelCell team in their offices, 
if this is less intimidating for them.  

I  may be able to fly up on Monday am and accomplish what I need to do with 
BD, although flying on Sunday is fine as well.  TBD.

Kay

Fred,

I think Kathleen will be a big help to all of us in improving the flow of 
paper.  I trust her to work up initial drafts of option agreements, subject 
to my quick review and the review of local counsel.  

Thanks for your cooperation.

The Fehrs and Ledfords did sign their respective option agreements last week 
prior to our Zoning Board of Appeals meeting.  I am expecting Karen Way to 
forward you an executed original copy of each agreement.  I will check with 
her on the status of this.

With regard to the policy, I understand your point.  Rusty and I will work to 
better co-ordinate with you in the future.  Perhaps we can lever off of 
Kathleen for agreements such as the Schaeffer option.

Let me know.

Fred

   
	
	

Hi Guys,

Enron policy requires that the assignment of tasks to outside counsel go 
through (or at least be coordinated with) the legal department.  In the 
future, please let me know what you need so that there can be some order to 
the process.

Did the Fehrs and Ledfords sign the option agreements?

Thank you,

Kay
Kay:

This morning, Rusty requested that we prepare an Option Agreement for the 29
acre parcel west of the Livingston Energy Center.  This property could be
used as a construction laydown site, but more importantly would provide a
sound buffer for the project.  It is our understanding that the Option
Agreement is to be presented to the property owner at some point next week.
We will forward a draft of the agreement to you no later than Monday,
October 16, 2000.  Please feel free to call me or Don Shindler
(312-368-2175) with any questions regarding the agreement.  Best regards.

I made a mad dash to get this revised.  I can't promise that I incorporated

Are these the ones which didn't have the date?  This is PITIFUL.

Hi Kathy,

Kay,

Please find attached for your review a Closing Documents list and a very 
preliminary draft of the Enovate Credit Agreement.  Once you have had a 
chance to review the attached with your business people, let's set up a call 
to discuss structure/changes/etc.  In addition to confirming the basics 
(lending entity, interest rate, term), we will need to discuss financial 
covenants

Please call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing.

Thanks for checking.  I'm on message 7 of 9, and don't have anything from 
Bruce.

Sorry I was cranking this am.  I got here at 600am, mostly because I had 
problems with a document which had to go out today.  

Kay

Have you heard from Bruce Silvers?  He called and left me a voicemail that he 
was free all day Monday, but he was checking with Nick Palatin.  I haven't 
heard any more from him and was wondering if he called you.  Just following 
up.

I'm in good shape now.  Just a little left for today.

Is Ric getting sentimental?  Losing someone can make you feel that way, even 
if it isn't logical.

We'll just get through this day and start over tomorrow.

Bruce probably hasn't heard from Nick yet.  I'll check again tomorrow.  When 
will you know when you are going to NY?  Sunday?

If you need help with a document, say something, I can help you (stay late 
whatever).  That's what I'm here for.  I figured something was up and I'm 
hormonal, so I've just stayed to myself today.

Ric emailed me about whether to pay his mother's, brother's and sister's way 
down for his birthday.  Now, he never hears from his sister and hardly ever 
hears from his brother except when he sends him his monthly payment that he 
owes him and that's just a check.  I told him to bring his mother down and 
the others can fend for themselves.  I was afraid I would hurt his feelings, 
but he said he felt the same way.  I will not have anyone taking advantage of 
him.  I'd be the same way with my brother if I never talked to him.  Emma 
wouldn't be nearly as spoiled as she is!!!!  Can you tell I'm hormonal, I'm 
just bitching away.  

Are you ok now with your document?

Stuart,

Kay's venting for the day:

Is it nitpicking to expect outside counsel to (1) make sure the option 
agreement is signed AND acknowledged (2) ascertain whether the thing has the 
dates filled in, and (3) makes sure that the legal description is included?

Ok, maybe I'm whining, but I think Mark should know that we are having 
problems.  Have you mentioned anything to him?

Kay
Kathleen.Carnahan@enron.com on 10/11/2000 03:17:18 PM
Karen,

There are a few outstanding items missing on the Ledford and Fehr Option
Agreements.  They are as follows:

Ledford Property

1.   Steven and Lynn Ledfords's signatures were not acknowledged.

2.   Exhibit B (Grant of Easement Legal Description) was to be inserted.
Since it is our intention to have executed and record a Memorandum of
Purchase  Option and Grant of Easement, shouldn't we obtain from the
Ledfords: (i) a legal description of the easement; or (ii) a legal
description of the parent tract for      reference purposes; or (iii) a
property identification number of the parent tract at the very least to
include in the Memorandum?

Fehr

1.   No legal description (Exhibit A) was attached to the Fehr Option.  Do
you have a copy of the legal description?  Please advise.

I look forward to hearing from you regarding the above.

Thank you

Kathleen

Attached are files incorporating suggested revisions for the change order to 
Contract 24-LM6K-2-99 for the purchase of a generator step-up transformer for 
the Pleasanton Project.

In lieu of the Exhibit A of the draft you sent out, I have substituted 
Exhibit A, the GE proposal dated October 9, 2000.

I have substituted Exhibit B, GE's standard specifications for generator 
step-up transformers, for the EE&CC specifications in the earlier draft. GE's 
proposal is quoted on the basis of their standard GSU transformer 
specification. I have this only in hard copy and have a call into GE to 
verify this is the applicable standard and whether it is available in 
electronic form. I will give you a copy, Dale.

The two additional documents were transmitted along with GE's proposal and I 
have referenced them in Part I, Paragraph 2.

I don't know if you are in the loop on this one.

Hmm.  Can you get a picture of the dog? Neil and I have been talking about 
getting Michael a dog, and we DO NOT want a puppy. Does she bark much?  Is 
she hyper? She's a short haired dog, isn't she?  

The problem with the document arose after you left yesterday, and I knew I 
had to get cracking on it early.  I would have had to ask you to be here by 
700, and I figure that was just too much to ask!  Thanks anyway.

I think he was feeling maybe he should do something, but he really didn't 
want to, and wanted my advice.  Well, I certainly gave it to him.

Kristine said an English Pointer showed up on her doorstep, and she's trying 
to find her a good home.  She said she's about 2, white teeth, trimmed nails, 
in very good shape and a great dog.  Know anyone looking for a pet.  I told

call and set up a meeting or what?  Please advise.  Thanks, Suz

I'm glad she sounds so good.  Maybe she can be a back up for next Thursday.

Kay

Just got off the phone and she wants to pick Michael up from school on
Friday the 27th. I told her we would be home around noon on Sunday and she
said that was find but they might be out and about! She sounded great! She
is busy on the 21st so I thought I would try grandma again. I plan on
stopping by this evening to work on the pager issue.

FYI.  Kay
	
	

Attached is the latest risk policy from Peoples.  It appears that they have 
only made the one change that is highlighted.  However, I would request that 
we all re-read the policy in its entirety to ensure that there are no other 
changes which are not highlighted.  Vlady - here are some thoughts on your 
comments.  

1 - Stop limit size.  I don't think we will be succesful in trying to change 
this at this point.  Peoples Board has been presented with the $10 million.  
As we discussed, there can be no actions taken by the risk committee unless 
unanimous and we can always try to change it once we get going.  
2 - I changed Appendix I to reflect a Stop Loss Trigger limit determination 
period of each fiscal year.
3 - There are no differences in notifications for the 50% and 75% levels.  
The easiest thing to do may be to handle this internally if we want a 
different notification at the higher threshhold.  It does not need to be a 
formal part of enovate's policy unless we feel it absolutely necessary.
4 - The VaR language you provided has been incorporated as Appendix IV.

Overall, there have not been many changes.  I would like to get final 
comments, subject of course to Peoples changing their minds on something, as 
soon as possible.  My goal is to execute this policy the first part of next 
week.  Let me know if this is practical.

Thanks,

Gregg

I couldn't remember if I forwarded this to you, so here 'tis.

Kay
Kay,

Please find attached for your review a Closing Documents list and a very 
preliminary draft of the Enovate Credit Agreement.  Once you have had a 
chance to review the attached with your business people, let's set up a call 
to discuss structure/changes/etc.  In addition to confirming the basics 
(lending entity, interest rate, term), we will need to discuss financial 
covenants

Please call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing.

Regards,

Heather

Karen,

As far as I'm concerned you have answered my legal questions.  I will add 
that I think that it is the City which  has preserved its option as to who 
repairs the road since they have approval authority.  However, this doesn't 
seem like a big issue to me.

So long as the commercial team is happy with the minor changes with the risk 
profile, I'm happy.

Kay

Stan,

For some odd reason I am having difficulty forwarding this email to Peggy and 
Sheila.  Please forward it to them for me.

Thanks,

Kay

From my end I will probably have the memo summarizing the issues complete 
tomorrow, there will however, because the final terms of the assignment 
agreement assigning the GE contracts to Mitsui have not been agreed to by 
Mitsui  that will make one element of the memo contingent on finalization of 
that assignment agreement form.   We sent Mitsui a draft of that assignment 
agreement some time ago, but they have not yet responded.  It is likely that 
they are waiting until they get a letter from EEIM which indicates that 
Mitsui will be paid for certain Pre NTP work before Mitsui finalizes the for 
of the assignment agreement.  I understand that a letter regarding such 
payment to Mitsui is being sent to them by Steve Irvin today.

Once my memo is complete, I will forward it to Brian Barto among others and 
hopefully there are some items that he and I will be able to get cleaned up 
in the "Final GE Contracts" he forwarded me.

Please feel free to call me at (713) 221-1524 with any questions.

Hi Stan,

Not to rush you, but do you have an estimate of when you will have
completed  your review/memo?

Thanks,

Kay

Any problems/comments?

A redraft of Change Order #5 to the LM 6000 contract to provide for the 
purchase of a GE transformer for the Pleasanton project is attached.  

Please note that I have added some guaranty/LD provisions in Exhibit A, and 
confirm whether these are appropriate in scope and amount.

We will attach the documents included here as separate files as Exhibits B 
and C.  I understand that GE is to provide a more current copy of their 
standard specifications for the transformer to be included in the Exhibits.

Kathleen:  Kay tells me that you are the keeper of change orders.  
Congratulations!!  The discussion of current amount balances, etc. in the 
attached are clearly wrong if we are up to CO#5--it was all based on this 
being the third CO.  Can you please let me know what the right numbers should 
be?

Thanks in advance for your input.  I understand there is some urgency with 
getting this out.

We don't need her if we aren't going to discuss the loan.

Have you heard from Sara?  I was under the impression that she is out of town 
this week.  Guess I could walk over there and look.

I don't think we need Heather for this conversation.  The goal is to finish 
the necessary templates, namely ISDA and guarantees, and determine a process 
for negotiating with third parties going forward.  What do you think?

Just to keep you in the loop.  
	
	

Latest version.  When do you think we will get a look at the first draft of 
the loan docs?  I will call you in a little while and we can talk about this 
weeks fire drills.

Thanks for getting me the ISDA docs on Friday.

Doesn't look like this will apply to you.  The person we need to include in 
our discussion is out of town.

Talk to you soon,

Janet and Ben,

Ben now has signature authority up to $250,000.  

Let me know if you have any questions,

Kay

Per your request.

Is the contract supposed to be an off balance sheet contract?  I'm supposed 
to be working on the changes necessary to make this one 97-10 compliant, but 
I haven't done it yet.  Maybe you will beat me to it, which is fine by me.

Form contract plus exhibits, per request
John Schwartzenburg
09/21/2000 01:57 PM

Here's the next to last iteration of the form contract before we christen
it officially "FORM 2000 - Rev. 00",clean and compared. John R will need to
take this, diddle with it,  and use the product PDQ for a couple of crisis
applications, but before it becomed and gets advertized as "Form 2000" I
woanted to collect  last comments from you guys and get some fine tuning
from  our litigation mangers  onthe arbitration and dispute resoluton
materials, which is to be on my desk by the end of the day.
Because of Johnnie's urgencies, I did not have the chance to pretty up
format and section and page numbers, please forgive. We will get it next
time.

You guys also have the un-revised draft exhibits. I think Rigby was to
revise to try and revise them to fit  the form - I await the draft exhibits
withbaited breath.

Please collect your thoughts and we we schedule a time to get tehm in.

Angie, please print both attachemenst and this e-mail for me.

Darn.

Hi there!

Sounds like things are going really well.

Neil is working tomorrow (his turn), then we have a wedding to go to Saturday 
night. Paige isn't coming in until Sunday, leaving Tuesday or Wednesday.  
She's visiting friends in Waco.  You know how it goes with juniors. So, it 
doesn't look good for us to  make it to Palacios this weekend.  How long are 
you going to be there?

Gotta get on the phone.

Love,

Kay

Hi Kay Kay. Hope you have had a good week. The weather is wonderful,big
black drums,26 inch red fish,keeper flounder and one keeper trout.Ham
sandwiches and not a very clean house but would love for you to come down
this week-end if you have any free time. Daddy did not call Neil with the
fishing report because his hooks did catch fish. He was to call if he
didn't catch fish. Does Paige go back to school Sunday? Love to see all of
you,Mother

Please cancel this.

I'm glad you found something interesting to do. Let me know if you meet 
anybody famous!

We now have televisions in the elevators.  At first, CNN ran all the time.  
This morning we started getting messages from management about the SAP 
program.  It is kind of odd to get into an empty elevator, but hear voices.  

I was discussing Enron with my 20 year old daughter.  I found it difficult to 
summarize what Enron does, and what kind of opportunities it has for college 
grads.  Any wisdom you have on the subject would be appreciated.

I know your husband must be overjoyed to have you back.  His gain is our 
loss, but I understand completely.

Take care and keep in touch,

Kay

Hi Kay how are you! I have been back in Mexico for a month. I just started
working in a media/entertainment company in Mexico, it is quite a different
world, but very interesting. I am working in the finance department, working
primarily in valuation of new investments. Well I just wanted to touch base
with you and say hi. I hope everythis is excellent!.
By the way I bumped into Jean Michele Enriquez the other day, and he loves
working with enron!.
Well if you are ever in Mexico, please let me know. My phone numbers here
are 525 292 1387 and 525 261 23 00.

Big hug. Lupe. 

We don't have to meet with them....
Ok, you are on to meet with Bruce and Nick at 4:30-5pm, depending on traffic, 
at their offices located at 399 Park Avenue.

Lee,

Your changes to the letter look fine to me.

I'm attaching the latest version I have on change order #2.  Are we ready to 
go with this one?

We would like to close out #3 and #4 soon.  I believe GE prepared #4.   Could 
you send me a copy of the latest draft of #4, as it was inadvertently deleted 
from my computer. Meanwhile, I'll work to get you a draft of #3.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

Attached is a redline version of Sept 29 letter, and clean copy for
sign/send.  The change involves reference to the contract paragraphs that
deal with corrections, enabling Enron and GE to reach agreement on timing of
performance of corrective work, if we both agreed to a schedule other than
prior to delivery to site.  We recognize that if any of this work has an
impact on your EPC contractor's site work schedule, there maybe other
consequences/remedies, as provided in the contract.

I'll sign and fax.  Hope you all have no objections.

Thanks,

Lee

Lisa,

Here is the discussion draft of change order #3 for your review, comment, 
changes, etc. Once it is finalized ENA would appreciate receiving a note 
requesting that the change order be executed, with the change order 
initialled by the appropriate person at ESA.

Thanks,

Kay

Sheila/Dale,

Ben wants Chris to sign this change order.  I believe it is in essentially 
the same form as when I sent it before.  Please advise is there are any 
changes you want made.

Thanks,

Would you believe I don't know how late the maid stays?  I think on most 
Tuesdays she comes in the afternoon, but beyond that I really don't know.  I 
don't know if Paige will be here still, but she might.  Buy you really don't 
need to do that, as we don't mind getting it whenever we next come to 
Palacios -  makes the fun last longer.  We won't even celebrate our 
anniversary until the weekend, as I will be out of town Tuesday-Wednesday 
(New York), and Neil is gone Thursday-Friday (Dallas).  Tag team parenting!  

Love,

Kay

coming the next week-end. We have your Anniversary present here,also part
of neil's Birthday. we can't mail them, so would it be O.K. if we bring
them to Houston Tuesday afternoon and leave them with the maid? Isn't that
the day she works? How late does she stay?  We love you

Lee,

Here's a revised draft incorporating your two suggestions:

I've forwarded what I have on the CO (#3) for South America to their lawyer, 
so I hope it will be wrapped up soon.

I've seen reference to the Pleasanton CO, and I know it is in the works as 
well.  It is percolating through the system.  

Do you have the electronic file for the LV CoGen change order (#4), extending 
the delivery dates?

I'll be in on Monday, although I have a heavy conference call schedule.  I'll 
be easiest to catch towards the end of the day.

Kay

Thanks.  Unless someone catches me, I'm out at 430.

Folks,
We should not be making changes like this at this time.  This clause was
part of the document (terms & conditions) initialed a month ago.
Regards,
Jeff Smith  

His issues need to be communicated directly to Jeffrey Smith at GE so
Jeffrey
Smith can tie in his tax advisors.  Please follow up with this as I am fully
occupied with Genpower for the next few days.   PS  I have asked Kay Mann to
lend a hand closing out the Consolidation Agreement too.

I tried to calling you on your phone, but it does not seem to bew working
right.
Jeff Blumenthal from tax has some final issues we need to discuss in section
5.2.4 of the contract and he will be sending an e-mail describing those
issues
later this morning.  That is the last remaining issue I am aware of before
we
can finalize and sign this contract, unless anything has poipped up the over
the
last couple days from GE. Can we meet this afternoon to arrange the signing
of
this contract with GE.
Please call me back at 3-9548 and let me know.

Thanks,

Steve

Nancy,

Here are some come comments to the draft PPA:

As a general note, we would have these goals:

1.  Keep the PPA has streamlined as possible, putting as much as we can in 
the interconnection agreement.
2.  Minimize ties to specific unit.
3.  Maximize optionality, especially delivery points.
4.  Keep construction/ownership of the facility off the balance sheet.
5.  Signing the interconnection agreement must be simultaneous, or a CP.

More specifically we would like to:

Move start up/metering terms to interconnection agreement.
Megawatts will probably change due to change in equipment.  Bracket 192 for 
now.  The capacity will change for summer and winter, also, specifics to be 
determined.
Make sure we are protected from any liability caused by their delay.

Comments on specific articles:
Definition of emergency start up will belong in interconnection agreement.
2.2  Expiration is Dec. 31, 2004; move  bracketed language into interconnect.
2.3  We need an out in case we don't commence construction/achieve commercial 
operation as a result of Buyer's action/inaction, and the term "breach" 
should include failure to timely perform any of buyer's obligations under any 
of the agreements. Any reason why we shouldn't want an extension if there is 
a delay due to action/inaction of any governmental authority?  We can add 
change of law as an event which gives us schedule relief, but we might want 
to broaden the definition of change of law. Also, we don't have the site 
acquired yet, so we may need an out in case we encounter a problem, unless we 
will not sign this agreement before acquiring the site.
3.4  Peak period is July and August.
3.5 (b) Amount left over will depend on the summer and winter capacity.  
Might just leave blanks as placeholders.
3.5 (c) Let's try for 4 hours notice.
3.5 (d) suggest title "Start-Up Minimum Run Time".
3.5 (e)  add maximum of ___ per year.  
Need a minimum shut down time between start ups.
4.6 Note:  3.3 refers to alternate sources and market sources; 4.6 refers to 
the wholesale market.  We should pick a term, define it, and use it 
throughout. 
8.1 (c)  replace "covenant" with "obligation", and follow with "(other than 
payment)". Default isn't a remedy, so there's a disconnect in that sentence.  
8.1 (d) remove "shall" and conform grammar in romanettes.
8.3 refers to LD's, 4.8 but I didn't see any unless 4.8 is meant to encompass 
the concept. A little unclear to me.  How is this supposed to work with 4.8? 
Is there any reason the damage waiver can't be absolute?  Does the sole and 
exclusive language in 4.8 need to be conspicuous, or is it ok?
9.1  Is the demand charge included in the invoice, or is it due without an 
invoice?
10.1 On the third line, shouldn't the second "Seller" be "Buyer"?
15.  No mediation.
16.1  Delete oral amendment language.

Exhibits:
A. Megawatts, heat  rate to be confirmed.  Heat rate believed to be 10,600. 
Deleted bracketed language about implied cost of fuel from alternate source 
energy.  Start up costs:  $500.  Emergency start up to be addressed later.

Could we schedule a conference call for Friday or Monday to discuss any 
questions/issues.  Please let me know your availability.

Thanks,

Kay

Richard,

When you get a minute I would like to catch you up  on these issues.  I think 
it is appropriate to get outside counsel to look at the two Westinghouse 
issues we have.

Kay:

Just to let you know I am supposed to have the copies of the LM6K purchase 
agreement today and was planning to distribute them today.  I thought I'd 
deliver the Bank's original to Roseann along with a copy.

I'll send her an electronic copy also.

Karen,

Please provide a redline version of this document against the Fehr option, or 
whichever previous document you started with.  

Thanks,

Kay

 <<30FK203_.DOC>>
Kay, Fred, and Rusty:

Attached hereto please find the Draft Option to purchase for the
Titan-Schaeffer acquisition in Livingston County, Illinois for your review.
Per Rusty's and my conversation,  the option has 1) a $4000 option payment
for an 18 month term; 2) a $4000 renewal payment for an additional 18 month
term; 3) farm tenancy provisions to allow the Optionor to continue to farm
the land.  Please note we need to order preliminary title on the property to
confirm if the property is held solely by Mr. Schaeffer or if his wife or
other is also a fee holder.  Additionally, on page 7, please let me know
what cap, if any, we are willing to place on reimbursement for soil
preparation costs (we allowed $25 per acre on the Konicek option).  Please
feel free to call me with any questions or comments.  Thanks and talk with
you shortly.

Hi Kathy,

I can't remember if you are in the loop on this one.

Kay
I believe that this is the most recent version.  Lee, check the dates to make
sure they are right.

Kent

Kent,

Please send Kay the Amendment #4 draft (shedule change for Units 19,20,23,24).
I think you had it last.  I can't seem to find it either.

Lee
Lee,

Your changes to the letter look fine to me.

I'm attaching the latest version I have on change order #2.  Are we ready
to go with this one?

(See attached file: changeorder#2rev7.doc)

We would like to close out #3 and #4 soon.  I believe GE prepared #4.
Could you send me a copy of the latest draft of #4, as it was inadvertently
deleted from my computer. Meanwhile, I'll work to get you a draft of #3.

Thanks,

Kay

 <<SSlttrsept29rev1.doc>>  <<SSlttrsept29rev2.doc>>

Kay,

Attached is a redline version of Sept 29 letter, and clean copy for
sign/send.  The change involves reference to the contract paragraphs that
deal with corrections, enabling Enron and GE to reach agreement on timing
of
performance of corrective work, if we both agreed to a schedule other than
prior to delivery to site.  We recognize that if any of this work has an
impact on your EPC contractor's site work schedule, there maybe other
consequences/remedies, as provided in the contract.

I'll sign and fax.  Hope you all have no objections.

Thanks,

Lee

Hi Bart,

I think this is at least close to the final draft. It ain't pretty but it 
seemed to work.  You won't hurt my feelings if you make massive revisions, so 
long as I get a copy of the new-and-improved version.

Kay

I am so sorry to hear about Annie.  Did it break in a different place? I 
think they sometimes have to wait for the swelling to go down to really tell 
what is happening.

Michael had a good time. Thanks for having him.  He was SOOO excited when 
Paige got home yesterday.  He is just crazy for her.

Thanks for the bird house.  We are going to put it in the kitchen on top of 
the cabinets.

All is fine here.  Just buzy as usual!

Love,

Kay

Bill and Rita McCall <bmccall@wcnet.net> on 10/16/2000 12:51:39 PM
Hi Sweetheart. We really enjoyed Michael's visit. He was very good. We were
real proud of him. We,also were glad to have a short visit with you and
Neil. Hope Paige made it home for your great meal.
Wanted you to know Annie rebroke her right arm yesterday. She fell off a
chainlink fence. May have surgery next Monday to put a pin inthe arm. I'm
not sure why they wait until to decide. She and Lisa will be home for a few
days. We have offered to help out if needed. When michael cut is toe, I
remembered we need a note from you and Neil giving us permission to take
him to doctor,if we need it. [Pray we never need it]
Iknow you are busy getting ready for your trip. Can't wait to hear about
the hotel. Unless needed we will be here until Saturday. We love you,Mother

Does that take into account that more money may be going into the spending 
account?  I think we have a total of $2500 allocated for the year.  My 
records indicate that I've put in $1900 as of my last paycheck.

Love,

Kay

I just received the EOBs back on Sharon Seals. They will not pay. If the
reimbusement account pays it will leave about $900.00 in the account. I will
try to get the form completed tonight and in the mail tomorrow.
NM

Did you RSVP for me as well? That would be extra points!

I calendared this the other day when Sheila's came.  I'm way ahead of you!

My initial reaction is that it is ok for a  small gambling debt, but a little 
thin for a $50m revolving line of credit.

Hi Sweetie,

You know how Paige is about directions, etc.  Feel free to call her, though.

I ate all vegetables for lunch, but then I had a third cookie.  

Annie broke her arm again, and may have to have surgery.

Kay

I guess you won't want any dinner tonight. That's ok, that means more
chicken for me! You know, it's getting close to time for you to make your
wonderful sausage and cheese balls...

Does Paige want to pick him up and take him to Sharon's? She could drop him
off and I could pick him up. It doesn't matter to me. Do you want me to call
her?

Love, Neil

----Original Message-----
I forgot to pack Michael's speech/language notebook this am.  I did remind
him that today is a Mary Lou day.  He wants Paige to pick him up, but I
don't know how that could work.

The cars are moving on the Pearce Elevated.  You are probably right - you
could go quickest on 10 assuming no construction problems, as 610 may be
crowded.  I wish I would have thought to drive in that way this am.

It is Bosses Day, and there is so much food around here.  I'm on my second
cookie, and I won't even mention the sausage balls and 7 layer dip.

Love,

Kay

Heather,

I'm guessing that Peoples wants to use this form in lieu of the credit 
agreement.  Maybe I'm wrong.

Kay

Kay -- The attached notes look like they would be used for member loans to 
Enovate under the LLC Agmt (i.e., loans for capital expenditures and other 
purposes not covered by the credit facilities provided under the Credit 
Agreements).   (As you'll see when you review the attachments, those notes 
are non-interest bearing demand notes.)

Re:  the attached form of note -- it should work for purposes of member loans 
under the LLC Agmt, but you will need to decide how the LLC Agmt loans and 
the Credit Agreement's revolving loans "work" together ... i.e., can the LLC 
Agmt loans be paid from cash flow that would otherwise go to pay down the 
revolvers, and will they be subordinated to the revolvers?

That should be easy enough.   Paige needs some glasses, and that could run 
$200-$300.  
Dental is also covered, if we have any uncovered dental expenses.  I'm going 
to guess we might have another $100 in prescriptions to fill this year as 
well.  I could stand some new glasses also.

Your Eckerd's glasses can also be submitted.  

We need to forecast for next year, as open enrollment starts soon.

Kay

Election was $2400. Paid to date is $784 and I have an additional $712 to
submit. Hopefully they will pay even though the insurance declined to cover
it. So, that leaves a balance of $904 and we will owe Sharon $200 or so by
the end of this month. Depending on what happens after that we might have
another $250 or so from Sharon by the last of December. Best guess, $500 or
so we need to cover somewhere.

Does that take into account that more money may be going into the spending
account?  I think we have a total of $2500 allocated for the year.  My
records indicate that I've put in $1900 as of my last paycheck.

Love,

Kay

Please respond to <nmann@erac.com>

I just received the EOBs back on Sharon Seals. They will not pay. If the
reimbusement account pays it will leave about $900.00 in the account. I
will
try to get the form completed tonight and in the mail tomorrow.

Got a card we can send Annie? NM

Hi Sweetie,

You know how Paige is about directions, etc.  Feel free to call her,
though.

I ate all vegetables for lunch, but then I had a third cookie.

Annie broke her arm again, and may have to have surgery.

Kay

Please respond to <nmann@erac.com>

I guess you won't want any dinner tonight. That's ok, that means more
chicken for me! You know, it's getting close to time for you to make your
wonderful sausage and cheese balls...

Does Paige want to pick him up and take him to Sharon's? She could drop him
off and I could pick him up. It doesn't matter to me. Do you want me to
call
her?

Love, Neil

----Original Message-----
I forgot to pack Michael's speech/language notebook this am.  I did remind
him that today is a Mary Lou day.  He wants Paige to pick him up, but I
don't know how that could work.

The cars are moving on the Pearce Elevated.  You are probably right - you
could go quickest on 10 assuming no construction problems, as 610 may be
crowded.  I wish I would have thought to drive in that way this am.

It is Bosses Day, and there is so much food around here.  I'm on my second
cookie, and I won't even mention the sausage balls and 7 layer dip.

Love,

Kay

I'm O positive, and used to work with Bob.  I'm on the road until Thursday 
afternoon, and give give blood on Friday.

Please spread the word that we're looking for O+ blood donors -- See message 
below.  The patient is a 23 year old college student who was diagnosed with 
lukemia last December.  His father is a good friend and former Enron 
employee.  Thanks very much.

Michael has been in and out of the hospital the last 10 days with
fevers.  They're trying to figure out the cause, and no doubt will do
so.  In the meantime, he's in need of blood -- some 7-8 units over the
next couple weeks.  If any of you, your friends, spouses, co-workers,
etc., have some O+ blood in your system that you wouldn't mind donating,
I know Michael would welcome it.

Rather than rush down to MD Anderson to donate, please give me a call
first, and I can give you some of the specifics you'll need.

Thanks.

Hi Dale,

I would contact Kathy Clark.  As far as I know, there have been no change 
orders (unless my memory is failing, which is a possibility!).

Kay

Dale Rasmussen@ECT
10/16/2000 11:40 AM
Kay:  Do you know whether EE&CC has someone keeping watch over the ABB 
transformer contract & associated change orders, and if so, who that might 
be?  I need to get a good read on what CO number we are up to, etc.

Hope things are well with you.
	
	Don Hammond
	
	10/13/2000 05:04:46 PM
	
Dale, will you get involved in this change order as well? Hopefully, this one 
will be much simpler than the GE change order since we are just changing 
design parameters for two units on the existing order. Ed has already 
indicated an ok for this added expenditure.

Jody, can you assist again? Sorry, but I will be in Las Vegas again until 
next Wednesday. I'm available by cell phone (503-703-4600) if I need to do 
something on this or there are any questions. The ABB e-mail contains the 
transformer identifier numbers and new parameters. My conference call notes 
of the requested changes are also attached. The total losses for the loss 
guarantee increase from 218 to 240 kW per the attached. The original contract 
is in the file and another copy is on my desk for reference if needed. I 
think all the information is here and just needs to be put into the proper 
format. Thanks.
	
	Don Hammond
	
	10/13/2000 04:06:18 PM
	
We confirm that we wish to proceed with the changes as discussed in our 
conference call and described in your e-mail included below. We will promptly 
initiate a change order to the original contract with ABB that included the 
purchase of these two units in the amount of $99,000 (two units at $49,500 
each).

   

Security Level:?         Internal

Mike,
     As requested, we have looked at the original design of the Enron Las 
Vegas
84/112/140MVA units (SO# LNL9518-1 & -2) and find that we can not be compliant
with the items as described in Don Hammond's conference call notes as shown
below , unless we do a re-design.  We can still build the adjusted units in 
the
original production schedules, given the timely authority to proceed in that 
new
direction.  If the units are built according to the new re-designed 
parameters ,
ABB would have to make the necessary material and performance changes to get 
to
Enron's desired characteristics, especially for the impedance change and the
necessity to perform in a higher ambient temperature.

     Overall this re-design will require a price adder to each of the 2
transformers, of $49,500.00/each .  Key factors in this cost adder would be 
the
engineering re-design effort, the additional radiators required, and the use 
of
high delivery fans.  The overall footprint dimensions and guaranteed 
performance
of the transformer also must be adjusted to meet the new parameters requested 
,
as follows:

Characteristic      New Design           Original Design

H/X Impedance       13%            9%
Ambient Temp        46 degree C          40 degree C
Sound (dBA)         70/72/73       70/72/73
Overall Length      315"           350"
Overall Depth       238            195
Overall Height      232            243
NL Losses(KW)  43             57
Load Losses(KW)     197            161
Total (KW)          240            218
Aux Losses(KW) 9              6.5

     Please provide this data to Enron and confirm that we are to proceed with
this adjustment ASAP, so that we can complete engineering on the new design, 
and
then provide the drawing information that Enron has requested from our 
drafting
department. That drafting effort has been put on hold until these redesign
issues are resolved.  The confirming Enron change notice for the technical and
the monetary changes will also be required.

     Please advise when you think that we will have feedback on these changes
from Enron.
     Thanks

Please find two presentations attached for your information.  The first

second presentation is our standard presentation on fair value investments.  
We also spend a considerable amount structuring transactions under the fair 
value accounting model.

If it would be beneficial to the legal group, I would be more than happy to 
set up a presentation/working meeting where we could go through the 
presentations and review in more detail. 

If you have any questions/comments, please let me know.

sure they are right.

I think you had it last.  I can't seem to find it either.

Lee
Lee,

Your changes to the letter look fine to me.

I'm attaching the latest version I have on change order #2.  Are we ready
to go with this one?

(See attached file: changeorder#2rev7.doc)

We would like to close out #3 and #4 soon.  I believe GE prepared #4.
Could you send me a copy of the latest draft of #4, as it was inadvertently
deleted from my computer. Meanwhile, I'll work to get you a draft of #3.

Thanks,

Kay,

Attached is a redline version of Sept 29 letter, and clean copy for
sign/send.  The change involves reference to the contract paragraphs that
deal with corrections, enabling Enron and GE to reach agreement on timing
of
performance of corrective work, if we both agreed to a schedule other than
prior to delivery to site.  We recognize that if any of this work has an
impact on your EPC contractor's site work schedule, there maybe other
consequences/remedies, as provided in the contract.

I'll sign and fax.  Hope you all have no objections.

Thanks,

Lee

I think the effective dates have been relating to when the deal was cut.  
That's as much a guess as anything.

Ben left me a voice mail that said he had gotten something from ESA on #3, 
but I haven't made it through all my emails to see if I have it. I will send 
it to you if I do, of course.

I would think #4 is ready as soon as I get confirmation that the dates are 
correct.  Again, I have to check my emails.

I heard a rumor about 5 (but am now drawing a blank), and haven't heard of 
any others.

Kay

   

Kay, from a general financing perspective the below looks fine.  For all 
these change orders, why do we keep having to make them effective long before 
they are actually executed?  I am concerned because for both WestLB and 
TurboPark, we need to provide the executed change orders to them on a timely 
basis.  Doesn't look so timely when we keep back dating documents.

I am very confused with Change Order Numbers also.  I received the executed 
Change Order 1.  Any idea where we are on 3, 4 and 5?  Any others on the 
horizon that you know of?

Regards, Lisa

Taking a quick look at the CO I am not sure what are GE's comments.  Do we 
have a redline copy showing GE's comments?

I can't remember if I made this comment previously, but are the exhaust 
stacks considered "major components" (or whatever the correct defined term is 
under the Agreement)  for purposes of delay LD's?  If so, then we need to 
revise the CO accordingly.  

Also, do we need the defined term "Purchase Amount Increase" in Section 3(b) 
in Part II?

Hi Guys,

I think the price of the turbines will be the internal Enron price.  Sheila 
has the magic number per turbine.

Kay

I tried to reach you on the phone a couple of times but the phone is busy 
(must be the Compaq battery).

I would like to speak with Kay before calling Kent and think your idea of 
posting the summary with a [to come] for the price is a fine idea.   I would, 
however, suggest that Kent review the summary not for accuracy but for 
content prior to posting.  I believe that this is consistent with the deal 
that Sheila cut with him.

By the way, I heard from Don Miller that the following companies have 
expressed an interest in LV CoGen: Southern, Allegheny, Pinnacle West, El 
Paso, NRG, Calpine, AEP, PECO, and Dynegy  (this should be kept confidential)

Stuart

 

Hi Kent,

I was wondering if we could schedule a conference call to discuss the form of 
these agreements.  Are you available any time soon?

Hi guys,

I suggest a brief meeting to discuss strategy before anything is sent to SW.  

Kay 

Mitch, no problem here.  Pete/Chris, along with Ross will handle outstanding 
warranty issues.  Pete,Chris please submit your warranty items to Ross, Ross 
please work with Gavin to ensure that EE&CC's meshes with ours.

Thanks

Tom

Kay -

As part of the contract implementation, we need to authorize the plant 
managers at Gleason and Wheatland to execute warranty issues with 
Westinghouse.  I've taken a first stab.  Please review from a legal 
perspective and change as necessary.  Note that there are 3 total contracts, 
two for Gleason and one for Wheatland.

Gavin, please provide contact names and addresses to Kay for the Westinghouse 
section.  Please also provide the contract numbers.

Pete & Chris, my intention is to empower you to be able to talk directly with 
SW on warranty issues.  Obviously, the terms of the O&M contract and common 
sense should dictate when you cut in the owner (me). Additionally, OEC's 
internal procedures and methods will dictate when you cut in your chain of 
command.  Performance test issues, MW limiter issues, etc will be coordinated 
by Houston since they involve deeper commercial issues.

Thanks,

Mitch

If you don't hear from me by 1245, I probably won't be having lunch.

You did better than I did.  I was telling people I was 41 when I was 42.  I 
felt terrible when I realized I was older than I thought!  Oh well, it just 
goes to show you that it is all a state of mind.

I'm not sure how you don't focus on development, when it is all a part of the 
same group and process. Neat trick, though.  I wish Carlos was here to do a 
lot of this, though.

Why don't you try feeding her again at night?  Maybe she will sleep better.  
I feed Jack twice a day, and he is still skinny as a stick.  Isn't she on the 
thin side anyway?  

All dogs go through adjustments.  She may be trying to find out who is the 
boss.  There are lots of little tricks I can tell you about to show her you 
are the boss.  I'll try to make you a list while you are gone.  CRATE TRAIN 
HER!!  It is one of the best things you will ever do for yourself.  She may 
fuss at first, but she will love it. Crating her will calm her down. I 
believe the Pointer Rescue people agree.  

ckm

I think I'll try the treat approach and see if that helps.  I scold her and 
then tell her I love her and pet and kiss her and she pops right back.  She's 
not a dumb dog, just a stubborn dog!

I'm not feeling very good again today, probably lack of sleep!  She was 
looking pretty drowsy herself this morning too, she didn't get her 10 hours 
of sleep.  I bet the neighbors are just loving us.  Oh well!

I'll print this out now.  How many of those pigs ears can I give her at 
night.  We feed her in the morning and she's hungry again at night.  Although 
dogs are pigs and always want more.  Help!

Hi Paul,

Any luck with the draft of the ABB facility agreement form?  Looks like we 
might have some business.

I have forwarded your draft of the turbine document to GE, but have not had 
any comments.  I would like to set up a conference call with GE to discuss 
it.  How is your schedule tomorrow or Monday?

Thanks,

Kay
	
	

Mike,

Per our conversation today, please note the assignment of transformers to the 
PSCO / Fountain Valley Station project in El Paso county Colorado.

LNL 9517-3   12/01/00  El Paso County, Colorado  

Please feel free to call if you have any questions or concerns.

Chris

Anybody uncomfortable yet?

Hi guys,

I suggest a brief meeting to discuss strategy before anything is sent to SW.  

Kay 

Mitch, no problem here.  Pete/Chris, along with Ross will handle outstanding 
warranty issues.  Pete,Chris please submit your warranty items to Ross, Ross 
please work with Gavin to ensure that EE&CC's meshes with ours.

Thanks

Tom

Kay -

As part of the contract implementation, we need to authorize the plant 
managers at Gleason and Wheatland to execute warranty issues with 
Westinghouse.  I've taken a first stab.  Please review from a legal 
perspective and change as necessary.  Note that there are 3 total contracts, 
two for Gleason and one for Wheatland.

Gavin, please provide contact names and addresses to Kay for the Westinghouse 
section.  Please also provide the contract numbers.

Pete & Chris, my intention is to empower you to be able to talk directly with 
SW on warranty issues.  Obviously, the terms of the O&M contract and common 
sense should dictate when you cut in the owner (me). Additionally, OEC's 
internal procedures and methods will dictate when you cut in your chain of 
command.  Performance test issues, MW limiter issues, etc will be coordinated 
by Houston since they involve deeper commercial issues.

Thanks,

Mitch

Joe,

Would you like to renew with a letter agreement as in previous years?  

Thanks,

Kay

Hello Kay,

Steve Plauche asked me to send you a copy of the current agreement with ENA
cited in the work order request for the Connecticut project.  You will note
the agreement expires at the end of this month.  Please fax the signed work
order to my attention at 978 266-4098 today as Steve has directed us to
begin work immediately and attend a meeting tomorrow.  Also, it would be a
great help if you could provide a letter extending the term of the agreement
to October 2001.  Please call me if you have any questions.

I've been out of town, and have back-to-back meetings/conference calls.  I'll 
call you though.

Based on the development meeting this morning, the strategy for the Edgecombe 
Energy Facility is as follows:

finish development activities with existing momentum,
get long term control (3 to 5 years) of Reierson land and Electricities land, 
as necessary,
get a binding agreement with the city to annex and serve the gas we need once 
the project company executes the land option,
get interconnect study underway, and
monitor regulatory environment for the dawn of the merchant power age in 
North Carolina.

The following "To Do" list is being devleoped, please add as necessary:

Regulatory
Tom Chapman to keep a close eye on the regulatory environment in North 
Carolina.
Air permit application was submitted.  Draft permit expected to be issued for 
Enron review and comment.  Reagan to ensure that flexibility exists such that 
equipment may be changed without jepardizing the permit status.

Fuel
John Hodge to monitor the Rocky Mount/NCNG gas deal as it developes.

Land
Reagan to get the option agreement information specific to the Reierson 
property.  We will be trying to get 40 acres from Ms. Reierson.
Kathleen to facilitate production of draft option agreement for Reierson, Kay 
Mann to finalize.
Reagan to facilitate getting Reierson property surveyed (need a local 
surveyor, Reagan to get with Kay regarding a professional services agreement 
with local consultant).
Reagan to coordinate Enron's activities with reagrd to rezoning hearing 
November 6, 2000 (Electricities 10.1 acres).
Reagan to work with Kay to develop a binding agreement with Rocky Mount to 
establish responsibility for Rocky Mount to annex the property and supply gas 
once the project company (EDC) executes the land purchase.

Interconnect
Gene Preston ran ATC study--looks encouraging.  We should proceed with more 
definitive studies through VEPCO.  Larry Soderquist is the Enron electricial 
engineer and is on the job.
Reagan to follow-up with Heather concerning VEPCO's interconnect study 
progress with regard to Enron/VEPCO letter agreement.  We need to confirm que 
position or re-establish, as necessary.
Reagan to follow-up with Heather to determine if Enron paid VEPCO any of the 
$15,000 contemplated in the letter agreement.
Reagan to begin the process of entering into an interconnect study agreement 
with VEPCO so that study can be finished.

Hi guys,

In looking at CRRA's comments to the draft LOI. I have these questions:

1.  I'm not sure what we mean by EPC contract.  Is this referring to the Fuel 
Cell document we are working now, or is there to be another layer? I know 
this may depend on whether CRRA or someone else is doing the balance of the 
construction activities.

2.  He expects one EPC contract, and we had tried to leave room for multiple 
contracts. Does anyone care?

3.  Does CRRA get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail 
the performance tests?  We have discussed with FCE the concept of a 
proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent, then a full 
reduction as to the failing unit(s) only.  Also, are we planning to mark up 
the fuel cell contract to recover our fee?  Is our fee at risk for the fuel 
cells failing to perform? 

Thanks,

Kay

Barbara, here is the document I discussed concerning some of the Chicago 
stuff.  Jeff, I don't know if you have received this from Gregg all ready.

Kay
	
	

Attached is the weekly status update for the business setup of enovate.  
There are no significant updates to last week's report.   Please call me with 
any questions.

Gregg

I've given blood at MD Anderson before, and I think they will have the blood 
type  information on file.  If anyone else is in the same boat, you call the 
number below and ask for Barbara. I couldn't reach her today, because it is 
Saturday, but they tell me she will be in on Monday.  If all goes well, I 
could be in business fairly quickly.

Kay

FYI re: getting your blood typed at MD Anderson Hospital, Donor Room (see 
instructions below) -- It takes 1 day for them to get the blood typed so your 
card won't be available until the following day.  If you don't pick up your 
card, they will mail it to you which takes 7-10 working days.

here is what people need to know - it will save A LOT of calling around...
to get the blood typed (if you don't already have a card or letter from dr.
stating blood type)- you go to the MD Anderson Hospital, Donor Room in the
purple zone, 1st floor.  The phone number is 713-792-2626.  There is an $11
charge to type the blood.  I was told that I would be given a card with my
blood type.  

Suzanne, please forward this to Jeff.  My email is acting up again.

Hi Jeff,

I thought I would pass this email along to you since you've been working on 
some of the aspects of the Peoples deal.  I don't want to interfer with 
whatever you have going on, but I'm happy to assist/participate in whatever 
way makes sense.

Kay

	
	

Here is some more info. regarding the Affiliate Master Purchase and Sale 
Agreement that is on the list.  

Attached is a draft agreement prepared by Simon Halfin at Peoples.  It is 
based on the 3rd party contract that Jeff Hodge is working on with Peoples.  
The agreement is intended to be a master contract that would facilitate a 
blanket of structured term transactions between the utilities (Peoples Gas 
Light and Coke Co. and North Shore Gas)  and MEH.  It will be filed with the 
Illinois Commerce Commission for approval.  My understanding is that the 
transactions will still be subject to the annual prudency process of each 
utility.  I am not sure your strategy on this one, but would think that a 
combination of you, Jeff Hodge, and Boyd would be most effective.  I 
understand that Dynegy and Nicor filed a similar agreement as part of their 
Hub Agency Agreement that Boyd has reviewed.  I am sure he can confirm that 
or not.

Thanks,

Gregg 

I don't know if you got this, so here 'tis.  I was out of town and missed the 
presentation, although I've worked with Herman, Roger and David on these 
issues.  I'm sure they would be glad to give the presentation again for 
others with a need to understand the complexities of off balance sheet 
treatment of power plants.

Kay
	
	

Herman and I will see you at 10:00am tomorrow to discuss accounting issues 
related to our power plant development and sale activities.

Our presentation will be based upon the following attachment.  

Hard copies will be available tomorrow in 38C2.

Could you check with David and see if he could fax copies of the PowerPoint 
plates to me in Portland so we have a fighting chance of following along by 
tying in by phone?    If that is possible, try to send them by Tuesday. Thank 
you very much.
 Al Larsen

There will be a presentation by David Leboe on October 18, 2000 at 10:00 a.m. 
in EB38C2.  Please put this on your calendar and plan to attend.

Also, the weekly meetings with Sheila will begin October 25, 2000 at 10:00

I understand completely.  Those ear infections can be very painful.  Nothing 
can get to you like your kid in pain.  If it makes you feel any better I have 
a 20year old (I can't believe it) and a 6 year old (even more unbelievable), 
and both have a lot of allergies and sinus infections, etc.  My oldest  also 
had a lot of ear infections, and it seemed to be painful.  But she out grew 
the problem.

I expect to be in town Mon-Thurs, with high hopes of taking Friday off to 
join my husband at his officer's meeting in San Antonio.  

Kay

Thanks for the quick turnaround. My apologies again for not getting back to 
you on Friday.  It turns out that my daughter  now officially has her first 
ear infection.  The joys of parenthood.  Talk to you on Monday.

Gregg

My morning is fairly open, other than grinding on the purchase contract.

Heather Kroll@ECT
10/22/2000 01:31 PM
Let's meet in the morning and discuss the LOI.

Kay,

To briefly answer your questions, we are contemplating another layer of 
documents with the EPC contract.  There will also be a Development Agreement 
that outlines our development activities and our nonrefundable fee.  I don't 
read his comments to mean he only wants one EPC contract.  Let's discuss 
tomorrow.  Also, we've told Bob Wright that if the plants don't work, the 
state gets its money back.  I think he and everyone involved would be 
amenable to a performance band provided that a comparable reduction in price 
accompanies the reduced performance (to the 10 percent floor, of course).  
This LOI outlines the EPC contracts only.  The Development Agreement will 
cover our fee.  So, no, our fee is not at risk for the fuel cells failing to 
perform.  We will have some risk on BOP if the plants fail.

What time works for everybody?  How about 9:30?

Heather

equipment contract.

How does 10:00 work for everyone?  Jeff's got a meeting at 9, so he can't 
make the 9:30.

Kay,  can we use your office?  All the conference rooms are full down here.

If 10:00 works for you, I'll see you up in Kay's office.

Heather

Heather, 

Could we handle the CRRA LOI at the same time?  It would help me get finished 
with the FCE doc. 

I'm sure you saw that GE and Honeywell are merging.  I wonder if that makes 
ONSI a part of GE?  Does GE have a fuel cell product yet? It would explain 
the statement in the Journal that headquarters would not be in NJ or 
Connecticut.

Kay

 Scott should be in the office at 1:00 pm today and would like to have a 
meeting with everyone to review where we are and what the punch list is for 
this week and next week.  If you are available at 1:00 today, please let me 
know so that I can get a conference room.  Thanks.

Stephen

Shall I handle items #1 and 2?

Kay
Sheila, as I mentioned in my voice mail, there are a couple of items I need 
to follow up with you on:

1. Turbine Purchase Agreements - diligence item for the bank.  I have most of 
these, I think.  I can check with Kay to develop a list of these and get them 
copied for the bank.  I think I can get some out the door this evening - 
Millbank is very anxious to see them.

2. Project LLCs - Millbank would like a list of these and a set of formation 
and/or operating docs. for each of them. 

3. Developer as EWG - the bank has asked if the Developer could/should have 
this designation by the mid-November close.   I don't know if EWG is a 
plant/project specific designation or if it is "personal" to the entity 
applying for it.  Could you let us know?

4. Mortgages on site land - the bank is proposing that we give a 60-day 
negative pledge while we prepare a mortgage in the bank's favor on the real 
property in connection with a project site.  Is 60 days reasonable?  

Thanks,

Rose

I am waiting for a call back from MD Anderson concerning whether they were 
able to locate my information.  Their records go back to 1998, and I believe 
I gave at MD Anderson in 1998, but you know how that is.  Assuming that all 
goes well, I can go tomorrow at 930am (when they open.  I'll keep everybody 
posted.

The folks at MDA confirmed that they have Michael's consent forms ready to 
go, just in case that question should arise.

Bob, sorry to hear about the doctor, and the impact it must have had on 
Michael.  

Kay

I have not received my card verifying blood type yet (hope to have it today)
so as of yet, I am not "legal" to give blood.  If someone CAN go, could you
let all of us know - otherwise I will try to go Tue or Wed if my card
arrives.

I'm going to guess that it depends on whether you are giving a direct 
donation (as in this case) or a replacement donation.  Since it is for a 
specific patient, they may want to make sure it works, especially since it 
will keep you from donating for a while.  Just a guess!

How's this?

okey dokey

Good idea.  I'll let him know.

Should we let Marty know about this?  Mitch is his client.

I think Piazza sped up to try to get close to the bat.  He's a sly one.  
Roger's first story was ok ("I didn't think he was running, I was tossing the 
bat to our bat boy").  Second version was a little iffy ("I didn't know if I 
had the bat or the ball" - why the hell would he throw the ball towards the 
dugout?)

The Turner wedding was amazing.  Jim and Betty Boyd sat behind us at the 
wedding. Mauricio and his wife were there, and showed no signs of leaving.  
When Neil and I left at 130 (Michael was with grandparents)  the band was 
still playing, and the bride and groom were still there.  Unbelievable.  I 
wonder how late it went.

I'm out of town this weekend - Neil's officer's meeting at the Hyatt Hill 
Country, then up to see Paige on Saturday, back on Sunday.  Let me know if it 
reschedules.

Did you change jobs?

What do you hear from Ben?  Anthony called me last week, just to chat.  They 
are looking forward to hunting before the baby gets here.

Kay

Andrea Dowlen <dowlena@camerondiv.com> on 10/23/2000 01:15:56 PM
How are you?  Catherine is trying to get you, Honey, Pam, and me
together this Sunday - brunch to look at the pics I took at Dawn's
wedding.
Are you available?
 I had such a great time in New Orleans.  Drove over Fri the 13th.  No
sweat either way.
 Mrs T told me Turner's wedding was a spectacular.
Hey - tell that St. Francis boy of yours - Roger - to quit throwing
broken bats!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Let me know.
Andrea

Did you hear Candy is moving to Holland?  She looked great.  I didn't know 
she was married until I saw her.  She seems happy.

Sounds like Ben found a good head hunter.  It can be hard to get positive 
after being in that environment.

Kay

I'm thinking you don't have anything to move.  Maybe it would help if you 
acknowledged that ENA might not be your final destination, but seems like a 
good place to get exposed to a variety of opportunites, such as Enron Global 
Markets and Enron Industrial Markets - both new businesses with international 
aspects. Plus, lawyers at ENA move between groups without much fuss and 
bother (if it changes, don't blame me later!)

How does that sound?

Kay

Carlos.Sole@enron.com on 10/23/2000 04:00:44 PM
My deductive reasoning leads me think that JS's reaction was based on his
marine motto of being semper fei and thus feels that he has an obligation
to Vicki to present her with the opportunity of recruiting me first.
Anyway, I guess I should be flattered that I am such a coveted asset.  I'm
thinking that my next step tomorrow needs to be able to convey the message
to John that in visiting with Vicki, my interview season starts and based
on that, I'd like to be able to explore all opportunities where I have
leads (EES and ENA) and then make a decision based on what "offers" I
receive, rather than limiting myself to just one interview and wondering
what if.  It's a bit like a pushing a rock, you can only move so much each
day.  Today he was the one who opened the opportunity to discuss this
topic, so tomorrow can the opportunity to get what I've been wanting since
June.  So what do you think?

Paul,

FYI.  This is the document which starts the move into the ABB facility

Paul,

When can we expect a draft of the ABB facility agreement? It is getting 
urgent.

Thanks,

Kay

The attached is marked to show changes from previous draft seen by CRRA.

Kay

Hi Matt,

Sheila tells me that you are working on the docs requested by Global Finance 
for Turbopark (does this ring a bell?)  If you can get me the docs on this 
LLC, I'll see if we can pitch the angle Sheila suggested.

Thanks,

Kay
Yes please.  I do not know of a single project LLC that is ready to commit to 
Phase II Turbo Park.  So I suggest we send them corporate docs from 
Pleasanton Local Reliability  Facility LLC and tell them that all of our 
LLC's are basically the same.

Marty,

FYI. Sheila mentioned that Mitch is one of your guys.  

Kay
Mitch, no problem here.  Pete/Chris, along with Ross will handle outstanding 
warranty issues.  Pete,Chris please submit your warranty items to Ross, Ross 
please work with Gavin to ensure that EE&CC's meshes with ours.

Thanks

Tom

Kay -

As part of the contract implementation, we need to authorize the plant 
managers at Gleason and Wheatland to execute warranty issues with 
Westinghouse.  I've taken a first stab.  Please review from a legal 
perspective and change as necessary.  Note that there are 3 total contracts, 
two for Gleason and one for Wheatland.

Gavin, please provide contact names and addresses to Kay for the Westinghouse 
section.  Please also provide the contract numbers.

Pete & Chris, my intention is to empower you to be able to talk directly with 
SW on warranty issues.  Obviously, the terms of the O&M contract and common 
sense should dictate when you cut in the owner (me). Additionally, OEC's 
internal procedures and methods will dictate when you cut in your chain of 
command.  Performance test issues, MW limiter issues, etc will be coordinated 
by Houston since they involve deeper commercial issues.

Thanks,

Mitch

Ok.  I'll follow up.

The insanity continues.  I finally called Lee Johnson at S&S, who fortunately 
had called me, and asked him if he knew if Kent was around, as I hadn't heard 
from him.  He is going to get in touch with Kent for me.

I'm expediting Paul Pipitone re the ABB facility agreement, but haven't heard 
back from him yet.

Hope your trip is going well.

Kay

Yes please.  I do not know of a single project LLC that is ready to commit to 
Phase II Turbo Park.  So I suggest we send them corporate docs from 
Pleasanton Local Reliability  Facility LLC and tell them that all of our 
LLC's are basically the same.

Hi David,

It is just us chickens, Gregg's agenda.

Kay

Regarding your call, I can make the 8:30 a.m. conference call tomorrow 
morning on the agency agreement.  [Can I assume it's an internal conference 
call?]

I'm looking forward to speaking with you.  Thanks!  DT

Hi Jeff,

I guess this answers the question of whether the policy has been adopted.

I'm at home this am, as I'm on my way to MD Anderson to donate blood for a 
friend's son who has leukemia.  I don't think it will take too long, but they 
don't open until 930.  

Kay
Kay - Can you please review this additional language to the risk management 
policy ( or circulate to Jeff Hodge)?  In light of the CA regarding curves, I 
am slightly concerned with a blanket statement essentially giving Peoples 
unlimited access to information. I know that we address audit rights in the 
LLC agreement so this may not matter anyway if this is a right they already 
have.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks,

Gregg

Attached please find the latest enovate risk policy.  Our attorneys and
internal audit area have made one language revision concerning Section XIII
Audit Rights.

Mary <<MEH-risk Oct 20>>

 - MEH-risk Oct 20.doc

In a recent discussion with Mark H, he suggested that I consult you two 
gentlemen about outside counsel in Chicago to support our efforts with 
Peoples.  It would be beneficial to have a firm on board with some trading 
expertise, as well as more generalized transactional experience.  Gas would 
be a plus.

I've used Jones, Day  (good job on regulatory issues), and Piper Rudnick (bad 
experience).  Any suggestions?

Thanks,

Kay

Kathleen,

We have forms for confidentiality agreements.  All CA's are processed through 
Kay Young, as she maintains the data base.  Kay, could you point Kathleen to 
the repository of the forms so that she can generate the first draft? By the 
way, I've assembled the emails I received on changing the form.  I'll be 
happy to take a crack at the revisions if you tell me which form to start 
with.  I know it will have to be processed through before it becomes standard.

Thanks,

Kay
Kay - We have previously discussed the idea of a CA to specifically cover the 
curves.  We need to put this at the top of the list for this week.  Can you 
prepare a CA for the distribution of enovate curves to specific individuals 
at Peoples?  I would like it to read as follows:
Basis and Index curves will be provided daily for all points at which enovate 
has a position, whether hedged or open, to specific individuals employed in 
the risk management area.  (Individuals should be named on a schedule).
Curves are being provided for the express purpose of independent risk 
analysis of the enovate portfolio by Peoples Risk Management personnel.   

In return, the specific individuals will not forward, copy, or otherwise 
distribute the curves to any individual not on the approved schedule.  No 
communications, written or verbal, will be made to any person other than the 
enovate GM or the Enron designated enovate risk committee member regarding 
any aspect of the curves.  

I need some language regarding audit rights, but this should get you 
started.  Call me to discuss.

Gregg

I'll get the draft working, but it would probably be a good idea to discuss 
this a bit.

FROM BARBARA GRAY AND STEVE VAN HOOSER:

We have a special treat for our Wednesday staff meeting.  Roger Ondreko, a 
senior accounting professional in ENA's Transaction Support Group, will give 
us a presentation on mark-to-market accounting and related accounting 
concepts of significance to those closing typical ENA transactions.  The 
meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, Wednesday, October 25th at 1:30 pm in 
Conference Room EB49C1.   We would like to have a big turnout for Roger.  He 
has taken the time to update his materials and to inform our group as to the 
financing options available to us.  

Please RSVP to Pat Radford (extension 39282) no later than 5:00 pm today, 
letting her know whether or not you are able to attend.

Please prepare a fed ex package to go out tonight, as described below.  Also, 
please prepare a transmittal letter to Heather for me to sign.

Thanks,

Kay
Heather Kroll@ECT

Kay,

As I said in my voice mail, please print out executable copies of the CRRA 
LOU with your CKM initial.  We are going to see Bob Wright tomorrow and if he 
has no further changes we can get the documents signed.

Please FedEx them to our attorney's office in Hartford:

c/o Paul McCary
Murtha, Cullina, Richter and Pinney
Cityplace I
185 Asylum Street
Hartford, CT  06103-3469

860.240.6037

We'll be there by 11:00 (enough time to sleep in a little bit), so 10:00 
delivery is perfect.

Also, if you will send the fuel cell document to swanita_99, I will make sure 
I download it and review before seeing Jerry tomorrow night.

Thanks!  Call me on my cell if you need anything.

I'll let you know if anything interesting happens at The Mark Bar or on 
Channel 35 (gotta' love PBS).

Heather

Janet has already signed Change Order #2, so adding value to this one will 
required that change order #3 be revised, then we would have to go back to 
ESA for their approval. It would be easier on this end if we could pick up 
the new stuff in this one to a subsequent change order?

I spoke to Lee Johnson yesterday about all the change orders, and a couple of 
outstanding issues.  I am having difficulty getting GE's attention on the 
facility agreements, and would prefer that the change orders not be given to 
GE until I at least get a call back on the issue.  If this is a problem, 
please let me know.

Kay

Alan:

Attached is Change Order #2 which has been revised to add the additional 
items you requested.  Please let me know if you have any changes or 
comments.  Thanks.

Kathy Clark
713-345-6400

Hi Kathy,

Here are my suggestions/comments on Rev. 6

Definitions.  I think we need a Business Day definition, and a search and 
replace of business days for Business Days.

1.55 The definition of Performance Tests is really a definition of 
performance test reports.  I think we need a definition that incorporates the 
tests listed on Exhibit E.

The phrase installation option is used, but I didn't find a description of 
the installation option when I did a search.

3.14.2.1  Is 6 months enough under this circumstances?  Does it matter?

4.3  Delete "Each".

5.1  The amounts on Exhibit N don't match what I have on the last option 
agreement, and there isn't a description of any options, unless I'm 
interpretting it incorrectly.

5.3 (ii)  add "as provided in Section  5.5"

6.4  I may have missed this, but I didn't see where amounts owed by Seller 
would be charged interest if not timely paid.

10.7  Are the roman numerals correct?.

I am going to email you some new language for assignment and the buy back 
option. You should have it today.

Do you have a redline on this rev 6 versus whatever the version was I read 
before?  I'm skimming it and I want to make sure I don't skip something.  

Thanks,

Kay

Thanks.  This is a  very drastic situation, so the draft will be 
appreciated.  

As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility 
agreement, deleting the WestLB references.  When will this be forthcoming?

Thanks,

Kay

Peter Thompson is working on it.  We should have a draft Wednesday.  Regards, 
Paul

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 10/23/00 05:38PM >>>
Paul,

When can we expect a draft of the ABB facility agreement? It is getting
urgent.

Thanks,

Kay

Bob,

My donor number is 1181819.

Let me know if Michael needs more.  As you know, I can go back in 56 days.

Here's hoping all goes well.  I'll have your family in my thoughts and 
prayers.

Kay

Joe,

Here tis:

Thanks,

Kay

Sheila,

I just realized that this is at the same time as our GE conference call.  Can 
we adjust the time of the GE call?

I have a feeling that Roger's presentation is the generic mark-to-market 
stuff, but I could be wrong. I just don't get the feeling that it is directed 
to the lease accounting rules and other stuff specific to Turbine Torture.  
Do you have any follow up questions from last week you want me to ask?

I'm expecting a draft of the ABB facility agreement tomorrow.  A & K really 
dropped the ball on that one, although I wish I had expedited them more.  I 
still haven't heard from Kent, despite email, voice mail, and calling Lee.  I 
hope he is ok, because being non-responsive is not Kent's style at all.

Did you see that Moby Dick (aka, GE) is swallowing another big fish 
(Honeywell).  I heard it increases their size by a third.  So I guess the 800 
pound gorilla is now a 1066 pound gorilla. (ok, I admit I used the 
calculator).

Talk to you soon,

Kay

See you didn't miss it after all, although we had Herman and David.  It would 
be comforting to know they are saying the same stuff.  Be sure to stop him 
and ask lots of fact specific questions so everyone will understand how  much 
fun this is.   Wish you were here.

To all,

As you know, Enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through WestLB.  
I've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through 
WestLB, and the change orders related to same.  All I know about is the LM 
deal with GE (with 1 executed change order, approximately 4 or 5 pending) and 
the ABB transformer deal (with one CO pending).  Please let me know if you 
are aware of any others.

Thanks,

Kay

Good Afternoon Kay,

The Mitsubishi equipment was purchased through WestLB.  Additionally I am 
working on the Las Vegas Cogen Project with a WestLB structure.  I am 
purchasing a steam turbine and four HRSG's.  

Give me a call at your convenience and I will give you any particulars 
required.

Dave,

 I authorize you to committ an additional $3,000 to cover costs asociated 
with ENSR's work on the CT Fuel Cell Project.  Thanks for your patience on 
this issue.  

Regards,

 Stephen 

In anticipation of receipt of the executed Work Order for the entire $25,000
by November 1, 2000, I understand that Enron is verbally authorizing an
additional $3,000 to cover costs incurred by ENSR through October 20, 2000.
The total amount verbally authorized by Enron NA on this project is $6,000.

jeffreye.smith@ps.ge.com on 06/02/2000 05:12:32 PM
Folks,
We should not be making changes like this at this time.  This clause was
part of the document (terms & conditions) initialed a month ago.
Regards,
Jeff Smith  

His issues need to be communicated directly to Jeffrey Smith at GE so
Jeffrey
Smith can tie in his tax advisors.  Please follow up with this as I am fully
occupied with Genpower for the next few days.   PS  I have asked Kay Mann to
lend a hand closing out the Consolidation Agreement too.

I tried to calling you on your phone, but it does not seem to bew working
right.
Jeff Blumenthal from tax has some final issues we need to discuss in section
5.2.4 of the contract and he will be sending an e-mail describing those
issues
later this morning.  That is the last remaining issue I am aware of before
we
can finalize and sign this contract, unless anything has poipped up the over
the
last couple days from GE. Can we meet this afternoon to arrange the signing
of
this contract with GE.
Please call me back at 3-9548 and let me know.

Thanks,

Steve

I'm circulating some language for the ABB transformer purchase agreement. =
=20
Please let me know if you have any problem with the language.

The buy back language is new.  The assignment language is intended to addre=
ss=20
some concerns raised by ABB - the changes are marked in red.

Buy back option.  (5.4.3)

At Purchaser=01,s option, Seller will arrange for storage of the Unit or Un=
its=20
to be stored for up to one year following the successful conclusion of=20
factory testing.  Purchaser shall pay the Purchase Amount in full, and will=
=20
pay the actual storage charges, billed quarterly during the year the Unit o=
r=20
Units are stored.  Title and risk of loss shall be with Purchaser during th=
is=20
storage period.  Purchaser shall have the right (but not the obligation) to=
=20
sell the Unit(s) back to Seller for 30% of Purchase Amount of the Unit(s)=
=20
after the end of the one year storage period.  Payment will be due 30 days=
=20
after receipt of written notification by Purchaser of its intent to exercis=
e=20
this option.  Title and risk of loss shall be with Seller as of the time of=
=20
payment.

If Purchaser desires to sell the Unit(s) prior to the expiration of the one=
=20
year storage period, Purchaser may request, and Seller agrees to act, as=20
broker for the re-sale of the Unit(s). The terms of the remarketing agreeme=
nt=20
will be subject to mutual agreement.

Changes to assignment language.

22.2   Assignment by Purchaser.  This Agreement or any right or obligation=
=20
contained herein may be assigned, from time to time, by Purchaser without=
=20
Seller=01,s consent to:

(i) Agent (in the case of an assignment by Purchaser) or an Affiliate of=20
either WestLB or Agent;

(ii) a joint venture, partnership, limited liability company or other simil=

entity in which Agent or any of its Affiliates is a venturer, partner or=20
participant with no less than a nineteen and one-half percent (19.5%) equit=

(iv) any Indemnified Party;

(v) any entity for the purposes of financing or sale of the Facility;

(vi) any party (1) for which Agent or any of its Affiliates has agreed to=
=20
construct or develop a facility using the Equipment, or (2) to which the=20
Agent or any of its Affiliates has agreed to convey a power plant project=
=20
which it has under development; or

(vii) any contractor or developer (including, without limitation, Enron=20
Engineering & Construction Company and/or NEPCO) which is retained by Agent=
=20
or any of its Affiliates to construct or develop a Facility using the=20
Equipment.

In the case of an assignment to a party described in (ii), (vi), or (vii)=
=20
(other than  Enron Engineering & Construction or NEPCO), Seller shall be=20
entitled to request and receive an appropriate guaranty, letter of credit,=
=20
payment bond or other reasonable form of payment security, in amount not to=
=20
exceed the amount of the Purchase Amount remaining to be paid at the time o=
f=20
the assignment, unless the assignor agrees to remain liable for all future=
=20
liabilities under this Agreement.  A letter of guaranty, letter of credit, =
or=20
payment bond provided by an entity rated BBB+ or better shall be deemed to =
be=20
an appropriate form of security for the purpose of this provision.

Except for (i) through (vii) above, this Agreement may not be assigned by=
=20
Purchaser to other parties without the prior written consent of Seller whic=
h=20
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  Seller agrees =
to=20
respond to any request for consent within thirty (30) Days following its=20
receipt of such request.  Any failure to respond within the foregoing time=
=20
period shall be deemed to be a grant by Seller of its consent to the propos=
ed=20
assignment.  In determining whether Purchaser shall be permitted to assign=
=20
this Agreement, Seller shall only be deemed to be reasonable in withholding=
=20
its consent if the proposed assignee does not have substantially the same o=
r=20
better credit quality than Agent unless (a) the proposed assignee provides=
=20
appropriate guaranties, letters of credit or other assurances of payment=20
issued by an entity or person with substantially the same or better credit=
=20
quality than Agent, or (b) the assignor agrees to remain liable for all=20
future liability under this Agreement.  Purchaser shall have the right to=
=20
assign or pledge, from time to time, all or any portion of its right, title=
=20
and interest in, to and under the Agreement as collateral for financing of=
=20
any Facility without Seller=01,s consent.

When duly assigned in accordance with the foregoing (including, following a=
ny=20
collateral assignment, upon foreclosure by any collateral assignee) (i) thi=
s=20
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the=20
assignee (and all rights hereunder, including, without limitation, any and=
=20
all warranty rights, shall be assigned to the assignee as if such assignee=
=20
were an original party hereto), and (ii) the assignor shall be irrevocably=
=20
relieved and forever discharged of all liability under this Agreement so lo=
ng=20
as the assignee executes an assumption of such liabilities.  Any other=20
assignment by Purchaser shall be void and without force or effect.=20

Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, in connection with any=20
assignment permitted under this Section 22.2 to any assignee, the Purchaser=
=20
shall have the right, from time to time by Notice to Seller and without=20
Seller=01,s consent, to (i) designate such assignee to be the successor of=
=20
WestLB hereunder, (ii) designate such assignee to be the successor of =20
=01&Agent=018 hereunder, (iii) designate such assignee as a sub-agent of th=
e Agent=20
hereunder, and (iv) designate that such assignee has succeeded to all of th=
e=20
rights and obligations of both WestLB and Agent, whereupon (notwithstanding=
=20
the first WHEREAS clause hereof, but subject to any subsequent appointment =
of=20
an =01&Agent=018 hereunder) each reference to =01&Purchaser=018 hereunder s=
hall be deemed=20
a reference to such assignee acting in its individual capacity and each=20
reference to an =01&Agent=018 herein shall be deemed deleted.

Upon any permitted assignment of the rights under this Agreement to acquire=
 a=20
Unit or Units, and the assumption (in accordance with the terms hereof) of=
=20
the obligations related thereto, Seller shall enter into a separate purchas=
e=20
agreement with the permitted assignee (each, a =01&Facility Agreement=018).=
  The=20
terms of each Facility Agreement will be in strict conformity with the term=
s=20
and conditions of this Agreement, except for site specific changes as agree=
d=20
by the Seller and such assignee.  In no way shall the Facility Agreement=20
increase the liability or responsibility of Seller, Purchaser, or Agent und=

this Agreement.

The parties further agree that the provisions of this Agreement relating to=
=20
assignment will only control the assignment of Purchaser=01,s or Agent=01,s=
 rights=20
and obligations under this agreement prior to Acceptance of the Unit to be=

Genpower has on Change Order on each of the two Contracts pending, for 
$133,000 on each.  The CO has been fully approved, but I have not been able 
to catch up with the paper work to get it signed by Enron.  It has been 
passed back and forth between NEPCO and GE for edits.  Last I heard, GE had 
signed it and would send it to me.  That was 10 days ago.

Dear Fellow Sufferers,

For the benefit of all the Fellow Sufferers, I attach herewith a modified
version of the Assignment language, which was developed by Sheila and me
after our last call.  Let's discuss tomorrow!

I look forward to talking with you all then!

YEAH!!!!  Something I can put on the list and take off!  Shall I send it 
directly to Tracy?

Talk to you at 1100.

Kay

Kay - I have an easy one for the list.  Can you please get me a copy of the 
signature page on the executed MEH LLC agreement?  Tracy Irvin, our 
accounting support, would like a copy for her workpapers.  Thank you.

I thought you would enjoy this.  And I didn't make any comments about being 
right about not going to a MEGA university.

Paige Record <recordp@southwestern.edu> on 10/24/2000 04:22:58 PM
Hey. I just had a "Thank goodness I go to Southwestern" moment. I was
walking to get help from my professor for my test tomorrow (we ended up in
there for an hour and a half!), and I saw Dr. Parks, a business professor I
have had but do not have right now. He told me that he got a compliment on
me and my tour Friday by one of the prospective students' grandparent's.
Then I was walking upstairs, and I saw a professor I have not had a class
with since FRESHMAN year. She asked how I was, etc... And I told her I was
going to Dr. Early's office for help on Money and Banking. She asked how
the class was going, and I told her it's a ton of work, but it's do-able.
Then she said it's do-able for you, of course. You were always so good (or
something like that). I had her for SOCIOLOGY (not for my major or minor or
anything). So, I just got complimented nicely by two professors that I
don't even have a class with this semester, and then I got outside help for
an hour and a half. Yikes is this place ever awesome! I just thought I
would share.:)

Love,
PMR

Ok.  When are you available to discuss how to deal with the various issues we 
need to address to get this wrapped up?

Thanks,

Kay:  references to WestLB are in only a few places in the GE Contract; 
namely, the recitals and sections 3.8(c)(2), 5.1, 6.1, 7.2.4, 30.7 and 
30.12.  The references in the recitals, 3.8(c),7.2.4, 30.7 and 30.12 can be 
handled fairly easily.  The references in 5.1 and 6.1 deal with pricing 
matters and will require a little work once the pricing mechanism is worked 
out with GE.  My suggestion would be to not revise the document at this time 
and make these changes at the same time we make any other changes arising 
from the discussions with GE.  PLease let me know what you think.  Regards, 
Paul

Thanks.  This is a  very drastic situation, so the draft will be
appreciated.

As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility
agreement, deleting the WestLB references.  When will this be forthcoming?

Thanks,

Peter Thompson is working on it.  We should have a draft Wednesday.

Hi Kathy,

I know I owe you a phone call.  I'm home with a sick kid today.  Please email 
me your number and I'll give you a call.  I can't believe I've forgotten it. 

So how are you doing with the EECC changes?

Kay

Hope it is going well out there. 

Michael is sick (I'm guessing strep), so I'll be calling in from home today.

Kay

Hi Scott,

It is a sick kid day (I'm guessing strep, with the 102 plus fever).  
Fortunately, I have most of what I need to get a draft of the equipment 
contract turned.  I'll email it later.

Kay

Hi Gregg,

I'm home with my sick son this am.  (It was one of those 102 plus fevers at 
430 this morning.)  I've asked the temp assistant to have my enovate stuff 
sent out so we can get some work done.

Talk to you later,

Kay

Sounds good to me.

Ok to discuss today after 3 pm meeting?

I'm circulating some language for the ABB transformer purchase agreement. =
=20
Please let me know if you have any problem with the language.

The buy back language is new.  The assignment language is intended to addre=
ss=20
some concerns raised by ABB - the changes are marked in red.

Buy back option.  (5.4.3)

At Purchaser=01,s option, Seller will arrange for storage of the Unit or Un=
its=20
to be stored for up to one year following the successful conclusion of=20
factory testing.  Purchaser shall pay the Purchase Amount in full, and will=
=20
pay the actual storage charges, billed quarterly during the year the Unit o=
r=20
Units are stored.  Title and risk of loss shall be with Purchaser during th=
is=20
storage period.  Purchaser shall have the right (but not the obligation) to=
=20
sell the Unit(s) back to Seller for 30% of Purchase Amount of the Unit(s)=
=20
after the end of the one year storage period.  Payment will be due 30 days=
=20
after receipt of written notification by Purchaser of its intent to exercis=
e=20
this option.  Title and risk of loss shall be with Seller as of the time of=
=20
payment.

If Purchaser desires to sell the Unit(s) prior to the expiration of the one=

year storage period, Purchaser may request, and Seller agrees to act, as=20
broker for the re-sale of the Unit(s). The terms of the remarketing agreeme=

will be subject to mutual agreement.

Changes to assignment language.

22.2   Assignment by Purchaser.  This Agreement or any right or obligation=

Hi Scott,

I have some questions:

The obligation to try to improve performance  about the specific performance 
(ie minimum) standards frequently has a time limit, say 6 months.  Do you 
have a sense for the appropriate time period here?  Would it make sense to 
require them to work longer on the first 2.0 and 2.4 than the rest?

Will we have a drawing number for a standard foundation design, or will we 
need to put words around it.  I know we discussed the need for pilings as the 
most significant change.  Do you think that this difference is enough?  Did I 
understand that we want them to pay us at the end for non-standard 
foundations (as opposed to a credit). 

On termination, are we going with the average value no matter what the reason 
for termination, with a rep along the lines of whay you wrote, plus some 
monitoring ability.

On assignment, they mentioned a corporate guaranty.  I was thinking of using 
something broader due to various financing/balance sheet considerations, 
perhaps tying it to a guaranty from a BBB rated entity.

Do we want an option to have them store these, which would then impact 
payment?

Thanks,

Kay

Hi.  Don't forget you can reach me by email.

Good catch on the fever this am!

Love,

Kay

Maybe it is viral.  I haven't really looked because I want Rey to see him 
since we are leaving town, so my opinion isn't as important.

He is starting to slow just a little.  He ate a good breakfast, but he is 
getting quieter.

If it is ok with you I'll let you know in a little bit.

430 this morning.)  I've asked the temp assistant to have my enovate stuff 
sent out so we can get some work done.

More questions:

We have two different levels of guarantee values.  We have the specific 
performance levels, which if not met can result in termination, etc.  This 
includes emissions, electrical output, heat rate, water (consumption and 
discharge).  Will all of these have  more stringent guaranteed levels that 
FCE will have to work to try to fix?  I'm assuming there are no sound 
issues.  

Thanks again,

Kay

How's Annie doing?  Has she seen her regular (sigh) orthopod yet? 

Do the girls (and I guess you grown ups can probably go, too) want to go to 
SU? Are the young ladies interested in spending the night?  

I'm home with Michael (the 102 fever drill), working at home.

Hi to all!

Love,

Kay

PS  Thanks for the traffic tip.  Do the games last about 4 hours?  I can't 
remember.

Hi! Just a quick note to say that we are looking forward to seeing you on 
Saturday. I am guessing that we'll see you sometime after your function
Satudray afternoon.

The UT game is in the morning, 11:30. Just a bit of a warning, I35 will back
up before and just past game time. I know you will be driving from SA.

Give us a holler and we will be looking forward to talking with you. Now,
it's time for me to be off to the land of playdough, crayons and snotty
faces!

Love,

Lisa

Why not.  You can tell how much Michael seems to be enjoying school.

I just got through to the Attendance line. It's says EC students need to
have the absence reported directly to the teacher. I will leave a voice mail
for Ms. Norris. Do you think I should follow it up with an e-mail too? NM

Please print and fax to me at 713 973 0287.  I'll forward a couple more I 
need faxed.  Thanks  Kay
	
	

1.  6 months is fine.  I think the standard should be higher on the 2.0 MW 
units.

2.  I would say that there should be a drawing for the foundation.  We should 
make the standard relative to the drawings either "substantially in 
accordance" or "not materially different."

3.  If termination is for a cause created by FuelCells.

4.  We should have a storage option if FuelCells is ahead of schedule on 
their deliveries.

5.  We should be able to assign to CRRA in all cases.  A financial standard 
for everyone else is fine.

Please print and fax to me at home.  Thanks
	
	

1.  There will be a sound guarantee.

2.  Output & efficiency we definitely want FCE to exercise commercially 
reasonable efforts to achieve their expected specifications.  I am not 
certain on the other guarantee points.  My answer will be influenced by what 
ENSR and the technical people tell me.

Steve--Have you received the specifications and guarantee points for the 2.4 
MW units.  Have you forwarded to ENSR? 

Here's what they suggested (yes I'm working, I can do two things at once)

There is a rule of halves - you can give half to your kids, you get medicaid 
when the retained half runs out.

There is probably a time period you can do this.

Kay
 

Stan,

I have one minor question.  

Is the Notice to Proceed Effective Date a set date, or is it x days following 
y event? 

I would expect to see language along the lines of "If notice to proceed is 
not given by the Notice to Proceed Effective Date, then...".  I see the 
deleted language was something close to that, so maybe in the context of this 
EPC different terminology is used.

Kay

Attached is a redline that highlights minor proposed revisions to the 
assignment contract you sent earlier today.

Please feel free to call me at (713) 221-1524 with any questions.

Stan Jensen

 - GEAssign4.doc

Here's a redline against our previous draft.  There are lots of holes, in 
large part due to the significant commercial issues still open and some of 
FCE's input due on the language to be used.  I'm also not finished with the 
project management/scheduling stuff, but I wanted you to get a chance to look 
at it forthwith.

Scott, I've printed off your emails and will incorporate your input.

I don't know when we want to give FuelCells a draft, but I'm going to keep 
working on this one.

Kay

Good.  That lets me massage it, review my notes, and perhaps even read it!

Kay

   
	
	

I hope to speak to Jeff and Heather this morning.  Lets hold sending FCE a 
copy until I have that call.  Thanks.  

Scott

I'm getting ready to take Michael to the pediatrician, so it depends on how 
long that takes.

I'll find the instructions and email them to you.

If I'm not on there but Kent is, could you let him know I really need to talk 
to hiim?

Thanks

Kay 

Good Morning!  I would rather that we not change the time of the GE call 
since I have Lisa, Dean and Ben sort of primed for it.  Will Scott and Rose 
be joining you?  I don't think it will take more than 20 minutes.  Would you 
please email me the dial in instructions and let me know whether you will be 
on the call?

you can open it and hold it.  I know what it is.

as to what it is or if it can hold until tomorrow when you come in.

Hi Barbara,

I'm on the phone with the GE folks right now, as we have a standing 
conference call with them every Wednesday at 130.  I'm familiar with the 
people and the contractual terms at issue, and will be happy to discuss it.

Kay

Kay I received a call from Dwight Beech,who used to do powere-type work....he 
is now in a different group.  While in that group he formed a relationship 
with individuals at Jones Capital Corp. They have somehow discovered that 
Enron has the above mentioned turbines and they wish to purchase 2 or 
more......I understand from Dwight that there are restrictions which affect 
ENA's right to sell the turbines to 3rd parties and that there may be ways to 
structure around these.

Please call so that we may discuss Ben Jacoby has been speaking with Dwight 
and wants a basic term sheet AND a confidentiality Agreement.   bng    I 
presume from our discussions you are familiar with the GE issues.

I'll be glad to handle it so long as it doesn't have to be done this week, as 
I have strep throat (Michael and I got a group rate at the peditricians' 
office.)  
Who should I contact?

Kay

do you the time to handle the CA and basic term sheet

Could you please fax this to Heather?  You might want to call her to make 
sure she is still at McCary's office.

Thanks,

Hi Heather,

Here's a form of LOI we can use.  

Nancy W. called and is ready to discuss the PPA.  We can call her after our 
meeting, or before if you have the time.

Kay

Scott,

Your question #2 raises a good point. My thought in bracketing the name is 
optionality.

I'm trying to be aware of potential balance sheet issues.  As you know, if 
this contract ends up in such shape that it can be construed as a committment 
to purchase equipment, we will need to cross the balance sheet bridge.  As 
far as I know, we have not ruled out that possibility, as well as the 
possibility that ENA or an affilate may be the EPC contractor, or somehow in 
the title chain. I was thinking that if we use an LLC we have the option to 
see .he equity in an LLC holding the contractual rights/obligations (for 
financing purposes or otherwise).  In that case, we may want to use an LLC 
instead of messing with an assignment later.

I am very interested in your insight concerning possible structures, and what 
we need to keep in mind.

Kay

   
	
	

I will send you comments via e-mail periodically as I read sections.  Here 
are my comments thru Section 5.

1.  Shouldn't the agreement be in the name of ENA?
2.  Section 2.1--We should have the right to change the persons identified 
listed in Section 2.1 (a) & (b), particularly if we assign.  Do we need a 
procedure?
3.  Section 2.1 (d)--Shouldn't it just say "highway" as opposed to "major 
highway"?
4.  Section 2--Need to add the following concept.  90 days after RTO, 
Purchaser shall identify up to [5] primary or alternative sites for 
installation of the units (identification to include an expected 
configuration).  Upon 10 day notice, Purchaser shall have the right to 
substitute sites or change site configurations.  The project plans shall be 
based on the primary configurations identified by Purchaser.  4 months prior 
to shipment, Purchaser must identify the site where a unit must go.  At this 
point, the site is locked in for that unit.
5.  Section 3.3 (c)--insert "or as reasonably required to implement" after 
"as required by".
6.  Section 3.16--Add in concept of identified sites.  Timing of plans should 
coincide with site identification.
7.  Section 5.1.1--Incorprate concept that shipping per unit is based on the 
lesser of actual costs or $87,000 per unit.  I think that FCE agreed to this 
concept.
8.  Section 5.4--Why is "to be discussed" shown?  I thought that FCE agreed.  

Poor Carlos.  He is almost pitiful.  I think it is a great idea to watch for 
a good networking opportunity.

I'm off on Friday, too.  In fact, both Michael and I have strep throat and 
spent the day at home.  I'll probably be in no more than 1/2 day tomorrow.  
Is Norman still out of town?  Will you have the house ALL to yourself?

Kay

   
	
	

Hi Kay,

I just talked to Carlos.  They had their meeting today with the EES group, 
and what can I say?  Since Carlos told me that you are his exclusive head 
hunter, can I be the mingling coordinator?  Don't you think it might be nice 
to have Carlos meet Stuart and some of the group, like for lunch or 
something?  He is feeling sooooo lost.

By the way, I think I am taking Friday off, okay?

Kathleen

SZ really grows on you, doesn't he?  Just like Carlos.

Neil leaves tomorrow.  He was out ONE night last week.  I am encouraging him 
to get a hunting lease.  He thinks I'm very supportive.

   
	
	

Yes, Norman is out of town.  Isn't Neal out of town too?  I'm sorry about the 
strep throat.  I sure hope it doesn't get you like it did last year (that was 
awful)!  I still haven't done anything with the Confidentiality doc. for 
Peoples.  Maybe I can work on it tomorrow and get with you next week.

One funny note, I was looking for a document on Stuart's directory and found 
a file called "Jeffrey Kennan is getting on my nerves.doc".  It was an 
Easement Agreement.  When I found that, I almost fell out of my chair 
laughing!

Take care of you and your little man!

Kay:

I spoke to Chris earlier today and he told me there is a meeting today 
regarding GE change orders for the LM6Ks.  He agreed to send me a summary of 
what decisions were made so I can get change orders 3, 4 and possibly others 
done.

Kathy

Sc ott, 
I'm planning on taking your emails and revising the current draft to create a 
new one.  Your points were very well thought out, so I would like to have the 
day to get a new draft.  It looks like I will be at home tomorrow since I'm 
still not feeling well, but I certainly feel well enough to work on the 
contract.  Perhaps we will get some input from our team in Conn. gang by noon.

How does this sound?

Stephen, 
Feel free to weigh in with any comments/suggestions.  Your  input is welcome.

Kay

PS I can now print at home. 

Peter,

Thanks for the update.  By the way, is the new version in Word?

Sounds like a good plan.  I can't wait to hear how it went in Danbury.  
Sounds like the CRRA meeting went well.

I expect that a number of business issues will be discussed tomorrow.  
Whether its tomorrow or Friday, I think to maintain schedule that we will 
need to get the draft P.O. (with the legal revisions) to FCE by Friday.  At 
this point, I am mainly concerned about the business points and the status of 
the technical information.  If we are going to be substantially done by a 
week from Friday, we need to move that portion along faster.  If we get 
feedback on the business points by early tomorrow, I would like to get those 
comments into the draft P.O.  If not, then I want to send the P.O. (with the 
changes we have) to FCE so they can review it on the weekend.

Hi Charlotte,

I'm glad you wrote, as I was going to write you.

Michael has strep (as do I), so he and I are home today.  He is on two 
antibiotics which he takes twice a day.  I'm trying to figure out how to get 
these to you, since these have to be refrigerated.  Obviously, if Michael  
isn't doing great I won't go.  Currently, he feels fine, and only feels bad 
when he has fever. He woke up with fever again this am, but the fever should 
go away after 24 hours on the antibiotics.  Just let me know if you aren't 
comfortable with  the situation.  I can always leave on Saturday, or not at 
all.

Michael's doctor is Rey Calderon 713 520 9550.  His wife (and assistant) is 
Delores, and they are wonderful about returning calls, etc.

We will be staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, 210 647 1234. Saturday 
night I will be staying in Round Rock (going to Paige's homecoming in 
Georgetown), but Neil will still be at the Hyatt.

Michael says hi, by the way.  He is watching me type this.

Kay

   Don't forget to let me know where you will be staying in San
Antonio.  Also, what is Michael's doctor's last name.  I know it's Reynaldo
something.

   Thanks.  Have a great time and don't worry about Michael.

That would be great.  We can leave his "stuff" by the front door.  I know he 
will have things he wants to bring to show you.

Michael asked me for advice yesterday.  ("Mom, I have a problem...").  He now 
has 2 girlfriends, Ashley plus a new one, Marilyn.  He was torn.  He decided 
to stick with Ashley. Oh, the problems of a 6 year old!!

Michael is very excited about the weekend.  He just doesn't think it will be 
long enough!!

Thanks for everything,

Kay

   No problem as far as I am concerned.  I can just pick up the
antibiotics and anything Michael has forgotten on the way back after I pick
him up.

He hasn't left yet, but I'll remind him.

Michael gets his school picture taken tomorrow.  Carol Junell takes the 
pcitures there.  She did our first family portrait after Michael was born.

Kay

Ok.  So basically all bets are off if we don't give NTP by September 
whatever.  Sounds good.

The Notice to Proceed Effective Date is not a set date but rather the day 
that the notice to proceed is given so long as certain other conditions are 
also in effect on such date (such as either financial close or the Enron 
Guaranty]

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 06/26 2:16 PM >>>

Stan,

I have one minor question.

Is the Notice to Proceed Effective Date a set date, or is it x days
following y event?

I would expect to see language along the lines of "If notice to proceed is
not given by the Notice to Proceed Effective Date, then...".  I see the
deleted language was something close to that, so maybe in the context of
this EPC different terminology is used.

Kay

Attached is a redline that highlights minor proposed revisions to the
assignment contract you sent earlier today.

Please feel free to call me at (713) 221-1524 with any questions.

Stan Jensen

(See attached file: GEAssign4.doc)

Will do.

please call Dwight Beech @33934 and advise him of your time schedule and 
expertise.....      and your commitment to prepare these matters for 
him..........it is my understanding that in the non-binding letter of intent 
he wants to get a commitment that the counterparty will not deal with anyone 
else for a period of time.......i don't have any more details than that...he 
also stated that Ben Jacoby has a "redacted version of the GE AGREEMENT" that 
he wants to send out.....since I have no knowledge of the GE Agreement, any 
confidentiality provisions therein or elsewhere or of any past practices in 
this regard, I hesitate.to express an opinion on this..

I am sorry to hear of you and your son's strep conditions; I hope that you 
received medication to alleviate the symptons.
If  Dwight needs something this week please  call Shonnie at31463 ; she can 
help meet the needs while you are out......with your expertise on the GE 
matters..........................Jeff is not in today and I will be out of 
the office from 11:oo on tommorrow and all day Friday  (V&E TRIPLE LUTZ 
negotiation) but will be checking voice mail.

I'll be glad to handle it so long as it doesn't have to be done this week, as

office.)  
Who should I contact?

	Kay Mann@ENRON

Hi Barbara,

I'm on the phone with the GE folks right now, as we have a standing 
conference call with them every Wednesday at 130.  I'm familiar with the 
people and the contractual terms at issue, and will be happy to discuss it.

Kay

Kay I received a call from Dwight Beech,who used to do powere-type work....he 
is now in a different group.  While in that group he formed a relationship 
with individuals at Jones Capital Corp. They have somehow discovered that 
Enron has the above mentioned turbines and they wish to purchase 2 or 
more......I understand from Dwight that there are restrictions which affect 
ENA's right to sell the turbines to 3rd parties and that there may be ways to 
structure around these.

Please call so that we may discuss Ben Jacoby has been speaking with Dwight 
and wants a basic term sheet AND a confidentiality Agreement.   bng    I 
presume from our discussions you are familiar with the GE issues.

10/25/2000 08:38 PM
I am unaware of any others except Pastoria.

To all,

As you know, Enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through WestLB.  
I've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through 
WestLB, and the change orders related to same.  All I know about is the LM 
deal with GE (with 1 executed change order, approximately 4 or 5 pending) and 
the ABB transformer deal (with one CO pending).  Please let me know if you 
are aware of any others.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Dale,

I thought I'd send this along.  It is the first draft of the "break out" 
contract for the ABB transformers which go with the LM's.  I thought Sheila 
told me that your stuff is in immediate need to getting this and the LM break 
out in shape.  This has not been reviewed with ABB yet (in fact, I haven't 
read it yet), but just in case you want to give it a look, I thought I would 
pass it along.

FYI.  I had previously asked Paul to revise the LM contract to remove all of 
the references to WestLB.

Kay
Kay:  references to WestLB are in only a few places in the GE Contract; 
namely, the recitals and sections 3.8(c)(2), 5.1, 6.1, 7.2.4, 30.7 and 
30.12.  The references in the recitals, 3.8(c),7.2.4, 30.7 and 30.12 can be 
handled fairly easily.  The references in 5.1 and 6.1 deal with pricing 
matters and will require a little work once the pricing mechanism is worked 
out with GE.  My suggestion would be to not revise the document at this time 
and make these changes at the same time we make any other changes arising 
from the discussions with GE.  PLease let me know what you think.  Regards, 
Paul

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 10/24/00 12:37PM >>>

Thanks.  This is a  very drastic situation, so the draft will be
appreciated.

As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility
agreement, deleting the WestLB references.  When will this be forthcoming?

Thanks,

Kay

Peter Thompson is working on it.  We should have a draft Wednesday.

Hello - I spoke with Jeff Hodge yesterday regarding the additional language 
from Peoples regarding Audit Rights.  His initial reaction was that their 
request was probably reasonable and in line with the spirit of a jointly 
owned L.L.C.  However, he did suggest a couple slight revisions to protect 
Enron's interests.
1) Highlighting that information will only be provided that is related to 
enovate and 2) that each designated representative should sign an appropriate 
confidentiality agreement.  This language has been included in the attached 
draft.  My goal, however optimistic, is to execute the risk policy by the end 
of today.  Activity is picking up dramatically and the fine line is getting 
further blurred each passing day.  Therefore, I need to know ASAP if there 
are any problems with the draft as written.  Otherwise, I will be sending it 
to Peoples as our final revision by mid morning.  Thanks for your prompt 
attention to this.

It is less complicated for me to initial and fax than to track down someone 
who doesn't know anything about it and get them to initial it.  I can print 
it here, initial it, and fax it to whomever you want.  Plus, I work with 
Janet a lot so she may get some comfort from that, instead of having a lawyer 
she hasn't dealt with initial it.  She is very conscientious about what she 
signs, and who initials what.  

 Is the attached form the final final form?  Where and to whom do you want it 
faxed?

Thanks,

Kay 

Since it will be Janet signing, it will probably be better to have the 
initials on the pages first.  Either fax or someone else works fine.  Let me 
know which is easier and we can coordinate.

I'm working on it now.  Maybe we (Enron) could review it tomorrow morning, 
then send it to FCE.  I can meet around 10:00.  That way, we can get it to 
them in time for weekend review.  Does that work?

Kay

   
	
	

I spoke briefly to Jeff.  He said that they resolved all the major economic 
issues with FuelCells.  Here is what I believe to be the resolution.

1.  Foundations--FCE to do; our obligation to deliver site in the required 
conditions.

2.  Shipping--As we previously proposed; not to exceed amount

3.  Escalation--None.

4.  Financing Adder--Considering 3.6% adder.

5.  Termination points--Jeff said 9 months, 5 months and 4 months.  I assume 
that means 9 months after expected installation for the first 7 units, 5 
months for the next 7 and 4 months for the last 8.

6.  Termination Price--Average price of order.

Where does everything stand on the redraft?

Sounds good.  The email was a good idea, also.

Hi guys,

Here are some quick thoughts:

2.10  Suggest we delete "specific" from second line.  
3.3  (i)To protect cash flow neutral status we need to get the money a couple 
of business days before date due.
6.2  We need to discuss changes which could materially impact the value of 
the agreement to MEH, not just the risks/responsibilities.

I'd bracket the concept of what the Admin Service Fee is supposed to cover.  
Can we recover any additional costs, such as the cost of preparing/filing 
docs on their behalf (2.2) and collection (3.1)?  I think we probably need to 
limit our role to "short of litigation" type stuff.   Maybe "reasonable 
efforts, short of litigation", something like that?

That's all for the first quick read.  

Kay

As we discussed, in an effort to forward our internal discussions and 
memorialize the results of our discussions in Chicago last week, Boyd and I 
have produced a new draft of the Agency Agreement.  The changes can be 
inspected by launching the attachment in Word and then going to Tools --- 
Track Changes --- Highlight Changes to display and print the changes in the 
document.

A number of questions must be addressed.  They include, in no particular 
order:

Can we delete the confidentiality article?

Is it commercially important to restore the langauge on displacement 
deliveries?

What will the compensation arrangements be?

Are we willing to deduct the administrative fee from the net cumulative 
revenues?  [Doing so "loses" us $10,000 a month.]

Will we collect accounts receivable directly or have payments made to a 
deposit account in which we will retain a security interest?

How should Section 2.9(ii) be recast to allay Boyd's regulatory approval 
concern?

Is the new Section 2.10 acceptable?

How must the agreement change to reflect the "two county" concern?

I look forward to discussing this with you at your convenience.  DT

 - #1127382 v9 - NEW AGENCY AGREEMENT.doc

Any problem if I add signature lines on the last page of the document (prior 
to the exhibits)?  I can do that.

ckm

Here's the final final final.  I had to put in a page break before one of the 
exhibits because it wasn't printing right.

Michael probably won't be at school tomorrow, unless he really perks up 
quickly. However, I was thinking of bringing him up there to get his picture 
taken, if he feels up to it.  Do you think there would be a problem with 
that?  Any idea when and where I should take him?

Thanks!

Charlotte,

Michael hasn't bounced back yet - still getting fever up to 102.  I spoke 
with Delores, and she said Rey said that Michael had a pretty good dose of 
strep, so it will take 6 doses of medicine to get it under control.  I'll see 
how he is in the early am, but I may not take him to school, just so I can 
watch him another few hours.  If you will be at your office tomorrow I'll let 
you know how he's doing.  Maybe I can leave on Saturday.  I know he will be 
very upset if he doesn't get to spend time with you this weekend.

Kay

By the way, did they ever get the acknowledgments taken care of?

Looks fine to me.

Kay

per the policy, the risk committee has to approve the initial policy.  can 
you look at this and let me know if it works.

Thanks,

Gregg

Michael is still running 102 fever.  I spoke to the doctor again today, and 
he said that Michael had a pretty good bit of strep.  I'm feeling better, 
though, and have gotten a decent amount of work done.  In fact, Christy 
Chapman may give you some original documents I initialled and faxed to her.  
I'll explain later.  If I had your fax number I think I would have faxed them 
to you.

Have a great day tomorrow.

Not yet.  Karen called me after I sent her my e-mail regarding the several 
missing items and she assured me she would take care of the acknowledgments.  
I did not want to mention it in my e-mail to her yesterday (thought I would 
save that until I had a chance to see if she sent anything to Fred and he is 
out of town).  I have not forgotten about it though.

How are you and handsome doing?  Feeling any better?  I talked to your other

Hi Charlotte,

Poor thing woke up with 101.6.  He isn't getting any worse, which means the 
medicine is doing something, but it  just hasn't done the trick yet.  I'll 
give him his sixth dose of medicine in a minute.  I just can't take him to 
school until he is better. I would like to hold the option open to bring him 
in the am.  Once the medicine kicks in, he will bounce back quickly.

Here's the new version with attachment.

Here's today's version.  

Michael is still running a fairly high fever, so it would be a big help if we 
can talk via phone.

Kay

Yes.  If you called 713 973 6325, it is the number my computer is on.  I'll 
log off before 1000 so you can call on that number when you are ready.

AM to discuss the PO?

Sorry to hear about this weekend.  It is kind of sad that Mary Susan doesn't 
have other options for her birthday.  Not that you guys aren't fun....

Michael and I've been home with strep since Wednesday.  He hasn't gotten 
better, but I have. So, I'm not going to San Antonion, just heading for GTown 
tomorrow.  I haven't decided whether I'm taking Michael. If he is feeling 
better, I'll leave him with his sitter, Charlotte.  Since he has been ill, 
I'll probably head back to Houston EARLY on Sunday, and won't wait for Paige 
to get up.  Sorry it didn't work out with girls, but I understand.

Love,

Kay

I changed the plant stuff around, swapping most of them for Facility.  I 
think it is a bit more clear now.  Let me know what else needs to be done.

I'll be leaving in around 1230 to buy a bribe, I mean pumpkin, but we won't 
be gone long.

Kay

Gloria,

I need to have a redline generated by Comparwrite, as I don't have it loaded 
locally.  The original document is in my Fuel Cell/Equipment contract file, 
and has the same name as the one below, only it is dated October11 (I believe 
rev 2).  The new document is the one below.  Please save the redline verision 
in the same directory, and email the redlined document to me, Heather Kroll, 
Scott Healy, and Stephen Plauche ASAP.

Thanks,

Kay
	
	

Per my voice mail, here is the latest draft of the purchase order (we are 
preparing a redlined version which I will send you shortly).  We have not had 
the opportunity to incorporate all the business terms which were discussed 
and agreed to yesterday.  Also, we have not yet completed a full internal 
review of the document.  However, so that we can hold our conference call 
today, I am sending you the draft.  Please give me a call to arrange the 
conference call.

Never a dull moment!  It is hard to get deals done at Enron, which as 
shareholders we should probably be glad. Chicago is only slightly more 
difficult because of the utility angle - and mind set.  

Michael's temperature STILL hasn't gone done.  And of course, now the weekend 
is coming.  I guess it is time to call the doctor again.  And you!

Kay

There is, however, an unexpected down side to all of this.  As you are aware, 
Joe Sutton has left Enron.  Due to his departure we are now unable to run the 
list.  Your names will be published as winners of the contest, but we won't 
be able to show the list.

Please feel free to call me at (713) 853-9843 if you have any questions.  If 
you don't get your certificate by the end of next week, please let me know.

Thanks again for your fabulous entries.

Warm regards,
Sarah.

Thanks.  Who was able to do it?

Kay

Neil left town yesterday.  I can't really complain since he rarely travels.  
However, he is welcome to pamper upon his return!

Kay

I understand that you and Michael are sick with strep throat.  I hope you get 
well over the weekend and that Neill appropriately pampers you and Michael in 
the interim.

She compared the wrong versions.

I'll try again.

Here's the latest version:

Kay

Sorry I lost my temper.  I guess I'm not accustomed to being transferred to 
someone else to get things done.  No reason to lose my temper, though.

Kay

I had heard that the big E bought out the minority investors last summer.  
Hadn't seen this coming.  So what's next for Azurix?  

I'm just now printing it out (takes about 15 minutes), but I'm fine with 
sending out the redline.  

Kay

   
	
	

Can I send the last version of the red-lined P.O. to FCE?

Water is just as liquid as gas.  So to speak.

Doesn't say, other than go private.  So I guess that means, this first step 
is trying to ease whatever pain can be eased in the investment community that 
bought into Azurix since a drop from $19 to $7 is better than $19 to $4, and 
then Azurix will sell itself out of business (I told you about the calls from 
Argentine and Mexican counsel on wanting to represent potential buyers of 
Azurix assets in those countries).  I don't know about any other strategies, 
can you trade water?

You'll be happy to know that it didn't take long.

Please don't tell me that you've spent the last hour trying to think of that 
response because I certainly do like it.

There's isn't any problem getting - both Suz and I have it.  Have a good

Dear Mr. Schrum,

I attended Sing! last night to watch and support my daughter perform with her 
Tri Delta friends.  I enjoyed the performances of the various groups, which 
were within the bounds of what I expected.  Unfortunately, I am not writing 
to tell you how much I enjoyed it.

I'm writing  you to encourage the administration to not take lightly the 
indecent exposure incident which occured in the second act.   The act was 
beyond offensive, it was criminal, especially in light of the young children 
present.  During the first act, I was sitting on the first row, and there 
were 4 young children sitting in the front.  In fact,  at the end of the 
first act I had regretted that I had not brought Paige's six year old brother 
to watch her perform.  I cannot tell you how glad I am that I did not bring 
Michael.   Even I was offended, and I'm a forty-two year old lawyer (we don't 
offend easily) who was in a sorority at UT.  I was glad I had moved back at 
intermission to sit with my daughter for the second act.

Again, I urge you to not view this as an act of youthful indiscretion. It was 
offensive to the individuals present, and degrading to a fine university 
which prides itself on "encouraging contributions toward the well-being of 
humanity".  My husband, Neil, who was a Pike at SU in the seventies, joins me 
in this request.

Thank you,

Kay Mann

To all:

Attached below please find a draft of the CRRA Filing with the DPUC regarding 
the fuel cell transaction.  There are several points that remain open that I 
would like to have cleared up by Monday afternoon.  For example, is CRRA 
filing alone or are we filing jointly?

I believe we've covered all the issues outlined by Sandra.  Please let me 
know if we've left anything out or if we need to delete anything.

I think this is a good start to us meeting our compressed timeline.  Do not 
hesitate to call me for any reason whatsoever.  The next few weeks/months are 
going to be very busy, but I know we can get to the goal line.

To quote Dave Delainey, "Go, go, go."

Regards,

Heather

Carlos, you have much  wisdom for such a young buckeroo.

If Debbie can't decide and if you can't use the PaperCity photo (it realy is 
a good pic), I'd go with the first one.  I must say that all of them look 
pretty, well, serious.  Kinda Gore-like, you know.  

Ok, that was a low blow.  I was just kidding!!

Kay

I would opt for the photo that you had in your Paper City article about you 
being the commentator at the polo matches as that photo conveyed a more 
rugged and stylish image.  I see these pictures and think -- "Al Gore, no 
George Bush, no Al Gore, no George Bush, well I can't make up mind, is there 
a Ralph Nader picture that I can choose from?"  All that being said, if they 
were my pictures, I'd let my wife decide, otherwise, I'd be subject to an 
eternity of second-guessing.

I noticed the paragraph headings duplicated themselves on this last draft.  
Odd.

More to come!

Mr. Keffer,

Asking this crowd to vote was like throwing chum to sharks.

Kay

The problem is that the two pictures are so dramatically different from each 
other and present two completely different views of Mr. Keffer.   #1 looks 
very respectable, likeable, and professional, whereas #2 looks  very 
professional, likeable, and respectable.   Real hard call, but I think you go 
with #1. 

Besides, the exposure and contrast on #1  looks better - its darker. I have 
seen paper city photo (was that a swimsuit?), but urge you to avoid any 
pictures in a tank with a tankers helmet on.

Could you resend it?

Hi Paul,

I would like to  change my previous response to this email.  I would like to 
get a cleaned up version of the GE contract (without WestLB references) so 
that I can make a wider internal distribution without having to explain the 
references to WestLB.

The intial read from GE was positive, but the devil is in the details, of 
course.

Kay

Kay:  references to WestLB are in only a few places in the GE Contract; 
namely, the recitals and sections 3.8(c)(2), 5.1, 6.1, 7.2.4, 30.7 and 
30.12.  The references in the recitals, 3.8(c),7.2.4, 30.7 and 30.12 can be 
handled fairly easily.  The references in 5.1 and 6.1 deal with pricing 
matters and will require a little work once the pricing mechanism is worked 
out with GE.  My suggestion would be to not revise the document at this time 
and make these changes at the same time we make any other changes arising 
from the discussions with GE.  PLease let me know what you think.  Regards, 
Paul

>>> <Kay.Mann@enron.com> 10/24/00 12:37PM >>>

Thanks.  This is a  very drastic situation, so the draft will be
appreciated.

As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility
agreement, deleting the WestLB references.  When will this be forthcoming?

Thanks,

Kay

Peter Thompson is working on it.  We should have a draft Wednesday.
Regards, Paul

Hi Kathleen,

Is the Peoples confidentiality agreement moving closer to the top of the list?

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Charlotte,

I'm not sure what we are doing at Thanksgiving, but at the most we might go 
to Palacios, which means that we would be gone no  more than Thursday and 
maybe Friday night.  I haven't talked to Paige about her schedule yet, but I 
know we need to get organized. Also, I think Michael is out of school that 
Wednesday.  Again, I need to check.  More to come.

As for tomorrow (BOO), we forgot to watch for sundown.  I know, that is hard 
to believe.  We will update tomorrow!

Kay

   As usual, Michael was a delight.  We want to see Beauty and the
Beast on Ice.  It's on November 22-26.  Let me know if the family is going
to be out of town and if not, what date would be best.  I assume Michael is
out of school Thursday-Sunday, but don't know.  I would love to get him
interested in things like this.

   We passed U. of H., and I told him that was where Mom went to school
to learn to be a lawyer.  He informed me that he was not going to be a
lawyer.  When I asked him what he did want to be, he said, "a boss so I can
tell everybody what to do."  I explained that you could not be a boss
directly out of college, but he was firm.  That's what he wants.

   He's funny watching videos.  I would try to sneak in reading a book
or looking over something, but he was emphatic.  He wanted me to "watch the
video at the same time he did so we could talk about things as they
happened."

   Let me know about Beauty and the Beast.  See you tonight to trick or
treat.

Well, once again I'm messed up on my calendar.  I thought you were going to 
be in FW a couple more days.  Michael tried callling yesterday (I think it 
was yesterday), but of course we missed.

I think I'm in town this week (cross fingers).  I was home with Michael three 
days last week - we both had strep, but he was worse.  His fever didn't break 
for a couple of days, so I had to cancel my trip to San Antonio to join Neil 
at his officer's meeting.  I did make it to Georgetown, and had a nice time 
with Paige.  
We are hoping for cooler weather soon.  It is muggy!  

Tell Dad hi, and happy fishing.

Love,

Kay

I may be able to back up Bart if he has a problem.  I have a conference call 
scheduled but it is likely to reschedule until later in the day.

I can attend the 9:00 am Pacific PSCo call. By copy hereof I'm requesting 
Karen let me know where I need to be/call in number. If I don't hear 
otherwise I'll be in my office at 11:00 am tomorrow Houston time.

SU was fun, but there was  a little incident with a streaker (more like a 
stroller on stage).  Otherwise, it was great.  Paige did really well, and she 
was front and center for most of their act.

I don't know what we are going to do about Thanksgiving.  Neil and I are 
negotiating. I neglected to discuss it with Paige this weekend, of course.  
It is hard to believe it is only a few weeks away.

Michael and I are both better, although he didn't get better until Friday 
night. 

Hi to all!

Love,

Kay

Hello!

How did things go in Georgetown? I just wanted to see how it went and tell
you again how sorry I am that things did not work out so that we could see
you. Also, are yall going to Palacios for Thanksgiving? Are you staying at
the bed and breakfast? I think we are going to come down on Saturday morning
and we were thinking about getting a room for that night. Bobby claims that
the pink house becomes the house of snores when we all stay there. He may
have a point!

Are you and Michael feeling better??

Love you!

Lisa

Dear Team,
Dave mentioned that probably the only other change would be in the assignment
section article xxii and that should not be any big change.

MIKE
Security Level:?         Internal

Mike,
     When  we  spoke  this morning, Dave advised that one change to the 
language
that  will  be  required is  the addition of the words in red , in bold added 
by
ABB at the end of this paragraph in section 22.2 of the contract.

     In  the  case of an assignment to a party described in (ii), (vi), or 
(vii)
(other  than   Enron  Engineering  &  Construction  or  NEPCO),  Seller shall 
be
entitled  to  request  and  receive  an  appropriate guaranty, letter of 
credit,
payment  bond  or  other  reasonable  form of payment security, in amount not 
to
exceed the amount of the Purchase Amount remaining to be paid at the time of 
the
assignment,  unless  the  assignor  agrees  to  remain  liable  for  all  
future
liabilities  under  this  Agreement.  A letter of guaranty, letter of credit, 
or
payment bond provided by an entity rated BBB+ or better shall be deemed to be 
an
appropriate  form  of  security  for  the purpose of this provision , so long 
as
payment  in  full  has  been  made  in accordance with the schedule set forth 
in
Article VI.

     Additional commentary may come later today when Dave reaches his first 
stop
on his flight back to Raliegh.

Gore good for health-care, fuel cells 

By Deborah Adamson, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 9:36 AM ET Oct 31, 2000

Latest headlines

NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - As Election Day nears, a key question confronting 
investors is how each presidential candidate will affect the stock market.
At no other time in U.S. history is such a question so pertinent, with about 
half of all households owning equities.
In this article, CBS.MarketWatch.com identifies sectors that will get a boost 
under an Al Gore presidency. On Wednesday, we'll examine the impact if George 
W. Bush wins. See our full election coverage.

First, a caveat: Despite the campaign rhetoric, analysts said, a president 
has less direct impact on the stock market than do the economic cycle, the 
stock market cycle, the oil cartel, the global economy, the strength of the 
U.S. dollar, interest rates and many other influences.
As such, giving any administration sole or main credit for a bull or bear 
market would be misleading.
Where the government has greater influence is in such things as military 
spending and, more critically, the choice of Fed chairman, said Arnold 
Kaufman, editor of the S&P Outlook, an investment publication published by 
Standard & Poor's. 
Investors also should remember that campaign promises don't always work out. 
That said, analysts have identified sectors that either could benefit under 
Gore, or that historically have done well under Democrats. 
Capital goods
If Democrats live up to their "big spender" image, Kaufman said, expect a 
rise in infrastructure spending. That means an impact on the communications 
and transportation, among other sectors.
His favorite stocks here include Sanmina Corp. (SANM: news, msgs), a maker of 
electronic components for equipment makers, and Tyco (TYC: news, msgs), a 
diversified electronics and industrial company.
Sanmina makes electronic components and cables for equipment manufacturers in 
the communications, industrial, medical and high-speed computer markets.
Last week, Merrill Lynch chose Sanmina as one of top 10 tech stocks that are 
expected to outperform in the next six to 12 months.
In the fourth quarter, Sanmina's earnings before one-time charges more than 
doubled from the like period in 1999, beating Wall Street's consensus 
estimate by 10 cents. Revenue almost doubled to $1.27 billion. Company 
profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings.
Tyco sells to the telecommunications, electronics, health-care, industrial 
goods and fire and security services markets. Tyco recently completed the 
acquisition of Mallinckrodt, a specialty medical products maker, boosting its 
position in the respiratory care arena.
Fourth-quarter earnings before extraordinary items rose by 40 percent to $1.1 
billion, or 64 cents a share, from a year ago. Sales went up by 25 percent to 
$7.8 billion. Company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. 
Earlier this month, Legg Mason raised its rating on Tyco to "buy" from 
"market performance." Elizabeth Mackay, chief investment strategist at Bear 
Stearns, includes Tyco on her recommended list.
Mortgage lenders 
A Gore presidency could end an action by some lawmakers to sever these 
lenders' lines of credit from the U.S. Treasury, said Erik Gustafson, senior 
portfolio manager for Liberty Growth Stock fund.
The argument for severance is that these congressionally chartered lenders 
have an unfair advantage over other banking and mortgage lenders. In 
addition, the SEC's new fair disclosure regulation can be expected to boost 
companies with reliable earnings growth, according to Bear Stearns. Stocks 
expected to do well in this environment include Fannie Mae (FNM: news, msgs) 
and Freddie Mac (FRE: news, msgs), Bear Stearns said.
Fannie Mae, or the Federal National Mortgage Association, and Freddie Mac, 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., buy conventional home mortgages from 
banks and mortgage bankers and sells them as securities. Fannie Mae: Company 
profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. Freddie Mac: Company 
profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings. 
Health care providers
An increase in government spending on Medicare should boost stocks in this 
sector. Warren Isabelle, president of Ironwood Capital Management, likes 
nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises (BEV: news, msgs).
Last week, ING Barings raised its rating on Beverly Enterprises to "buy" from 
"hold." Beverly Enterprises recently reported a second-quarter profit, 
reversing a loss from 1999. The company's business is improving because of 
increased revenue from Medicare and Medicaid. However, Beverly has taken a 
hit lately because it's adding $50 million to its reserves for patient 
liability costs for 2000.
Alternative energy sources
In his book, "Earth in the Balance," Gore called for the gradual elimination 
of the internal combustion engine and espoused other environmental beliefs. 
As such, alternative energy stocks should do well under his presidency, 
specifically fuel cell companies, said Jim Lowell, chief portfolio strategist 
for Adviser Investments Management.
One stock he likes is FuelCell Energy (FCEL: news, msgs). FuelCell develops 
electrochemical technologies that generate electricity without combustion. 
Last week, Friedman Billings Ramsey raised its rating on Fuelcell to 
"accumulate," following Chase H&Q's upgrade to "buy" earlier in the month. 
FuelCell also has allied with Enron (ENE: news, msgs) to develop and sell 
FuelCell's Direct FuelCel products. Enron has invested $5 million in the 
company. Company profile, latest financials, analysts' ratings. 
What about tech stocks?
Here, analysts have mixed feelings. Kaufman believes both candidates would be 
good for the sector in general, but Gustafson disagrees, citing the worsening 
of the regulatory environment in the last eight years and the antitrust 
action against Microsoft (MSFT: news, msgs). Lowell thinks Gore's impact 
would be neutral to negative, but analyst Safa Rashtchy of US Bancorp Piper 
Jaffray said the Democrat could be good for Net stocks.
Gore vs. Bush portfolios
Thus far, Gore is ahead of Bush, based on a basket of stocks pegged to each 
candidate's possible presidency. Since Sept. 1, Lisa Kammert, an analyst at 
Birinyi Associates, has been tracking two portfolios comprising 12 stocks 
each that would do well under Gore or Bush. As of Monday, Gore's portfolio 
has outperformed Bush's by 4.43 percent, based on a simple average of each 
stock's return. In 1992, the same model accurately predicted a Clinton win.
In the Gore portfolio are Amazon.com, Yahoo, Citigroup, Bank of America, 
Disney, Time Warner, BellSouth, Duke Energy, Tenet Healthcare, Procter & 
Gamble, Coca-Cola and Waste Management. In Bush's basket are IBM, Microsoft, 
Exxon Mobil, Transocean Sedco, Merrill Lynch, Bristol Myers, W.R. Grace, 
Beazer Homes, Philip Morris and Boeing. Going into the last week before the 
election, Gore has outpaced Bush most of the time since Sept. 1.
As for job growth, a study by executive recruiter Challenger, Gray & 
Christmas indicates that a Gore administration would boost employment for the 
mass transit sector, education, health care, construction (homes and 
schools), agriculture, lawyers, insurance, law enforcement, commercial 
banking and forestry.? 

1)The cybergoblins ate the attachment.
2) OK
3) Which Peoples is it?  Also, I think enovate should sign at CA.
4)  I sent Heather an email re her availability.  There's a bunch of 
construction near downtown, so I would hesitate to commit to an early call, 
but I know I'm free after 300 tomorrow.

Kay

Kay - 

1) Attached is my quick attempt at writing something to make the management 
changes at enovate that we discussed.  Could you please review this and add 
the appropriate legal language.  I don't think that we need any Board 
approval for any of these changes, so is some type of notification sufficient?

2)  I would like to address the idea of signature authorities other than 
Laura at the same time.  My suggestion would be that Richard and myself be 
granted some level of authority to execute CA's, Master Agreements, etc. that 
have been reviewed and approved by legal.  If you can at least pull the 
template you used to get approval for the Director you mentioned and see if 
there would be any changes necessary that would be helpful.

3) I need to get the CA form for the curves and other information started.  
We can discuss this any time you want.

4) What is your availability tomorrow either 8-9:15 or after 3:00 to discuss 
the intercompany loan agreement, and will Heather be available?

I will be leaving around 2:00 for suburban trick or treating.

Thanks,

Gregg 

Suzanne is going to track down Heather, then will call you to confirm if 330 
works.

Kay

1)

3) I think we want it to apply to whatever entity employs the individuals 
with access.  Most of these people will probably Peoples Energy Corp. 
employees, but I suppose we could make it also include all of their 
affiliates.  enovate can sign the CA as well, but since enovate doesn't have 
any employees I was assuming we could use Peoples Energy as the responsible 
legal entity.

4) After 3:00 is fine, let me know for sure soon enough that I can lock Sarah 
up.

Thanks,

Gregg

Do you know what it is about?

Thanks.

Heather

We want to have an internal conference call at 330 (instato discuss the 
enovate intercompany loans, and address any issues raised by the Enron 
commercial/financial team.  I don't know the substance of the comments.

Kay

Early morning is full, but I'm free at 10:00 and several hours thereafter.  
Would this be in addition to or in lieu of the 3:30 call?  Also, do you have 
any heads-up re:  what the comments will be?

Thanks.  Heather

What about Wednesday morning to discuss Bracewell's draft of the
intercompany loan agreement?  Kay could you check Heather's availability?
Anyone else that should be included?

Thanks,

I forgot about the fence.  

I'm still planning on leaving early - maybe 430 or earlier. Can you leave 
early, too?  Michael wanted to do something with the spider web.  I would 
offer to pick Michael up, but I'm not sure that I would beat you if I left at 
430 and you left at 500.

Love,

ckm

Well, we will not have a fence today.  The installer was very nice and
apologized for the inconvenience. He said there was a lack of communication
between he and the sales person. Bottom line he didn't have the equipment to
do either job. We discussed the driveway which will have two lines running
across it. The second one will be the divider at the gate. We also discussed
the front yard and how to get Jack in and out of the zone without having to
take off his collar each time. He got there before me and watched Jack a
little bit. He said he appeared to be the type of dog that would respond
well to the barrier.  A fast learner as he put it. Anyway, I am waiting for
them to call me and will let you know what I hear.

I will write Choc and let her know to be at the house at 6pm. I may try to
leave a little early so Michael and I will not be walking in the house about
the time she gets there. John has told the department heads to get the
parents out a little early today. I know he is leaving early himself.

Write if you can. Love, Neil

Hi Nancy,

It seems we may be scheduling a meeting with VEPCO to discuss the PPA.  July 
20th is the current date being discussed.  I don't know how we want to staff 
the meeting yet, but I do want to check your availability. How does that date 
look for you?

Thanks,

Kay

Here are the form exhibits, as we discussed:

Kay

Here's my little bit of info:

GE (S & S) - I've spoken with Lee Johnson (commercial lead) and have traded 
voice mails with Kent Shoemaker regarding the project specific turbine 
contracts.  I'm requesting a meeting with them on Thursday to iron our 
details.    I requested a revised draft this week (from Andrews & Kurth), but 
have not received it yet.

ABB - I've swapped calls with Mike Sandrige (their commercial lead) about it, 
but haven't connected.  The contract is more straight forward, so problems 
are not expected.  Initial draft of the project specific contracts has been 
prepared.

Blue Dog - Is that GE equipment? Sheila may have someone she wants to work on 
it.  If not, I can fit it in since it relates to what I'm working on with the 
GE contracts.

Austin - this is Stuart's project.

Kay

Hi -

We are fast approaching the time when  we will need to assign equipment 
purchase agreements to either the "Developer" in the CSFB structure, to ENA 
(I think) in the Austin deal or, more urgently, to WestLB in connection with 
a deal in which LJM is currently the nominal purchaser.  The LJM deal is 
called "Blue Dog" and ENA has decided it wants those turbines.

Blue Dog-

Lisa has her folks talking to WLB regarding the Blue Dog contract and Rob 
Taylor has contacted Winston & Strawn about a new ADA.   We will need to 
contact GE about the transfer (actually it will be two transfers - one to WLB 
and then into the "Developer" in the CSFB structure).  
Who at ENA legal should I work with  to get that process started?  Both Rob 
and I have the turbine purchase agreement and can get it to the ENA lawyer.   

Austin -

The Austin turbines are the LMs - that purchase agreement contemplates that 
the new buyer will execute another agreement with (GE/S&S) covering the 
turbines it acquires.   Is that structure still contemplated?  Is there 
another way to do this that would be easier from a labor perspective?   I 
assume ENA will then be assigning the equipment on to the project company or 
EPC contractor, also.

CSFB Structure -

More generally we will need to get buy-in from vendors on the assignment of 
the purchase contracts.  Is this an appropriate topic for the the World 
Hunger discussion tomorrow?  Are there other vendors who need to be contacted 
on this also?

Thanks for your help,

Rose

Suzanne,

Please call (not email - he doesnt check it) Paul Pipitone (Andrews & Kurth) 
and see if he is available for a meeting (or conference call) to discuss the 
GE facility agreement sometime tomorrow - either am or after 300.

Thanks,

Kay

Gregg,

Sorry, I thought Suzanne had confirmed it. We are on for 330.  I can call you.

Kay

At 330 please get Sarah and Heather Brown (Bracewell) on the phone for me, 
then I'll get Gregg.  

Thanks,

Kay, I told him the meeting was at 3:30 and that you would be calling him.

Hi John,

Karen Jones in Portland has been working on it for ENA.  I don't know the 
status.

Kay 

Hi, gang. Sheila called last Friday and let me know you were working on this 
off-balance sheet EPC form, and that it was expected to be out on Friday, 
maybe Monday for review and commment, which was needed PDQ becuase of a 
looming project.  I have not seen any copy of the form or had any update on 
the status of the project.

Kay/Dave, could one of you send the form to me and let me know the big

I wanted to send out a reminder to everyone that I had indicated to Mr. 
Schaeffer that we would be sending him a document last week and to suggest 
that we try to get something out to him this week if at all possible.  

Since our critical final zoning vote is next Thursday, I want to make sure we 
don't give him any reason to get "up in arms" over this issue and start 
thinking we have just been leading him along without intending to follow 
through on the deal.  Mark and Karen have done such an exemplary job on the 
zoning (record time) that I don't want anything to get in our way at the 
final moment.  Mr. Schaeffer is one of the wealthier and more influential 
farmers in the area, and has thus far been pretty quiet at the meetings, 
however, he pointedly cornered me at the end of our last meeting to ask about 
this issue.  Lets keep him happy.

Please let me know if we can get it out this week, so I can call him and 
apologize for the delay and give him a new improved delivery date of the 
draft documents.

Thanks.

Rusty,

You are going to have to refresh my recollection as to this piece of land.  
Kathleen, could you please get with Rusty or Fred to see what's up.

This morning, Rusty requested that we prepare an Option Agreement for the 29
acre parcel west of the Livingston Energy Center.  This property could be
used as a construction laydown site, but more importantly would provide a
sound buffer for the project.  It is our understanding that the Option
Agreement is to be presented to the property owner at some point next week.
We will forward a draft of the agreement to you no later than Monday,
October 16, 2000.  Please feel free to call me or Don Shindler
(312-368-2175) with any questions regarding the agreement.  Best regards.

The Fehrs and Ledfords did sign their respective option agreements last week

forward you an executed original copy of each agreement.  I will check with 
her on the status of this.

With regard to the policy, I understand your point.  Rusty and I will work to 
better co-ordinate with you in the future.  Perhaps we can lever off of 
Kathleen for agreements such as the Schaeffer option.

Let me know.

Hi Guys,

Enron policy requires that the assignment of tasks to outside counsel go 
through (or at least be coordinated with) the legal department.  In the 
future, please let me know what you need so that there can be some order to 
the process.

Did the Fehrs and Ledfords sign the option agreements?

The tract is a 29.46 acre parcel that is just west of the site for our 
plant.  We need to secure it to prevent other houses from being built on our 
perimeter (sound receptors).  We have just worked hard to buy the other two 
houses adjacent to the property to fix this problem.  Its a nice situation 
since the tract is long and narrow, so we get maximum sound receptor 
protection for minimal acreage purchases.  I had sent a memo to Karen Way a 
while back asking them to work on this and you cautioned me to make sure I 
ran kick off of outside counsel on a project past you first (if that jogs 
your memory).  

Anyway, this is a finishing touch on Pontiac, and I have promised the 
landowner a document a while back, so I would appreciate our turning it to 
him in the near future.  I have been preoccupied on some stuff in Florida, 
but feel badly that we haven't gotten this out to this guy sooner.  I will 
make the apology phone call (blame the big company lawyers - of course) and 
let him know its on its way and not to give up on us.

Kathleen and I have already discussed this today.

A call works.  It will be the Enron commercial lead (Ben Jacoby), Stuart 
Zisman, the GE commercial lead and the GE lawyer.  It is about the contract 
he prepared (although now I wonder).  If he prefers to have whoever will be 
doing the drafting, that's fine, too.

Paul called me back and said he is available for about an hour at 3pm 
tomorrow.  He wanted to know who would be on the call and what it is about.  
He said he needed to prepare for the meeting.  He hasn't read the contract, 
so if it's regarding same, he needs to know.  Let me know and I'll call him.

CST.  That was right, right?

I'm going to have the outside lawyer involved for the purpose of turning the 
revised draft, so long as you don't have an objection (objecting=volunteering 
to turning the next draft!)

Kay

Is that 3:30 CST? If so, I'll be ready.

Gentlemen:

Attached is a draft of the facility agreement, without reference to WestLB.
It just came in, so I haven't reviewed it.

It looks like 330 tomorrow will work for this group, unless you tell me
otherwise.  I'll get back to you with the location.

Kay
Enclosed please find clean and blacklined versions of the GE Contract.
The blackline of the Agreement identifies the changes from the draft I
sent you. Note that no blackline of the Exhibits was necessary because
it contained no references to WestLB.

Paul

Enron: Withdrawing 300 MW From Summer Peaking Program
Wednesday, November 1, 2000 02:18 PM

	NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--In response to new California power market rules 
proposed Wednesday by the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Enron 
Corp (ENE, news, msgs) has canceled some new generator projects it was 
discussing with the state's electric grid operator, Enron said. 
	The generators that are no longer financially feasible would have amounted to 
300 megawatts of new generation installed in California next spring, Enron 
said. The company, however, continues to negotiate other new generator 
projects with the California Independent System Operator. 
	The FERC Wednesday proposed limiting the California Power Exchange's price 
setting mechanism to $150 a megawatt-hour. The preliminary order could become 
a federal mandate by the end of the year, after the FERC takes comments from 
the public, or it could be modified. 
	Enron and 13 other companies, meanwhile, are in final negotiations with the 
ISO for the new peaking capacity for next summer. The ISO plans to pay a 
total of $255 million a year for three years to the power companies for 
installing the new generators, which the power companies will own. 
	In addition, California's three investor-owned utilities would pay the 
generators for any electricity the new generators produce. Pricing for the 
power would likely be based on the daily price set by the state-chartered 
CalPX. 
	"There's too much uncertainty that we would be able to recover the cost 
associated with those specific projects. For the purposes of making capital 
commitments, we view this as a $150 price cap," Enron's Mark Palmer said. 
	Earlier Wednesday, the ISO's chief operating officer, Terry Winter, expressed 
concern that FERC's proposed new rules could jeopardize some of the projects. 
	FERC's proposals Wednesday are the result of a two-month investigation of 
California's wholesale electricity market, where prices this summer were 
three times what they were a year earlier. To meet the state's rising demand 
for power, California's three utilities have paid billions of dollars more 
than anticipated to independent power producers in order to keep the lights 
on.

I see Ben keeps calling me.  Any idea what's up?  I probably have another 30 
minutes on this call.

Probably wouldn't hurt.  Tell him I'll be on for another hour.

Thanks,

Kay

He sound stressed as usual.  I told him you've been on a conference call and 
it looked like it was going to last a while.  He went into your voice mail.  
Do you want me to call him back and soothe his feathers.

As requested, attached is a listing of the turbine inventory.  Because the 
payment/termination schedules are not consolidated into one file, I will send 
you a hard copy of this information this afternoon.  

Wanda

Your list is very close to mine.  I'm making a list as I go back through the 
draft, so I'll update when I get through.

Kay

   
	
	

I looked through the exhibit package that you sent me.  I have highlighted 
the exhibits that believe that  we definitely need.  I also listed some other 
potential exhibits.  What are your thoughts on our specific requirements?

Kay,

 Please include Mike Nanny's verbiage below (on minimum design standards) in 
the Purchase Order Contract.  Please call with any questions.  Thanks.

Stephen
Michael D Nanny@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
10/30/2000 06:21 PM
Sorry in the earlier transmittal I was interrupted and sent the message by 
mistake.  The red text below is what I added to insure that the minimum 
design standards are satisfied.  From the discussion this morning, the 
sensing instruments should or must be rated class I, div 2 and Fuelcell was 
not willing to state that minimum was included in their design basis.  The 
wording below should bring closure to this issue, when placed in the contract.

Mike Nanny
	Enron Engineering & Construction Company

Sent by: Dom Liu
Mike:

This is the recommended verbiage to address area classification issues:

The electrical system design and installation shall be in compliance with the 
requirement of NFPA 70 (NEC), in particular, Article 500 with respect to 
Hazardous Locations.  The classification of locations shall be as recommended 
by API RP 500 (Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for 
Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities.)  The design compliance 
with the NFPA requirements shall be demonstated in a design review or HAZOP 
Regards,

Dom

Hi Scott,

I have these questions:

What do we mean by configuration?  We are telling them that we will give them 
the configuration by date x, but I'm not sure what we mean.

What was decided on spare parts, if anything?

I know it is repetitive, but could you email me a basic timeline of what you 
see as the key dates for site designation, shipping, anything else you can 
think of?  I've started a timeline but would like to cross check.

I was hoping to have it done before noon, but the 930 conference call will 
impact that.  I have a meeting this afternoon from 230 until 500 or so, so 
I'm trying to get done before then.

Thanks,

Kay

   
	
	

When you have the draft P.O. done, I would like to block of some time to 
discuss it.  I will leave my schedule fairly open today.

Please call Ben Jacoby and see if we can push our meeting to 230.  Please 
advise Stuart that I'm planning to meet with Ben at 230, and invite him to 
join.

Thanks,

Kay

Sheila went to these. I believe they cover the activities related to the 
development of the various site.  

I'm on a conference call or I would have called.

Kay

Kay, do you generally attend these meetings?? What is generally covered in 
these meetings??? Please at your convenience give me a shout .  thanks bng

Scott/Stephen, I'm trying to summarize the essence of these performance 
guarantees, similiar to what I have for heat rate.  I'm sure I've got 
something on output and probably reliability, but can you give me a thumb 
nail sketch of what we are looking for on the rest?

10.3.1   Heat Rate Guarantee.  Seller guarantees that the Heat Rate as 
measured for each of the Units 
as demonstrated during the Performance Test, shall be __BTU/kWh. In the event 
the Heat Rate exceeds the Minimum Heat Rate Guarantee, Seller shall take all 
necessary actions to correct, retest the deficient Unit and cause the 
deficient Unit to meet the Minimum Heat Rate Guarantee.  Failure to meet the 
Heat Rate Guarantee shall prevent Acceptance, unless Purchaser explicitly 
waives this guarantee in writing.  

{we have a definition of heat rate}

10.3.2   Electrical Output Guarantee.  
  
10.3.3   Emissions Guarantee. 

10.3.4   Water Consumption Guarantee. 

10.3.5 Sound Guarantee.

10.3.6 Reliability.

Thanks,

Kay

Didn't I tell you - I love outside counsel!!!

See you tomorrow
Kent

CST.  That was right, right?

I'm going to have the outside lawyer involved for the purpose of turning
the revised draft, so long as you don't have an objection
(objecting=volunteering to turning the next draft!)

Kay

Is that 3:30 CST? If so, I'll be ready.

Gentlemen:

Attached is a draft of the facility agreement, without reference to WestLB.
It just came in, so I haven't reviewed it.

It looks like 330 tomorrow will work for this group, unless you tell me
otherwise.  I'll get back to you with the location.

Kay
Enclosed please find clean and blacklined versions of the GE Contract.
The blackline of the Agreement identifies the changes from the draft I
sent you. Note that no blackline of the Exhibits was necessary because
it contained no references to WestLB.

I had a big lunch, so something light sounds good.

I spoke with a lady in St Louis HR who said she paid in advance for her
child last year. She said it does not matter when you paid. She suggested we
ask St F for a quarterly statement. That's what she used last year and had
no problem whatsoever getting reimbursed. I bet we are not the only folks in
this situation at St F.

I confirmed the fence installation for Wednesday 11/8 at 1:15pm. I will be
at an HCA luncheon that morning for 1 hour of CE and should be finished in
time to be at the house by then.

Any thought on what you would like for dinner?

Neil

Gentlemen,

I've made some changes to the assignment language of the ABB contract. The 
language is not identical to the LM 6000 language, but is substantially the 
same, and in some respects better.  Please let me know if you have any 
substantive comments:

I am also attaching the current draft of the contract.  It is being revised 
to incorporate delivery dates and to clarify the scope to include 
installation obligations of ABB (haul and install).  Also, in the fourth line 
of the first paragraph, the word "Purchaser" will be added to the 
parenthetical, after "WestLB". Any other changes should be very minor or 
technical.

We are trying to get this finished this week.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions or comments.

Kay

Attached is the latest ABB agreement for your review:

You have to admire the initiative!

Suzanne is adding your changes to the purchase agreement now.

Hi there,

I'm attaching the latest version of the purchase agreement.  I will prepare a 
compared version in the am if you will tell me which version you want it 
compared against.

Talk to you soon,

Greetings,

Ok, I know I must be doing something wrong.  I either get a "wrong SAP 
number", or I end up on the HRonline website, with no Clickathomepilot 
options.  I'm using my HRonline password.  Any suggestions?

Thanks,

	FuelCell Energy Announces Two Contract Awards
Thursday, November 2, 2000 07:07 AM	?Mail this article to a friend 
	DANBURY, Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Nov. 2, 2000-- 
	New, Specialized Applications for Direct FuelCell(TM) Power Plants 
	FuelCell Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ: FCEL, news, msgs) announced the award of 
contracts for two new power plants using the company's Direct FuelCells(R) 
(DFC(R)) for coal mine and remote location applications. The first contract 
is for a $5.4 million project with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 
National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) for the design, construction and 
operation of a 250 kW DFC, utilizing coal mine methane gas, at the Harrison 
Mining Corporation coal mine in Cadiz, Ohio. The second contract, for 
$100,000, is from the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center in 
Groton, Connecticut for a remote location, 3 kW fuel cell power system, using 
methanol for fuel. It is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter 
of 2001 at the Cape Henry Lighthouse at Fort Story, near Virginia Beach, VA. 
	Coal Mine Methane: Cost-Free Fuel Reduces Emissions 
	FuelCell Energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction 
project to demonstrate the ability of the DFC to generate electricity, using 
coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere. Costs 
for the three-year program will be shared equally by the DOE and FuelCell 
Energy. As a result, in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing 
emissions, the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced 
by using a fuel that is essentially free. 
	"The DOE has been supporting the development of fuel cells for more than two 
decades," said Mark C. Williams, fuel cell product manager for NETL. "This 
application to coal mine methane effectively combines efficient power 
generation with a solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions." 
	According to FuelCell Energy, 75% of the world's coal mine methane emissions 
from active and abandoned coal mines comes from the top six countries with 
coal mining operations. A total of approximately 1,000 megawatts of fuel cell 
power could be generated using coal mine methane from the two sources. The 
U.S., alone, has approximately 300 megawatts of unutilized coal mine methane 
capacity. At an estimated $1,000 kW, the 1,000 MW worldwide potential for 
FuelCell Energy fuel cell power plants is equivalent to a $1.0 billion 
market. 
	"The use of coal mine methane to power Direct FuelCells will result in 
benefits for all concerned," said Jerry D. Leitman, president and CEO of 
FuelCell Energy. "Coal mine methane is a greenhouse gas which can be 
remediated. By using it to fuel a DFC power plant, a customer turns a 
liability into an asset that gets rid of a polluting gas and produces 
electric power in an environmentally responsible fashion. An important 
milestone for the company is to identify prospective early-adopter markets. 
The coal mine methane market provides a virtually free fuel source to operate 
the fuel cells, facilitating early adoption by energy users." 
	Remote Power: Clean Energy Where the Wires End 
	The U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development Center has awarded FuelCell 
Energy a $100,000 contract to provide a 3 kW DFC power plant at the Cape 
Henry Lighthouse, for a field test at the lighthouse to demonstrate fuel cell 
capabilities at remote sites. The Coast Guard operates several hundred 
unattended power systems at remote site communication stations, radio 
navigation stations, weather stations, and aids to navigation such as 
lighthouses, structures, and buoys. Stand alone fuel cell power systems offer 
efficiency and environmental advantages for remote site operation. The 
methanol fuel allows for simpler, more compact process equipment for FuelCell 
Energy's Direct FuelCell plant compared to other fuel sources. 
	"This demonstration project by FuelCell Energy is the first application of 
fuel cells at a remote, unmanned site in a marine environment", said Walt 
Lincoln, project manager of the U.S. Coast Guard Research and Development 
Center. "We're interested in the potential of the fuel cell because of its 
promise of reduced maintenance and greater reliability compared to other 
systems." 
	"In addition to the unattended applications for the Coast Guard, there are 
other potential remote power applications in operation around the world, such 
as pipeline monitoring, microwave relay stations, and numerous other 
communications and recreational uses that could be served by fuel cells," 
said Leitman. 
	Using carbonate fuel cell technology, the DFC(R) power plant produces high 
efficiency energy through an electro-chemical reaction, rather than through 
combustion. This method of producing power gives energy users the option of 
producing electricity on site with the assurance of lower emissions, less 
noise and with shorter timeframes required for the permitting process. 
	About FuelCell Energy, Inc. 
	FuelCell Energy, Inc. - www.fce.com - formerly Energy Research Corp., is a 
leading developer of carbonate fuel cell technology for stationary power 
generation. The Company's Direct FuelCell technology eliminates external fuel 
processing to extract hydrogen from a hydrocarbon fuel. This results in a 
product whose cost, combined with high efficiency, simplicity and 
reliability, results in product advantages for stationary power generation. 
FuelCell Energy, based in Danbury, CT is developing Direct FuelCell(R) power 
plants with nominal ratings of 300 kW, 1.5 MW and 3 MW.. The Company has been 
developing DFC(R) technology for stationary power plants with the U.S. 
Department of Energy through the National Energy Technology Laboratory 
(NETL). The NETL's advanced fuel cell research program is focused on 
developing a new generation of high performance fuel cells that can generate 
clean electricity at power stations or in distributed locations near the 
customer, including hospitals, schools, data centers and other commercial and 
industrial applications.

I just completed a lengthy call with A & K concerning the form facility 
agreement.  A revised draft should be out mid-day today.

I have once again called ABB, but haven't heard back from them yet.

Kay

I think it is a great day to work!

If no one has any objections, I would like to take off Monday, November 27, 
2000.  My motherinlaw and sisterinlaw will be in from Tulsa, and I think it 
would be nice to take off.  

Brenda, please get me a temporary for this day.  Thanks.

I asked Paige what she was doing for Thanksgiving....

Paige Record <recordp@southwestern.edu> on 11/03/2000 10:44:42 AM
It is so gross and rainy here!:( I'm supposed to have a tour today, but
Sarah is calling me if anyone shows up because I don't want to walk all the
way there if no one comes. It is SO WET! I'm not really sure about
Thanksgiving. Jennifer is trying to get me a ticket to the game. I feel
bad, but I might decide if I do go to the game to just come up to
Georgetown. I have a TON to do for those next two weeks, and that next
weekend is New Orleans, so I can't get much of anything done. But I might
not even end up going to the game. I really don't know because no one has
found me a ticket yet. And if I do go and we come back Friday, then I'll
come back to school Saturday or Sunday. I guess it's just really too early
for me to speculate because the game is so undecided. I will be home ASAP
on Tuesday, that's for sure. Oh, I'm attaching my resume...I can't decide
what to put in for Enterprise or what to take out to make it one page. Feel
free to play with it and send it off to the proper authorities at Enron.:)
Have a great day. I'll keep you posted with plans as I figure them out.

Love always,

Paige

Please find attached for your review revised documents (and one new document) 
for the Enovate loan, incorporating the terms of our discussion on 
Wednesday.  Attached are:

1.  Closing Documents List (which will double as Exhibit A to the Credit 
Agreement -- these are the items which must be delivered as a condition 
precedent to Enron's obligation to make any advances under the Credit 
Agreement);

2.  Credit Agreement (clean and black lined copy); and

3.  Promissory Note.

I have pared down the covenants as we discussed, reflecting that it is 
expected that EMW will remain the managing member of Enovate, and you do not 
wish to impose burdensome obligations on EMW.

In addition, as we discussed, I have modified Section 7.3 to place 
limitations on Enron's ability to amend certain material portions of the 
Credit Agreement, since the Peoples agreement will contain a mirror 
provision.  Please confirm that the limitations I included are acceptable.

Finally, please note that Section 7.5 currently places no limitations on 
Enron's ability to assign its rights and obligations under the Credit 
Agreement, which means that Peoples will also be able to assign freely.  Do 
you wish to place limitations on the lenders' right to assign?

I don't seem to have Sarah's e-mail address, so please forward this to her as 
well.

Please call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing.

Heather

Hi Jordan,

I support ENA's Chicago group in their activities with Peoples.  Peoples and 
Enron have a jointly (50/50) owned company called enovate, which will be 
involed in managing some of Peoples assets and some trading activities.  Each 
of the parents will be establishing a line of credit to cover cash flow.  It 
is expected that Corp will be lending the money for Enron's part, and Sarah 
Wesner has been involved in the process.  Therefore, I thought it would be a 
good idea to run this transaction through your group for 
blessing/comment/sign off/whatever is appropriate.  I can give additional 
information to whoever you decide should take a look at this.

Thanks,

Kay

Gregg,

Joel is a lawyer with Global Finance.  Since Corp will be loaning the money, 
I contacted that legal group to get their buy in (they are Sarah's lawyers, 
so to speak).  Anyway, I thought the change of name from enovate to enervate 
is priceless.  Enervate= to weaken or destroy the strength or vitality of...

Strange choice for a company name!!!

It may not be a good name for a company, but I may have a new word for the

Hi Gregg,

FYI.

Kay
i faxed comments on the CA and note to Heather at Bracewell earlier today. 
Would like to see copies of the LLC Agreement and the propsed guaranty. 

Who from tax and accounting is reviewing this deal?

Is there a reason for member guaranties rather than equity funding agreements 
or note purchase agreements or any other structure?

Is a DASH/GASH prepared?

Who in legal handled the formation of the Enovate entity? [just in case I had 
questions about structure, etc.]

 

I just knew you guys got rain the entire weekend.  I'm glad it worked out 
ok.  I tried calling last night but got a busy signal. 

When Michael's school asked for names/addresses of grandparents, I didn't 
know they were going to send a request for $.  Sorry about that!

We are trying to figure out Paige's plans for Thanksgiving, although I'm 
about to give up on figuring it out. She doesn't know if she can get a ticket 
to the game yet. I'm kinda in the mood to cook, but that's as far as we've 
gotten.  Lisa tells me they may be heading your way on Saturday?  We'll 
probably figure things out in the next few days.

We are waiting to see if I'm going to be in town on Thursday to make plans.  
I haven't been out of town since our anniversary, so it must be time to go 
again!  Generally speaking Neil gets home around 600.

Hope you are enjoying the pretty weather today.  I can sure see along way 
today.

Love,

Kay

Bill and Rita McCall <bmccall@wcnet.net> on 11/06/2000 11:26:49 AM
Good morning. We hope you did not get washed or blown away yesterday. Would
you believe it didn't rain here until last night. We got an inch of rain
then. It did rain a slow drizzle most of the day Saturday. Every thing
worked out great with our company. They fished Friday and we went to Port
Lavaca and Victoria Saturday to some Arts and Craft shows. They could fish
again after we got home. Bobby Clarke's dad is to have the proceduce that
sends dye through the arteries around his heart this morning. He has been
having chest pains. Sallie's mother has had her arteries in her neck
checked out also. Mary's were clear. She is doing fine. I forgot to tell
you we sent money to Michael's school. They will put his name plate in it.
So of course we sent Paige some money also. Do you know your Thanksgiving
plans yet?  I must stop so you can go back to work. Let us know a good time
to call Neil on his birthday. Our Love,Mother

Joel,

Mary Lynn Ruffner has been involved, but to my knowledge has not reviewed the 
documents.  Matt Gockerman handles most of the tax stuff for enovate.

As for the structure, the commercial focus is on keeping things as simple as 
possible.  

If Sarah doesn't have a copy of the LLC agreement, I can get you one.

Lou Stoler was involved in the formation of enovate, although I coordinate 
most of their legal issues now.

I've seem a preliminary DASH, but I don't know where it sits now.

Hope this helps.

Here's what I can give you without talking to anyone:

I am not familiar with the Goldendale turbine (#7 on ENA long list). ENA's 
CTG group lists #7 as being an EECC turbine for Goldendale, not an ENA asset.

I don't know the 2 used GEC turbines (#8 on ENA long list).  

On the EECC long list, #13 (501D5A) is not slated to be used on an an 
ENA/Electrocities project, as LM's are now being considered (guess you knew 
this).

I believe Blue Dog (#14 on EECC list) has been an EECC deal, not an ENA deal; 
I don't know about the Choc. Bayou or Central Iowa projects listed as ENA 
projects.   Maybe these are sleepers.

I can chase down more info, and Sheila probably has  a great deal she can 
tell you just from looking at the list.

payment/termination schedules are not consolidated into one file, I will send 
you a hard copy of this information this afternoon.

Heather and Ozzie
We just concluded a review of the agreement documents and noted all changes,
corrections, etc. to make it in compliance with discussions last Tuesday
which resolved all/most of the business issues. 
 Jackie Scheib has committed to red line the agreement that was sent to us
last night, to be in accordance with our internal review this afternoon, and
to get it out sometime over the weekend to FCE and to Enron.  At the same
time we are trying to finalize the attachments (exhibits) for early next
week. 
I suggest we each review the red line on Monday and set up conf call late
Monday or Tues am to resolve any outstanding business issues or
"wordsmithing", so we can try to get this behind us.

On 10/27/00, VEPCO filed interconnection procedures at FERC (Docket No. 
ER01-247)(Protests due 11/17/00).  These largely mirror CP&L's 
interconnection procedures that were recently approved by FERC.  Therefore, I 
do not think that Enron should protest or intervene.

Customer is required to pay for the cost of a new system impact/facilities 
study if the study information/interconnection/upgrade costs change due to a 
customer higher in the queue losing its queue spot.
System impact studies should take 60 days or less.  Facilities studies should 
take 90 days or less.

Sheila,

I should have sent this to you as well.

Here's a redraft of one letter, second to follow:

Remarketing.

Ross,

The only thought I have with respect to this request would be that it should 
not apply if FCEL has failed to comply with its warranty obligations, or has 
declined to service the modules after the warranty period has expired.

Kay

Jackie, Stephen, Scott, Kay, Heather:

We have an additional item we did not discuss today. We want to add to the
agreement a provision to the effect that: 
   
The Purchaser (include their successors and/or assigns, subcontractors,
vendors, operators, etc.) may not open or in any other manner attempt to
view the interior of the DFC modules without Seller's express written
consent. Failure to comply with this provision would: a) Void all warranties
with respect to the Unit and b) Be considered an automatic violation and
breach of the confidentiality provisions of the agreement and subject to all
remedies for such violation.

Tony: We will also add the same provision to the O&M manuals.

Jackie: Please draft appropriate language for the agreement and include it
in the latest draft of the agreement.

FYI.  The VEPCO attorney said that currently VEPCO is taking about 60 days 
each for the System Impact Study and the Facilities Study.  Because of the 
increase in study requests, VEPCO is filing for 90 days for Fac. Studies, 
below.

Hi Kay.
I undestand that Tim Proffitt is now working on this on the business side.

Mary Lynn Ruffner has been involved, but to my knowledge has not reviewed the 
documents.  Matt Gockerman handles most of the tax stuff for enovate.

As for the structure, the commercial focus is on keeping things as simple as 
possible.  

If Sarah doesn't have a copy of the LLC agreement, I can get you one.

Lou Stoler was involved in the formation of enovate, although I coordinate 
most of their legal issues now.

I've seem a preliminary DASH, but I don't know where it sits now.

Hope this helps.

Kay  

i faxed comments on the CA and note to Heather at Bracewell earlier today. 
Would like to see copies of the LLC Agreement and the propsed guaranty. 

Who from tax and accounting is reviewing this deal?

Is there a reason for member guaranties rather than equity funding agreements 
or note purchase agreements or any other structure?

Is a DASH/GASH prepared?

Who in legal handled the formation of the Enovate entity? [just in case I had 
questions about structure, etc.]

I didn't work on the deal, so I'll have to check around the Legal Dept.

Folks,
We should not be making changes like this at this time.  This clause was
part of the document (terms & conditions) initialed a month ago.
Regards,
Jeff Smith  

His issues need to be communicated directly to Jeffrey Smith at GE so
Jeffrey
Smith can tie in his tax advisors.  Please follow up with this as I am fully
occupied with Genpower for the next few days.   PS  I have asked Kay Mann to
lend a hand closing out the Consolidation Agreement too.

I tried to calling you on your phone, but it does not seem to bew working
right.
Jeff Blumenthal from tax has some final issues we need to discuss in section
5.2.4 of the contract and he will be sending an e-mail describing those
issues
later this morning.  That is the last remaining issue I am aware of before
we
can finalize and sign this contract, unless anything has poipped up the over
the
last couple days from GE. Can we meet this afternoon to arrange the signing
of
this contract with GE.
Please call me back at 3-9548 and let me know.

Thanks,

I'm attaching a revised draft of the option to purchase the land for the 
VEPCO deal.  I've limited it to the land in Edgecombe County, changed the 
initial period to 90 days (with 3 x 90 day renewals).  The price is changed 
to $137,600, as have the option payments ($3500 for each 90 day period).  Is 
there anything else which needs to be changed?

FYI, I've left a message for Dutch Bumgarnder, VEPCO's lawyer, concerning the 
interconnection agreement, and who is doing what.

Thanks,

Hi Kathleen,

I want to get Laura Luce to direct us to give Gregg signing authority.  As 
you know, the request for Ben came from Janet, not Ben. I'll check with her.  
do you have the LLC agreement to see how changes are handled?  If not, you 
can get a copy of my copy.  It is not a standard agreement.

On the CA, please make the effective period two years from the latest 
disclosure of info, and the disclosures will be ongoing. I don't have the CA 
in front of me, but does it say that Peoples has to get their consultants to 
sign a CA as well?  It is a good question.

Ta ta for now,

Kay

   
	
	

Kay,

Gregg posed an interesting question yesterday regarding the Confidentiality 
Agreement.  If Peoples supplies our confidential information to Arthur 
Andersen, and someone from AA tells the world our secrets, would Peoples be 
on the hook pursuant to our CA?  I guess one way we could take care of this 
would be to include Arthur Andersen on Schedule I of the CA as one of 
Peoples' Representatives.  Any thoughts?

Also, I will work on getting Gregg signing authority re his message below.

3) I think we want it to apply to whatever entity employs the individuals 
with access.  Most of these people will probably Peoples Energy Corp. 
employees, but I suppose we could make it also include all of their 
affiliates.  enovate can sign the CA as well, but since enovate doesn't have 
any employees I was assuming we could use Peoples Energy as the responsible 
legal entity.

2) OK
3) Which Peoples is it?  Also, I think enovate should sign at CA.
4)  I sent Heather an email re her availability.  There's a bunch of 
construction near downtown, so I would hesitate to commit to an early call, 
but I know I'm free after 300 tomorrow.

Kay - 

1) Attached is my quick attempt at writing something to make the management 
changes at enovate that we discussed.  Could you please review this and add 
the appropriate legal language.  I don't think that we need any Board 
approval for any of these changes, so is some type of notification sufficient?

2)  I would like to address the idea of signature authorities other than 
Laura at the same time.  My suggestion would be that Richard and myself be 
granted some level of authority to execute CA's, Master Agreements, etc. that 
have been reviewed and approved by legal.  If you can at least pull the 
template you used to get approval for the Director you mentioned and see if 
there would be any changes necessary that would be helpful.

3) I need to get the CA form for the curves and other information started.  
We can discuss this any time you want.

4) What is your availability tomorrow either 8-9:15 or after 3:00 to discuss 
the intercompany loan agreement, and will Heather be available?

I will be leaving around 2:00 for suburban trick or treating.

Thanks,

Gregg 

I'm HERE!!!

How about the reorg?  Mark H looks like he came out great.

Kay-

I will look at your copy of the LLC regarding delegation of powers (or if I 
can't find it, I will get a copy from the Corporate Secretary's office).

The draft CA does not mention Peoples having to get their consultants to sign 
the CA, but I can put something in.

Where are you?  I talked to Carlos today and I believe he will be with us 
soon (if we can hire him).  He is anxiously awaiting your return from NY.

Hi Kathleen,

I want to get Laura Luce to direct us to give Gregg signing authority.  As 
you know, the request for Ben came from Janet, not Ben. I'll check with her.  
do you have the LLC agreement to see how changes are handled?  If not, you 
can get a copy of my copy.  It is not a standard agreement.

On the CA, please make the effective period two years from the latest 
disclosure of info, and the disclosures will be ongoing. I don't have the CA 
in front of me, but does it say that Peoples has to get their consultants to 
sign a CA as well?  It is a good question.

Ta ta for now,

Kay

   
	
	

Kay,

Gregg posed an interesting question yesterday regarding the Confidentiality 
Agreement.  If Peoples supplies our confidential information to Arthur 
Andersen, and someone from AA tells the world our secrets, would Peoples be 
on the hook pursuant to our CA?  I guess one way we could take care of this 
would be to include Arthur Andersen on Schedule I of the CA as one of 
Peoples' Representatives.  Any thoughts?

Also, I will work on getting Gregg signing authority re his message below.

Kathleen - This e-mail should aid in the preparation of the Board 
Resolutions.  The attached file lists the appointment changes.  As for my

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=

efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=

Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=

basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=

in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20

well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=

These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=

Rusty,

Let's meet at your convenience.  We need to identify some of the tripping 
points and critical path items, especially since our goal (I assume) will be 
to keep equipment, EPC contracts, land (?), etc off Enron's balance sheet 
while things are developing.  Talking through the process should help.

Attached is a proposal that was shared with PERC last week.  We are now 
awaiting PERC's response.  I am assuming that they will agree to the terms 
since their alternative is to lose $ on the units at resale with no 
opportunity for recapture.  

I wanted to give you a "heads-up" since the timing will be is tight once I 
get the green light to proceed with legal docs.  Please let me know what 
documents we will need and how you suggest we expedite the process (LOI or 
otherwise).

Calumet Project Participation (with ABB's):
ENA has verbally told them we will not participate in Calumet and the LLC 
term to get to execution has expired.
Upon release by Laura/Ben - need to send them formal notice under the PDA 
that we are withdrawing our notice of interest to participate in Calumet.

Going Forward:
We need to put the general terms in the proposal into a formal document.  
Letter of Intent authorizing us to take control of the development/site sales 
process at our expense - if they the deal unwinds we get reimbursed for our 
direct costs spent to further perfect/sell their sites.
Assess PERC's legal position with ABB (was it fraud or gross negligence that 
ABB failed to mention this problem they've known about for 10 years?).
Authorization/indemnification from PERC to negotiate with ABB to grant 
contract concessions that will benefit Enron Canada as subsequent owner.
Enron Canada will likely be involved as lead negotiater with ABB - who in 
legal will work with ENA/Enron Canada on this ?

Timing:  
Enron Canada - To meet their 2001 schedule we need to have legal 
authorization to engage ABB by early-July.
"Pitch Book" - In its current form includes Calumet/Torrence we need 
authorization from PERC - Bruce is expecting to begin circulation by week of 
July 10th.
EPC contractors -  They bid Calumet using ABB, and we want them to re-bid for 
LM 6000's.  Need authorization from PERC (July 14th or sooner) with cost 
coverage provisions, since the EPC contractors are likely to want to charge 
us $50-$100k to re-bid the deal. 

Attached are two letter our commercial lead on the salt soaked unti wants to 
send.

Jeff,

I don't know if our group needs anyone, but I wanted to pass this resume 
along.  I worked with Carlos when I was at EECC, and I rate him highly.  
He'll take on anything, has good people skills, works hard, and has a varied 
transactional background.  As an added bonus, he is fluent in Spanish.

EECC is being plopped into EES, and Carlos would prefer to make the move to 
ENA (or EA, whatever we are called). He discussed this with Vicky, so she is 
aware that he is checking out opportunities here.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay, as we've discussed before, I'm interested in pursuing the opportunities 
available in the ENA legal group.  As you know, my experience at EECC in 
addition to focusing on traditional EPC contracts and joint venture 
agreements, has also included cross-border financing agreements and merger 
and acquisition activity.  Before coming to Enron as you recall, I worked 
with a New york based firm here in Houston where I focused mostly on 
transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on their transactions 
involving long and short term oil supply agreements and CFE (Mexico's 
electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP projects.  Lastly, 
I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in DC where I focused on 
general domestic corporate transactions such as establishing new business 
entities (ie, joint venture work, partnerships etc.), m & a work, and 
securities offerings.  Thanks for your help.

I don't know numerical addresses, just cross streets.  This week I stayed at 
52nd and Madison, time before I stayed at either 72 or 77th and Madison. 
Madison is close to 5th.  I'm going to guess that he is living above 50th, as 
I had the impression that he was living in a pretty swanky area.

The weather is beautiful here.  Hope it lasts a couple of days.

Neil loves his pig.  I don't think he has picked a place for it yet, though.

Have a great day!

Hi,Kay Kay. Just a note to say have a nice week end. Hope you didn't mind
the pig. If you don't like it you can hide it behind a tree in the yard.
Dad and I were delighted to donate a book to Michael's school. Uncle Bob
and Sharon will be down this weeK end. Joyce and Kenneth Builta are going
to wait until the weather is better. Joyce wants to fish. They are leaving
for New York next Wednesday. Daron lives at 1016 5th Ave. Have you stayed
near there? Must go clean house. We love you, Mother

Thanks for your help.

Due to the sensitivity of the information, we'll be specific.  Also, should 
this be addressed to Bill or Curtis, or someone else?

One quick question - the LLC agreement provides for audit rights in relation 
to all of enovate's business.  Do you think that this CA also covers the 
provision of information for audit purposes?  If not, can we include that in 
this CA or should we have a separate CA for audit?

We can discuss this am.

Here are my comments:

Assignment Language:
in (i) "WestLB" should be changed to "Purchaser"
in (ii) - although this is a business point I think it is important to 
question: why should we provide credit support to the JV/partnership/llc when 
we are required to keep a min. 19.5% interest?  This is not a GE requirement 
and it is a doubling up of Enron-type support which will make the venture 
much more expensive to finance.

Purchase Agreement:
Def. of Business Day:  let's add New York since this is where WestLB funds 
from.
2.1(B):  It should be "Agent's" person to approve change orders, not 
"Purchaser's"
2.2:  "Purchaser" should be used rather than "WestLB" since it is not as 
limiting.
7.1:  Why is the Effective Date backdated to the date of the first option 
agreement execution date?
Exhibit N - Purchase Amount Reconciliation:  The total amount of the three 
purchase amounts is $78M less than the same amounts detailed in the latest 
Option Agreement.  I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of 
the Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option 
Premiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of 
the transformers.

Gentlemen,

I've made some changes to the assignment language of the ABB contract. The 
language is not identical to the LM 6000 language, but is substantially the 
same, and in some respects better.  Please let me know if you have any 
substantive comments:

I am also attaching the current draft of the contract.  It is being revised 
to incorporate delivery dates and to clarify the scope to include 
installation obligations of ABB (haul and install).  Also, in the fourth line 
of the first paragraph, the word "Purchaser" will be added to the 
parenthetical, after "WestLB". Any other changes should be very minor or 
technical.

We are trying to get this finished this week.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions or comments.

Kay

Attached is the latest ABB agreement for your review:

Please call Paul Pipitone (Houston) and Peter Thompson (he's in DC) and ask 
them to call in at 130. I'm not sure Paul will be joining us, but Peter has 
confirmed.  If we are delayed we'll let them know.

How long did you reserved the line?  I can see the call going until 330.

Kay

Kay, Sheila asked me to set up the above-referenced call (you have an email) 
and said you may want some A&K people joining in later in the call.  I don't 
have their names, so I figured you'd call them when you were ready for them.  
Let me know if you want me to give them a time to call and the dial-in 
information.  Thanks, Suz

As usual, the lawyers are the last to know.

Stuart is working on a transaction to sell the asset (Gleason), and therefore 
this ageement needs to be documented asap, which means in the next few days.  
Please review the attached and give me a call.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay -

I've reached a verbal agreement with Westinghouse on the LD issues.  I've 
attached a letter outlining the agreement.  Could you review from a legal 
standpoint?  Call me with questions.

Thanks,

Mitch

Thanks for the info.  I'll give it a look.

I just opened it.  It came in last night.

I wasn't sure from your email if you wanted to review it now, or wait until 
Jackie and I sort through some things.

Kay
Our server is back up - sorry for the delay in your receipt of these
comments which were initially sent out last night.  A message from our
system administrator indicates that Kay already received the message below
but Ross and Jerry did not.  Just to be safe I am resending to all of you.

Here's a rough draft of a different approach to assignment.  Do you think it 
fits with the possible structures?

Kay

Hi Mike,

Since we haven't had any luck hooking up on the telephone, I wanted to 
transmit to you an initial draft of a facility agreement, as contemplated by 
the contract for the transformer packages for the LM's.  I would have sent 
this to Dave, but I don't seem to have his email address.

Since the WestLB financing facility is scheduled to expire soon, we need to 
get the transformers transferred into our new facility, as well as get them 
contractually allocated to various projects.  Please give me a call or have 
Dave call me so that we can handle this as expeditiously as possible.

Thanks,

Kay

Scott,

As I preliminary answer, this language hasn't been approved by Deffner's 
group, although it is based on language they have seen before.  It was my 
understanding that you wanted to keep this deal off their radar screen, as 
you didn't want them entering into the structuring picture until later.  We 
can ask for a blessing on the language, but that will probably lead to 
questions about how the deal will be structured, etc.  I am happy to access 
the resources in their group, however.

FCE hasn't seen any of this language.  It was something I pulled together for 
you to look at.

As for FCE's desire to assign in case of merger, etc, I think the language is 
too broad.  In fact, I think assignment by them should require our consent. 
Otherwise, it needs to be conditioned on the acquiring party to be acquiring 
a bunch of stuff:  the know how, the patent rights, the manufacturing 
facilities, etc.  If they are going to merge with another company or sell 
their shares, they don't need an assignment clause, unless there is something 
peculiar in Conn. law.  They only need assignment language for an asset sale.

Kay

   
	
	

Questions/Comments:

1. How do we handle assignments to state agencies like CRRA...will they be 
rated in the fashion described?
2.  Shouldn't the credit standard only apply if it is an assignment of 
obligations?  Why would this apply if it were only rights?
3.  Isn't #2 the same as #3, except with no specific ownership requirement.  
My reading of #2 is that it allows #3, but #3 narrows #2
4.  My guess is that FCE will want condition 6(a) to apply to all the 
assignments. 
5.  Has anyone from Deffner's group approved this language?
6.  My guess is that FCE will reject this language as being too broad.  Have 
you run it by them?
7.  For condition #1 to apply to CRRA, would we have to assign the agreement 
to CRRA and then to the project financing?  The most likely scenario is this, 
so we should make certain that it can happen under the agreement.
8.  What about the acquisition language that FCE proposed.  Assignment should 
be allowed if Purchaser is acquired.

I don't have a problem with not back dating it. I'll see if there's a 
sesitivity to it from ABB's side.

If possible, regarding comment for section 7.1, could we make the date 
current?  Back dating to the first option agreement may be construed to be a 
deposit.  What do you think?
Here are my comments:

Assignment Language:
in (i) "WestLB" should be changed to "Purchaser"
in (ii) - although this is a business point I think it is important to 
question: why should we provide credit support to the JV/partnership/llc when 
we are required to keep a min. 19.5% interest?  This is not a GE requirement 
and it is a doubling up of Enron-type support which will make the venture 
much more expensive to finance.

Purchase Agreement:
Def. of Business Day:  let's add New York since this is where WestLB funds 
from.
2.1(B):  It should be "Agent's" person to approve change orders, not 
"Purchaser's"
2.2:  "Purchaser" should be used rather than "WestLB" since it is not as 
limiting.
7.1:  Why is the Effective Date backdated to the date of the first option 
agreement execution date?
Exhibit N - Purchase Amount Reconciliation:  The total amount of the three 
purchase amounts is $78M less than the same amounts detailed in the latest 
Option Agreement.  I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of 
the Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option 
Premiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of 
the transformers.

Attached is the latest ABB agreement for your review:

Gentlemen,

Attached are GE's comments which I just received.  They are concerned that we 
tried to improve the contract.  Oh well.

I hope to get this resolved today so we can wrap it up early next week.

Talk to you soon,

Kay

I can assure you that no improvement in the relative risk allocation was 
intended.  They pointed out what appeared to be some disconnects, and in some 
cases I ok'd them putting the suggestions in for discussions purposes.  I 
wasn't trying to play games.

As I fix I was going to offer to let GE pick up 1/2 their bill....

Hi Mark,

I thought I was in my "final" office.  Where am I moving?

Kay

Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The current phase 
of the office construction process is almost finished.  We have been given a 
completion date when (we hope) your new office will be ready of Monday, 
November 20.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move.

FYI,  I expect to be on vacation that week.

Kay

I think your "final" office changed when your group changed - the East 
Origination/Gas Trading Group is in the southeast quadrant of the floor and 
they have given you 3882, just  four doors down the hall from where I am 
now.  The construction workers are gone for the day if you want to stop by 
and see it.

On 11/1/00, FERC Staff issued reports on its Investigation of Bulk Power 
Markets in the Eastern Interconnection.  These reports were the result of a 
Commission order earlier this summer.  Enron's Federal regulatory staff 
(Christi, Charles Yeung, and Sarah Novosel) provided a great deal of 
information for this investigation and Joe Hartsoe and Donna Fulton discussed 
many of the problems with the grid with the new head of Staff, Scott Miller 
(who recently joined FERC from PG&E Gen).    While the Commission is under no 
obligation to take any of Staff's recommendations, the Commission typically 
looks to Staff for guidance on transmission and market issues.  Importantly, 
Staff concludes that the Commission should consider these options for the 
Southeast and Midwest -- all of which Enron has been asking FERC to implement 
for several years:

Reduce the advantages of network service over point to point service by 
requiring that native load be served under the same tariff as other 
transmission services to eliminate the current incentives that VIUs have to 
favor their native load through the calculation of ATC and handling of 
interconnection requests.

While the Staff Hotline is used productively, the Commission can direct Staff 
to conduct formal investigations into entities that have a pattern of 
complaints.

The Commission could require TPs to submit tariff provisions containing a pro 
forma interconnection process specific to interconnection, rather than simply 
relying on the Tennessee Power order that utilizes the OATT timelines and 
procedures.

Require TPs to retain real-time transmission data on market functions 
pertaining to daily load, internal generation to meet that load, and imports 
and exports.

RTOs should submit the basis and methods for calculating ATC and TTC, as well 
as standardized criteria for curtailment.  In addition, since even such 
standardized criteria might not "get to the root of the problem" -- that 
control area still control generation -- the Commission could require that 
each RTO set a date certain by which it will create one control area.  
Regardless of the implementation of these two options, the Commission could 
standardize ATC and TTC methodology.

Staff finds that while electricity is a commodity with market characteristics 
similar to many other commodities, it is still viewed as "different," with a 
reaction of price caps.  Staff encourages that basic decisions about the 
regulatory model be made in order to complete the transition from a 
traditional cost-of-service model to a model that uses markets to price the 
commodity and services.  

DETAILS  (Also, the reports contain good summaries of the generation, 
transmission, state retail, federal reg. and other issues for the region):

Midwest:  The Midwest is dominated by vertically integrated Transmission 
Providers ("TPs") that control transmission, generation and load.  "As such, 
they have weak economic incentives to provide access to transmission service 
to third-parties and strong incentives to favor their own services."  Staff 
received numerous complaints; however, due to the lack of information 
available from TPs, Staff cannot conclude whether these are isolated 
incidents or wide-spread.  At the very least, the complaints indicate a lack 
of confidence in the bulk power market and the ability of market participants 
to rely on transmission access, thus harming the liquidity of the market.  

TLRs are the most important transmission issue in the Midwest, with an 
"enormous" increase in 2000.  The region showed a decline in peak load from 
1999 to 2000 and a growth in new generation since the 1998 price spikes.  
Even though there was an increase in generation and mild weather with 
virtually no price spikes, TLRs climbed to record numbers.  The TLRs were 
highly concentrated:  only 5 flowgates account for 41% of ECAR TLRs and 
another 5 flowgates in MAIN account for 42% in that region.  Notably, even 
though the NERC procedures for Level 3 TLRs mandate transaction curtailment, 
78 of the 191 TLRs in the Midwest do not show any curtailment amount.  The 
total amount of relief that these curtailments are intended to produce are 
not posted.  Staff notes that TLR rules are established by NERC, whose 
procedures are voluntary and not enforced by penalties.  While the Commission 
has required certain NERC standards and procedures to be placed in Open 
Access Transmission Tariffs ("OATT") where the Commission has the power to 
enforce provisions under the Federal Power Act, in practice the Commission 
has generally deferred to NERC on transmission reliability questions, 
including the propriety of TLRs.

TLRs inhibit optimal functioning of the transmission system and market 
because load is not served by the least cost supplier.  TLR procedure is an 
inefficient instrument in mitigating constraints -- curtailment by fiat.  In 
addition, the NERC IDC can result in inappropriate curtailments or increased 
loading on the affected flowgate.  The impact could be mitigated by one 
control area per RTO.

Staff notes that the Midwest state commissions did not petition FERC for 
price caps following the 1998 price spikes.  Some market participants believe 
that the absence of price spikes is the single reason that NUG construction 
increased in the Midwest.  

Market participants must keep track of, and follow, a plethora of information 
in order to make energy deals, submit reservations and provide schedules for 
service.  Staff received many complaints about barriers to transmission 
access, including TLR curtailments and a lack of standardized information and 
protocols, particularly for ATC and interconnection requests, and 
discriminatory conduct.  Unbelievably, key data was unavailable to Staff, 
such coincident peak load data, system-wide snap shots for days when TLRs 
were called, and import/export data.  This lack of data creates a market 
inefficiency, because neither market participants nor regulators can fully 
analyze market conditions in real time.  As such, the market is risk adverse, 
eschewing long-term deals for short-term transactions.  Staff also noted that 
because the Security Coordinators often work for the IOU, there is a mixed 
incentive to enforce reliability on the grid and maximize profit for the 
IOU.  (Staff cites Richard Tabors' paper, "Transmission Markets, Stretching 
the Rules for Fun and Profit.")

Staff cites the lack of information on OASIS or on the NERC web site, 
particularly about real time TLRs and curtailments.  Examples were provided 
to Staff of transmission refusals when there were no TLRs posted and improper 
implementation of TLRs causing substantial financial loss.

The currently proposed Midwest RTOs may mitigate some problems; however, all 
three retain existing control areas with the favortism for generation and 
native load.  These incentives will continue to remain until the RTO 
exercises complete autonomy over transmission control and security 
coordinator functions.  Staff notes that the Midwest is a balkanized region 
of 61 control areas with no uniform method for calculating ATC and CBM.  The 
result is that ATCs can be different on 2 different sides of an interface.  
Staff notes examples in inaccurate ATCs and states that Staff's own ATC audit 
this summer was consistent with market participant complaints.  Staff is 
weighing follow-up options.  The result of these problems is a lack of 
liquidity.

Staff next noted the problems with unfiled "business practices," especially 
on the next hour market.  Staff's audit of OASIS sites revealed several areas 
of non-compliance.  

Information transparency is necessary for a market to function efficiently, 
with equal and timely access to data, including ATC, CBM, TRM, and load flow 
input data.  TPs have incentives to resist efforts to make this information 
transparent because of native load.  This incentive will still exist under 
RTOs if utilities are allowed to calculate their own ATC.  ***  "As a 
consequence, the Commission may wish to eliminate the native load exemption 
and have all transactions under the same tariff."  ***  The Commission could 
benefit by having access to existing transmission data and should require the 
TPs to retain data, including current real-time network status.

Interconnection Issues:  IPPs need to be compensated for VAR support.  Also, 
Staff cites a number of Hotline complaints about TPs seeking large deposits 
or failing to complete System Impact Studies timely.  One solution is to have 
the RTO handle this function to eliminate the disincentive the utilities have 
against IPPs.  The current practice of requiring IPPs to deal with a wide 
variety of procedures inhibits the free flow of transactions within the 
region.

Network service has inherent advantages over point-to-point, citing the 
Entergy source and sink order.  The Commission has relied on "passively" 
receiving informal and formal complaints to determine if discriminatory 
behavior has occurred rather than actively canvassing market participants.  
While Staff cannot conclude that discriminatory practices are widespread, 
there is evidence of discriminatory instances.

Southeast:  The traditional vertically integrated utility ("VIU") model has 
largely persisted in the SE.  This continued control has vastly reduced the 
economic incentives to facilitate IPP activities.  In many cases, the VIUs 
have dampened IPP involvement without violating any Commission regulation due 
to the inherent flexibility of the current rules.

Staff cites examples of delays in performing system impact studies, 
transmission hoarding in the name of serving native load growth and 
manipulation of ATC.  TPs have shown little inclination to improve the 
transmission system and use many TLRs.

There is also a lack of market information that has stymied the development 
of markets in the SE.  ATCs change constantly that leads to uncertainty and 
there is no clearinghouse for electric power prices.

TVA, despite having taken steps to participate in reformed markets, has acted 
as a bulwark against the development of competitive energy markets in the 
SE.  This is significant because of TVA's size and location.  IPPs have 
reported TVA's discouragement of siting in TVA through excessive time to 
perform studies, excessive fees, and rejection of requests to perform 
interconnection studies.

In addition, Staff cites the Florida Sup. Ct. decision against merchant 
plants as significantly impeding the competitive market in Florida.

Staff discusses the significant flow of power from the Midwest to the SE this 
summer.  Much of this resulted from the import of cheaper coal power, than 
the use of gas fired peakers due to higher gas prices.  Peak prices were 
radically lower this summer because utilities appear to have been better 
prepared for peak events through the use of forward contracts, increased 
generation capacity on line and reduced number of forced outages.  

SE utilities reported that they have not used market-based rates to 
extensively increase sales.  (Less used than in the midwest.)

The SE region lacks information, which has retarded the Staff's efforts to 
discern the truth about the numerous complaints about transmission in the SE 
(including ATC and TLRs).  Market participants seem to have less confidence 
in the SE market than in any other market region.  This appears to be 
justified based on Staff's investigations.  This lack of confidence 
discourages investment and participation in the markets.  Staff concludes 
that the Commission may need to be more prescriptive in terms of how 
transmission is allocated in the SE RTOs, since there are market concerns 
that the incumbents will continue to dominate operations.  The investigation 
found numerous problems in bad ATCs and TTCs and poor OASIS postings.  In 
addition, several OASIS audit logs actually erased historical data.  Staff 
thinks that additional affiliate transaction information should be posted.  
Staff could not obtain summer demand data and the Commission's lack of 
jurisdiction over TVA made it difficult to obtain transmission access 
information.

The Staff investigation revealed unclear interconnection procedures and lack 
of adherence to schedules and arbitrary cost estimates and deposits.  In 
addition, the TPs have reserved a huge amount of network transmission 
capacity, much of it reserved shortly after the IPP approached the TP to 
interconnect.  Staff cites the recent Skygen order in which Southern denied 
Skygen's request for transmission stating that the only option was the 
construction of an 80 mile 500 kv line that would take 8 years to complete.  
Staff solutions include allowing network requests by IPPs and limiting 
self-build capacity in the incumbent's territory.

ATC variations are a big problem in the SE.  SERC coordination of a 
standardized ATC is a long process and may not be resolved soon without 
direction from the Commission.  An improved method and improved communication 
are needed.

The SE experienced a 354% increase in TLRs this summer.  This increase raises 
the issue of whether curtailment has become an impediment to the competitive 
operation of the market in the SE.  Staff cites information provided by 
Charles Y. that an Ameren TLR was not implemented according to NERC 
criteria.  Staff also wonders if transmission is being oversold since TPs do 
not generally refund transmission revenues when TLRs are implemented.  RTOs 
must have a broad geographic area to internalize much of the constraints.  In 
addition, RTOs will adopt pricing mechanisms that obviate recourse to TLRs.  
However, if control areas are retained, VIUs will retain mixed incentives.

*** As noted in the Midwest report, the manner in which load is calculated 
weighs heavily on the value of this information.  This is an issue that the 
formation of RTOs may not resolve.  Eliminating native load exceptions -- ie, 
treating all load equally -- and placing all transactions under the same 
tariff may be an option that provides the right incentives for the provision 
of transparent and standardized information.

Finally, Staff describes specific problems with TVA and FP&L, TVA is a 
"problem area" for the Eastern Interconnect grid.  TVA is a transmission 
bottleneck due to the many TLRs called this summer.  The current federal law 
and lack of Commission jurisdiction are impediments to the development of 
deep and robust power markets in this area.  TVA simply has no strong 
incentive to provide effective and efficient transmission service.  In 
addition, the Commission does not have full information on TVA.  Staff lists 
a number of complaints against TVA, including unjustifiably increasing the 
tag deadline and allowing TVA Marketing, but not others, to sink and park 
power.  Staff concludes that recent proposals by TVA to enhance the 
development of markets and its system do not appear to have great potential.

A Staff audit of FP&L revealed violations of standards of conduct, including 
confidential information on FP&L's transmission system (including interchange 
information for other entities) posted on EMS systems that were available to 
FPL's merchant function.  Staff's report found that FP&L does not have an 
established procedure for review of EMS to ensure that information is not 
displayed in error.  It is "up to individual Managers discretion."  ((FRCC 
web site report dated 9/8/00)).  Violations such as these undermine 
competition.

The reports are attached below.

Hi Jeff and Barbara,

I would really like to stay where I am, if possible.  I like being close to 
Suzanne, not to mention the good neighbors and the benefit of facing the wall.

Thanks,

Kay
Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The current phase 
of the office construction process is almost finished.  We have been given a 
completion date when (we hope) your new office will be ready of Monday, 
November 20.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move.

We had a very good work session with GE today to iron out the details of the 
break out contract.  We expect to have a draft on Monday, which should be 
close to final as far as the form goes.  I have also asked A & K to prepare a 
memo outlining what will need to be done on a project basis to complete the 
document.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kay

Barbara has asked that I submit a weekly report about what I'm working on.  I 
haven't had time to fix up anything pretty, but I'll give you the big ticket 
items:

Fuel Cell Energy/CRRA transaction.  Enron owns equity and holds warrants for 
Fuel Cell stock.  We need to sell 55 mw of fuel cells in order to get the 
benefit of the warrants.  The commercial team is  working on a deal to place 
50 mw with the Connecticut Resource Recovery Authority, a state agency.  I 
have been working feverishly on the equipment contract, and we recently 
completed the LOI with CRRA.  We need to move to more definitive docs with 
CRRA, and the structuring isn't complete. The decision about whether the 
state will fund the project is expected in December.  This deal is likely to 
continue to take up a large amount of  my time, and requires a fair amount of 
travel, as I am involved in direct negotiations.  This transaction is on Dave 
D and Janet D's radar screen, and  Mark is familiar with it.  The potential 
upside (in a perfect world), is rumored to be in the nine figure range.

Turbopark.  Turbopark is the latest financing vehicle for power projects.  
Enron is moving 20+ turbines into Turbopark in the next 45 days.  This 
requires a series of contracts with GE (at least 6) which I am working on.  
We also have to move transformers into this facility, so I have been in 
contact with ABB concerning same.  

GE general.  ENA is attempting to negotiate a standard contract with GE.  
I've been working with Sheila on this one.  We are committed to finish this 
project by the end of this year.

Westinghouse warranty issues.  ENA has two significant disputes wiht 
Westinghouse concerning a couple of turbines.  I'm riding herd on resolving 
the issues.

VEPCO.  We were attempting to negotiate a PPA with Virginia Power, but ran 
into some problems, so it won't close this year.  Theres' some miscellaneous 
follow up work to do.

Illinois development.  I'm supporting the devolopers who are developing power 
plant sites in Illinois.

Enron/Peoples joint venture.  I'm working with the Enron commercial team in 
certain matters relating to getting the joint venture up and running.

This gives at least an overview of what I'm spending most of my time on.
.

If it says Austin, it must be yours....

Kay
Mike:

Attached is a draft letter which provides authorization to ABB for the haul & 
install option at Austin.

After it has been signed, please send me a copy for my files.

Thank you.
Kathy

Lisa,

Thank you for the timely comments.

Credit support.  On the issue of credit support for a project company 
partially owned by Enron, ABB has some concerns even when Enron still holds 
an equity interest due to some late payment problems they had in the past 
with an Enron project company.  Also, the ABB and GE payment schedules are 
different, with GE being more front end loaded. For example, GE will have 
received 45% of the total payments due by the time the first 4 units are 
ready to ship; by the time the last 6 units are ready to ship, they will have 
received 95% of the payment.  In contrast, we hold 25% of the price of each 
ABB unit until delivery (15%) and acceptance (10%) of that particular unit.

Effective date.  The typical reason for an earlier effective date is to 
capture any work which ABB may have chosen to do during the option period in 
order to hold their guaranteed completion dates.  In the GE contract we 
addressed the issue in section 30.3, stating that it governs all work 
performed pursuant to the agreement in principle. It is fine with me to make 
the effective date a current one.

 Price change. I will confirm why the prices changed $78,000 from the latest 
option agreement. I suspect there were changes in the specifications since 
the data sheets have changed.  

Hope this was helpful.

Kay

   

Here are my comments:

Assignment Language:
in (i) "WestLB" should be changed to "Purchaser"
in (ii) - although this is a business point I think it is important to 
question: why should we provide credit support to the JV/partnership/llc when 
we are required to keep a min. 19.5% interest?  This is not a GE requirement 
and it is a doubling up of Enron-type support which will make the venture 
much more expensive to finance.

Purchase Agreement:
Def. of Business Day:  let's add New York since this is where WestLB funds 
from.
2.1(B):  It should be "Agent's" person to approve change orders, not 
"Purchaser's"
2.2:  "Purchaser" should be used rather than "WestLB" since it is not as 
limiting.
7.1:  Why is the Effective Date backdated to the date of the first option 
agreement execution date?
Exhibit N - Purchase Amount Reconciliation:  The total amount of the three 
purchase amounts is $78M less than the same amounts detailed in the latest 
Option Agreement.  I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of 
the Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option 
Premiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of 
the transformers.

Gentlemen,

I've made some changes to the assignment language of the ABB contract. The 
language is not identical to the LM 6000 language, but is substantially the 
same, and in some respects better.  Please let me know if you have any 
substantive comments:

I am also attaching the current draft of the contract.  It is being revised 
to incorporate delivery dates and to clarify the scope to include 
installation obligations of ABB (haul and install).  Also, in the fourth line 
of the first paragraph, the word "Purchaser" will be added to the 
parenthetical, after "WestLB". Any other changes should be very minor or 
technical.

We are trying to get this finished this week.  Please let me know if you have 
any questions or comments.

Kay

Attached is the latest ABB agreement for your review:

1100 is just fine.  

We are all so dependent on our computers, I can hardly remember what we did 
in the "old days".

Kay

I should have the revised agreement to you by 11 AM CST.  I had hoped to
have it to you earlier, but we have experienced some technical
difficulties as a result of the conversion of our system over the
weekend.

so please let me know if you can't get them printed soon.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi Mitch,

Hi John,

Thanks for your call the other day.  The team is currently focused on getting 
the funding approved, as you can see from the attached.  Also, we have had 
some discussions with Fuel Cells about the contract to purchase the 
equipment.  I expect to forward a draft to you soon for a sanity check.  It 
may be a Connecticut law contract due to the State's involvement.  The next 
big item will be the project development agreement.  The tax credit 
monetization is still on the horizon, and if the funding approval is granted, 
we will want to talk about your sense of how that might work.

Again, thanks for checking  in.

Here's how it is shaping up:

We have a fence appointment for noon, the Wednesday before Thanksgiving.  
That is the first opening, but there is always a chance of a cancellation. 
Just in case there is an earlier opening, the utility people will be out 
tomorrow. Therefore, we need to have BOTH dogs put up tomorrow, and the gate 
open.

We have a noon appointment with John Foster THIS Wednesday.  There is a $20 
consulting fee.  This is the same day Michael's class sings in chapel at 115, 
so this isn't too bad.  I have a 130 staff meeting, but maybe I can miss it.  
The work will NOT be done that day, as far as I know.

If we have  a hope of leaving town the week of Thanksgiving, we need a 
reservation at the kennel.  Do we have one yet?  I would say we might want 
one Fri and Sat night. Also, we might want to consider boarding Jack this 
week for a couple of days, so we don't have to do the crate trip.  We should 
be ok Saturday-Wednesday, since I'm planning on being home, and Paige will be 
home on Tuesday.

Kay

Rusty,

Let's meet at your convenience.  We need to identify some of the tripping 
points and critical path items, especially since our goal (I assume) will be 
to keep equipment, EPC contracts, land (?), etc off Enron's balance sheet 
while things are developing.  Talking through the process should help.

Attached is a proposal that was shared with PERC last week.  We are now 
awaiting PERC's response.  I am assuming that they will agree to the terms 
since their alternative is to lose $ on the units at resale with no 
opportunity for recapture.  

I wanted to give you a "heads-up" since the timing will be is tight once I 
get the green light to proceed with legal docs.  Please let me know what 
documents we will need and how you suggest we expedite the process (LOI or 
otherwise).

Calumet Project Participation (with ABB's):
ENA has verbally told them we will not participate in Calumet and the LLC 
term to get to execution has expired.
Upon release by Laura/Ben - need to send them formal notice under the PDA 
that we are withdrawing our notice of interest to participate in Calumet.

Going Forward:
We need to put the general terms in the proposal into a formal document.  
Letter of Intent authorizing us to take control of the development/site sales 
process at our expense - if they the deal unwinds we get reimbursed for our 
direct costs spent to further perfect/sell their sites.
Assess PERC's legal position with ABB (was it fraud or gross negligence that 
ABB failed to mention this problem they've known about for 10 years?).
Authorization/indemnification from PERC to negotiate with ABB to grant 
contract concessions that will benefit Enron Canada as subsequent owner.
Enron Canada will likely be involved as lead negotiater with ABB - who in 
legal will work with ENA/Enron Canada on this ?

Timing:  
Enron Canada - To meet their 2001 schedule we need to have legal 
authorization to engage ABB by early-July.
"Pitch Book" - In its current form includes Calumet/Torrence we need 
authorization from PERC - Bruce is expecting to begin circulation by week of 
July 10th.
EPC contractors -  They bid Calumet using ABB, and we want them to re-bid for 
LM 6000's.  Need authorization from PERC (July 14th or sooner) with cost 
coverage provisions, since the EPC contractors are likely to want to charge 
us $50-$100k to re-bid the deal. 

Here's the blacklined version.

Greetings,

I'm working with Sheila Tweed and others at ENA and EECC in developing a more 
standardized contract with GE for equipment purchases.  The goal is to 
develop a more efficient contracting process, and to avoid negotiating the 
same  points repeatedly, with varying results among business units.  Sheila 
has suggested that I drop you a line to see if this is something you might 
find interesting and/or helpful.

You now have my email address, and my phone number is 713 345 7566.  Please 
let me know your thoughts about participating in the process.

Thank you,

Kay

Thanks!

Hi Peter,

When do you  think we will have a pretty compared document?

Thanks,

Kay

Scott,

Here are letters to Westinghouse, as revised to reflect our comments.

Kay

For your reading pleasure...

Lisa,

Thank you for the timely comments.

Credit support.  On the issue of credit support for a project company 
partially owned by Enron, ABB has some concerns even when Enron still holds 
an equity interest due to some late payment problems they had in the past 
with an Enron project company.  Also, the ABB and GE payment schedules are 
different, with GE being more front end loaded. For example, GE will have 
received 45% of the total payments due by the time the first 4 units are 
ready to ship; by the time the last 6 units are ready to ship, they will have 
received 95% of the payment.  In contrast, we hold 25% of the price of each 
ABB unit until delivery (15%) and acceptance (10%) of that particular unit.

Effective date.  The typical reason for an earlier effective date is to 
capture any work which ABB may have chosen to do during the option period in 
order to hold their guaranteed completion dates.  In the GE contract we 
addressed the issue in section 30.3, stating that it governs all work 
performed pursuant to the agreement in principle. It is fine with me to make 
the effective date a current one.

 Price change. I will confirm why the prices changed $78,000 from the latest 
option agreement. I suspect there were changes in the specifications since 
the data sheets have changed.  

Hope this was helpful.

Kay

   

Here are my comments:

Assignment Language:
in (i) "WestLB" should be changed to "Purchaser"
in (ii) - although this is a business point I think it is important to 
question: why should we provide credit support to the JV/partnership/llc when 
we are required to keep a min. 19.5% interest?  This is not a GE requirement 
and it is a doubling up of Enron-type support which will make the venture 
much more expensive to finance.

Purchase Agreement:
Def. of Business Day:  let's add New York since this is where WestLB funds 
from.
2.1(B):  It should be "Agent's" person to approve change orders, not 
"Purchaser's"
2.2:  "Purchaser" should be used rather than "WestLB" since it is not as 
limiting.
7.1:  Why is the Effective Date backdated to the date of the first option 
agreement execution date?
Exhibit N - Purchase Amount Reconciliation:  The total amount of the three 
purchase amounts is $78M less than the same amounts detailed in the latest 
Option Agreement.  I'd like to understand why this is, especially in light of 
the Effective Date in 7.1, to insure that AA won't determine that the Option 
Premiums paid were somehow a deposit or credit toward the purchase price of 
the transformers.

I got lots done Saturday, but I can't remember what!  You know how that 
goes.  I bought a few Christmas presents, which felt good.  I went to the 
grocery store and spent lots of time without rushing.  That felt decadent.

We didn't get hit too badly.  Jack ran off during the worst part of the 
storm, scaring Neil and I horribly.  A  neighbor brought him back.  We are 
having an electronic fence installed soon, so I hope that will help.  

I'm glad Michael got to see Uncle Bob.  He was very impressed that his name 
was so close to Uncle Bobby's.  

I'm guessing that we may come down for a day or two next week.  Sorry I can't 
get organized.

Hope you are enjoying better weather today!

best behavior[Neil also]. Uncle Bob was so glad to see them. After they
left he was sorry he had not taken a picture of them. We enjoyed their
visit. They left to go home this morning. Did you get any shopping done
this week end? Did you have a bad storm at your house last night? We just
had rain. Let us know your plans for the holidays when you can see Paige's
plans. We understand. Love you,Mother

I thought I had sent it out on Friday, but I had just saved it as a draft.  
Must have been the full moon.

Hi Heather, Jeff and Ozzie,

The only issue I have with the testimony is the statement that the units are 
"extremely quiet".  At this point FCE will only guaranty 60dba, which some 
folks might not consider to be extremely quiet depending on how close a 
facility is to their house.  You may have determined that the noise level 
will be some number less than 60 dba so that the guaranty level does not 
reflect the expected noise level.

Your suggestion is probably cheaper for Enron!

Tell them to reverse the CompareWrite and redo (should be an easy fix).
Otherwise, we can just agree to all of GE's suggested changes and call it a
day!

Hi, Kay:

One of the invoices relates to a matter entitled, Preparation of Form TU, 
dated July 31, 2000.

The invoice number is 10103851 and the amount is $25,165.00.

Have you seen or do you recall this invoice?  If so, would you happen to know 
where I might find a copy?

Thanks, a million,

received the defective versions.

Last night I reviewed the last blackline that I forwarded to you

changes made to the text.  I have asked our IT Department to send the
document to our outside vendor who handles problems such as this.  I
again apologize for the delay in getting a workable blackline.

Gentlemen,

Things are heating up, no pun intended. Therefore, it would be helpful if you 
would prepare a closing list for the GE turbines moving out of WestLB.  I 
know it is short, but I thrive on lists.

I cannot tell you how many calls I've swapped with ABB's rep about that 
contract, without ever hooking up.  I see that we will be facing a fire drill 
quickly in getting at least some of these transformers into the right 
financing vehicle.  Therefore, please prepare a list of site specific issues 
for that document as well.

Thanks,

Kay

FYI.
Please keep me updated as well on the expected timing for bringing the LM 
6000s into the new So American structure.  It needs to be done soon in order 
to attract the club banks by year end.  Thanks!

	Roseann Engeldorf@ENRON
	11/14/2000 11:54 AM
		 
Ben and Brett -

I do not know your target timing to move the LMs; however, you need to be 
aware that funding from the bank structure to pay for them requires that we 
go through a full second closing process.  It may take several days to pull 
together all the documents and information needed for this closing - we will 
have to deliver Brazil counsel opinions, Cayman counsel opinions, another A&K 
opinion and deliver a multitude of other corporate and security documents too 
boring to list here. 

So - as soon as:

1)  the break-out contract is ready; 

2) GE is on board; and 

3) ESA, ENA and WLB have signed off on the purchase option transfer 
document(s) (which must include Matt,  Mary Kimball and Mary Cilia 
sign-off),  

we can finalize the "second closing" docs for the bank - we have already 
started on them, but it will take a focused effort to finish them and receive 
all signatures necessary.  

Ben and Brett must let Rob Taylor of A&K - at 713-220-4436 know when the 
above items are complete - he will need to coordinate with the team to push 
for final docs.

Lisa Alfaro - will you please coordinate with Rob Taylor at the above number 
and Frederico Porto at A&K in Dallas at 214-659-4447 on the Brazil-based 
issues? 
 
I also ask that Ben and Brett be available to the deal team to consult and 
answer questions as necessary.

I am going to be out of town for a week on another year-end deal and will 
check my voice mails regularly.   My assistant, Melba Trevino at 835-7664 
will have my contact details.

Please call Rob, me or Tammy (345-3870) with any questions.

I've been trying to figure out what is meant by the last sentence. Can you 
(or Dave) clarify what is wanted?  Does it mean that payments must be current 
for the guaranty, etc, to be acceptable?

Thanks,

Kay

Dear Team,
Dave mentioned that probably the only other change would be in the assignment
section article xxii and that should not be any big change.

MIKE
Security Level:?         Internal

Mike,
     When  we  spoke  this morning, Dave advised that one change to the 
language
that  will  be  required is  the addition of the words in red , in bold added 
by
ABB at the end of this paragraph in section 22.2 of the contract.

     In  the  case of an assignment to a party described in (ii), (vi), or 
(vii)
(other  than   Enron  Engineering  &  Construction  or  NEPCO),  Seller shall 
be
entitled  to  request  and  receive  an  appropriate guaranty, letter of 
credit,
payment  bond  or  other  reasonable  form of payment security, in amount not 
to
exceed the amount of the Purchase Amount remaining to be paid at the time of 
the
assignment,  unless  the  assignor  agrees  to  remain  liable  for  all  
future
liabilities  under  this  Agreement.  A letter of guaranty, letter of credit, 
or
payment bond provided by an entity rated BBB+ or better shall be deemed to be 
an
appropriate  form  of  security  for  the purpose of this provision , so long 
as
payment  in  full  has  been  made  in accordance with the schedule set forth 
in
Article VI.

     Additional commentary may come later today when Dave reaches his first 
stop
on his flight back to Raliegh.

okey dokey

Kay - I know ENA is planning to hand the breakout K to ESA as a done deal, 
but Lisa Alfaro really should at least get a look at the assignment 
provisions so Brett and Enron can know what his constraints are with respect 
to a possible sale of all the SA assets, as well as the ease with which they 
can go into the Elektrobolt project.  

Could you send that portion of the contract to her?

I have asked Lisa and Brett to confirm that their understanding about the 
deal is the same as  Ben's.

Rose:

Sheila provided final comments on the option agreement a couple of days ago. 
I believe it's in Lisa Alfaro's court.

GE is on board, and I think the final breakout contract should be completed 
this week. Kay Mann / Sheila Tweed are coordinating with GE, and I will defer 
to them on this point.

I think that's it. 

Regards,

Ben

Ben and Brett -

I do not know your target timing to move the LMs; however, you need to be 
aware that funding from the bank structure to pay for them requires that we 
go through a full second closing process.  It may take several days to pull 
together all the documents and information needed for this closing - we will 
have to deliver Brazil counsel opinions, Cayman counsel opinions, another A&K 
opinion and deliver a multitude of other corporate and security documents too 
boring to list here. 

So - as soon as:

1)  the break-out contract is ready; 

2) GE is on board; and 

3) ESA, ENA and WLB have signed off on the purchase option transfer 
document(s) (which must include Matt,  Mary Kimball and Mary Cilia 
sign-off),  

we can finalize the "second closing" docs for the bank - we have already 
started on them, but it will take a focused effort to finish them and receive 
all signatures necessary.  

Ben and Brett must let Rob Taylor of A&K - at 713-220-4436 know when the 
above items are complete - he will need to coordinate with the team to push 
for final docs.

Lisa Alfaro - will you please coordinate with Rob Taylor at the above number 
and Frederico Porto at A&K in Dallas at 214-659-4447 on the Brazil-based 
issues? 
 
I also ask that Ben and Brett be available to the deal team to consult and 
answer questions as necessary.

I am going to be out of town for a week on another year-end deal and will 
check my voice mails regularly.   My assistant, Melba Trevino at 835-7664 
will have my contact details.

Please call Rob, me or Tammy (345-3870) with any questions.

Rose

fyi

Gentlemen,

Things are heating up, no pun intended. Therefore, it would be helpful if you 
would prepare a closing list for the GE turbines moving out of WestLB.  I 
know it is short, but I thrive on lists.

I cannot tell you how many calls I've swapped with ABB's rep about that 
contract, without ever hooking up.  I see that we will be facing a fire drill 
quickly in getting at least some of these transformers into the right 
financing vehicle.  Therefore, please prepare a list of site specific issues 
for that document as well.

Thanks,

Kay

Mike Sandridge and I finally spoke on the phone.  Here are the issues which 
need to be addressed to keep things moving:

1. Which transformers go where?

2. How do we deal with the two cancelled units and any cancellation charges?

3. ABB has not had a good experience with an Enron LLC arrangement, and the 
contract allows for them to request payment security.  Unless they are 
convinced that they aren't at risk, they will want some form of payment 
security.  The contract does allow for the equipment to be paid off (except 
retainage) to facilitate the assignment.

Mike is available Thursday to discuss these issues, and how to get the break 
out contracts closed. I'm available any time.

Kay

Are you going to get a Palm Pilot?

Paul/Peter,

Me again.  I have a meeting with ABB for Thursday.  Could you make me a list 
of issues like you did with the GE contract (removing the comments from the 
text), and blackline the new clean "commentless" version against the original 
master contract.

Thank you,

Kay

Here's something to look at.

I'm heading out soon for Master Whalley's birthday party at the Houstonian, 
but I'll check messages later today.

Kay

fyi.  I'm printing.

Kay
The following documents are attached:

1)  Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement between enovate and PetroCanada.  I 
have made the following changes to Mary's document:
 a) effective date of November 1st, 2000 to coincide with the start of the 
transaction,
 b) notification for nominations/confirmations, and 
 c) signature line from enovate to enovate by Enron MW.

Jeff - Can you please print out two copies of this document, initial and have 
your assistant deliver them to Janet for execution.  Janet will be leaving 
for the management conference on Wednesday around noon so the earlier in the 
morning the better.  I will then have Janet's assistant get them back to me 
for delivery to PetroCanada.

2)  Audit Waiver

Kay - Can you please print out two copies, initial and I suppose your 
assistant can coordinate with Jeff's to make the delivery to Janet.  I will 
take care of getting Bill's signature.

Thank you both for your assistance.  Any questions or comments, let me know.

Gregg

Here's what I have on the open issues/ to do list:

Resolve shipping/delivery obligations in accordance with option agreement; 
conform contract
Confirm pricing
Add schedule of delivery dates
Finalize assignment language (I sent Mike an email with a question about 
their request)
Agree on effective date: suggest signing date be whatever it is (hope for 
tomorrow) with effective date being the last day of last option
Need estimated price per month to store (a request from Finance for budget 
purposes)
Verify sales tax exemption with WestLB (doesn't require ABB involvement, nor 
does it need to be done before contract is signed)
Need assignment of option (Finance to provide - no ABB action, I'll follow up)

Kathy:  do you have anything to add? Are there any technical details left to 
resolve?

Ben, anything to add?

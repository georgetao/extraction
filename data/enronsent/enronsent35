Tanya:  the Morgan lawyer called about putting ISDA Master Agreements in 
place with the following Enron entities:

Enron Canada Corp.
She indicated that guaranties were all about to expire in June.
All of Morgan's commodity business is being centralized in the above Morgan 
entity.
Please let me know how you are going to handle this in case Beth Ng calls me 
back.  Thanks.  Sara

Jeff Sorenson would like the meeting on May 12 to be from 11:30a to 1p.

Mark:  I know that David Minns has been sending copies of executed agreements 
to Alan.  These include ISDA Master Agreements and brokerage (futures) 
agreements executed in the name of Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd.  We need 
to incorporate these agreements into Lotus Notes and David Minns needs to 
have access to our database.  Do you want to speak with Alan or should I?  
Also, on a related issue, do we need to keep copies of the ECTRIC Master 
Agreements in Houston?  Would this be necessary in an emergency situation?  
Thanks.  Sara

I've checked my notes and spoken to Heidi and it appears the delay was 
settling the mark up (107.5%) in the Agreement. Heidi believes that this 
figure can be reduced to 100% (which is current practice). If everyone is 
agreeable I will arrange execution.

09/18/99 06:32 AM
Attached please find my mark-up of the Australian Services Agreement. I have 
attached a blacklined version for ease of reference. 

Apart from changing the name from ECT to ENA, I have modified clause 1 in 
Schedule 1 to more accurately reflect the intended products.

Please call me if any questions. 

Many thanks, 

Shari

Do you have the short information sheet/request that you threw together for 
Enron company requests for brokerage agreements?  This would be helpful when 
we meet.  I am shooting for Friday at 10 am.  Thanks.  Sara

For the time being Sara is handling the Swap Master Agreements for South 
America since they are ENA transactions.

Attached is credit terms for Capex master trading contract (per Julian's 
request).

Andrea,

I hoped your credit questions were answered concerning adequately in the 
recent contract negotiations with Pluspetrol.  I apologize if I wasn't 
sufficiently responsive.  I'm working on unloading other responsibilities so 
that I can focus purely on Southern Cone.  

Rod

Left you a voice mail. Check with Stacy or Jeff.  Is Janice back?

   
	
	

Sara, Janice:

I'm not sure which, if either, of you will work with us on this.  We are 
under a somewhat rigid timeline though.  OPP is flying up from Brazil on Mon 
July 12 to hopefully finalize overall agreement in principle on the 
"Contingent Buyer" transaction terms.  We'd like to finalize our response to 
a confidentiality agrement by Wed 7/7 and send back to OPP for signature.  
From what we see in the document looks like we need to:

work on the wording of the preamble
make "two-way" protecting our terms and conditions etc.
add agreement term
add "confidentiality" term
define "products"
require their signature

Comments???

Thanks,

Doug

P.S.  This transaction has about $5 million in value to Enron.  Thanks for 
your urgent attention.

Douglas,
Attached please find the confidentiality agreement that will cover
information received by Enron from OPP in connection with the proposed
transaction. Please review and then send to OPP. Please fax me a copy of the
signed confidentiality agreement as well so that I can send you all the
information that you requested regarding OPP.

Paul:  Enjoyed your talk in San Antonio.  Now for the real issues:  could you 
send to me the confirmation templates that you have devised for credit 
derivatives in the UK?  Also, are there any other materials which might be 
helpful in the credit derivatives area?  Shari has passed this on to me and 
I'm reviewing a couple of Deutsche Bank transactions executed last month.  
Thanks.  Sara

David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

Attached is the Aquila/ENA weather HDD confirmation. A couple of points to 
note.

The Aquila company listed on the Confirmation is the one having an ISDA with 
Enron. I'm not sure if ENA is the Enron counterparty.
If we elect we can put a specific payment date in or just leave it to as 20 
Business Days after the Floating Amount is detetmined.
If there is an Aquila/ENA ISDA then that should be referenced  in Paragraph 1.

Will you pass it on

Marty:  I will have a response to setoff shortly.  With respect to the CSA 
and calculation of the "Credit Support Amount," our change should not create 
any inconsistencies in the calculation of that amount among your 
counterparties since it would only change IF the calculation yielded a 
negative number.  The only reason for "specifying otherwise" in Paragraph 13 
is to capture the situation where the Pledgor MIGHT be holding Independent 
Amounts (if there are ever any specified in a particular Transaction) of the 
Secured Party as cushion (which is not meant to be returned until termination 
of Transactions) and subtraction of that amount would create a negative 
number when calculating the Credit Support Amount.  By specifying that the 
Credit Support Amount will be "the higher of" the amount calculated (deemed 
to be zero if a negative number) or the sum of the Pledgor's Independent 
Amounts, the latter would prevail.  This calculation method will make a 
difference if, for example, the Secured Party asks for a Return Amount when 
the Pledgor intends to retain any Independent Amounts as cushion (such that 
only Posted Credit Support exceeding the sum of the Independent Amounts will 
be returned).  I hope this helps.  Sara

Marty_Oelmann@cargill.com on 04/18/2000 04:53:26 PM
     Hi Sara,
     Confirming or conversation, only 2 issues remain unresolved.

     1.  Please remove subclause (B) in Part 5(g) Setoff.  As we discussed,
         this contemplates including all kinds of "obligations of any kind
         whatsoever" and it is our intent to include only Energy trading
         under this Agreement.

     2.  Please explain the reasoning for modifying the definition of
         "Credit Support Amount" in Paragraph 13(b)(C) of the Credit
         Support Annex.  We would prefer to retain the intent of ISDA's
         definition to maintain consistency in the way this amount is
         determined among our counterparties.

     Thank you for all your assistance and I look forward to receiving
     execution copies of the Agreement if these two issues can be resolved.

     Best regards,
     Marty Oelmann

recommend, if this hasn't already been done, that legal bless the guaranty 
language by Conectiv.

take a look at this document today?   Thanks!

FYI (just thoughts ...)
D'Arcy Carroll
04/19/2000 01:51 PM
Group - we need to address the due diligence for executing the " first " 
physical option transactions in Brasil and for Direct Sales ( and Wholesale 
).  The initial industrial candidates are: 

Owens Corning ( 1.6MWs firm ). 1 site,  peaking unit.  break-even R$182/MW - 
5 year term
Carbocloro ( 10 MWs firm ). 1 site 3rd part re-sale(Copel) , monthly call 
option. supplanting product sales, estimate minimum incentive strike R$ 
125/MW  - 3 or 4 year term,  
O Globo. (1-3MWs) 2 sites, peaking units.  awaiting summary terms and 
conditions. 
White Martins (10-15MWs ).   8 sites (MG), intersite flexibility to adjust 
product between sites and maximize energy re-sale.  3rd party re-sale 
(Cemig). short-term capacity basis indutrial demand for gases short-term 
variable price - 2 or 3 year

In all four cases, Enron is buying the right to buy power and all 3 are 
executable in Q2/Q3.  We are expecting (hoping) to transact paying no premium 
- with the focus on the strike price itself being the profitability incentive 
to the customer.  However, we'll need to guage our pricing ability ( and 
appetite from a book and risk control point of view ) for option length and 
the forward curve, not to mention getting the terms and conditions into 
reasonably standardized and legally binding contracts.  

Wholesale. Am including Wholesale on the wire given both the synergies on 
contracting and pricing and given the significant potential ( benefit and 
opportunity to Enron's regional trading effort ) to launch the physical and 
financial option product line into the commercial Wholesale effort.  

Note:  Particularly to put options - how many LDCs would we expect to charge 
us anything for our right to sell them power at R$30 or R$40/MWh ( or have 
charged us  3-5 months ago for the right to sell closer to R$50-60.  

We're having first sit down with Remi and Sami this afternoon, Wed Apr 19; 
please shoot any/all additional inputs, insights.  

I'm tied up from 1-3.

Sara and I have some swap legal issues that we would like to discuss with

3 of us, if possible this week, but if not, as soon as possible next week?  
Thanks.

a basis swap?  A CFD is merely a swap!

In regards to these trades, we have not had a CFD confirmation from Phibro 
before.  I realize the trades have expired but would like the format to be 
reviewed.  I will then add it to the incoming confirmation file for future 
use.  As far as the payment date, 5 days after the Floating Price is 
determined.  These deals settled about the 11th of June.

Bernice

By the way, did you resolve Zachary's "fund" issue?  Sas
ps  I'm going to call you when I get a break.  I learned that I have a ticket 
to the game on Sat.  Oh, joy!

Hi, Shane.  Here's a quick update.  As you can see, the Westpac ISDA is a 
done deal.  Susan Bailey (paralegal) had been holding the Commonwealth ISDA 
because she didn't have an address.  I asked her to email you for the info.  
I am working on ABN AMRO.  I' m also trying to keep up with you other trading 
activity.  Let me know if you ever have any questions.  Sara

 We have received the following executed Master Agreement:

Type of Contract: ISDA Master Agreement ( Multicurrency-Cross Border)

Effective Date:  April 12, 2000

Counterparty:     Westpac Banking Corporation

Transactions Covered:   Approved for all products except:          pulp and 
paper and weather

PLEASE NOTE:   The Counterparty is the Calculation Agent.   The Counterpary 
has three (3) Local Business Days after the receipt of a Confirmation from 
ENA to accept or dispute the Confirmation. 

We need to finalize.  Legal opinion needs to come from Mark Haedicke (my 
recollection is that he may not need the back up).  Have we requested the 
guaranty?  Thanks.  Sara
Sara,

     Any progress on getting a guaranty, legal opinion and a corrected
certificate of the secretary for me?  I will forward the executed master to
you with my attached docs once I receive these docs from you.

Thanks

disclaimer language)

Mark:  Nice to meet you too!  When Credit sends us the creditworksheet, we 
can generate an ISDA master to send to the counterparty.  Sara

   
	
	

Sara,
 I just joined Enron about 1 month ago and am just getting use to the 
process.  Could you start the ISDA process with EnSight Resources.  The 
address and phone number and contact information are below in the John Suttle 
memo.  Thank you very much.

Mark

John,
 Could you set up EnSight Resources an account with Enron, so they can 
transact some NYMEX NG fixed price swaps with us in the near future.  Karen 
Anthony is the CFO and she can provide you any financials that you need to 
get them set-up.

The address is:

Karen Anthony
CFO
EnSight Resources, LLC
333 Texas St, Suite 1175
Shreveport, LA 71101

Thanks for your help in this matter.

Enserco Energy busted on line today.  Although we are collateralized with 
L/C's, our exposure is increasing due to the size of the on line volume they 
have been doing.  ENA sent an ISDA draft to them a few weeks ago, with no 
response.  Today I spoke to their Credit Manager, Don Perkins, and informed 
him that we can not take on additional volume unless we have an executed 
ISDA. He is going to review, with his legal, the contract and will get back 
to me.  At this point I feel we should not take on any further transactions 
until the ISDA is signed.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Russell

Please forward this e-mail on to the appropriate EOL people so they are aware 
of Enserco's status.

I am ready to finalize the letter agreement.  Please verify that Jeff McMahon 
will sign for Enron Corp.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

I'm on someone else's computer - I'm having all sorts of e-mail problems 
today.

The business person on the  EES side to be signing this letter would be Mark 
S. Muller.  He is a Managing Director of EES LLC.

I don't necessarily have a problem with the description of the back-to-back 
obligations, but I'd like to know Gareth's opinion as to whether the language 
is too broad.

Attached is a first stab at the agreement.  Please comment.

Tanya:  I left you a voice mail earlier this week on the single outstanding 
issue:  paragraph (B) of our setoff language.  This provision allows the 
nondefaulting party to withhold any payment it might owe to the defaulting 
party under the master until the nondefaulting party can be certain IN ITS 
REASONABLE DISCRETION  that ANY other payments owed to it (under ANY other 
agreements between the parties)  by the defaulting party have been paid.  
Cargill does not want to "comingle" its business.  Remember, we have already 
given in on "affiliate setoff".  [the lawyer never raised the paragraph (B) 
issue until this week!] 

Also, Cargill has requested that we change our Credit Support Amount 
definition (but I provided them with an explanation) AND Cargill has decided 
to issue transferable L/C's.

Please let me hear from you so that we can finalize.  I do not know if this 
is a deal breaker.

Carol:  I spoke with Richard Peterson (retail side).  Apparently we were 
dealing with the exploration side of the company last year.  We agreed to (1) 
mark up the Flying J form AND (2) reissue the Industrial Master that had been 
negotiated last year (with our form changes).  John Scales (exploration side) 
wouldn't agree to the MAC at the last minute.  Do you want to handle?  Just 
let me know.  Sara

Please put on my calendar with respect to "POLAND"

A message from my crazy sister!
 - garfield.pps

Hey, Sam:  Great to hear from you and I'm thrilled that your golf game is as 
good as ever.  Have you been playing in Palm Springs or Amelia Island or  The 
Boulders?  I was in Phoenix last year and thought it was wonderful except for 
the fact that people age faster.  I didn't go to Baton Rouge for Passover 
since the seders were in the middle of the week.  But I know that my sister 
ordered everything from the Second Avenue Deli in N.Y. and various other 
Manhattan establishments.  My niece has been accepted at that high school in 
Natchitoches for smart kids and Deb is really happy (and sad).  Jennifer is 
only 15.  My nephew is tall, handsome and driving Steve crazy.  My parents 
are fine and my Dad is going to have a knee-cap replacement sometime soon.  
He'll be 83 in June.  I've decided on in-house training for my dogs and the 
trainer thinks that CHLOE needs the most "help" since that sweet little 
bichon may try to bite strangers (and maybe friends!) in my home.  Otherwise, 
I'm rocking along.  You know, I never called Helen but I still have her 
number and I'll do it this week.  Hope all is well.  Do you keep up with 
Ron?  Love, Sara

No, but we add different provisions to the Master Agreement  for commodity 
trades and currency/rate trades.

   
	
	

commodity only (as far as I know and based on trades thus far).  Does it have

Carol and Rod are working on the ISDA comparison for a potential ISDA between 
ENA and Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  Last week, Cregg Lancaster furnished 
Reliant's newest form of Schedule and Paragraph 13 for our review.  You may 
want to visit with Carol as to the status.

Also, it is my understanding that once we have the ISDA between ENA and 
Reliant in place, that that form of agreement would be used for the ECC and 
Reliant Canada agreement (with the exception of the provisions specific to 
Canadian entities).

Hope this explanation help.

Harry Arora (e-commerce group) wants to take a look at Goldman's online 
trading operation.  His motive is to explore/navigate the site during the 
next 30 days (but not trade).  I told Harry that I would need to review the 
agreement and negotiate with Goldman just as I would any agreement in order 
to not set any precedent with Goldman for future agreements.  Although Harry 
does not intend to trade at all, and we could terminate the agreement when he 
is done, I suppose Gary may want to trade with Goldman online in the future.  
We could negotiate another agreement at a later date.

Let me know if you would agree to accept Goldman's agreement "as is" for the 
limited purpose of allowing Harry to navigate the site, with the intention of 
terminating the agreement when he is done.  Although ENA would have a 
password, access could be limited to Harry [and whomever he needs to 
assist?].  Please let me know your decision.  Thanks.  Sara

Here's the comparison chart. We've gone as far as we can with SSB. The ball 
is in the traders' court to look at, and approve, the numbers. I don't know 
when, if ever, they'll do that. They don't seem as interested as they once 
were. I think we're more or less on hold waiting for them. SSB is aware of 
the development and said they will push the traders independently.

My schedule is fairly flexible so let me know when you'd like to meet.

Neither Susan has any comparisons.  Flynn eagerly volunteered amendments 
she's got lying around.  I'm indifferent although I wonder if Flynn is simply 
trying to use the system.

BY THE WAY, your voice mail does not work!  If your phone calls roll over to 
an assistant or I try to leave you a voice mail, I cannot get there!  Please 
call or stop by.  Sara

Could I arrange a very short conversation with you regarding the May 28, 1999 
memo from Jorge Brito Pereira?  I would like to discuss your analysis and any 
further actions which the local firm may be taking on ECTRIC's behalf.  I 
have a paper trade with a Portuguese corporate pending receipt of an 
enforceability opinion acceptable to ECT.  I'm not sure if we'll get there.  
I'm interested in further discussions you may have had internally or 
externally.  Sara

Robert:  Susan Flynn told me that your client is objecting to the deletion of 
the first part of the first sentence in the "Setoff" language.  I just wanted 
to explain why we are requesting this change.  In reviewing our forms during 
the latter part of 1999, we made a number of changes to both our ISDA 
Schedule and CSA.  One of these changes was the deletion of  the preamble 
language contained in the setoff provision.  We concluded that the phrase 
"Without affecting ...., all payments will be made without setoff 
...;provided, however," actually negated the effect of setoff which we WANT 
to occur UPON THE DESIGNATION OR THE DEEMED DESIGNATION of an Early 
Termination Date.  What purpose do you think the phrase serves if left in the 
setoff provision?  Please feel free to give me a call at 713/853-5620.

Thanks for the following email regarding our ability to remove Cargill in our

May we discuss the possibility of closing the account with Cargill?

They added approximately $20,000 to our margin account by mistake on April 
7th.
They reversed this yesterday but didn't take out the entire amount, so it 
appears to be
creating additional work for our margin accounting group. Gerri Gosnell in

I talked to Bank One this morning and they said that initially only NG would 
be traded; however,

Tanya:  I left you a voice mail earlier this week on the single outstanding 
issue:  paragraph (B) of our setoff language.  This provision allows the 
nondefaulting party to withhold any payment it might owe to the defaulting 
party under the master until the nondefaulting party can be certain IN ITS 
REASONABLE DISCRETION  that ANY other payments owed to it (under ANY other 
agreements between the parties)  by the defaulting party have been paid.  
Cargill does not want to "comingle" its business.  Remember, we have already 
given in on "affiliate setoff".  [the lawyer never raised the paragraph (B) 
issue until this week!] 

Also, Cargill has requested that we change our Credit Support Amount 
definition (but I provided them with an explanation) AND Cargill has decided 
to issue transferable L/C's.

Please let me hear from you so that we can finalize.  I do not know if this 
is a deal breaker.

Susan:  I wanted to clarify  whether Enron Australia Pty. Ltd. needs to 
execute ISDA Master Agreements with the SAME counterparties which already 
have agreements with ENA (and vice versa).  As an example, I can only rely 
upon tax advice ENA has previously received in connection with the services 
agreement between ENA and ECT Canada.  For book and tax purposes, the trade 
is recorded on the risk books of the Enron affilate ultimately booking the 
trade but the transaction is actually documented in the name of the Enron 
affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterpary.  The Enron 
affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterparty then transacts 
with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through a bulk swap arrangement).  The 
credit risk remains with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through an internal 
back to back transaction with the "booking" Enron affiliate)  for which the 
"booking" Enron affiliate will presumably pay a fee pursuant to the services 
agreement.

Consider:  ENA is negotiating an agreement with Commonwealth Bank of 
Australia.  Will Enron Australia require a separate master with Commonwealth 
Bank of Australia?  Or will the services agreement permit the hereinabove 
described arrangement?

That's fine but I have to leave shortly before 5 tomorrow.  Sara

Antonio Felix,

As Enron is finding several opportunities involving financial derivatives in 
Brazil, we would like to get from Tozzini Freire Law Firm a summarized but 
concise read on the "cans and cannots" of these type of transactions in 
Brazil. Here is my understanding of the regulations from the memo you have 
already sent to us regarding swaps and prepays as well as a list of the most 
common examples of deals that Enron would be encountering in the marketplace. 
I would appreciate if you could comment on what is written here and also add 
further information so Enron can have some sort of menu of deals of this 
nature that can be pursued. I would like to ask you to add your comment in 
this same message to make the review process a little easier. Thank you 
inadvance for your attention.

Swaps (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

OTC Swaps

The Central Bank regulates swap transactions involving local financial 
institutions acting either as dealers for their own account or as 
intermediaries to the contracting parties. When the financial institutions 
act as intermediaries, the agreements are in fact private agreements 
negotiated by two non-financial companies, but become subject to the 
requirements and regulations normally applicable to swaps involving financial 
institutions. According to regulations currently in force, such swaps can 
relate to exchange rates, interest rates, gold and price indices.

All of the swap agreements involving financial institutions must be 
registered with CETIP or with another custody and clearing system authorized 
by the Central Bank or the CVM (Brazilian SEC). As a matter of practice, the 
agreements used by the banks that participate in the swap market do not 
follow a standard form, since normally each bank has a particular sample form 
with which it feels more comfortable.

Derivatives
In addition to exchange-traded derivatives and OTC swaps involving financial 
institutions, there is no legal impediment, in principle, to derivatives 
transactions being privately negotiated and entered into between two 
interested parties. As a general rule in Brazil, as long as no specific 
prohibition is found in the law, parties are free to negotiate agreements 
that best suit their interests.

International Hedge 
Central Bank regulations authorize that Brazilian companies enter into 
transactions abroad, either in exchanges or having a financial institution as 
their counterpart, to hedge against the fluctuation of interest rates, 
exchange rates or commodity prices in the international markets. 

Such hedge transactions must refer to payments in foreign currency scheduled 
to be made by or to the Brazilian company in respect of commercial or 
financial rights or obligations, or to payments in local currency arising out 
of certain financial obligations subject to the variation of exchange rates 
and payments relating to imports, exports or local transactions involving 
commodities priced according to their valuation in foreign exchanges. The 
commercial market exchange rates are applicable to foreign exchange 
agreements referring to remittances of currency in connection with hedge 
transactions.

When the underlying obligation/right is registered with the Central Bank, the 
corresponding hedge transaction must be informed to the Central Bank within 
10 days of its execution. When there is no registration with the Central 
Bank, the banks executing the foreign exchange agreements relating to the 
hedge transaction must verify the existence of the obligation/right being 
hedged.

Examples

Commodity swap between two Brazilian companies:
As per what has been said above, there is nothing that precludes Enron Brazil 
of entering into a swap with another Brazilian company regarding any 
commodity traded by Enron (Pulp, Paper, Petrochem products, Power, Gas). 
Enron does not need to be a financial institutions to provide swaps 
transactions. On the other hand, I am not sure yet on the following points: 
(1) Does such swap agreement should be registered with CETIP or any other 
clearing system to be valid under Brazilian regulations? (2) What are the 
taxes involved in a swap?

Commodity swap between a Brazilian company and an offshore company:
This kind of deal seems to be also available in the Brazilian market and the 
only difference from example 1 would be the fact that it must be registered 
with the Central Bank and it would involved transfer of foreign currency.

Commodity swap between two offshore companies but involving Brazilian exports:
I am not sure if Brazilian regulations would have anything to do with a 
transaction like this one. I would assume that a Brazilian exporter would 
sell to their offshore subsidiary and such subsidiary would sell to their end 
customer. Enron would step in and offer a swap agreement for the offshore 
subsidiary of the Brazilian company therefore Enron would not have any 
involvement with Brazilian regulations because it would not be dealing with 
Brazil. 

Prepays (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

The regulations currently in force governing export prepayments, especially 
Central Bank of Brazil's Carta-Circular 2624, of February 14, 1996, establish 
that all repayments of principal under such transactions must necessarily be 
made by means of shipments of the relevant exported goods.  Carta-Circular 
2624 allows cash remittances abroad only in regard to payments of interest 
under the facility.  Therefore, it is not possible to structure a transaction 
where the repayment of principal will be made only in cash or where the 
borrower has the ability to choose between paying cash or exporting the goods.

A transaction that involves structuring a direct loan to the Brazilian 
company where the value of the principal of which would be tied to the price 
of the relevant commodity is very difficult to be approved.  Under a direct 
loan registered with the Central Bank the borrower may remit all due amounts 
of principal and interest in accordance with the schedule of payments 
attached to the certificate of registration. The problem with such 
alternative is that, although there are no express regulations preventing it 
to do so, the Central Bank will most probably not issue a prior authorization 
for such type of loan, as it only normally issues authorizations for normal 
loans where the principal is a fixed amount and the interest rate is either a 
fixed rate or a floating rate (normally based on LIBOR or US Treasury).  It 
should also be noted that generally speaking all interest payments under such 
an agreement are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% p.a.

CC 5 Account

A possible alternative way to structure a prepay would be by using a 
non-registered loan with the Central Bank.  Under such alternative, the funds 
disbursed by Enron under the loan would be remitted to Brazil through an 
international transfer of Brazilian currency, as allowed by Circular 2677 of 
the Central Bank of Brazil. The international transfer of Brazilian currency 
("International Transfer") is a system which uses a non-resident current 
account in Brazil and the Brazilian interbank foreign exchange market to 
effect remittances of funds to and from Brazil.  Under such system, a lender 
that wishes to disburse funds to a Brazilian borrower makes a foreign 
currency deposit with a bank located outside of Brazil ("offshore bank")  and 
instructs the offshore bank to deliver such dollars to a Brazilian bank in 
exchange for Brazilian currency.  Such Brazilian currency is then deposited 
in a non-resident account held by the offshore bank in Brazil and thereafter 
transferred to the borrower. The repayments follow the inverse procedure, 
i.e. the borrower deposits the amount in a non-resident account of an 
offshore bank and instructs it to exchange the funds into foreign currency 
and deliver them to the lender abroad.

The main differences between the registered loans and the non-registered 
loans are that the non-registered loans are not subject to prior approval by 
the Central Bank of Brazil (and therefore not subject to scrutiny as to their 
minimum tenors and applicable interest rates) and the applicable foreign 
exchange rate to non-registered loans is the floating rate (as opposed to the 
commercial rate of exchange). All transfers of funds to Brazil as 
International Transfers are subject to a Financial Transactions Tax ("IOF") 
at the rate of 2% on the amount transferred, plus a bank fee that normally 
ranges from 0.4% to 0.6% of such amount.  Any interest payments under a 
non-registered loan are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% (or 25% 
if the lender is located in a tax-haven jurisdiction).

I don't think this type of transaction is the best way to circumvent some of 
the Brazilian regulations regarding prepayment given the bad press that deals 
via the CC 5 Account mechanism would bring to Enron but I have it addressed 
just in case someone does not share the same opinion. 

Examples

Financial prepay between two Brazilian companies
Not allowed unless the company providing the prepay qualifies as a financial 
institution as per Brazilian law. Since it will not be the case in Enron's 
cases, we should not focus in these kind of transactions.

Financial prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
As it has been mentioned before it is allowed as long as Enron can structure 
the prepay in way where there is a pre-established amortization schedule for 
principal and interest. It is very hard to structure a prepay with specific 
split between principal and interest because the objective of the prepay is 
to lock on a certain volume of a product and not on a specific price. 
Therefore, if Enron prepays for a specific product on a floating basis the 
attached value of that commodity can go up or down as the market fluctuates 
as well as the total value associate to the deal. Such value can be either 
principal or interest and it is impossible to determine what it will be.

Financial prepay between two offshore companies but one being a subsidiary of 
a Brazilian entity
I think there is no restrictions in this case given the whole deal will be 
closed offshore and the Brazilian authorities are not going to be involved. 
It will most likely be a deal involving three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Physical prepay between two Brazilian companies
No restrictions.

Physical prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
No restrictions as long as there is physical deliveries.

Physical prepay between two offshore companies but  involving Brazilian 
exports
No restrictions. It would also involve three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Thanks,

Gustavo

It has recently emerged that we have concluded financially-settled trades 
from London with Sempra in the name of ECT (Houston).

Unfortunately, this could create a significant tax issue for ECT (Houston) 
i.e. a taxable presence in the UK.

Therefore, if we wish to continue trading with Sempra from London, we must 
trade in the name of ECTI (aka ECTRIC), but not ECT (Houston). 

This principle applies generally  - London should not bind ECT (Houston) to 
trades with counterparties.

Please call Janine Juggins or myself if you would like to discuss this.

Tanya:  There's no short answer with these people!  I think we are fine with 
their setoff language (part A only) because the NDP always has the option to 
permit setoff to other agreements between the parties as to amounts payable 
by the Payee to the Payer (where the Payer owes money under the ISDA to the 
Payee).  So here's my recommendation:

(1)  Call your friend Andre and hear what he has to say.  He has some kind of 
suggestion about Part (B) and limiting the NDP's payment to the DP to be 
based upon satisfaction that "nondisputed" amounts having been paid by the 
DP.  Will he also raise the "other agreements" issue here?  Not a clue.

(2)   If Cargill leaves part A in tact and we agree to change part B, I'M 
FINE.  (I'm fine without part B, actually)

(3)  The potential problem is that Cargill and ENA view part A differently, 
right off the bat.  I think Cargill is wrong because they don't read part A 
as applying to "other agreements between the parties".  But Cargill proposed 
part A and it DOES apply to "other agreememts between the parties."  I don't 
want to start off on the wrong foot so I'm sure I'll have to discuss this 
again with Marty.

Thanks for your continued help.  Sara

Susan:  Attached are the electronic agreements for ENA trading with Goldman.  
Not much to do here because we'll need only  a signature (get Gary Hickerson 
to sign).  I have two changes to the Client Access Agreement which I will 
give you to add.  We do not need certificates or our typical authorized 
trader list to send back.  However, we will have to authorize password 
applicants on Goldman's form.  How does EOL keep track of this?  We will have 
to track because Harry Arora will be the password applicant (there may be 
more) and I think he's still ENA.  I know that we will want to receive the 
password very soon.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara

In advance of your calling me later this afternoon, I set out below some 
thoughts the issues to be discussed:

1. Jurisdiction - under the English law Annex the preferable route is 
recourse to the courts - I can confirm that this is Enron London's policy.

2, Non-reliance:  From our telephone conversation yesterday, I understood 
that you said that the CP would be relying on us.  I believe that this should 
not be the case and the usual non-reliance provisions should apply.  If this 
is not the case, then

3. the additional para. (h) that you faxed me earlier today, I am informed, 
is unnecessary.  I also understand that the practical effect of those 
provisions might be to scare the CP.

Please call me so that we can discuss any of the above and/or to confirm that 
you are happy for the documents to go out to the CP.

Thanks
Michael

Jay:  I am a lawyer with Enron.  I called for you on Friday, you're out, and 
no one else could help.  I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1) 
replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a 
broader range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant 
ISDA definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even 
though the master is an early master energy price swap agreement.  Please 
call me at 713 853-5620 with the information so that we can move quickly.  
Thank you for your help.  Sara

Susan:  for the SITA file.

Hi, Sami!  Sorry we missed the call yesterday.  I just wanted to update you 
on some of the financial trading issues in Brazil (and I have added you to 
the working group list).  I am going to finalize our "swap matrix" for 
Brazil.  On the physical trading side, I had asked a physical trading lawyer 
to call you and am wondering if Elizabeth Sager ever called or emailed.  
Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara 
Dear Sara:

Thank you for your message below. Please find attached hereto free

Susan:  I would like to have this agreement (all three parts) executed early 
INSERT 1 to Paragraph 9(g) after the word "enjoined":  "upon proof of any 
such breach"

INSERT 2 which will replace the second and third sentences in Paragraph 9(h) 
:  "Any dispute between the parties relating to this Agreement shall be 
resolved pursuant to the ARBITRATION provision contained in Schedule A to 
this Agreement."

For purposes of the password ID application, we must verify that Harry Arora

Shari, Westpac have contacted me re putting in place an ISDA with EAF. As far 
as we ar concerned it will cover just power trades and commodities. A couple 
of questions. 

Our credit sheet required a MAC trigger (fall below BBB-) for additional 
credit support. Was this changed? The ISDA Schedule Westpac sent me has no 
such provision?  
Can I have a copy of the Enron Corp.guaranty you finally settled with 
Westpac?  

 Thanks

Sara, further to my email. Has the confirmation for the Melbourne HDD swap 
with Aquila been signed yet. If it has we need to do the "back to back" 
confirmation with EAF.    

David Minns
04/27/2000 02:44 PM
Sara I agree that the confirmation should be in a form that is acceptable to 
ENA. We attempted to put use an ENA confirmation format. I have incorporated 
your comments into our latest draft. I did this with some caution as there 
appears to be slight differences between it and the draft you sent me. I 
suggest if you find our section 2 satisfactory then you lift it and place it 
in your standard confirmation. On the issues you raised.
1 October is correct as the termination date as time is measured from 9am 
each day. Hence 30 September finishes at 8:59am on 1 October   
The Payment Date should be at least 20 Business Days after the BoM readings 
to determine the Floating Amount. An alternative wording could be "the 
earlier of the [specified date] or 20 Business Days after...." 
 The "Strike Amount Differential" and  "Payment Amount" could be worded 
alternatively as in the pro forma ENA confirmation attached.  

Would you forward your final wording. 

David Minns

Hi, David!  Hope all is well.  Since the referenced swap has been documented 
by ENA, I am now reviewing the Transaction.  I have a number of questions, 
many the result of my unfamiliarity with your Australian Reference/Fallback 
weather stations and a few other comments.  I thought I would mark this up 
and fax it to you which I will do shortly.  Sara

Trena:  Can you please let me know if the docs from Chase are to amend the 
existing Repo Agreement between ENA and Chase?  What type of transactions 
will you be doing with Chase?  The docs I received are from a woman named 
Monica Turner and she has not returned my phone call.  She did not provide an 
email address so I don't know how to get in touch with Chase.  Can you help?  
Maybe get me another name?  Thanks.  Sara

Sami:  Attached are the most recent ENA power trading agreements.  Parts of 
the agreements may be useful to you and/or Jose Emilio (or whomever you are 
working with).  Tozzini began with the earlier ENA template.  Please forward 
any translated trading docs to my attention.  Thanks.  Let me know if there 
is anything else I can do.  Sara

Sara --  As discussed last Friday, attached is the referenced agreement 
reflecting the power group's most current thinking, though it has not yet 
been finalized or rolled out.  I also attach the 'long form confirmation' 
used for trading wholesale power with counterparties who have not executed a 
master agreement or other sort of enabling agreement with EPMI.  The latter 
document has not been updated in about nine months' time and thus may not 
reflect all proposed changes to the master.   The formatting may also be out 
of kilter on Annex  A of the latter document but I believe it should be 
usable by the person you are assisting in Brazil.  Please  contact me if you 
have any questions.  --David 

Jeff:  Are there any  issues that I might address that would be particularly 
useful or timely for your group?  Sara

Bob:  Are there any issues that might be useful for your goup that I should 
address?  Also, I would like to chat with you about settlements on multiple 
trades.  An interesting issue was raised in our credit lunch last week.  
Please let me know when you are available.  Thanks.  Sara

Sheila:  Per my voice mail, can you make headway with these two companies?  
We have not heard back from either.  I think that there needs to be a 
commercial push.  Please call if you have any questions or if I can help 
further.  Thanks.  Sara

Tana:  When will the database be ready for companywide access?  Sara

Tana:  I added several brokerage agreements to the database yesterday and all 
ended up in the "Other Agreements" section.  Except for one, which is an 
"electronic trading agreement".  Can I call our developer?  Thanks.  Sara

Hi, Andrea!  Attached are updated power trading forms currently in use by 
ENA.  I thought these may be useful.  I have forwarded these already to 
Sami.  Let me know if I can be of any assistance or if you have a recent 
English translation of a current deal.  Regards.  Sara

Anita:  It was great hearing from you and it sounds as though you have lots 
going on!
I am trying to refresh myself on the type of trading activity which is 
currently taking place in Singapore (physical vs. financial, types of 
commodities) and the confirmation procedures (what is confirmed in Singapore 
vs. what is confirmed in London).  Is there a written set of procedures that 
I can see?  Should I be asking this question of Paul Simons? anyone else?  
Please send me an e-mail.  These issues are arising because of my involvement 
in working with the Brazilian office.  Thanks.  Looking forward to speaking 
to you soon.  Sara

It seems that there are only a few issues for me to respond as to and these 
are below.  You can handle the rest, I think.  Also, he jumped on the L/C 
removal language that we discussed.

[references are to numbered paragraphs below]
(2)  OK
(5)  Did you ever receive a response from Rhett?
(7)  Per already responded to you.  Please find out if CP has Cayman counsel.
(11)  These are two separate issues.  Short of a conversation, it sounds like 
he is confusing payments on Early Termination with consequential damages.  
The former will capture unpaid premiums in the event of an Early Termination 
based upon failure to pay.
(12)  Need to be consistent for both parties.
(14)  Is he right?

	"Daniel A Harris" <dharris@shearman.com>

Susan,

Thank you for the revised drafts. My comments are as follows:

(1) Please date the Master Agreement as of February 1, 2000.

(2) Part 1(a) -Specified Entities. As Enron Corp guarantees the performance of
Enron NAC's obligations under the Agreement, please add the words "Enron Corp,
but only to the extent that Enron Corp is a Credit Support Provider". This 
seems
reasonable.

(3) Please re-number the pages so that the Schedule starts on page 19 and the
Paragraph 13 starts on page 11.

(4) Part 1(e) - Payments on Early Termination. I am checking with Tudor as to
whether they are agreeable to Loss for trades going out beyond two years. I
would say, however, that I am not aware that they have agreed to this with any
other counterparty. That said, Per's point that the trades are much shorter 
than
this is noted.

(5) Part 2(b) - Payee tax reps. Ospraie never makes payee tax reps other than
relating to its place of incorporation.  If this is an important point for 
you,
I will get out tax group involved.  However, Tudor prefers that neither party
makes payee tax reps.

(6) Part 3(b) - Documents to be Delivered.  Party B annual financials - should
read "... 120 days after the end of its fiscal year".

(7) Part 3(b) - legal opinion. Please confirm that you will pay the costs of
Cayman counsel.

(8) Part 4(h) - Jurisdiction.  I am checking with Tudor as "any court" is much
broader than the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the NY courts.

(9) Part 5(b)(g) - Commercial User rep. Tudor cannot make this rep. Please
replace with the following: "Party A represents, with respect to Options, that
it is a producer, processor, commercial user of, or merchant handling, the
commodity subject to the Transaction or the products or byproducts thereof, 
and
is entering into each Option Transaction solely for purposes related to its
business as such".

(10) Part 5(f) - Procedures for Entering into Transactions. Please remove the
word "deemed" in the last line. This is no longer relevant.

(11) Part 5(i). I am checking with Tudor. Is the "no consequential damages"
consistent with Part 7 which expressly provides for the payment of out of 
pocket
expenses, the costs of a delta hedge etc. on non-payment of premium in a
currency option?

(12) Part 5(k) - Transfer.  For the part of the paragraph relating to Party A,
please change the proviso to read "and provided that such transfer will not 
give
rise to adverse tax consequences to Party B or to a Termination Event or an
Event of Default, and the proposed transfer would not adversely affect Party 
B's
existing netting or set-off rights or under applicable law".  The part of the
paragraph relating to Party B should provide: "Party B may transfer its rights
and obligations under this Agreement with the prior written consent of Party 
A,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld."  These amendments are intended 
to
be reasonable and fair to both sides.

(13) Part 6 - line 2 "Definitions" - typo.

(14) Part 7(b) - please remove the reference to "ISDA". The FX Definitions are
previously defined in Part 5(e).

(15) Para 13(b)(ii). Please include longer term Treasuries. My understanding 
is
that this is what has been agreed, but please let me know if this is not your
understanding and I will check with Tudor.

(16) Para 13 (b)(iii). Please remove the reference to L/Cs.

(17) Para 13(d) - Specified Condition (Tax Event) should refer to Section
6(b)(ii) and Specified Condition (TEUM) should refer to Section 6(b)(iii).

(18) Para 13(g). I will check with Tudor.

(19) Para 13(g). I think references to "Downgraded Party" and "Credit Rating
Event" are inappropriate. Please clarify. Is there any way you will agree to 
the
provisions of Paragraph 6(c) without more? What seems to be important is that
the Secured Party is not a Defaulting Party - i.e. Para 13(g)(i)(1) (not (2)).
This is consistent with Para 6(c) of the pre-printed form. Para 13(h) is 
related
to this issue.

(20) Para 13(i) and (j) - please remove. L/C-related provisions are no longer
relevant.

I look forward to receving revised drafts of the Schedule, Paragraph 13 and
guarantee in due course.

Kind regards.

     Please the attached letter, revised draft of the ISDA Schedule and Credit
Support Annex, and redline of the ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex 
marked

Susan:  I have given this to Jason.  SS

David:  I will try to call you before I leave work today to follow up with 
any questions you may have with respect to the following items:

(1)  I am having the Representative Agreement executed by ENA and will return 
an original to your attention.  Shari suggested that Susan Musch initial the 
agreement and Susan is out until May 22.
(2)  The ENA/Aquila weather deal has not been finalized ONLY because I have 
been waiting to actually view the Floating Price source materials which our 
traders have never been able to produce or cite a reference to (so that I 
could view).  There is no problem with the deal.
(3)  As a policy matter for Enron Australia Finance Pty. Limited, do you 
always agree to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of New South 
Wales as opposed to arbitration?  I am negotiating the ENA/ABN AMRO 
(Australian branch) futures agreement and am trying to determine appropriate 
jurisdiction.
(4)  ENA is attempting to draft an ISDA Master Agreement with a company 
incorporated in New Guinea (which may have a US office).  I don't know a darn 
thing about New Guinea law.  Do you happen to know if we've ever dealt in New 
Guinea, any lawyers located in New Guinea, what law is used (I guess New 
Guinea!) or whether it's similar to other PacRim countries? 

I'll speak with you later.  Regards.  Sara

Jarrod:  Attached is a "form" letter for you to send (with adjustments as 
indicated) or let me know and I will sign and send with the Vitol confirms.   
Separately, I have faxed to you the first page changes.  Call if you have 
questions.  Please be sure that we have included the additional reps.  Sara

I would only add the ongoing cash collateral issue in Canada (and run spell 
check).

We recently did about 20 weather trades with Vitol and I "confirmed" these 
under the 1995 energy price swap master (bad for weather) but incorporated 
ISDA definitions.  I think we should work toward replacing this master with 
an ISDA to eliminate the problem.  We did the same with Aquila which solved 
the weather problem (and I realize the Aquila is a bigger trading partner 
than Vitol).  Can someone generate credit?  Thanks.  Sara

All:  I received a request from PPM to send our form of ISDA to document 
trading.  We previously sent a draft to these guys on 1/13/99.  The only 
difference is that they now want to trade and the Scottish Power acquisition 
is done.  The contact is:

Gary Ordway
830 N.E. Holladay
Suite 200
Portland, Oregon  97232 

You are right!  Sorry about that.

   

	
	                           
	

I don' think we ever replaced Aquila with an ISDA.  We sent one out, but they 
then decided to use Utilicorp, right? I'll put Vitol on our list, how high of 
a legal priority is this?  (not high for credit).  Thanks

It's true!  I am not really a lost friend, but a friend with a lost head!  I 
may not have time to call you today, but then again I might.  But I will call 
before the weekend.  Sara

Sara:

I have not heard from you in a while. Are you still checking your
emails? Maybe not, if I do not receive an answer or are you just real
busy. I sent you an email about the Gordon etc etc. duck lunch a while
back. Monty says hello, and asked if you "were still fine".

Carson

Marie is fine with either Friday June 2 or 9.  So let's pick June 2 unless 
someone has a conflict.  For quick planning (invitations, caterer, limo, 
etc.), who wants to help?  Sara

Carol St. Clair has the VEPCO proposed guaranty in hand and will contact you 
soon.  Thanks for reminding me.  Sara

Sheila:  We are still working with our developer to open up access to Gary's 
group (read-only).  Should I include all of the names on your February 2000 
org chart?  Delete some?  Add some?  Thanks.  Sara

Susan:  Would you please handle.  Thanks.  Sara
David Minns@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
05/10/2000 05:50 PM
Would you be able to email over to us the Enron Corp. that was provided to 
Westpac a couple of months ago? I agreed to provide a guaranty in exactly the 
same form for our ISDA Agreement. I have a faxed copy but it would be more 
efficient if we didn't have to copy type.  

Rick:  With a little luck, I can attach the first page of each of the 
foregoing documents and the signature block for the ISDA Master Agreement (at 
the bottom of the first page of the ISDA Master Agreement).  The full set of 
signature documents comprises four pieces:
(1)  [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency - Cross Border)
(2)  Schedule to the Master Agreement [previously emailed to you]
(3)  [BOILERPLATE] ISDA Credit Support Annex  [NOTE:  the document contains 
12 paragraphs]
(4)  Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex [previously emailed to you]

When we are ready to execute documents, we generally send out a complete 
package with all four parts.  The two emails which you previously received 
probably have the word "DRAFT" plastered all over them and we would normally 
remove this wording.  Please call me in the morning so that we can be sure to 
dot the "i's"  and cross the "t's".  Thanks.  Sara

I just learned that I have a conflict on June 2.  So I have already consulted 
with Marie who has agreed to Friday, June 9.  I hope this works for the 
majority of the group.  Thanks.  Sara

At end of first paragraph, add:  Terms used but not otherwise defined herein 
shall have such meaning as set forth in the Agreement.

Insert in "Credit or Other Special Provisions":  On or before 5:00 p.m. 
(Houston time) on Wednesday, May 17, 2000, Counterparty shall deliver to ENA 
Performance Assurance in the form of a Letter of Credit in the amount of 
$10,000  which amount shall be maintained in favor of ENA in accordance with 
the terms of Annex A to the Agreement and which may be aggregated together 
with other amounts required for other Transactions subject to the Agreement 
in order to establish a single Letter of Credit.  Further, at any time during 
the term of this Transaction, upon the request of ENA in its sole discretion, 
Counterparty shall deliver additional Performance Assurance in the form of a 
Letter of Credit in the amount of $10,000, subject to the provisions of the 
foregoing sentence.  In addition to such Performance Assurance, Counterparty 
shall establish, maintain, renew, substitute and increase such Performance 
Assurance in accordance with the terms and provisions of Annex A to the 
Agreement and the failure to do so shall constitute an Event of Default under 
Section 5A(6) of the Agreement.

Susan,
     I'm still reviewing the ISDA and should get back to you by week's end.
Could you update me on the status of the Enron Corp. guaranty???

Thanks.

Maria

Jarrod:  Attached is the price correction language.  There is a 60 day true 
up with a 30 day notification period after the correction is announced.  Upon 
notification by a party, there is a 3 Business Day period for payment.  This 
language tracks the ISDA so that our approach in each instance will be 
identical.  We will need to add "Calculation Agent" to the confirmation.  
Please call if you have any questions.  Sara

P.S.  you should use a paralegal for Annex B purposes and if the omnibus is 
for a cross-border transaction

Tana:  I've already spoken with Clem this morning and he is on board with 
this form.  The changes we are making are not substantive so let's make 'em 
(marked in yellow on the hard copy I've delivered to you) and get this signed 
right away.  Clem is going on vacation Friday.  We should also email a copy 
to Jack Foley when the revisions are made.  PG&E will send execution copies 
to me.  The paralegal handling this is Maryann Friel at (415) 973-4599.  
Thanks for your help.  Sara

Sara,

I am attaching our guarantee format for your review.  Please note that I
have inserted the "cap" at $ 10 million.

If you have any questions, please call me.

Jack:  I just spoke with Karola and she tells me that you want to talk about
the
guaranty.  I didn't recall if you had ever reviewed our proposed format.
Also,
I am aware that Enron Corp. previously issued a "General Guarantee
Agreememt" on
 - EnronGnt.doc

Monica:  Since our recent conversation, I thought that you were going to send 
me the entire format for the European format for the repos.  Also, have you 
had an opportunity to review the existing repo between Chase and Enron North 

Will send the MARKUP of the Axel Johnson Inc. guaranty later today.  I have 
inserted several provisions.  SS

   

Sara-

I faxed a guaranty from Sprague Energy Corp. on July 1 for you to review.  
Wanted to see if you had a chance to look it over.

Regards,

Pat

Sara, further to my email. Has the confirmation for the Melbourne HDD swap 
with Aquila been signed yet. If it has we need to do the "back to back" 
confirmation with EAF.    

David Minns
04/27/2000 02:44 PM
Sara I agree that the confirmation should be in a form that is acceptable to 
ENA. We attempted to put use an ENA confirmation format. I have incorporated 
your comments into our latest draft. I did this with some caution as there 
appears to be slight differences between it and the draft you sent me. I 
suggest if you find our section 2 satisfactory then you lift it and place it 
in your standard confirmation. On the issues you raised.
1 October is correct as the termination date as time is measured from 9am 
each day. Hence 30 September finishes at 8:59am on 1 October   
The Payment Date should be at least 20 Business Days after the BoM readings 
to determine the Floating Amount. An alternative wording could be "the 
earlier of the [specified date] or 20 Business Days after...." 
 The "Strike Amount Differential" and  "Payment Amount" could be worded 
alternatively as in the pro forma ENA confirmation attached.  

Would you forward your final wording.

Hi, David!  Hope all is well.  Since the referenced swap has been documented 
by ENA, I am now reviewing the Transaction.  I have a number of questions, 
many the result of my unfamiliarity with your Australian Reference/Fallback 
weather stations and a few other comments.  I thought I would mark this up 
and fax it to you which I will do shortly.  Sara

Mark:  I've been asked whether ENA can enter into derivatives with an Indian 
company.  Do you have research regarding legality/enforceability since the 
1997 global review which ENA conducted through Allen & Overy?  Thanks.  Sara

Laurel:  Can you send the deal ticket for this transaction?  Sara

As a result of Jeff Nogid's request, here is a recap of the Morgan Stanley 
situation:

(1)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.
 This is the entity for commodity trading.
 (i)  ECT has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated 6/16/92
 (ii)  ECTRIC has an ISDA dated 3/2/99, but eff. 8/27/97

(2)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
 Jeff Nogid requesting new master for fixed income transactions

(3)  Morgan Stanley International Limited
 This is the entity for equity trading.  Will Nogid or Kinneman ever need 
this one?

Each of these companies has a different lawyer to negotiate the agreement.

Each Morgan Stanley entity might require a separate guaranty.  Anne Clark in 
legal (Cap Services) will let me know.

I will put (2) in place.  Do you want to pursue upgrading (1)(i) or 
addressing (3)?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

Texaco to create a JV called BL.  I believe that the ownership is 60/40, 
respectively.  BL has its own employees drawn from both companies and 
elsewhere but is still requiring additional services.  The swap group has 
already opened two futures accounts for BL and drafted resolutions, 
authorized trader lists, etc.  Before the closing, there was an 
"understanding" that Enron would assist BL for a short time (until June, 
2000).  However, credit (through Bill Bradford) negotiated a 3-year services 
agreement for credit services to BL (I believe based upon 1 full-time person 
run through an entire budget).  Randy Curry (BL's president) has requested 
that legal (swaps group) consider a short-term services arrangement (I am 
told by credit this would be for approx. 6-9 months; BL looking for approx. 
20 ISDA's).  By the way, ENA is trying to negotiate an ISDA with BL but we 
have no one to negotiate with!  BL has not yet hired an in-house lawyer.

Are you interested in pursuing this request?  Sara

Carol:  Laurel Adams was wondering whether any of the paralegal candidates 
who we interviewed might have a good background for "back office" duties.  I 
have no idea whether salaries are comparable but she needs someone who can 
spot issues and learn the confirm process at the same time (if no experience 
in the confirmation area).  What do you think?  Sara

Carol:  I've been meeting with Jarrod about confirm templates.  Prior to the 
departures of Shari, Lynda, et al, there was a move afoot to create an annex 
of weather definitions which could be incorporated by reference into the 
confirms (or added to the Schedule), either of which approaches would shorten 
the confirms considerably.  Jarrod advises that the EOL T&C's for the 
varioius weather products contain the basic information which can be drafted 
in the annex.  Jarrod will send us the EOL T&C's.  I think it's a great idea. 

Jarrod will also send the existing  weather templates (which may be slightly 
different from those Shari gave us earlier).  We should verify that the 
weather rep appears in the weather option templates (since we have agreed to 
remove that rep from the Schedule).  Also, shouldn't we verify that all 
weather trades are executed under NY law (they probably are anyway) since we 
now have the opinion from the NY Office of General Counsel?

Sara

Kelly:  ENA is opening a margin line with Bank One to facilitate NYMEX 
trading through the Bank One broker.  Has Enron Corp. ever signed a standard 
Master Note with Bank One?  I'd like to see what's been previously 
negotiated.  Thanks.  Sara

Please remove Mark Taylor from the distribution list and insert my name and 
email address.  Thank you.

I have two questions:

(1)  If the ECC financial trading business is to be confirmed in Canada, 
won't Greg Johnston need a "short course" on ISDA/omnibus, etc.?  I was 
thinking of practical issues as well as Tana's more formalized training.

(2)  Have you spoken with Mary Solomson about Anthony?  I'm not sure if Tana 
has organized her lunch with global contracts, but it sounded as though 
Anthony was part of the problem and that Mary should be at the lunch.

Sara left you a voice mail about this attachment.

FYI. See you all when I am in town.

The structure for the financial prepay doesn't seem  to work under the 
Brazilian regulation therefore we need to come up with a different structure. 
David has put together a couple of different structures but basically all of 
them will run into the same problem and the Central Bank won't accept those.

We (Gustavo and I) had lunch last Thursday with a Mr. Jose Lavia owner of 
Fair Corretora (a brokerage house that I've worked with) basically he thinks 
that the financial prepay structure is not going to work because the Central 
Bank wants to see benefits for the country and impacts in the country's 
current balance.
He asked us to send him a draft of the structure and he will discuss with his 
partners to see if they came up with different ideas.

Below are the comments of the next steps and ideas from Antonio Felix 
(Tozzini Freire).

Central Bank:
As recommended by Antonio Felix from Tozzini Freire, we need to decide if 
this is a deal/structure we want to continue to pursue. If so we should 
schedule a meeting with the International Operations Director of the Central 
Bank in Brasilia and make a presentation covering the following points:

- The overall structure
- Market need
- Benefits to the companies involved (petrochemical, pulp and paper) - 
Benefits to Brazil ? (if any)

We should approach this not as a single transaction but as a new product, 
with specific characteristics, without any similar in the market, that Enron 
developed in the US and is trying to "sell" in Brazil.

Swaps:
A swap in Brazil can be arranged between two local parties and neither one 
needs to be a financial institution. If we want we can have a brokerage house 
or bank in the middle to register the contract with the BM&F (Mercantile 
Exchange).
The other possibility is to have a swap contract between a local and an 
offshore entity, in this case the offshore entity needs to be a financial 
institution.
Is one of the Enron companies in the US considered to be a financial 
institution ?

A specialist form Tozzini should be sending us some paper covering swap 
contracts. I hope to have a better understanding of the requirements for swap 
contracts after we receive that.

Yao Apasu: Andrea mentioned that you were involved with some swap contracts 
in Brazil. If you have anything about that (presentation, regulation) would 
you please forward  to us.

I think that we can structure the prepay mergin a simple loan and 
fix/floating swap, if the swap is something we are allowed to do under the 
Brazilian regulation.

Please add comments,

Andre

I'll try to have it emailed on Monday.  Regards.  Sara

All:  Sheila and I have been trying to coordinate the account(s) to receive 
the shares of the above entity.  I can't locate the company on the corporate 
database.  My understanding is that CF First Boston will receive the shares 
and then transfer to our Morgan account (upon our instructions).  

CF First Boston has an Enron Corp. account (pre-1994) and can open a 
subaccount for EIplc.  However, two (2) items are required:
(1)  a letter of beneficiary ownership
(2)  Is EIplc a regulated UK company?  If the answer is no, then it (or the 
company reporting for it) must provide a net  asset valuation

Has someone in London already handled these issues?  If not, can one of you 
supply me with that information?  We have spoken with Andrew Bracken in 
London (0207 888 3196) at andrew.bracken@csfb.com

No, but we have considered recently our exposure to brokers where they hold 
our money.  The analysis is more a function of applicable law/regulation (SFA 
or CFTC rules) than clearing house rules as I understand it.  We did not take 
outside advice or prepare memoranda, but Justin may have done so in the past 
(Justin?).  Please call me or Ed if you'd like to discuss.

Jarrod it seems the reference to Sydney time for a Melborne weather 
transaction could lead to an inconsistency this year. So if a time zone is to 
be referenced it should be Melbourne. 

David Minns
05/23/2000 12:39 PM
I agree this change could cause problems. During September 2000  daylight 
saving will start early in Sydney during the Olympics. As a result there will 
be a 1 hour time difference between Sydney and Melbourne.  The local time as 
reported by the Bureau of Meteorology is Melbourne time. Hence if there is to 
be a reference to a time zone it should time zone applicable to that 
location. More generally we should put a definition of "LST "in documentation 
as meaning the time at the relevant weather station. We could have a 
circumstance of reference weather stations in difference time zones (eg 
basket of cities).

Heidi can you handle?

Dear Heidi,

1.
I confirm that this is now a swap rather than a bought option.

Since Jared has replaced LST with Sydney time -

should this be Melbourne time instead ?????

The confirmation I have received below looks to be the deal we were talking 
about when I was in Houston. Is this correct? At that stage, were we not 
talking about there being a significant premium payable at the start of the 
deal. It appears from the confirmation below that this is now a swap rather 
than a bought option.  Can you please confirm that this therefore the same 
deal. 

Heidi

David Minns
22/05/2000 17:21
Jarrod looks fine. For completeness I have noted one minor inconsistency in 
(v) of the Fallback Data provisions that dates back to my first draft. Our 
rounding of degrees celsuis is to one decimal point. Hence the reference to 
whole numbers may not be apropriate in all cases. In practical terms it is so 
immaterial I question the need to redo the confirmation. Anyway please put 
together the the confirmation between between Enron Australia Finance Pty. 
Ltd. and RMT. I have copied in Susan (Tax) and Heidi (Finance) to double 
check they are fully aware of this arrangement.    

David,

I have attached a copy of the Confirmation that we sent to Aquila. They have 
read it and returned a signed copy to me. Please let me know if you think 
this document is acceptable. If it is I will go ahead and put together the 
Transaction between RMT and Australia. If we need to make any changes, I will 
send a revised copy to Aquila and then do the back to back transaction.

Thank you,

I refer to our recent conversation relating to the progress of ISDA 
negotiations with the above counterparty.

I have just spoken to Carine Lavergne at SITA.  She informs me that SITA does 
not feel adequately equipped or informed to progress the negotiations 
internally and therefore intends to appoint external counsel (I urged her to 
do this as soon as possible).  Despite this intended appointment, she assured 
me that SITA wishes to enter into the ISDA as soon as possible and is keen to 
keep negotiations to a minimum.

Either I or Michael Khajeh-Noori will keep you updated as to the progress.

For your information, I also attach a status report with respect to the 
counterparties with whom Michael and I are currently negotiating.

Let me know if you need anything else.

I refer to our recent conversation relating to the progress of ISDA 
negotiations with the above counterparty.

I have just spoken to Carine Lavergne at SITA.  She informs me that SITA does 
not feel adequately equipped or informed to progress the negotiations 
internally and therefore intends to appoint external counsel (I urged her to 
do this as soon as possible).  Despite this intended appointment, she assured 
me that SITA wishes to enter into the ISDA as soon as possible and is keen to 
keep negotiations to a minimum.

Either I or Michael Khajeh-Noori will keep you updated as to the progress.

For your information, I also attach a status report with respect to the 
counterparties with whom Michael and I are currently negotiating.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Regards
Deepak

Rod and Susan:  The CP's lawyer asked for a new draft so we can redraft on 
our new form.  Unless Rod objects, we will use the same credit.  Rod, there 
will be  cross default  and transferability issues (check Lotus Notes) but we 
can discuss when CP returns comments.  Our Portland trader is Kim Ward and 
she would like to be copied on the redraft.  Thanks.  Sara

All:  Sheila and I have been trying to coordinate the account(s) to receive 
the shares of the above entity.  I can't locate the company on the corporate 
database.  My understanding is that CF First Boston will receive the shares 
and then transfer to our Morgan account (upon our instructions).  

CF First Boston has an Enron Corp. account (pre-1994) and can open a 
subaccount for EIplc.  However, two (2) items are required:
(1)  a letter of beneficiary ownership
(2)  Is EIplc a regulated UK company?  If the answer is no, then it (or the 
company reporting for it) must provide a net  asset valuation

Has someone in London already handled these issues?  If not, can one of you 
supply me with that information?  We have spoken with Andrew Bracken in 
London (0207 888 3196) at andrew.bracken@csfb.com

Thanks for your help.  Sara

Carol:  Haven't you been speaking with the confirm desk about identifying 
high volume transactions with "masterless" counterparties?  I don't want to

Definitely want to upgrade #1 - its on my list of ISDA upgrades as follows:

Done:  TXU, JAron
In Progress:  El Paso, Occidental, Reliant
To Do:  Morgan Stanley, Dynegy, Statoil, Vitol, Valero, Sempra

Can your dept provide a breakdown of type of executed masters? There are (as 
of today) 423 masters - can we break out which ones are old ECT masters?  
That may give us some insight in to any others that need upgrades.  Also, the 
confirm desk should be able to tell us the level of activity (as they did 
before) to determine priority.  Eventually, we would like to get to all of 
these; however, establishing new documents where we have none (Cargill, 
Mieco, Idacorp, PanCanadian) is my first priority.

Rod should be able to address #3.

Thanks,
Tanya

As a result of Jeff Nogid's request, here is a recap of the Morgan Stanley 
situation:

(1)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc.
 This is the entity for commodity trading.
 (i)  ECT has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated 6/16/92
 (ii)  ECTRIC has an ISDA dated 3/2/99, but eff. 8/27/97

(2)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
 Jeff Nogid requesting new master for fixed income transactions

(3)  Morgan Stanley International Limited
 This is the entity for equity trading.  Will Nogid or Kinneman ever need 
this one?

Each of these companies has a different lawyer to negotiate the agreement.

Each Morgan Stanley entity might require a separate guaranty.  Anne Clark in 
legal (Cap Services) will let me know.

I will put (2) in place.  Do you want to pursue upgrading (1)(i) or 
addressing (3)?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

agreed to use Enron Corp. as the swap counterparty.

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Sara,

I have attached draft Confirmation of a Collar with Rand Whitney. They want 
to go live with this deal today and send out an executable Confirmation. 
Tanya wants to put a provision in the confirmation that states that the deal 
is subject to Credit approval. If we do not get credit approval Tanya will 
kill the deal. I have left a message with Tanya asking her exactly what she 
wants to say in the Confirmation. Please let me know what you think of the 
Collar the way it is writtne and if we have any language to use for the 
credit provision. I have a meeting at 3:00 an should be back at my desk by 
4:00. 

Thanks,

Jarrod

P.S. SITA? you were going to take a look at the governing law.

Mark:  Please verify for me that you told Susan F. that Samantha would be 
responsible for the brokerage accounts when she joins us.  I wasn't certain 
that Susan knew and I didn't want to spring it on her.  Thanks.  Sara

Gareth:  My comments are generally directed toward the Schedule to the ISDA 
Master Agreement between the Trust and UBS.  Please note that UBS is aware of 
the 12/9/97 master executed between Swiss Bank Corporation and ENA (as it was 
attached to the original fax).  The confirms are pretty straightforward.

(1)  Is the Trust an eligible swap participant?
(2)  The Schedule is missing some "standard" Enron type provisions (which 
were in the Swiss Bank master).  These include:
 limitation of liability
 confidentiality
 setoff  
 isn't the Trust an Enron affiliate?  this could impact our approach.
(3)  Enron does not agree to the ISDA standard jurisdiction language (which 
is non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of NY state and the federal court 
in Manhattan; waiver of all objections).  Enron's preference is arbitration.  
With GC consent, we agree to other provisions (e.g., specifice courts, waiver 
of jury trial, so specific court and no waiver of objections, etc.).  In the 
Swiss Bank master, we agreed to NY law, neither party waived any objections 
to venue/forum, and parties could sue anywhere.
(4)  Is this master to be limited to this transaction only?  If the Trust 
intends to use this agreement for future currency, rate, or other 
transactions, we need to consider the impact of caving on our usual terms.  
What eventually happens to the Trust?

Also, Rod Nelson in credit is currently reviewing Enron exposure to UBS.
Call if you need anything else.  Sara

I spoke with Kevin Zemp this morning and he will e-mail docs to me for

Hello my Esteemed Doctors,

I am in Rodney Malcolm's Commercial Transaction Group focusing on selling 
energy outsourcing relationships to industrial consumers. 
Based on the list of executed master agreements that was provided to us 
recently, many of our targeted industrial customers have not signed our 
master swap agreement. 

In preparation for our transacting with these customers, would you send me as 
soon as possible a copy of our Master Swap Agreement language, a copy of the 
more intermediate "Omnibus" Short form Swap agreement, and a copy of the one 
or two page confirmation agreement.  I will forward to my group so that they 
can become more familiar with the language, and I will also accumulate the 
industrial customers that we are closest to closing deals.  I will then 
forward the names of those customers to you so that we can get these 
documents to the customers in advance of the deals.

If you have any questions or comments, please call me at x35583.  Thank you, 
Tim

We have a separate group in legal that puts these together.  Ed and I are not

are Carol St. Clair (x33989), Sara Shackleton (x35620) and Shari Stack

assist, please let me know.

Hello Bob and Ed.

What is the most efficient way for us to get Master Swap Agreements in place 
with our industrial consumers.  With the commodity energy market going 
through the roof, many of the industrials are asking us to concentrate on 
solving their short term commodity exposure and look to establish a  greater 
outsourcing opportunity in the future.  We do not seem to have Master Swap 
Agreements in place with industrials such as IMC Global, AK Steel, WR Grace, 
and our solutions will involve financial swaps.

Thank you. Tim

Kaye:  I would like to schedule a meeting for sometime after June 8 (when our

orientation on June 8.  If Tana is "training" on June 9, 10, etc., I could

I  would love it if we could meet.  We have made a little bit of headway in 
this effort, but quite frankly, not much.  In fact, I have seen DASH's that 
is indicating the purchase of public equity and I am trying to find out who 
and how etc these are being transacted.  Can you set something up or do you 
need me to. I will bring somebody from my group to help and learn so we 
probably need a conference room.  Thanks for keeping this issue alive.  
Donna  P.S.  Has Marie moved to EBS or is she still with you?

Donna:  It's been awhile since we last spoke about advising Enron companies 
of existing brokerage accounts.  It has also been determined (in legal) that 
the accounts will remain with ME and not move to Alan A.  I have some 
temporary assistance in that an A&K lawyer, Jason Peters, is working up here 
for another few weeks.  I was hoping that we could all meet and put our 
"project" into action.  Please give me a call and suggest some time when we 
may meet.  Thanks.  Sara

Melissa,

I just sold a swap to EPE and I have forwarded a copy of the attachment below 
to them.  They have agreed with the terms in the attachment.  Could you 
coordinate with Sara Shackleton to include the necessary attachment in our 
confirm.

Thanks,

At the request of Sara Shackleton, I am transmitting a proposed form of Annex 
A for the referenced counterparty.  Please call me at x33399 or Sara at 
x35620 if we can be of further assistance.

Kaye:  Can you print a list of the documents in my folders so that I can 
eliminate old items?  Also, am I still subject to the "backup" of documents?

Rod:  Forgive my redundancy, but did I already request (and did you send) a 
credit worksheet for this counterparty?  This is another Clint Freeland/Jeff 
Nogid push for Fastow.  Thanks.  Sara

Jeff and Larry:  Last year, Mary Gosnell prepared a one page summary which 
was used by legal and credit to target the preparation of ISDA Master 
Agreements.  The summary was divided into two parts:  "Without Master 
Agreements" and "With ECT Master Agreements" and included the number of 
trades for the first half of the year.  It is our objective once again to put 
new agreements into place and upgrade existing ECT Master Agreements to ISDA 
Master Agreements.  I don't know if EOL trades have impacted the numbers this 
year and I'm not sure whether we need to create a line item for EOL (I'll 
leave that to your discretion).  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.  Sara

P.S.  We were very successful in negotiating masters appearing on Mary's 
list!

Attached is a new letter for the July 17 payment which ECT owes Sonoco.  
Please review for accuracy.  If it's OK, one of us can fax (with the 
settlement statement) on the payment date.  Thanks.  Sara

Rod/Sara: last week we met with Capex and everything is advancing very well.
They see the signing of the ISDA as a very simple process, as they have 
several of them signed. But we need to take into account the following:
They want to sign 2 ISDAs, 1 with CAPEX and another one with CAPSA, because 
LPG, Oil and power are traded from the different entities
They have a Fiduciary Assignment Agreement with IFC that we need to look at 
and if necessary add some language in the ISDA

We are sending you the IFC Agreement for your review and comment. It will go 
by courrier cause of it's length. Once you receive it pls. review, and if we 
need to discuss anything with Capex, coordinate with Patrick to arrange a 
conference call.
Patrick will be involved in the process as he needs to fully understand the 
ISDA document due to EOL which is scheduled to  come on later this year.

Sara, we will need an ISDA for CAPSA as well. It will be identical to the 
CAPEX I believe. Rod pls provide your input to Sara on credit for Capsa, 
considering the no threshold issue.

I am a derivatives lawyer with ENA in Houston and obtained your name through
one
of my traders who is transacting with Jay Carr in Houston (please see
attached
message below).  When I spoke with Jay earlier this month, I asked him for
the
name of a lawyer but was advised that all Vitol lawyers were in New York and
that he would pass my message along to a lawyer.  I am assuming that you are
the
trading lawyer who can assist me with negotiating an ISDA Master Agreement
between our respective companies.  If not, please let me know and feel free
to
pass this message on to the appropriate attorney.  On April 12, 1995, Enron
Capital & Trade Resources Corp., predecessor in title to ENA, and Vitol
S.A.,
Inc. entered into a Master Agreement which is one of ENA's early energy
price
swap agreements.  Since our companies are currently trading weather
derivatives,
I think you would agree that it would be prudent to supersede the existing
agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement.  This relates to my conversation
with
Jay in that we confirmed our weather deals under the existing master but
incorporated the 1991 and 1993 ISDA definitions into the confirms of our
weather
trades.  Please let me hear from you.  You can reach me via email, phone
(713/853-5620) or fax (713/646-3490).

Jay:  I am a lawyer with Enron.  I called for you on Friday, you're out, and
no
one else could help.  I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1)
replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a
broader
range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant ISDA
definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even though
the
master is an early master energy price swap agreement.  Please call me at
713
853-5620 with the information so that we can move quickly.  Thank you for
your
help.  Sara

All:  I know that credit and legal are currently stretched to the limits but 
pushing your credit priorities will require some coordination.  Here's a 
brief recap of yesterday's meeting:

ALMOST DONE:  Cargill, Idacorp, Utilicorp

BRANT:  Dynegy Canada, Occidental, Duke Energy Marketing Limited P'p

ED:  Mieco, Inc.

RUSSELL:  PanCanadian Energy Services, WPS Energy Services

TANYA:  J.Aron (we need commercial help to push this)

Please review the comments taken at each meeting and distributed to 
everyone.  Please use Lotus Notes to record/review activity.  We are 
depending on you to take needed action as required and we are doing the 
same.  Thanks.  Sara

Tanya:  Please talk to either Carol or Tana.  Maybe they need commercial help 
to get the guaranty.  SS

Tanya:  Please see Vitol response below.  Do you generate the credit 
worksheet?  How does London credit fit in here?  Another interesting feature 
here is the use of the multibranch provision for a trading company (Vitol 
isn't a bank, or is it?).  I have never seen this utilized in practice for a 
non-bank entity and have resisted the idea for us.  There is very little 
written about the application of the multibranch party and I think that is 
because it has been understood as applying to banks.  However, would this 
master be a "multibranch master" for us as well?  Sara

Firstly, thanks for the message. I am indeed the right person for ISDA's in
Vitol. I did meet with your credit people in London ( David Hardy and Lee
Munden) and we did discuss the idea of replacing the existing agreement. I
am at present in our office in Rotterdam, but will be back in Geneva
tomorrow. I therefore do not have the existing agreement with me, but I seem
to remember that it is just signed with Vitol SA Inc, which is the US branch
office of the main trading company in the Vitol Group, Vitol SA, which is a
Swiss company registered in Geneva. I would suggest that you send us a
proposal for an ISDA agreement with Vitol SA, set up as a multibranch
company about to trade out of its Geneva and Houston office, and with Vitol
Holding BV (the ultimate parent company of the group) as the credit support
provider. I would hope that once we have agreed terms for the basic schedule
and credit support annex, we can then easily add other Vitol or Enron
companies as appropriate.

Regards, David

I agree with your proposal but would like to add that in order to determine 
the MAC for Vitol Holding BV, in the absence of a Rating from S& P etc, we 
need to receive details of existing bank covenants which I believe you were 
going to forward to us.

We also need to consider the netting issue between the various entities 
involved in UK Power / Gas / Oil 

Please give me a call if you have any questions

Dear Ms. Shackleton:

Thank you for your recent order placed at
www.bravo.com.  Bravo 20 has recently merged with OFFI

between order receipt and shipping is longer than
usual, as we are in the midst of manufacturing and
re-stocking.

Due to this delay, the approximate shipping date for
your order is 7/25/00, although we hope the actual
ship date will be earlier.  Please do not hesitate to
contact us at 800-383-OFFI(6334) or offiweb@yahoo.com
if you have any questions or if we can be of further
assistance.

Thank you,

Ted:  ENA, formerly Enron Gas Marketing, Inc., opened a futures account with 
Cargill in 1993.  I am advised that there has not been any activity with 
Cargill for many months.  It appears that we had subaccounts for trading 
crude, nat gas, unleaded gas.  We do not have any margin residing with 
Cargill. 

Given our recent discussions regarding inactive equity accounts, I was 
wondering if you had given any thought to inactive futures accounts.  

As of 5/23/00, I see only 13 active futures accounts.  The following accounts 
appear to be dormant:

(1) Bank One - I am currently negotiating to open up a margin line
(2)  Cargill
(3)  Daiwa Securities America
(4)  Gerald Inc. (may have merged or business moved to another firm)
(5)  Merrill Lynch Futures
(6)  Paine Webber
(7)  OM Stockholm (paper)
(8)  Spear, Leeds & Kellogg

general.  Thanks.  Sara

enforceability of arbitration in ISDA agreements between US and Swedish 
parties.  Do you know the answer?  Or do you have any other suggestions?  We

Would you mind to handle this one?  It appears that ETOL is the entity 
involved in the Watershed deal you worked on back in December.

I have been sent a copy of a proposed  ECT-ETOL ISDA Schedule and it is very 
specialized and unlike (despite what Mark Evans wrote) the Riverside 6 
transaction I am working on.   Maybe it is the Schedule used in the Watershed 
deal?? Anyway, I will bring it to you. 

Many thanks, 

Shari
Mark Evans
07/13/99 07:19 PM
Shari,

this has been sent to you because of the similarities with the Teesside 
Riverside 6 swap which you are dealing with. Perhaps you or Mark could let us 
know whether you or someone else will be taking this forward.

The deal is that Enron is providing swap support to the deal which is an 
Enron structured financing to get ETOL off balance sheet. ETOL (Enron 
Teesside Operations Limited) owns the power station at Wilton which we bought 
from ICI at the end of December 1998.

The main factor to bear in mind is that (as in Riverside 6) the swap has to 
be seen in the context of the deal  as a whole and thus there may be 
non-standard provisions in the documentation  which  are deal specific and 
which Enron has to accept in the context of the deal.

Let's speak about this as soon as we know that you will be the person to take 
this forward.

Thanks

     Mark

ETOL is Enron Teesside Operations Holdings Limited, a company we bought in 
December last year.   We are currently arranging the sale of subordinated 
debt and equity in this company to a group of US institutional investors.   
Since the underlying cash flows are sterling but the investors want US$, we 
have entered into a currency swap with Trena and Harry.   The ISDA that 
Jurgen has sent to you has been drafted by Milbank Tweed, counsel to the 
Investors.  Mark Evans is the Enron legal person on the transaction, and our 
outside counsel are Slaughter & May.

The underlying transaction is, I believe, similar to the Teesside deal, in 
that it is subordinated to the investors investment.   The underlying swap is 
for 10 years, but in certain circumstances, largely relating to default by 
ETOL, the swap might be accelerated.

My understanding from Slaughters is that the ISDA is standard for the first 
10 pages and thereafter is specific to the current transaction.

I would suggest that if you feed your comments back via either Mark or 
myself.  My number is +44 171 970 7438.

If you have any further questions, please call.

Regards, Robina

Dear Robina- 

I have received the belowmentioned document from Jurgen.  Can you pls explain 
what or who ETOL is? Do you know who drafted this ISDA Schedule? ECT 
(Houston) Legal? ECTRI (London) Legal? Who am I supposed to neogiate with at 
ETOL? 
What are the underlying transactions that this document governs?

I am the attorney working on the Teesside ISDA and it does not resemble this. 

Any information you can give would be appreciated.

Many thanks, 

Shari Stack

Shari, 
Robina Barker-Bennett from our London treasury group asked me to forward to 
you an ISDA Master agreement from ETOL Trust.  I am going to send you this 
document by air mail.
It seems you have recieved already similair agreements from us. Robina 
mentioned the Teeside ISDA in this context.
Please give either Robina or me a call if you have questions.Thanks
Jurgen.

P.S.: I talked to Gunnar from SEB lately about the ISDA and they really seem

can agree on pricing.  This is the form of agreement they propose.  It 
represents 
the way their 3-way JV owned plant will sell power offtake to marketers such 
as Enron.  I would be interested in your opinion especially if we are close 
to 
commercial agreement.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Duncan Croasdale

Susan:  Please let me review changes to docs.  When will this go out the the 
counterparty?  Sara

Mark:  I have scheduled a 5 pm flight to NO.  I am attending a wedding Friday 
night.  I hope this is not a problem, but let me know.  Also, did you receive 
my voice mail about the Goldman electronic agreement and their denial of my 
request for injunctive relief upon proof of breach?  I'd like to finalize 
this agreement.  Thanks.  Sara

you had sent down for use with an Omnibus contract. Please let me know what 
you think.

Hi, Susan.  Just to let you know that I will have the agreements executed by 
ENA once you have initialled and returned them to me.  Thanks.  Sara

Further to our telephone discussion today with Jason Peters who I couldn't 
find on email. I did some checking around. The clause (which incidently 
normally has a paragraph (d))seems  to be only found in the CBA Agreements. 
Its purpose is a little uncertain. If the Broker was holding a Client's money 
then by law he must account for it. 

The reason why there ARN Ambro may be reluctant to accept the clause is 
because the instances it addresses would probably fall within the definition 
of an "undesirable market event" under the SFE rules. This would trigger 
action by the Board of SFE to sort out the mess. It may uncertain as to how 
these contractual would fit in     

Taffy:  Did you ever deliver a recap of our Tuesday meeting to legal and 
credit?  Sara

Tanya:  my mistake.  I'll put back on.  We've signed; it's their paper.  Sara

Sheung,
I am resending this e-mail to you.
As soon as we have an account number for EDIDE we will give you a letter to 
transfer Shares as a contribution from EPCA  to EDIDE.
We will send a separate letter for instructions for EDIDE to convert the ADRs 
to ordinary Class B Shares.
Thanks. Sheila

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Rafael Rangel
05/24/2000 05:50 PM
Sheila, finally ready to open up the account at Morgan Stanley for EDIDE so 
that EPCA can transfer the correct amount of ADRs.  I have the Corporate 
Resolution from EDIDE.  I understand that the contact at Morgan Stanley has 
changed.  Please advise.

RFR

I will be out on maternity leave soon (hopefully).  In my absence, please

Team,

I have had a few conversations over the past couple of days with Terry 
Brownrigg at Twister Gas Services, LLC and Todd Tharp with Sanguine, Ltd..  
We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet 
for the transaction.  Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small 
E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for 
the transaction.  After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go 
ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the 
confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine.  It is my 
understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the 
confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully 
coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel).

I have attached a worksheet for the transaction (Sanguine agreed to post 
$500K).  Please coordinate with Sara, Sheetal and me in getting this out.

The contact information at Sanguine is:
Todd Tharp
Manager of Gas Contracts
Sanguine, Ltd.

Tulsa, Ok 74136

Thanks,

John

This evening, ECT faxed comments to counterparty's proposed ISDA to both John 
Joel and Douglas Marshall.  We also resent the Credit Support Annex because 
counterparty never commented on ours and failed to include one.  John Joel 
called me this morning to determine when the lawyers could speak.  I told him 
to schedule a conference call because ECT was ready and was faxing comments 
today.  I haven't heard from him.  SS

07/09/99 09:04 AM

In the interest of time, I have revised our draft ISDA Schedule to conform in 
most material respects to the 1994 (effective 1992) agreement executed 
between ERMS and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. ("Old ISDA").  This was 
done to accommadate the Merrill lawyer, Gary Rosenblum (who didn't want to 
read our Schedule!).  The Old ISDA is not identical to the format used by 
Merrill Lynch International today so I'm not sure how hard they will press 
for other changes.  There are two potential credit issues that I see:  (1)  
agreement as to the Enron Corp. guaranty cap (and possible Merrill Lynch 
guaranty cap) and (2) our introduction of a MAC provision in the form of an 
Additional Event of Default (necessary because the Old ISDA had a Credit 
Support Annex and this one does not).  I left a voice mail for Gary Rosenblum 
and asked that he let me know when he was available on Monday to talk AND to 
have his credit person contact Rod Nelson.  Sara

P.S.  I haven't heard from Morgan Guaranty Trust Company or Morgan Stanley 
Capital Services, Inc.

Please ask Tracy if Ed Sacks or anyone else from credit should be included.

Carol:  Here's my "short" list of issues for Mark:

(1)  Swap Group Meeting on Wednesday, June 7:
 (a) reiterate "rules" (e.g., office hours, taking personal/vacation time and 
advising the rest of the group, how rotation of masters/confirms/C.A. works 
and   what happens when someone is ill/vacation, timeliness of deemed 
ISDA's/omnibus confirms, confirmation desk, etc.)
 (b)paralegal workload

(2)  Confirmations and need to create a "writing"
 multiple confirms with the same counterparty 
 confirms with extremely short terms (hourly, under 5 days) - no confirm?
 use of confirms with negative language

(3)  Hiring a clerk to assist paralegals to run errands

(4)  Policy regarding INDIVIDUALS as eligible swap participants

(5)  Method for shortening weather confirms

(6)  Mary and Brent - possible work assignments

Yes, please.

FYI
Carol St Clair has confirmed for me that the GTC does not contemplate a 
'Correction for Prices'. John Suarez states that corrected prices must be 
'flagged' by the ISO with 75 minutes of publication and must be changed 
within 5 days. Since the GTC doesn't contemplate the issue and the mechanism 
is different from ISDA,  I have added some suggested language to the Index, 
as we should contemplate this issue in the Long Description.

My apologies for not having the attachment included in my last e-mail.

The East Power traders would like to commence transacting on financial swaps. 
We had anticipated this, so the Product Type was already built and has been 
approved. The Index and Loadshape built with this Product were done so based 
on comments from John Suarez (the trader), who has approved the attached.

Leslie - please offer commets/suggestions from the power perspective.

Mark - final approval will need to come from you since this is a financial 
product.

Also, trading wants us to consider price changes for the Product because the 
prices published do change from time to time. I know that the ISDA 
Definitions contemplate a 30-day true-up, but I can't find a like provision 
in the GTC. So - I took a hack at some language to contemplate the issue:

"If the price published (as set forth herein) on any day during a 
Determination Period is subsequently corrected and the correction is 
announced within 30 calendar days of the original publication date, the 
parties agree that the corrected price shall take affect as if it were the 
price published on the original publication date and the Floating Price will 
be adjusted accordingly. Payments of the adjusted Floating Amount will take 
place 5 business days following notification by either party of a change to a 
published price."

be consistent.  I left Leslie a vm. SS

Melissa:  I've revised your list slightly for my purposes.  Can you take a 
quick look?  We can refine the format tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara

p.s.  It sure looks like a lot of people have their hands on the "power 
correction language".  I'm meeting with Tom May this afternoon.

Brent, Andrea and I had a "status" conversation this afternoon.  Brent will 
go to Sao Paulo on July 20 to meet with Andrea, Randy and commercial people.  
Andrea has requested that you and I go to Brazil after July 28 when the 
outside lawyer is back from vacation.  In general, the three of us are 
conforming and updating physical resolutions (final and proposed) and 
identifying additional research necessary to address the financial trading 
issues.  These are related to specific deals originating in Brazil (which are 
truly settled financially, e.g., a purported prepay where no physical 
commodity was to be delivered) and issues arising here in Houston (e.g., the 
Hickerson request for fixed income, FX and equity trading).  Brent will be 
discussing pending transaction structures while in Sao Paulo. 

It appears  that Brent is the "point person" for dealing directly with the

Add the first one to the ISDA status list.

For the S. Africa entity ENA legal needs to be informed of this as they 
usually deal with S. Africa. Suggest you contact Carol St. Clair as to 
whether she is happy for us to run with this if we are just going to be doing 
deals from Europe.

We would like to begin to establish ISDA agreements with the following 
entities:

Anglo American plc (www.angloamerican.co.uk) based in London and

Anglo American Corporation of South Africa Limited.

The annual financial statement  of Anglo American plc can be taken from the 
website above. I have asked the folks at Anglo American in Johannesburg, 
South Africa for the financials for the Anglo American Corporation.

Can you take a look at this for me please?

Thanks

How are we coming with the ISDA agreement for MP with parental guarantee from 
Heritage?

Also, does MP need to invoice ENA for May SWAP transactions or do you issue a 
credit invoice and wire
transfer payment to MP? (Deal #s NA 1279.1 and 1279.2).

Brant:  Is this really high priority (for our legal/credit discussions)?  We 
haven't heard from these guys since April 13.  Sara

Rod:  What's going on with this dudes?  They just sent me a huge agreement 
relating to their arrangement with the International Finance Corp. and 
hedging agreements.  Sara

For ALL options for this party, we need to revise the opening sentence to 
read:

"... the terms and conditions of the Transaction ... on the Trade Date 
specified below (the "Transaction") which is an option offered by Small 
Ventures USA, LLC to ENA, and accepted by ENA, pursuant to a telephone 
conversation between the parties."

I believe this to be true.  I spoke with the Utilicorp lawyer when I 
documented the "Australian" weather trade and discussed transfer of the 
weather deal to the new master. We should talk to our Aquila trader.

	Tanya Rohauer
	06/06/2000 06:50 PM
		
Do we know if this is where they plan to trade weather derivatives now 
(instead of Aquila Risk)?

We have received the following executed Master Agreement:

Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)

Effective Date:   May 3, 2000

Counterparty:   UtiliCorp United Inc.

Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of: Pulp 
& Paper
          Foreign Exchange 

Stewart:  I'll have to review their master to be certain (and insure that 
there is no specific prohibition against weather transactions).  In general, 
there is nothing else required specifically, although we may have to add some 
language to the weather confirmations themselves.  Sara

Would you mind to handle this one?  It appears that ETOL is the entity 
involved in the Watershed deal you worked on back in December.

I have been sent a copy of a proposed  ECT-ETOL ISDA Schedule and it is very 
specialized and unlike (despite what Mark Evans wrote) the Riverside 6 
transaction I am working on.   Maybe it is the Schedule used in the Watershed 
deal?? Anyway, I will bring it to you. 

Many thanks, 

Shari
Mark Evans
07/13/99 07:19 PM
Shari,

this has been sent to you because of the similarities with the Teesside 
Riverside 6 swap which you are dealing with. Perhaps you or Mark could let us 
know whether you or someone else will be taking this forward.

The deal is that Enron is providing swap support to the deal which is an 
Enron structured financing to get ETOL off balance sheet. ETOL (Enron 
Teesside Operations Limited) owns the power station at Wilton which we bought 
from ICI at the end of December 1998.

The main factor to bear in mind is that (as in Riverside 6) the swap has to 
be seen in the context of the deal  as a whole and thus there may be 
non-standard provisions in the documentation  which  are deal specific and 
which Enron has to accept in the context of the deal.

Let's speak about this as soon as we know that you will be the person to take 
this forward.

Thanks

     Mark

  
Robina Barker-Bennett

ETOL is Enron Teesside Operations Holdings Limited, a company we bought in 
December last year.   We are currently arranging the sale of subordinated 
debt and equity in this company to a group of US institutional investors.   
Since the underlying cash flows are sterling but the investors want US$, we 
have entered into a currency swap with Trena and Harry.   The ISDA that 
Jurgen has sent to you has been drafted by Milbank Tweed, counsel to the 
Investors.  Mark Evans is the Enron legal person on the transaction, and our 
outside counsel are Slaughter & May.

The underlying transaction is, I believe, similar to the Teesside deal, in 
that it is subordinated to the investors investment.   The underlying swap is 
for 10 years, but in certain circumstances, largely relating to default by 
ETOL, the swap might be accelerated.

My understanding from Slaughters is that the ISDA is standard for the first 
10 pages and thereafter is specific to the current transaction.

I would suggest that if you feed your comments back via either Mark or 
myself.  My number is +44 171 970 7438.

If you have any further questions, please call.

Regards, Robina

Dear Robina- 

I have received the belowmentioned document from Jurgen.  Can you pls explain 
what or who ETOL is? Do you know who drafted this ISDA Schedule? ECT 
(Houston) Legal? ECTRI (London) Legal? Who am I supposed to neogiate with at 
ETOL? 
What are the underlying transactions that this document governs?

I am the attorney working on the Teesside ISDA and it does not resemble this. 

Any information you can give would be appreciated.

Many thanks, 

Shari Stack

Shari, 
Robina Barker-Bennett from our London treasury group asked me to forward to 
you an ISDA Master agreement from ETOL Trust.  I am going to send you this 
document by air mail.
It seems you have recieved already similair agreements from us. Robina 
mentioned the Teeside ISDA in this context.
Please give either Robina or me a call if you have questions.Thanks
Jurgen.

P.S.: I talked to Gunnar from SEB lately about the ISDA and they really seem 
to be very slow in their legal department. Thanks for your up-dates.

hello Sara,

I think this should be a high priority once they take on an ISDA attorney.  
Per your recommendation, I contacted Randy Curry, President of Bridgeline and 
passed along your thoughts about Jason.  I gave him your phone number and he 
sounded enthusiastic about wanting to talk with him.  God knows they need an 
attorney.

Right now, I think we can take this off the priority list.

Dear Ms. Shackleton,

I refer to your fax dated 6th March, 2000.

The seller whether it is an Indian company or a foreign company is not
required to be registered with the BSE for the purpose of selling publicly
traded shares held by it of an Indian Company.  Only brokers and other
intermediaries such as merchant bankers etc. are required to be registered
with SEBI or BSE.

Please note that Vinay Dwarkadas is no longer working with us.

Just got off the phone with outside counsel for Credit Agricole.  We're very 
close. 
Tanya:  Can you tell me what products we trade? Are there many outstanding 
transactions?  Also, I'd like to make sure that the "credit worksheet" is 
current.  It looks like we're working off of something dated 1/31/96 (Terry 
Donovan!!!!!).  This must be wrong.

morning (6/2) since we didn't know who would handle.  I remember, now, I 
checked the log in book while Susan was at lunch and it wasn't there so when 
I asked her about it, she told me she was holding a prior confirm for Twister 
( apparently inactive until further notice) and she was now going to handle 
this one.   I reminded her that I was leaving early to fly to NO so that I'd

Team,

I have had a few conversations over the past couple of days with Terry 
Brownrigg at Twister Gas Services, LLC and Todd Tharp with Sanguine, Ltd..  
We transacted with Twister last week and I had sent you a credit worksheet 
for the transaction.  Twister is a broker who transacts on behalf of small 
E&P companies, and in this case, the E&P agreed to post the L/C we quoted for 
the transaction.  After talking to Sara, it sounds like we are going to go 
ahead and send a confirmation to Twister for the deal and attach to the 
confirmation an assignment of the deal from Twister to Sanguine.  It is my 
understanding that both Terry and Todd will need to sign both the 
confirmation and the assignment, so I think we will need to carefully 
coordinate the steps through the Confirmation Desk (Sheetal Patel).

I have attached a worksheet for the transaction (Sanguine agreed to post 
$500K).  Please coordinate with Sara, Sheetal and me in getting this out.

The contact information at Sanguine is:

We have a total of .77 cents remaining in our account with Cargill.

Since we have several acounts in addition to Crude Oil, it is my

we do not cancel the account as traders may want to utilize Cargill for other 
commodities.

Could you check the non-India trading names and titles to make sure they are 
current.  I checked with Samantha but she said she was having computer 
problems and wasn't familiar with the names.  And, obviously, we will not 
have this done by Monday morning.  Is there anything we can do to get the

Once Sara checks the non-India names, may I have your permission to put your

Hi David & Sheila,

As you will see from the DASH that Rajesh Agarwal is separately faxing to 
you, Rediff.com India Limited is issuing American Depository Shares (ADSs)

As discussed, we would like to bid for $ 4 mn equivalent at the clearing 
price, subject to a maximum price of $12 per ADS. This works out to approx. 
333,333 shares - however if the clearing price is lower, then we would get a 
higher number of shares.

We would appreciate it if you could put in a word to your contact at Goldman 
to let them know that the order is coming in.

Our contact in Goldman Sachs, Hong Kong is Vijay Karnani: +852 2978 1685 (W),

FYI.  It would seem we still have a lot of ground to cover on selling Genesys.
Chandran Bhaskar

Dear Rahul,

Your mail on the above subject refers.

As regards to the approvals to be followed in sale of the Genesys shares by 
Enron Distribution Ventures MHC Ltd., Mauritius, i list below the following:

(A) Approvals required:
Per section 10 B (1) the FEMA Regulations effective 1 June 2000, transfer by 
way of sale by a person resident outside India of the shares / debentures 
held by him to person resident in India will require prior permission of RBI. 
Veena, your activity chart shows that Form TS 1 is to be filed after the sale 
is effected, money received and at the time of remittance of sale proceeds. 
Since, the Act prescribes prior approval, we should sell only after receipt 
of RBI approval and not before.
The requisite form to be filed for seeking approval is Form TS1. 
If we are effecting the sale through a private arrangement , the application 
should be supported with the average quotation of the share price ( average 
of daily high and low) for one week proceeding the date of application, duly 
certified by a Chartered Accountant. If the sale proposed to be effected on 
the floor of the exchange to the general public at the prevailing market 
price, the Chartered Accountant's certification is not required. Since, we 
intend selling at the floor, this certification is not required.

(B) Thinly Traded:
I refer to Veena's query on whether Genesys shares are thinly traded. Per 
section 10 - Explanation i) the share will be treated as thinly traded if the 
annualised trading turnover in that share, on a main stock exchanges in 
India, during the six  calendar months preceding the month in which the 
application is made, is less than 2%( by number of shares) of the listed 
stock.
Though we can take a view that Genesys shares are listed for trading only 
from 5 June 2000, it is to be noted that the new shares issued to (a) the 
erstwhile Genesys shareholders are issued as a result of the scheme of 
amalgamation approved by the High Court, Mumbai & (b)  the applicants of the 
private placement ( incl. Enron) and the new amalgamated company, Genesys 
International Corporation Limited, whose previous name was Aeke Trading and 
Investments Limited, was a listed Company at the Mumbai Stock Exchange. 
Hence, it is advisable to check whether the shares of AEKE were thinly traded 
or not. FYI, the Paid - Up Equity of AEKE prior to the Amalgamation was 
2,40,000 Equity Shares of Rs. 10/- each aggregating Rs. 24,00,000/-. We can 
apply the test as explained above on the AEKE shares prior to Genesys 
amalgamation just to satisfy ourselves that it was not thinly traded.
It is better to check this provision. 

(C) Formalities for remittance:
Per section 11of the FEMA Regulations, remittance of sale proceeds shall be 
made by a authorised dealer upon:
satisfying himself that the security was held by the seller on repatriation 
basis ( we need to submit the Foreign Collaboration Approval Letter No. 3/9 
SIA/NFC 99 NRI to the AD)
submission of the contract note of the Broker effecting the sale and 
submission of a No Objection Certificate/ tax clearance certificate.

(D) Income Tax - NoC / TCC:
I understand from Veena that there is a current thinking that through a 
Chartered Accountants Certificate stating the double taxation treaty, we need 
not obtain the NoC of the IT. In my view, since the regulation stipulates an 
NoC / TCC from the IT Department, i doubt whether it is doable without a BoC 
/ TCC of the IT. 
In the past, this was followed and with an Undertaking from the Company, 
supported with a Chartered Accountants Certificate,confirming there are no 
tax implications in the underlying transaction, one could remit the funds 
without a NoC/TCC from IT. But, given a very specific statement u/s 11 of the 
FEMA Regulations and the same being introduced only from 1 June and hasn't 
been time tested, i doubt whether the Authorised Dealer will accept our view 
and effect fund transfer with an Undertaking and CA Certification. 
In my view, NoC would be a pre requisite. 

(E) Bank Account:
Assuming that the NoC is required, there will be a timing difference between 
we receive the sale proceeds and remitting the money to Mauritius after 
obtaining the NoC from IT. It is certainly not advisable to hold the 
instrument without encashing it. Hence, opening of a Bank Account in India to 
encash the instrument  is warranted. I refer to Mike's mail on allowing the 
Broker to hold the funds in a trust account for EDVMHC. In my view, instead 
of the Broker holding the same, the AD himself can hold it on trust for 
EDVMHC. But this needs to checked and properly documented with the Bank ( 
Authorised Dealer) and as well at EDVMHC. From Due Diligence and Compliance 
point of view, i would suggest to take the route of opening of an rupee Bank 
Account than the trust route. 
Since it is not a demated shares, opening of an custodial account is not 
required. This needs to be checked with the authorised dealer.

(F) Application to RBI / TS 1:
I suggest that while making the RBI Application under TS 1, it is advisable 
to state and seek their concurrence or keep them informed as to point E 
above. We could mention in our application to RBI and seek approval as to (a) 
opening of an rupee account or (b) authorising the AD to hold the same in an 
trust account for EDVMHC. RBI while according its approval, will look in to 
the transaction and accord approval for this as well. 
May be, before filing the application with RBI, we could meet with the 
concerned official in Exchange Control Department and walk him through with 
the transaction so that the approval is obtained at the earliest.

(G) Original Funds:
I understand that while making this investment, the funds have not come in 
from EDVMHC, Mauritius or it has come from a Company from Caymon Islands. Tax 
need to confirm whether the money received from Cayco ( though on behalf of 
an Mauritius Company) would qualify for tax benefits.  

(H) Confirmation by Genesys on non Lock-in:
There are no documents available like the Board Resolution while alloting the 
Shares to EDVMHC or the application to Stock Exchange which would specify 
distinctive numbers of the Lock-in Shares nor it is stated in the Information 
Memorandum as whether shares offered under this IM are freely tradable. 
Though the SEBI Guidelines are clear that if the shares do not form part of 
the Promoters Quoto, they are freely tradable, it is advised that we take a 
certificate from Genesys on this. I have spoken this with Rajesh who 
confirmed that such a certificate from Genesys can be otained without any 
difficulty.

Please feel free and do call me for any further assistance from my end.

Bhaskar

input into Rahul please.
Rahul Basu
06/07/2000 12:37 PM
Seems to me from a read of the regulations that we are required 

Clause 10 B (1) to get RBI approval for the transfer on a TS1 form. Please 
note that the TS1 form requires a CA certificate
If we sell on an exchange through a broker, clause 10 B (2) (a) (i) will 
apply. Since the transfer takes place when its recorded on the register held 
by the company, there is time from when the sale order is given to the 
broker. 
Clause 11 (2) provides the conditions by which the AD will repatriate the 
money to Mauritius. Please note the requirement for an IT clearance in clause 
11 (2) (c). Also, it seems from Clause 11 (2) (b) that if we sell through the 
exchange, then approval of RBI under the TS1 is not required for the 
repatriation.

I spoke with Eugenie Sibeud at Goldman Sachs who is a local market expert.  
She spoke with someone from Hong Kong.

Per Eugenie, We probably do not need an FII (which takes the 9 months to 
obtain) but we will probably need a FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) Form to 
sell the shares.  This form needs to be approved by RBI (Royal Bank of India) 
taking approximately 3 weeks and is good for a specified period of time (e.g. 
3 months). 

She said that we may be able to complete the sale by opening a cash account 
with Standard Charter Bank (GSs agent) or a special purpose account which 
would stay open only for a month.
Eugenie is going to get back to me and forward to me the specifics which I 
have tried to summarize above.
Thanks. Sheila.

Jen:  This is a good question and I think that the PG&E lawyer may be 
confused here with instructions to her traders.  
The PG&E trader can call either an ECC or ENA trader BUT a transaction will 
ALWAYS be booked and confirmed in the name of ENA under the executed ENA ISDA 
Master Agreement with PG&E.  For internal purposes, the trade will either 
remain on an ENA book or backed to an ECC book.  I hope this answers your 
question.  Sara

	Jennifer Fraser
	06/10/2000 04:49 PM
		 
Sara;
One last thing is remaining.
Does PG&E have to have an ISDA with ECT Canada in order to trade with them? 
Can't Canada trades be covered under our ISDA. PG&E told me that in order to 
trade with Canada, they would have to trade through us. Can't they just call 
canada direct and then we can confirm the trade under our ISDA? 

Please call me to discuss.
Thanks

Sara,

I have drafted the attached based on what we did for the GDR acquisition.  
Could you check the non-India trading names and titles to make sure they are 
current.  I checked with Samantha but she said she was having computer 
problems and wasn't familiar with the names.  And, obviously, we will not 
have this done by Monday morning.  Is there anything we can do to get the 
account opened on an expedited basis and then follow up with paperwork later?

Lena,

Once Sara checks the non-India names, may I have your permission to put your 
initials on these documents and get them signed?

Thanks,
Lauren

David:

Thank you for the email.  I left a message for you to call (let me know 
what's convenient and I'll make myself available) because we were trying to 
make the language generic enough to include all future products which might 
fall into this category.  We considered the following:

Alternative 1:  "For purposes of any Transaction in a Commodity for which 
there is either no market or for which the market is illiquid, Party B 
recognizes that (i) this market is less liquid than other OTC derivatives 
markets; . . ."   

Alternative 2:  "For purposes of any Transaction in which the relevant 
Commodity is traded in a market that is newer or less liquid than other OTC 
derivatives markets, Party B recognizes that (i) such market is newer or less 
liquid than other OTC derivatives markets; . . . "

We also considered adding some type of statement that specifies newer 
products without limiting future applicability (i.e.. "including but not 
limited to paper and pulp").  Also, "newer market" may not mean illiquid.  
"No market" could mean that we are the only market maker.

Your language places the onus on us to continually identify these illiquid 
products either in the Schedule, by amendment to the Schedule or in a 
separate writing.
Can we please discuss?  I am free all afternoon.  Thanks.  Sara

We are continuing to send Deemed ISDA's to this entity (periodically) and 
have transacted with other Glencore entities in the past.   I would like to 
generate a draft ISDA and send to these guys because it will make our life 
easier (and we say as much in a Deemed ISDA).  Thanks.  Sara

draft of yours.  Please send ASAP.  How long will it take for you to 
execute?  Sara

At the request of Sara Shackleton, attached is a blacklined version of the 
Schedule to ISDA Master Agreement, which compares the newest version (dated 
6/8/2000) against the version (dated 6/2/2000), which I sent to you under my 
E:mail transmission of June 2nd.

Please be advised, Sara has not been able to review your "confidentiality" 
provision at this time.  She would like to schedule a conference call with 
you on Monday, June 12th, in order to so.  Please let her know your 
availablity.

Also, direct a copy to either Sara or me of the draft Guaranty to be provided 
by Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc.

Hi Sara,

I met with accounting regarding these amounts. I will be forwarding a copy to 
you.

We have a total of .77 cents remaining in our account with Cargill.

Since we have several acounts in addition to Crude Oil, it is my 
recommendation that
we do not cancel the account as traders may want to utilize Cargill for other 
commodities.

Regards,
David

What were the dollar amounts on the printout that you sent to me?

	David P Dupre
	05/24/2000 06:06 PM
		 
Cargill said that we do not have a line of credit nor do we have money 
sitting in an account with them.
The account is inactive at this time.

Let's review our next step when you have an opportunity.
Thanks

This provision is an election which we have added to the Schedule for 
governmental entities.  I believe that it is intended to eliminate any 
confusion that historically arose during the debate between "First Method" 
(one-way payments) and "Second Method" (two-way payments) for Early 
Termination purposes.  Although I can't find a good reason to continue to use 
this provision with an ISDA (except that it emphasizes the point), I can 
understand why we may have added it to a pre-ISDA agreement with a 
governmental.  The only example that I could locate was our September 21, 
1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District.  For those of 
you who have never seen this form, it was one of the two types of master 
agreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA.  Because 
these forms didn't contemplate municipal counterparties, we had to add many 
of the ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions.  The Part 
5(b)(k) provision originally appeared in this early agreement.  It was 
included in the "Event of Change" section [5F(4)] (which is tantamount to the 
ISDA concept of "Illegality", a "Termination Event").  I think it was 
probably included because in the ISDA, Second Method is the automatic payment 
method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early 
Termination purposes, but there isn't a comparable provision in the old ECT 
form.

Hi Shari,

I'm sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you.  I had to get a few
people involved and it took a lot longer than I anticipated.  However, I
have things organized now and have summarized my comments below.  In
addition, we reviewed your form of guarantee.  I have attached a mark up of
your guarantee to conform with our form of guarantee and where possible
amended our form of guarantee to conform with yours.  (I believe there were
some conversations between my trader and your credit officer about
increasing the amount under your guarantee to $35,000,000.)

I think it would be helpful if we used my comments below and the blackline
of the guarantees as an agenda for a call to finalize the Agreement.  Please
let me know when you would be available.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Suanne

Part 1(b) Threshold Amount:  I know we agreed in concept to have the
Threshold Amount apply collectively to each party and their Credit Support
Provider, but I'm not sure we get there with your amendment.  May I suggest
the following:

  Threshold Amount means, with respect to Party A and its
Credit Support Provider, collectively, U.S. $100,000,000; and with respect
to Party B and its Credit Support Provider, collectively, U.S. $100,000,000.

Part 1(g) Credit Event Upon Merger:  Thank you for adding the last sentence,
however, may I suggest clarifying it further as follows:

  If such additional Eligible Credit Support is not provided,
or if additional Eligible Credit Support is deemed inadequate by Y in its
sole discretion, then the provisions of Section 5(b)(iv) shall apply without
amendment.

Part 2(b) Payee Representations:  I am still waiting for a response from my
tax department.

Part 3(a) Agreement to Deliver Documents:  (a) The W-8 ECI is not in effect
until next year, so we will only be able to deliver a W-8.  In addition, we
believe the delivery requirements are a little onerous and we would prefer
to deliver the forms upon execution and thereafter upon request.  ECT's
delivery requirements should be substantially similar.  (c) We will provide
you with a copy of DLJIC's Memorandum of Association.  We would also like to
receive similar documentation from ECT evidencing its authority to execute
the Agreement.

Part 4(c) Calculation Agent.  Below please find sample language:

  Calculation Agent.  The Calculation Agent will be Party A
and Party B jointly or, in the event of a dispute, a reputable, unaffiliated
financial institution appointed by the parties.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, upon the occurrence of an Event of
Default or Termination Event with respect to a party, the Non-defaulting
Party or the non-Affected Party, as the case may be, or, in the
circumstances where there are two Affected Parties, as agreed between the
parties, shall be the sole Calculation Agent.

Part 4(i) Jurisdiction.  We can agree to this clause provided that you agree
to conduct proceedings in New York City.

Part 5(g) Setoff.  We can agree to your setoff clause with the following
amendments:

  in line 2, insert "sole" prior to "non-Affected Party"

  in line 3 and 5, please insert "(whether at such time or in
the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency)" following "amounts
owed" in each line

Part 5(r) Consent to Recording.  Please add the following clause as
requested:

  (c) Consent to Recording. The parties agree that each
may electronically record all telephone conversations between them and that
any such recordings may be submitted in evidence to any court or in any
proceeding for the purpose of establishing any matters pertinent to any
Transaction, provided, however, that notwithstanding the terms of this
clause, the parties do not waive any rights they may have under the
applicable rules of evidence.

CSA (b)(ii) Eligible Collateral.  I believe we discussed adding Treasuries
with maturities greater than one year.  We propose Treasuries under one year
with a Valuation Percentage of 99%, 1-5 years at 97% and 5-10 years at 95%.

CSA (b)(iv)(B) Thresholds.  Please remove "Potential Event of Default"

CSA (d) Conditions Precedent.  We asked that Tax Event and Tax Event Upon
Merger be excluded as Specified Conditions.  There is no reason to stop
collateralizing a Transaction upon the occurrence of these events, because
if at the end of the remedy period the Transaction is terminated, then the
posted collateral will be returned, if applicable, according to the normal
procedures of the CSA.  If the Transaction is terminated and the settlement
amount is not paid, then the non-Affected Party has the right to liquidate
the Collateral to satisfy its claim and you would want all Transactions,
including the affected transaction, to be fully collateralized at that time.

CSA (f) Dispute Resolution.  (i) We can agree to two Local Business Days to
resolve a dispute.  (ii) We suggested that the parties look to market
standard screens before polling dealers to determine Value.  This is our
standard definition of Value:

  Value. For the purpose of Paragraph 5(i)(C) and 5(ii), the
Value of Posted Collateral other than Cash will be equal to the sum of (i)
the face value of the Posted Collateral multiplied by the product of (A)
either (x) the closing bid price as quoted by Bloomberg Financial Markets or
Dow Jones Telerate Services as of Resolution Time or (y) the sum of the
arithmetic mean of the closing bid prices quoted by three mutually-agreed
upon Reference Market-Makers for the relevant security on the relevant date
and (B) the applicable Valuation Percentage plus (ii) the accrued interest
on such security (except to the extent Transferred to a party pursuant to
any applicable provisions of this Agreement or included in the applicable
price referred to in (i) of this clause) as of such date.

(iii) We can agree to transfer only the undisputed amount.

CSA (g) Holding and Using Posted Collateral.  I have several thoughts on
this section.  The Credit Rating for a party should include both S&P and
Moody's and a party's ability to hold Posted Collateral should be based on
the lower of those two.  However, if the Posted Collateral is a letter of
credit, then a party should be entitled to hold the letter of credit
regardless of their Credit Rating.  Under the terms of (g)(i), the party and
it's Custodian are individually entitled to hold Posted Collateral.
However, there are no requirements for a Custodian.  I believe the
requirement of a Qualified Institution should apply to the Custodian.  If
there is a ratings requirement for the party in order for it to hold Posted
Collateral and the party is no longer in compliance with that ratings
requirement, then in order to comply with the general terms of the CSA, the
party would have to transfer the Posted Collateral to a Custodian which met
the requirements of a Custodian or else it would be in breach of the
agreement (which would be an Event of Default if not remedied within 30
days).  Therefore, if you apply the requirements of a Qualified Institution
to a Custodian under (g)(i), then (g)(ii)(2) and (3) can be removed.
Finally, we would like the requirements of the Custodian to be a rating of
at least A/A2 and having total assets of at least US $10,000,000,000.

CSA (h)(iii) Alternative to Interest Amount.  Subparagraph (A) should not
apply.  In the event that the downgraded party is the Secured Party (and
they were at the time of downgrade holding Posted Collateral) and Posted
Collateral is moved to a Custodian, there is no reason why the Pledgor, who
was not downgraded, should be penalized by not receiving interest payments
in the form of cash when they are paid on the Posted Collateral.  As a
matter of fact, it is my understanding that it is more difficult
operationally to reinvest such funds and much easier to pay them to the
Pledgor.

CSA (m) Other Provisions.  The definition of Federal Funds Effective Rate is
not necessary.  Please amend the definition of Letter of Credit to reflect
the requirements of the issuing bank to include a rating of A/A2 and having
total assets of at least US $10,000,000,000.  The definition of Material
Adverse Change should be amended to reflect the rating of both Moody's and
S&P.

Exhibit A Letter of Credit Provisions.  (b) Please delete the parenthetical
in line 3 to 4 and conform (i) to the amended definition of Letter of Credit
with respect to the requirements of the issuing bank.  (d)(ii) Y should be
entitled to draw under the LC in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph
8 of the CSA and not only upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.  The
first sentence of this section should be amended accordingly.  (e) Please
clarify the intent of this section.  It is rather confusing as written.

Schedule I.  The statement to be presented to the issuing bank should
conform to the circumstances under Paragraph 8 of the CSA under which the
Secured Party can demand payment and not just be limited to an Event of
Default.

them to avoid future problems.  I understand that one is already in existence 
between this c/p and ECT.  I suggest that we could mirror this and send it to

Below is the response that we received from our Agent.  Please call me at
(2120 902-1930 with any questions that you may have.

This has reference to our telecon. Enclosed is the relevant RBI regulation
for the captioned company (ABC) to sell its stake in the local company. To
effect the sale, ABC would require an approval from Reserve Bank of India
(RBI) even though the stock is listed. The documentation required varies
depending on whether the stock is thinly traded or actively traded. RBI's
definition of thinly traded is included in the regulation.

The company is required to fill out Form TS1 (I  am enclosing the format)
and submit this to RBI. In addition, the RBI requires certain documents
which are detailed in the form itself.

Trust this helps. Any other information that you require, please do not
hesitate to get in touch.

Paul:  I think you are trying to avoid me!  Hope all is well and you are just 
overworked and overwhelmed.  I am now working with Moazzam Khoja in Houston 
who is part of the enroncredit.com group most of which (as I understand) is 
located in London.  In connection with that group's activities, I have some 
questions and all fingers point to you.

(1)  Do you have credit derivative research that may be applicable for credit 
derivative transactions (including your online "bankruptcy swap") in the US?  
I am sure that you've already explored the "insurance" issue and I don't want 
to duplicate reasearch, if possible.
(2)  What forms have you devised?  Are they online?   Should I just grab a 
password?
(3)  Are the enroncredit.com traders in the UK required by the SFA to take an 
SFA exam (I'm guessing it's a broker or securities exam)?  Is trading in 
credit derivatives regulated, or regulated differently than other types of 
derivatives?  I am trying to determine whether Moazzam needs to take the 
Series 7 here in the US; our traders taking that exam must be dealing in 
"securites" for that exam to be necessary.
(4)  Where is enroncredit.com headed?

I would very much appreciate your [PROMPT] reply.  Sara

Rod:  I'm thinking ahead with respect to Enron Corp./Hickerson matters.  A 
few current issues include:

(1)  Nogid/Freeland seem to be entering into more equity swaps.  I have asked 
that copes of all equity transactions be forwarded to my attention 
immediately.  The first order of business includes transacting with the 
following parties in the following order:
 1.  Credit Suisse First Boston ("CSFB").  We have an ECT ISDA with Credit 
Suisse Financial Products which I believe is the predecessor to CSFB.  Can 
you verify?  Do we need to amend or create a new master?
 2.  Bear Stearns (I believe that it will be Bear Stearns International 
Limited because equities are done offshore)
 3.  Lehman Brothers Finance S.A.  (you already provided credit)

Please let me know about 1 and 2 above.

(2)  Credit derivatives and distressed loan transactions

On May 18, 2000, I provided you with a list of the types of transactions 
originating in Kinneman's group by ECT Investments.  Do these guys ever need 
to communicate with credit?  How do you monitor? 

Please let me know who I should be speaking with about these transactions.

Do you think that we should give Susan B., Susan F.  and Tana an expression 
of thanks for their work during Marie's departure?  I was thinking that a 
gift certificate would be appropriate (e.g., spa services, Enron gift 
products, etc.) and it might send the message that we do know and appreciate 
their efforts.   Sara

Jaime,

In connection with our telephone conversation with Susan Helton last Friday, 
I wanted to follow up with you regarding the possibility of Enron North 
America Corp. ("ENA") assigning some or all of its ISDA agreements entered 
into with Mexican counterparties to an Enron entity formed under the laws of 
Mexico ("Enron Mexico").  Such a transfer would cause ENA to be subject to 
U.S. federal income tax (at a 35 percent rate) on the value of the contracts 
assigned.

As we discussed, one alternative may be for Enron Mexico to enter into new 
ISDA agreements with the Mexican counterparties, and to allow the ISDA 
agreements entered into by Mexican counterparties with ENA to lapse or, 
alternatively, to cancel such agreements.  While such an alternative may be 
preferable from a U.S. tax perspective, other business concerns must also be 
considered (such as credit issues).

Please contact me at ext. 35777 if you'd like to discuss further.

Best regards,

Jeff

The market for this Transaction is less liquid than other OTC derivatives 
markets and, accordingly, this Transaction may be subject to greater risk 
than other derivatives transactions.

This should be added to the confirm as:

Sara:

    As promised, this email discusses the securities laws issues involved
with equity derivatives, I
then make a few observations about the relationship between the securities
and commodities laws, and I
then makes some comments on the confirmations you sent me (both securities
laws comments and other
comments.

The principal securities laws issues relate to the fact that the equity
derivative itself is a security and to the
issue of whether and to what extent a counterparty=01,s activities in
establishing or unwinding a hedge are
attributable to the issuer.  When Enron enters into a derivative and the
counterparty goes out into the
market to make a purchase, is that purchase attributable to Enron?  When it
unwinds its hedge by making
a sale, is the counterparty=01,s sale attributable to Enron and therefore
required to be registered?  Here are
the principal issues:

1)  Rule 10b-5.  When Enron enters into a derivative, it must be sure it
does
not have undisclosed
material inside information regarding its affairs.  It is my understanding
that the traders are
supposed to check with Rex Rogers on the issue of whether Enron possesses
such information.
Although it could discharge its obligations under Rule 10b-5 by disclosing
the information to the
counterparty, that would probably be unacceptable since the counterparty
would then be in
possession of material inside information and could not engage in a market
transaction to hedge.
Thus, each time it enters into an equity derivative in its own stock, Enron
must be confident that
the public has available to it all material information regarding Enron.

2)  Rule 10b-18.  This rule permits issuers and persons acting in concert
with issuers to repurchase
the issuer=01,s  shares under a =01&safe harbor=018 that says in effect tha=
t if
purchases are made pursuant
to the rule they won=01,t be deemed to be manipulative by reason of the tim=
ing
and amounts of the
bids or purchases.  It is typical for an issuer to require its counterparty
to make purchases
pursuant to the rule.  Sometimes this is a contractual undertaking in the
confirmation, and in
some cases the issuer will simply obtain an oral commitment from the
counterparty to engage in
its hedges pursuant to the rule.  Obviously, it is better to have it in
writing.

3)  Registration of Sales.  If Enron decides to net share settle and issues
shares to the counterparty,
those are obviously restricted securities that cannot be sold by the
counterparty in the absence of a
registration statement.  But what about the resales by the issuer when it
unwinds its hedge that it
has put on by buying shares in the open market?  Are those sales
attributable
to the issuer so
therefore required to be registered?  I have seen lots of counterparties,
based on advice of their
law firms, take different positions on this:

a)  Some counterparties say that they want registration rights covering
resales of shares
purchased in the open market to hedge a derivative with the issuer.  If the
economics of
the derivative are determined based on the net proceeds from the sales, it=
=01,s

a more
difficult case because the issuer itself is realizing benefits and
detriments
from the sales.
b)  Some counterparties say they want registration rights covering resales
of
shares
purchased in the open market to hedge a derivative with the issuer only if
there is a
strong correlation at the onset of the contract between the terms of the
derivative and the
hedge.  It it=01,s a total return swap, for example, there will be a 1:1
correspondence (i.e.
the economics will tell you that the counterparty will buy 100% of the
shares
covered by
the swap immediately upon entering into the swap); but if it=01,s something
like
a collar
with divergent strike prices and involves dynamic hedging where it=01,s not
clear whether
and to what extent the counterparty will make purchases or sales in the ope=
n

market,
then it=01,s not as easy to attribute the counterparty=01,s actions to the =
issuer.

 In those cases
these counterparties look at the correlation and if it=01,s not that great =
they

don=01,t ask for
registration rights.
c)  Some counterparties say they don=01,t want registration rights for resa=
les
of stock
purchased in the open market to hedge their position.

Credit Suisse First Boston falls in category c) with respect to the May 200=
0

confirmation you sent
me. Even though there is a strong correlation between the deal and the hedg=
e

( i.e. even though
in that case they will no doubt immediately purchase 100% of the shares
covered by the
transaction) they are only asking for registration rights with respect to
the
shares that are
delivered by Enron on net share settlement.

4)  Commodities Laws.  Under the commodities laws there are some risks in
doing equity swaps in
that one has to rely on the swaps policy statement rather than the swaps
exemption, but those
risks are probably minimal enough that Enron is willing to take them.  (The
swaps exemption
does not cover equity swaps.)  With respect to equity options, they are
outside the CFTC=01,s
jurisdiction altogether.  Forward contracts present the most difficult
issues
in that there is a lot of
case law and CFTC lore about the distinction between forwards and futures,
and a key distinction
is that forwards are physical delivery contracts that bind the parties to
make and take delivery.
State bucket shop laws outlaw contracts that purport to be contracts for
sale
of a security that are
to be settled based on market price quotations.  So I would counsel Enron
not
to enter into any
forward contract that has a cash settlement alternative.  Although one can
argue that net share
settlement has the same defects, I don=01,t feel as strongly about that bec=
ause

you could get to where
you want to get by physically delivering the  shares and issuing  new share=
s

in payment; the
theory is that you actually delivered shares and just netted them out; that
is not quite as bad as
flying in the face of the case law and CFTC lore on net cash settlement.

The Bear Stearns Confirmation and Cancellation.  I really don=01,t have any
comments on this; I think the
cancellation was effective to cancel the parties obligations.  The
confirmation did not present any
registration issues.  I guess I would say that if you do something precisel=
y

like this you might get them to
agree to make any hedge purchases pursuant to Rule 10b-18, but that=01,s it=
.

The Credit Suisse First Boston Confirmation.  This is an extremely well
written document.  For the
reasons discussed above, I would counsel against entering into this kind of
transaction with the cash
settlement feature, in light of the risk that it could be characterized as
an
illegal, unenforceable futures
contract.  A few other comments: They say automatic early termination
applies, but I think that is a really
bad idea.  Enron had an agreement with a counterparty that took bankruptcy
and Enron did not find out
about it until a few days later, after the market had moved; since Enron di=
d

not know of the termination it
did not unwind its hedge, yet the ISDA said that the amounts payable on
termination would depend on the
termination date pricing.  So Enron took a loss.  You ought to always have
within your control the right to
terminate.  This is especially true of U.S. parties, but I would think the
same would apply to foreign
parties unless there is something peculiar about the law of the jurisdictio=
n

you are dealing with.

Both Confirmations  Both confirmations have language that says that if the
parties have not entered into
an ISDA Master then the counterparties=01, standard form controls.  I think=
 it
is not a good idea to agree to
such language because you are agreeing to something you know nothing about.

Additional Comment.  I think that whenever a counterparty requests
registration rights Rex should be
involved.  I think the CSFB confirmation=01,s provisions relating to
registration are fine, and of course they
can=01,t force us to register because the choice of net share settling is
purely
our choice.  Nevertheless, I
think that Rex needs to be involved so you and Rex need to get this point
across to the business people that
they shouldn=01,t just sign a confirmation and then send it to you and ask =
if
it
is ok.

But my bottom line is the only change I would make would be eliminating the
net cash settlement feature
in the CSFB confirmation.

Prior to our meeting last Friday, I had provided the guaranty template 
(below) to Western Resources, Inc.  The counterparty has approved the 
languange without any changes.  The request is for a $15,000,000 outgoing 
guaranty to cover both financial derivatives (gas and power) as well as 
physical gas.  Please advise on how we should proceed on the guaranty 
issuance.  FYI-On 6/15/00, I forwarded to Susan Flynn's attention a credit 
worksheet so that we can prepare ISDA docs.

and HS Resources, Inc.; after execution of the assignment, the trades will be 
between ENA and HS Energy Services, Inc.  subject to the ISDA which we are 
now negotiating [the second doc is an appendix consisting of 5 trades and I 
have asked the desk to confirm that these are the only outstanding trades]

(2)  the second set (last two docs) is an assignment of trades between J. 
Aron & Company and HS Energy Services, Inc; after execution of the 
assignment, the trades will be between J.Aron & Company and ENA subject to 
the 8/14/94 J.Aron/ENA ISDA [the fourth doc is an appendix of all existing 
trades between J.Aron/HS Energy Services, Inc.  I have no idea where this 
came from but I assume it is part of your agreement with HS.  Who is 
verifying the trades and are all trade terms acceptable?  Presently, the 
assignment is drafted such that a conflict between the Master and a confirm 
will be governed by the Master]

There was a flurry of activity in March, 1997 involving Petron but it was on

I'll be happy to do the legal due dliligence and ISDA documentation from here.

Bill/Cynthia:
Please let me know who in Credit will be handling this so that I can 
coordinate with them when the need arises.

Sara:
When Janice mentioned the legal due diligence with regard to commodity 
derivatives in the Philippines, did she mean the legal survey done by Allen & 
Overy?  If so , I've got copies of all that and can take it from here. If 
that isn't the case and you've done more ISDA work in the Phillipines since 
then, I'd be forever grateful if you could send over whatever copies of the 
stuff which you have for me to suss out the situation there.

Thanks, all.

Well, it looks like we might have a shot at an ISDA w/ a PHilippines 
company.  One issue that discussed w/ Manuel but he does not mention in his 
note is that we would probably require an enforceability opinion from Petron 
(a compnay jointly owned by the PHilippines govt and Saudi Aramco).  I'm not 
sure which credit dept. would handle this deal, but Cynthia Schnedier has 
some familiarity w/ Petron.   I'll leave it to Mark, Alan and Anita to 
determine whether Anita will handle the ISDA or whether it will be someone 
from Houston (Sara S. did the original legal due diligence on the 
enforceability of commodities derivatives contracts in the PHilippines).

Manuel,

Thanks for the update and we look forward to meet Petron traders/risk 
management team during our next visit to Manila, probably during our first 
cargo of gasoil to FGH, currently planned for end August / early September. 
Kindly let us know on new developments. For your information, John is away on 
home leave and will be back in office only after mid - August.  

Best regards,
Eng

Dear John,

Yayette Ventigan of Petron informed me yesterday that the energy derivatives 
course conducted by Paradigm in Manila from July 7 to 10 was well-received.  
I sensed that the course was not deemed easy by the Petron participants.  
Further, Yayette indicated that they could have easily used up more time for 
the same amount of material.

Given the Paradigm course (and the Citibank course which Yayette attended in 
Australia), Yayette indicated that the Petron Board will most likely give the 
marching orders to Petron management on July 27 to (1) develop an initial, 
basic and conservative hedging program for Petron?s fuel oil and gasoil 
supplied to the National Power Corporation and (2) go out to the market (most 
likely through a bid process) and execute a financial risk management 
contract (ISDA).

Yayette indicated that Petron looks forward to the working meeting with 
Enron?s Singapore traders.  I indicated to Yayette that end of August to 
early September would probably be convenient for us.  Yayette could not yet 
determine an appropriate time for Petron.

With respect to legal expectations, Petron appears to be at ease with the
following:

?  In general, the concept of disassociating the financial risk management 
contract from the Philippines with the exception of Petron Corporation (a 
Philippine corporation) being a party to the contract.

?  Petron executing a financial risk management contract with an offshore 
counter-party like Citibank Australia or ECT Singapore.

?  Petron physically executing the contract outside the Philippines.

?  The contract to be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

I did point out to Yayette the need for offshore collateral in the form of a 
Letter of Credit, which is consistent with the risk of non-enforcement for 
collateral in the Philippines.  Yayette indicated that she would raise this 
issue in her discussions with Petron treasury.

More later as I receive more feedback from Petron.

Best regards,
Manuel

Joe - attached is a first shot at getting a handle on all the differences 
between the proposed and existing margin lines.  I plan to do more analysis 
with respect to covenants and warranties but this hits the main points.  The 
analysis between rates will be very complex and may be something best left to 
the research Group.  We can go through why this is such a complex issue to 
model.  What I do plan to do is update historical info. so that based on the 
past we can make general statements such as over time Fed Funds + X bp <,>,= 
to LIBOR + X bp.

A quick synapses of difficult items:

Commissions vs. Margin lines - will trading desk use facility for many trades 
or less frequent trades for smaller amounts
Short on Financial gas vs. Long on physical gas - cash flow differentials and 
how we can model the cost of cash to fund the working capital (as you 
explained to me today)
What positions the trader take and how our equity position is at that exact 
time.  Will we trade in a similar fashion in the future?

From what I understand the trading desks do not have ready access to the 
above  information in a format which lends itself to modelling of reasonable 
complexity or do not wish to share it with us (understandable considering the 
sensitive nature of the business.)  The ideal situation would be for the 
desks to decide themselves whether a line makes sense for them based on the 
pricing provided.  As mentioned above, I believe that we should be able to 
explain why a certain base rate would be attractive but am not sure how to 
estimate the value of a line to the traders without detailed information.  
Perhaps the best division of labour would be for the desks to decide what 
loan would be most valuable based on the desk's trading patterns while we 
could focus on getting the line in place as quickly as possible.  If you 
disagree, please let me know and I will try to rethink how to model this 
appropriately.

I had a call on this from Bob a few weeks ago.  I told him that generally it

definitive position, plus we would need to ensure that advice which we 
ploughed through earlier last year was still current.  He told me not to do 
any more work on this at the time because it was not clear whether there was 
any chance of doing a deal with an Indian counterparty.

I am more than willing to send you ou all my notes, etc, however, which 
crunched through the 1/14/97 opinion with Crawford's and asked supplemental 
questions.

and NEP could pick either one.  We've prepared a physical contract and wanted 
to alert you that there may be a need for a financial one -- which I assume 
would be in the form of an "Omnibus" agreement (as far as I can tell, we do 
not have an ISDA in place w/ NEP).  John will let us know tomorrow either

Susan,

The below e-mail/Telex was sent to our Trading desk as MG's Confirmation for 
a Copper Transaction we have traded with them.  Per the desks instructions I 
have not sent our form of Confirmation for several reasons as follows:

1) Trader wrote on ticket that MG was to Confirm the Transactions
2) We were unsure of MG's Legal entity name
3) No contact @ MG

My question for you is are we going to accept this as a form of Confirmation?

Thanks,
Joe

Pushkar:  Here's the language suggested by Merrill for use in NDF's.  I am 
not familiar with the frequency of our trades, but I'm sure Laurel can fill 
in the blanks.  I thought that the process being implemented by the EMTA 
seemed reasonable but let me know if this is a fallback that you would agree 
to use if the PTAX rate is not available for settltment.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

Previously we have agreed upon "CURRENCY REFERENCE DEALERS" as the first 
disruption fallback, and ""CURRENCY MUTUAL AGREEMENT" as the 2nd disruption 
fallback.  It appears that EMTA has created a "BRL Industry Survey Rate" 
(BRL11).  Merrill feels that this definition is replacing the Currency 
Reference dealers definition--or at least setting out a clear methodology for 
determining the rate.  Also, Shari always preferred that we use the mutual 
agreement rather then calculation agent determination of settlement rate.  
The ISDA template defaults to Calculation Agent.  Do you prefer that we 
continue on asking people for mutual agreement, or are you o.k. with 
Calculation agent determination of settlement rate?  Trading has no 
preference on that matter.  

I am faxing you a current ML non-deliverable deal with this new language in 
it for your review.  Please let me know if the confirm is o.k. to sign, or if 
you have any issues we need to address.  

Thanks!

See the below attachments for the new definition and the history surrounding 
it.  
Hi Laurel,

Please take a look at the following documents sent by EMTA.  Only difference
is that we have not included the "unscheduled holiday" provisions as there
has not been a clear cut consensus among counterparties whether to use
Preceding or Following.

Please contact me if you have any problems.

I will try to sort through my e-mails if I find additional information on
the BRL templates.

Thank you

 The email that you sent to me below does not pertain to to the referenced 
entity.  Did you send me this email in error?  In order to open to the 
brokerage account for Rafael Rangel, we need corporate resolutions and an 
authorized traders list for the referenced entity.    On June 1, 2200, I 
emailed our form of corp. resolutions and authorized traders list to you and 
Rafael.  I will send the email to you again.   Please advise me of when I

TIFP's parent, Temple Inland (an ESP), is now willing to provide a $500,000 
guaranty.  This makes TIFP an ESP as well.  To this end, will you please have 
a legal assistant prepare a form of guaranty that would list Temple-Inland 
Inc. as the guarantor for the Temple-Inland Forest Products Corporation 
(counterparty).  The amount of the guaranty will be $500,000.  I would also 
suggest that we lower Enron Corp's guaranty to an even amount.  

Thanks!

Thanks for your response.  My prior message to you was in error because I did 
enter the correct address.  For example, I can get to the screen that says 
"Documents" but when I click on one of the choices, I get a message that says 
"Netscape is unable to locate the server ei-sp-data01.  Please check the 
server name and try again."  Am I doing something wrong?  Should I simply 
call the Helpdesk here in Houston?  Thanks.  Sara

Sara, the correct address is http://ei-sp-data01/regulatory      and not  
http://ei-sp-01/regulatory as you tried before.
If you can access Enron's intranet or extranet you are able to get in the 
site. Please let me know if you still have problems accessing it.  Thanks,

Tanya:  I just spoke with Chris about this ARCO transaction which might trade 
TODAY.  We are "cleaning up" some of the language as it was based on the 
prior ARCO deal (when we were ECT).  Please note that Enron Corp. previously 
provided a guaranty.  I am not certain whether that guaranty is tied to the 
transaction specifically and I'll try to track down.  Will ENA provide a 
parent guaranty for the new transaction?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara:

Arco is back.  Could you please review the attached and let mw know if we can 
transact under this confirm?

Chris

Chris, I've attached a simplified confirm based on our prior May, 1999 
version.
The only change in the new draft is to represent the fact that we are now 
using
only firm energy rather than a blend of firm and nonfirm. As a result volume
weighting should only apply on holidays and Sundays when on-peak and off-peak
values may need to be weighted in with 24-hour firm values.

On a related issue, how quickly could you have a corporate guarantee 
available?

Dave

Joe:  Attached in draft form is a transaction that Chris Foster may do with 
Arco today.  His number in Portland is 834-3822.  I'm not certain about 
credit and "ECT" will have to change to "ENA".  Let's keep in touch.

Jarrod:  attached is language which should be added to all paper and pulp 
omnibus confirms (and Bob has reviewed this language):

  
 Also, attached is the Temple-Inland confirm and I have changed only the 
"Credit or Other Special Provisions" paragraph.  You will have to attach 
Exhibit "A" (which Susan sent you last week).

P.S.  Please verify with credit the timing for delivery of the guaranty.  I 
believe that Paul told me by Wednesday.

Kevin:  We are holding up the execution of the ISDA Master Agreement until

 On May 23, 2000, Paribas merged with and into Banque Nationale De Paris, the 
surving entity which changed its name to BNP Paribas.  As a result of the 
merger,  BNP Paribas assumes all of the rights and obliagtions of Paribas 
(and becomes our Counterparty) under the ISDA Master Agreement, dated June 
28, 1995 between ENA and Paribas.   Copies of the notice of merger will be 
distributed.

Please see the attachment for a specific definition of ELIGIBLE SWAP 
PARTICIPANT and the TRADE OPTION EXEMPTION.

From a legal perspective and to avoid scrutiny and regulation by the 
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, ENA must always comply with the Trade 
Option Exemption when entering into options (as buyer or seller) with a third 
party.  Some of ENA's trading parties cannot satisfy this exemption from 
regulation because they are not a producer/merchant handling the underlying 
commodity (such as banks, hedge funds, etc) even though they may be entering 
into the transaction for business purposes.  If that situation occurs, ENA 
MUST ALWAYS BE THE OFFEREE OF THE OPTION (as buyer or seller) and ENA cannot 
solicit the party to enter into the transaction.

If ENA's trading partner fails to satisfy the Trade Option Exemption, our 
confirmation will EXPLICITLY state that ENA was offered the option to buy or 
sell by the counterparty.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara [ENA legal]

Attached are revised forms of Assignments for both the HSES to Enron (J. Aron 
trades) and HS Resources to HSES (Enron trades).  These are redlined versions.

The main changes to the HSES to Enron (J. Aron trades) assignment are 
completion of the Effective Date (June 28), the date of the J. Aron/Enron 
ISDA and the addition of counterpart and fax signature language.

The HS Resources to HSES assignment has been structurally revised to assign 
all HS Resources/Enron trades to HSES except those shown on Appendix A.  
Since the HS Resources/Enron trades continue to change every day until the 
HSES/Enron ISDA is in place, this new structure of the assignment will be 
much simpler and will pick up all HS Resources/Enron transactions through 
Friday, June 30.  Hopefully, by then the HSES/Enron ISDA will be in place.

Please let me know as soon as you believe these documents are ready for 
Enron's signature.  As soon as I have sign off by the other parties to the 
documents, I will advise you.  We can then have everyone print finals, get 
signatures and fax all counterparts to me.  I will act as a clearinghouse and 
get counterparts back out to everyone.

At last!  Thursday morning at 10:30 am, Rex Rogers and Jim Armogida will meet 
with me in my office.  You are invited.  I suspect that much of our 
conversation will be a repeat of the meeting that you had last week.  Sara

Rod and I discussed this party (which always appears on the legal/credit 
list!!!!  It seem that BP signed a Master Agreement (our OLD form) with 
ECTRIC on 1/8/98 and agreed to sign THE IDENTICAL AGREEMENT with ENA.  Absent 
an executed agreement, ENA and BP continue to use a form of "Swap Contract" 
which had been agreed to many years ago (similar to our GTC's in the omnibus) 
which also provides that the parties will negotiate a master agreement.   Rod 
doesn't see much current trading activity so we didn't believe this to be a 
high priority.

Having said all of this, the form is limited to swaps, doesn't provide for 
setoff, arbitration, certain market disruption events and several other items 
which we can review if necessary.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.  Sara  

Please advise.  Sara

The trade descriptions, which would control in any event, have not changed.

We would like to proceed with execution on Thursday.   Would you please 
accept the changes  in the red-lined documents I sent yesterday, print 
cleans, get signatures, and fax to me at 303-296-9709?  I will send the HS 
signiture pages in the morning, and will send the J. Aron pages as soon as I 
get them.

I will be in touch with you in the morning to discuss further.

Hi,
Do you know the current status of the Bank One account for NG?
Jim has been inquiring about this.

Many thanks
David

Hello David,

I didn't want to bother you - you're probably more than busy right now.

In my continuing effort to get your account going, specifically,
completing the margin line of credit, I thought the following might
help:

When Jeff Shankman first told me of Enron's requirement to have a line
of credit for margining, nat gas initial margin was $2750 per contract.
It is now $3850 and likely to rise again.  The 'cheap financing' that
our line represents to John Arnold may be even more appealing now (if he
has a second to convince Sara Shackleton to work on the documentation).

Otherwise, thanks for the intro to Bill White.  We've only spoken
briefly so far, but he did say he was trying to free up some time to get
something going.

I'll be in Houston in about two weeks, but I hope to talk to you before
then.

Regards,
Jim Naughton

 On May 23, 2000, Paribas merged with and into Banque Nationale De Paris, the

merger,  BNP Paribas assumes all of the rights and obliagtions of Paribas 
(and becomes our Counterparty) under the ISDA Master Agreement, dated June 
28, 1995 between ENA and Paribas.   Copies of the notice of merger will be

FYI.  Let's talk later.   SS

I am sending this e-mail message to address several issues related to the
swap and to circulate a proposed confirmation for your consideration.

Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to
me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather
than a guaranty.  If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know
so that we can stop this process.

Comments on the Draft Schedule:

 1.  Part 1(a) "Specified Entity":  A Specified Entity is an entity
other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a
termination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified
Entity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a
Specified Entity with respect to TBS.

 2.  Part 1(b) "Threshold Amount": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which
seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.

 3.  Part 1(h) "Additional Event of Default":  If we use a swap
arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one
for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want
an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest
in TBS could result in termination?

 4.  Part 2  "Representations":  I think that we need someone in tax
to determine whether TBS can make the representations.

 5.  Part 4(d) & (e) "Credit Support Provider": Shell will be the
credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.

 6.  Part 4(g) "Governing Law", 4(h) "Arbitration": The schedule
proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem
to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to
those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami,
under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of
the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).

Comment on the Proposed Confirmation:

 I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas
Supply Agreement under the "Fixed Amount Details" but have not done so under
the "Floating Amount Details", which cross-references the provisions of the
SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.

 Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments
or any comments on the attached confirmation.  I will contact Nasim to
discuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to
completion.

Regards, Dean

All:  It appears that this is the group which can best address the 
(derivatives) issues which may arise when Enron Corp. attempts to enter into 
equity swaps/options/forwards based upon Enron Corp. stock.  We have all 
undertaken to provide the group with the following items:

(1)  "Procedures for Executing/Documenting/Unwinding Enron Corp. Equity 
Derivatives"
       Clint has already circulated a draft proposal.  Comments are invited.

(2)  The transacting party:  ENA (with an Enron Corp. guaranty) or Enron 
Corp.?
       Rex has no preference and credit's initial response was to consolidate 
trading in ENA.  I will revisit this issue with Bill Bradford.

(3)  Enron Corp. equity trading resolution
       Rex and Jim will handle the drafting and logistics.  This will be 
necessary if Enron Corp. is the trading party because the counterparty will 
want to review      (and equity trading requires authorization) AND also 
necessary if ENA is the trading party because equity trading requires 
authorization.

(4)  Standard form of Registration Rights Agreement
       Rex and Jim will handle the drafting.  This can be used as our "form" 
for future transactions.

(5)  Enron Corp. "position paper" addressing equity derivative parameters, 
preferable methods of settlement, registration rights, etc.
       I have no volunteers.  Maybe Bob Baird needs an assignment.

As you know, there are several outstanding confirms which require immediate 
attention before the foregoing items can be finalized.  Please let me know if 
we can establish a timetable for completion of this project.  Thanks for your 
help.  Sara

Bill:  I have previously discussed this issue with Rod.  I would like to 
revisit once again.  These transactions include swaps/options/forwards on ENE 
stock.  There is a renewed effort coming from Treasury to use these tools 
more frequently than in the past.  I am in touch with Rex Rogers (Enron Corp. 
securities lawyer) as registration rights issues on ENE stock are definitely 
involved.  Our counterparties are telling us that they prefer to look to 
Enron Corp. since it is Enron Corp.'s stock that is involved.  At a minimun, 
even if ENA were the trading counterparty (with an Enron Corp. guaranty 
capped at an appropriate level), Enron Corp. would probably have to sign each 
confirmation as ISSUER OF THE STOCK (and ENA cannot make those agreements on 
behalf of Enron Corp.).

I would like to discuss ASAP as we are in the midst of negotiations with CSFB 
International, UBS AG, Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc. and Lehman 
Brothers Finance S.A.

Where does this stand?  Have you received the guaranty from Clem?

Sara,

Attached is a revised worksheet.  In addition to what is on the sheet, we 
agreed to:

Remain silent on jurisdiction.
New York Law
BBB- negative watch is an additional event of default.
if the rating drops below BBB- there is an additional event of default.

I will calrify if you need me to.

JS

All:  I spoke with Bill Bradford to get the global credit perspective, and, 
he is entirely neutral.  However, he agreed that it made sense for Enron 
Corp. to transact on its own stock.  

I am prepared to draft new ISDA Master Agreements with our remaining 
potential targets in the name of "Enron Corp." without Credit Support 
Annexes.  Upon execution, the parties generally exchange evidence of 
authority (i.e., resolution or excerpt thereof).  

The outstanding confirms are in the name of Enron Corp.  These are "Deemed 
ISDA's" and no party has asked for evidence of authority (although the 
parties do represent that they have such authority).

Please let me hear from you if someone objects to the use of Enron Corp.   
Thanks.  Sara

This is a wrap-up email to inform all of you about the dates, activities and 
where we are standing with regards to the expansion of EOL to the Mexican 
Market.   The general strategy is to target the 40 major key customers 
directly, through two  formal presentations. One on Thursday August 3rd in 
Monterrey, at the  Quinta Real Hotel; and the second one on Friday August 4th 
in Mexico City, at the Four Seasons Hotel.   The setting is pretty much a 
Continental breakfast, followed by welcoming remarks and the formal 
presentation of EOL.

We plan to send out the invitations with the brochures around July 15th.  Kal 
Shah is planning on delivering around 600 spanish-translated EOL Ball 
Brochures in the next days. The brochures will have a cover letter that will 
include the Guest Accounts for the customers that will be invited to the 
formal presentations. We will follow up with RSVP personal calls from the 
15th to the 3rd. The rest of the customers will receive the brochure by mail. 

Jeff Blumenthal is helping us on the Tax Issues regarding on-line 
transactions by Mexican Counterparties. Jeff is almost finishing on checking 
the Tax implications on the products most probably traded by the targeted 
customers, as well as all other products listed on EOL. 

Carol St Claire is helping us on all the legal issues, as well as reviewing 
the marketing material that would be sent out to customers. We should have a 
formal opinion in the next days. 

Eric Thode is putting together the press releases to be sent on the launching 
date, and is also helping us with a plan to invite and inform the media about 
the event as well as EOL service. Eric, please send a copy of the press 
releases to Carol, since there are some words we need to avoid on the legal 
side of things.

Paul Radous and Rod Nelson are helping us with the pre-approval of credit for 
all of these targeted customers to be able to transact in EOL. 

Leonardo Pacheco is helping us on several fronts, and specially coordination 
of this effort, as well as getting all the guest accounts for the customers, 
together with Frank Davies. Leonardo please send a bunch of  Getting Started 
manuals as soon as you can. 

Daniel Diamond will help us with the marketing material and strategy. Dan let 
me know who will be attending the presentations on your behalf, and type of 
aid we will need in the Hotels. 

Let me know who is planning to attend so we can help with reservations and 
travel arrangements, or call directly Barbara Martinez at 011-52-8-152-2404.

I really appreciate all of your support and great work.  I am looking forward 
to successfully concluding the "Approval" process in the next days so we can 
move forward with the logistics, and please let me know how else can I help.

Kind Regards,   Jaime Williams.

A few thoughts:
1. Section 2.1 (y) the .30% should specify per annum
2. Section 2.1 contemplates that interest is payable monthly--this seems to 
conflict with the provisions of Section 3.1 which makes it payable on demand. 
Am I missing something?
3. Section 3.5 should we specify a time of day?

I have reviewed this via remote access, and am not able to print. I think 
more thought should go into the mechanics and timing  of what is going on 
here. I will be available next week. Can we have another meeting?

George,
I'm not sure if you're the right person to send the comments to, but Media
General has the following comments on the Newsprint Swap Agreement.

Schedule to Master Agreement

1.  Media General wants the cross-default to be reciprocal at $100 million
for both Media General and Enron.
2.   Further, Media General thinks that this should be a cross-acceleration,
not a cross-default.
3.   Page 3 of Schedule.  The "date by which to be delivered" for Party B
should track the same with Party A: i.e., if financials are available on
EDGAR then they would not be automatically provided by MG on a quarterly
basis.
4.  Page 4 of Schedule.  Under (a), add "Attn.: Chief Financial Officer".
We will send Marshall Morton's fax and telephone numbers.
5.  We will let you know who will serve as process agent.  We would like to
talk about governing law in Texas and the site of arbitration in Houston.
6.  Page 6 of Schedule.  In clause(b)(g), please note that MG intends to
assign this agreement and we want to make sure that does not affect this
representation.
7.Page 8 of Schedule.  MG wants the right to assign this agreement to a
party with a credit agreement equivalent to a certain level.  We can discuss
what that level should be.  We should discuss what Enron's credit rating is
in this connection.

Transaction Confirmation Document.

1. MG does not think this transaction should be characterized as a
"swaption".  This was to be a deal for the purchase of newsprint at a fixed
price, not at Enron's option.
2. We want todiscuss the expiration date. We should also discuss the other
dates and terms which are blank.  On page 2, under "Additional Provisions",
the date for satisfying conditions is clearly wrong since it refers to July
5.  Once again, all of this ties in with not being an option, but a fixed
agreement.
3. We would like to have Enron render a monthly settlement statement with a
net amount being paidto/receivable from MG.  No netting is presently
provided for in the agreement.

ISDA Credit Support Annex

MG  would like to delete this entirely and would propose that Enron would
rely on the general cross-acceleration provisions.  Media General never
contemplated credit provisions more onerous than its credit agreements.

          I will have the Media General business people follow up with the
people at Enron, but could you please have some one get in touch with me on
this.

Thanks,
John

All trades were originally confirmed in the name of Dow Hydrocarbons and

3.   Page 3 of Schedule.  The "date by which to be delivered" for Party B
should track the same with Party A: i.e., if financials are available on
EDGAR then they would not be automatically provided by MG on a quarterly
basis.
4.  Page 4 of Schedule.  Under (a), add "Attn.: Chief Financial Officer".
We will send Marshall Morton's fax and telephone numbers.
5.  We will let you know who will serve as process agent.  We would like to
talk about governing law in Texas and the site of arbitration in Houston.
6.  Page 6 of Schedule.  In clause(b)(g), please note that MG intends to
assign this agreement and we want to make sure that does not affect this
representation.
7.Page 8 of Schedule.  MG wants the right to assign this agreement to a
party with a credit agreement equivalent to a certain level.  We can discuss
what that level should be.  We should discuss what Enron's credit rating is
in this connection.

Transaction Confirmation Document.

1. MG does not think this transaction should be characterized as a
"swaption".  This was to be a deal for the purchase of newsprint at a fixed
price, not at Enron's option.
2. We want todiscuss the expiration date. We should also discuss the other
dates and terms which are blank.  On page 2, under "Additional Provisions",
the date for satisfying conditions is clearly wrong since it refers to July
5.  Once again, all of this ties in with not being an option, but a fixed
agreement.
3. We would like to have Enron render a monthly settlement statement with a
net amount being paidto/receivable from MG.  No netting is presently
provided for in the agreement.

ISDA Credit Support Annex

MG  would like to delete this entirely and would propose that Enron would
rely on the general cross-acceleration provisions.  Media General never
contemplated credit provisions more onerous than its credit agreements.

          I will have the Media General business people follow up with the
people at Enron, but could you please have some one get in touch with me on
this.

Thanks,
John

Trena:  We have ISDA agreements as follows:

(1)  CIBC
 (a)  Enron Corp. has a 1/17/96 master and CIBC is designated as multibranch 
to act through offices in Tokyo, London and New York.  If this agreement is 
used, we need to add FX/currency provisions.
 (b)  ENA has a 10/1/94 master and CIBC is designated as multibranch to act 
through offices in Toronto, Tokyo and London.  The agreement was amended on 
5/24/96 (to add a collateral annex), on 7/27/97 t(o add FX/currency option 
and FRABBA provisions) and on 1/13/00 (to amend thresholds).

(2)  Deutsche Bank AG 
 ENA is in the process of negotiating an ISDA master agreement.  We are 
speaking with Stephen Kessler (legal) in New York.

(3)  Commerzbank AG

trades with the following banks:
CIBC

Can you please tell me what lines we have in place with these, if any at all.

The confirmation desk recently received a call from Mike Billings who I 
believe is your Dow trader.  Mike is trying to trade financially under the 
name "The Dow Chemical Company".   ECT SHOULD CONTINUE TO TRADE FINANCIALLY 
WITH "DOW HYDROCARBONS AND RESOURCES INC" (the party that ECT has a Master

I received a call from Judy Lee at Swiss RE (212-317-5523) regarding the 
standard confirmation we use.  She said that their legal department wishes to 
omit Section 4 on Representation.  I said I would forward it on to our legal 
department for consideration.  Below, I have attached the most recent confirm 
we sent them.  Please advise on how I should proceed.
Thanks
Scott

All:  I am comparing this list to mine but Jill's certainly looks more 
comprehensive!  Jill said she may not have signed confirms, etc. but we 
should get copies of all live equity deals.  I don't have paralegal

Is there a Guarantee in place by Enron Corp. for ECT Investments, Inc. 
relating to our prime broker agreements with Goldman Sachs?  
We are talking to Goldman currently about increasing our leverage and a 
guarantee may be beneficial if one does not already exist.  We are unsure if 
one already exists.

Sara,

As way of background, Carol has been working on an ISDA with PCES.  I had 
advised our PCES contact that I was unable to attend to this before my 
departure.  As you know,  PCES is a "Top Ten", therefore, you may want to 
pass this message onto to someone to handle.

FYI:  Our PCES contact is out of the office until August 2nd, but you may 
want to tackle anyway.

The PCES file can be found in the file drawers for "green files".  

Thanks.

Susan, 

We are definitely getting closer to bringing this ISDA agreement to a close. 
I reviewed with the Calgary office the latest draft you e-mailed; listed 
below are the remaining questions: Part 1 of the Schedule; subitem (k) with 
reference to romanette (ix) - the term "Performance Assurance" should be 
changed to "Eligible Credit Assurance" (same as in subitem (f) of Part 1). 

Part 4 of the Schedule; subitem (h) Governing Law - question was asked about 
Texas being the choice of law as opposed to New York. Our understanding is 
that the ISDA was structured under the guidance of New York law and request 
that Governing Law be changed to New York. 

Paragraph 13(c)(iv), Notification Time - request that the time be changed to 
1:00 p.m. 

Paragraph 13 - the remaining issues (listed below) will be discussed by Mr. 
Harry Wijsman in Calgary's Credit Department with Mr. Bill Bradford. These 
same issues were discussed during the ISDA negotiations with PanCanadian 
Petroleum and Enron's Canada office. The items are: 

Paragraph 13(b)(iv)(C) - Minimum Transfer Amount
Paragraph 13(g)(ii)(2) - Use of Posted Collateral
Paragraph 13(m)(i) - Material Adverse Change
Irrevocable Transfer Letter of Credit: transferability and automatic 
extension language.

Your assistance over this time period of negotiating has been appreciated 
very much. FYI: I will be leaving for vacation on Thursday, July 20 and back 
in the office on Wednesday, August 2. If you have any questions, please 
contact me at 713-331-5049. 

Best regards, 
Rick

I'll try to call you later (or vice-versa) about the memo.  Also, if you are 
willing, we'd love your participation in the credit/legal meeting.  SS

Jeff, I am sending you the specific information of the indexes and products 
that we believe our customers would be trading on EOL.....Please take a look 
at the file attached, and the page with Index Definitions, for the 
information you are looking for. The trades will be performed based on 
indexes taht already exist in OEL, so no new Mexican Indices will be 
included.   Please note however, that the mexican gas is priced in Mexico on 
the basis of the Tetco/Valero basket. So, most probably, that same basket 
will be included in the system to accomodate to our customer's needs. 
Please note that Carol St Clair will be helping us on the legal aspects of 
including Mexico into the EOL system.
Thanks and regards.

no estan en EOL: el promedio Tetco y PG&E; el poliestireno y el PET. 

Por otro lado para el polietileno esta la descripci?n para el LLDPE.

Si se requiere alg?n cambio solo avisame.

Trading with certain type of metals is regulated. Let us confirm that.

One possibility would be to incorporate TradeCo first the way that we have
recommended, and then amend the corporate purpose once we have ascertained
which metals could be traded without being subject to governmental
concession.

Rogelio, the new corporate purpose looks very good to me...However, as you

(MG), and as of next september we will be able to trade metals on the

I got a copy of 2000 Definitions Annex via distribution today.  However, I 
did not know of nor do I have the 2000 Definitions, which apparently 
restated/conformed the 1991/1998 basic ISDA definitions.  Our Master still 
refs 1991, as amended etc., so it probably does pick up the 2000 issuance by 
ISDA.  Do you have the 2000?  Do we need to order?  Should we consider 
revising the master agreement in respect of the definition incorporation 
language?  Give me a call.   Mary  Thanks.

ISSUE

For a number of business reasons, a company may enter into contracts that are 
indexed to, and sometimes settled in, its own stock. Examples of these
contracts include written put options, written call options (and warrants), 
purchased put options, purchased call options, forward sale contracts, and 
forward
purchase contracts. These contracts may be settled using a variety of 
settlement methods, or the issuing company or counterparty may have a choice 
of
settlement methods. The settlement methods are:

     Physical settlement - the party designated in the contract as the buyer 
delivers the full stated amount of cash to the seller, and the seller 
delivers the full
     stated number of shares to the buyer.

     Net share settlement - the party with a loss delivers to the party with 
a gain shares with a current fair value equal to the gain.

     Net cash settlement - the party with a loss delivers to the party with a 
gain a cash payment equal to the gain, and no shares are exchanged.

The contracts described above may be either freestanding or embedded in 
another financial instrument. A freestanding contract is entered into 
separate and
apart from any of the company's other financial instruments or equity 
transactions, or it is entered into in conjunction with some other 
transaction and is legally
detachable and separately exercisable.

This Issue applies only to freestanding derivative financial instruments (for 
example, forward contracts, options, and warrants). This Issue does not apply 
to
security price guarantees or other financial instruments indexed to, or 
otherwise based on, the price of the issuer's stock that are issued in 
connection with a
purchase business combination [Note See STATUS section.], nor does it address 
the accounting for either the derivative component or the financial instrument
when the derivative component is embedded in and not detachable from the 
financial instrument. This Issue does not address the accounting for 
contracts that
are issued to compensation employees or to acquire goods or services from 
nonemployees.

The issue is how freestanding contracts that are indexed to, and potentially 
settled in, a company's own stock should be classified and measured.

EITF DISCUSSION

A. Framework for Accounting

The Task Force discussed the accounting for freestanding contracts that are 
indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock and reached 
several
consensuses, as described below. The consensuses in this Issue are to be 
applied to all freestanding derivative financial instruments that are indexed 
to, and
potentially settled in, a company's own stock; however, nonpublic companies 
may continue to apply the consensus in Issue No. 88-9, "Put Warrants ," to the
instruments covered by that Issue. Hereinafter, the framework for accounting 
that is established in this Issue is referred to as the "Model."

(1) Initial balance sheet classification

The initial balance sheet classification generally is based on the concept 
that contracts that require net cash settlement are assets or liabilities and 
contracts that
require settlement in shares are equity instruments. If the contract provides 
the company with a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares, the 
Model
assumes settlement in shares; if the contract provides the counterparty with 
a choice of net cash settlement or settlement in shares, the Model assumes 
net cash
settlement. However, this Model is not applicable when settlement 
alternatives do not have the same economic value attached to them or when one 
of the
settlement alternatives is fixed or contains caps or floors. In those 
situations, the accounting for the instrument (or combination of instruments) 
should be based
on the economic substance of the transaction.1

          1 For example, if a freestanding contract, issued together with 
another instrument, requires that the issuer provide to the holder a fixed or
          guaranteed return such that the instruments are, insubstance, debt, 
the issuer should account for both instruments as liabilities, regardless of 
the
          settlement terms of the freestanding contract.

Accordingly, unless the economic substance indicates otherwise, contracts 
would be initially classified as equity, or as assets or liabilities, in the 
following
situations:

Equity instruments

     Contracts that require physical settlement or net share settlement

     Contracts that give the company a choice of net cash settlement or 
settlement in its own shares (physical settlement or net share settlement).

Assets or liabilities

     Contracts that require net cash settlement

     Contracts that give the counterparty a choice of net cash settlement or 
settlement in shares (physical settlement or net share settlement).

(2) Initial measurement, and subsequent balance sheet classification and 
measurement

The Model requires that all instruments be initially measured at fair value 
and subsequently accounted for based on the initial classification and the 
assumed or
required settlement method in (1) above.2 Contracts that are initially 
classified as equity are accounted for in permanent equity. If physical 
settlement was
assumed or required and the company is obligated to deliver cash as part of 
the physical settlement,3 then public companies should refer to ASR 268, which
provides guidance by analogy for those transactions, and account for the 
transactions as provided below under "Equity instruments - temporary equity."

          2 For contracts that are classified as equity instruments that 
provide the company with a choice between either net share settlement or 
physical
          settlement that may require that the company deliver cash, net 
share settlement should be assumed. For contracts that are classified as 
equity
          instruments that provide the counterparty with a choice of either 
net share settlement or physical settlement that may require that the company
          deliver cash, physical settlement should be assumed.

          3 For example, if the company sells put options indexed to its own 
stock that enable the holder to sell shares back to the company at the strike
          price.

Equity instruments - permanent equity

     Contracts that require that the company deliver shares as part of a 
physical settlement or a net share settlement should be initially measured at 
fair value
     and reported in permanent equity. Subsequent changes in fair value 
should not be recognized.

     Contracts that give the company a choice of (a) net cash settlement or 
settlement in shares (including net share settlement, or physical settlement 
that
     requires that the company deliver shares) or (b) either net share 
settlement or physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash 
should be
     initially measured at fair value and reported in permanent equity. 
Subsequent changes in fair value should not be recognized. If such contracts 
are
     ultimately settled in a manner that requires that the company deliver 
cash, the amount of cash paid or received should be reported as a reduction 
of, or
     an addition to, contributed capital.

Equity instruments - temporary equity4

          4 Classification and measurement in temporary equity is required 
for public companies. ASR 268 provides guidance by analogy for transactions
          classified as temporary equity.

     Contracts that (a) require that the company deliver cash as part of a 
physical settlement, (b) give the company a choice of either net cash 
settlement or
     physical settlement that requires that the company deliver cash, or (c) 
give the counterparty a choice of either net share settlement or physical 
settlement
     that requires that the company deliver cash should be initially measured 
at fair value and reported in permanent equity, and an amount equal to the 
cash
     redemption amount under the physical settlement should be transferred to 
temporary equity.

Assets or liabilities

     Contracts that are initially classified as assets or liabilities should 
be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
and disclosed
     in the financial statements. If contracts initially classified as assets 
or liabilities are ultimately settled in shares, any gains or losses on those 
contracts
     should continue to be included in earnings.

B. Hedging

The SEC Observer stated that the SEC staff has consistently held the position 
that hedge accounting is not permitted for transactions involving the 
contracts
within the scope of this Issue because those transactions have not met all 
the criteria of Statement 80. The SEC staff also believes that hedge 
accounting for
transactions involving those contracts is inconsistent with paragraph 28 of 
Opinion 9.

Because of the SEC staff's position, the Task Force decided to end its 
discussion of whether the contracts described above can qualify for hedge 
accounting.

C. Application of the Model to Specific Instruments

The following reflects several Task Force consensuses with respect to the 
application of the Model, described in Section A of this Issue, to certain 
freestanding
derivative financial instruments that are indexed to, and potentially settled 
in, a company's own stock.

(1) Written put options5 and forward purchase contracts

          5 Includes shareholder rights (SHARP rights) issued by the company 
to shareholders that give the shareholders the right to put a specified number
          of common shares to the company for cash.

Description

The company (the buyer) agrees to buy from the seller shares at a specified 
price at some future date. The contract may be settled by physical 
settlement, net
share settlement, or net cash settlement, or the issuing company or the 
counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods.6

          6 Application of the Model to purchased call options is discussed 
in C(3).

Consensus

The Model would be applied as follows:
                                                One Settlement Method

                                                                 Physical (a)
                                                                              
        Net Share

                               x

(a) Physical settlement of the contract requires that the company deliver 
cash to the holder in exchange for the shares.

(b) Classification and measurement guidance within temporary equity applies 
only to public companies.

those contracts should continue to be included in earnings.

(e) If the contracts are ultimately physically settled by the company, 
requiring that the company deliver cash, or are ultimately settled in net 
cash, the amount of
cash paid or received should be reported as a reduction of, or as an addition 
to, contributed capital.

(f) If the contracts are ultimately settled in net cash or net shares, the 
amount reported in temporary equity should be transferred and reported as an 
addition to
permanent equity.

or the issuing company or counterparty may have a choice of settlement 
methods.

(3) Purchased call options

Description

The company (the buyer) purchases call options that provide it with the 
right, but not the obligation, to buy from the seller, shares of the 
company's stock at a
specified price. If the options are exercised, the contract may be settled by 
physical settlement, net share settlement, or net cash settlement, or the 
issuing
company or the counterparty may have a choice of settlement methods.

Consensus

The company should follow the table included in (2) above in accounting for 
the call options.

(4) Detachable stock purchase warrants

Description

An enterprise issues senior subordinated notes with a detachable warrant that 
gives the holder both the right to purchase 6,250 shares of the enterprise's 
stock
for $75 per share and the right (that is, a put) to require that the 
enterprise repurchase all or any portion of the warrant for at least $2,010 
per share at a date
several months after the maturity of the notes in about 7 years.

Consensus

The proceeds should be allocated between the debt liability and the warrant 
and the resulting discount should be amortized in accordance with Opinion 21.
The warrants should be considered, in substance, debt and accounted for as a 
liability because the settlement alternatives for the warrants do not have the
same economic value attached to them and they provide the holder with a 
guaranteed return in cash that is significantly in excess of the value of the 
share
settlement alternative on the issuance date.

(5) Put warrants

Description

Put warrants are instruments with characteristics of both warrants and put 
options. The holder of the instrument is entitled to exercise (a) the warrant 
feature to
acquire the common stock of the issuer at a specified price, (b) the put 
option feature to put the instrument back to the issuer for a cash payment, 
or in some
cases, (c) both the warrant feature to acquire the common stock and the put 
option feature to put that stock back to the issuer for a cash payment. Put
warrants are frequently issued concurrently with debt securities of the 
issuer, are detachable from the debt, and may be exercisable only under 
specified
conditions. The put feature of the instrument may expire under varying 
circumstances, for example, with the passage of time or if the issuer has a 
public stock
offering. Under Opinion 14, a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of 
debt with detachable warrants must be allocated to those warrants.

Consensus

Because the contract gives the counterparty the choice of cash settlement or 
settlement in shares, public companies should report the proceeds from the
issuance of put warrants as liabilities and subsequently measure the put 
warrants at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. 
Nonpublic
companies may continue to classify and measure the put warrants in accordance 
with the consensus in Issue 88-9.

D. Earnings per Share

The Task Force reached the following consensus on how written put options 
affect the earnings-per-share calculation:

If the written put options are "in the money" during the period being 
reported on, the potential dilutive effect on earnings per share should be 
computed using
the reverse treasury stock method. Under that method, the incremental number 
of shares is computed as (a) the number of shares that would need to be issued
for cash at the then current market price to obtain cash to satisfy the put 
obligation less (b) the number of shares received from satisfying the puts.

The Task Force discussed whether it should comprehensively address issues 
relating to earnings per share in this Issue. The Task Force agreed that the 
FASB
should address the issues relating to earnings per share as part of its 
project on earnings per share. [Note: See STATUS section.]

STATUS

In February 1997, the FASB issued Statement 128, which supersedes Opinion 15. 
Statement 128 is effective for financial statements for both interim and
annual periods ending after December 15, 1997, and earlier application is not 
permitted.

Statement 128 affirms the consensus reached by the Task Force on how written 
put options affect the earnings per share calculation. That is, in computing
diluted EPS, Statement 128 requires use of the reverse treasury stock method 
to account for the dilutive effect of written put options and similar 
contracts that
are "in the money" during the reporting period. Statement 128 states that 
purchased options should not be reflected in the computation of diluted EPS 
because
to do so would be antidilutive. At the July 23 and November 18-19, 1998 
meetings, an FASB staff representative made an announcement (Topic No. D-72,
"Effects of Contracts That May Be Settled in Stock or Cash on the Computation 
of Diluted Earnings per Share ") that for those contracts that provide the
company with a choice of settlement methods, the company shall assume that 
the contract will be settled in shares. That presumption may be overcome if 
past
experience or a stated policy provides a reasonable basis to believe that it 
is probable that the contract will be paid partially or wholly in cash. For 
contracts in
which the counterparty controls the means of settlement, past experience or a 
stated policy is not determinative. Accordingly, in those situations, the more
dilutive of cash or share settlement should be used.

At the July 23-24, 1997 meeting, the Task Force addressed the accounting for 
contingent consideration issued to effect a purchase business combination in
Issue No. 97-8. "Accounting for Contingent Consideration Issued in a Purchase 
Business Combination ." The Task force observed that Issue 96-13 should
be applied to freestanding contracts that are indexed to, and potentially 
settled in, a company's own stock if those instruments meet the criteria in 
Issue 97-8
for recording as part of the cost of the business acquired in a purchase 
business combination.

A related issue has been discussed in Issue No. 98-12, "The Application of 
Issue No. 96-13 to Forward Equity Sales Transactions ." That Issue deals with
the accounting and earnings per share treatment of situations in which a 
freestanding derivative instrument (a forward contract) that is indexed to, 
and
potentially settled in, a company's own stock is issued concurrent with the 
issuance of shares of the company's stock. This Issue is limited to 
situations in which
the party to whom the common stock was sold is also the counterparty to the 
forward contract.

Another related issue has been discussed in Issue No. 99-1, "Accounting for 
Debt Convertible into the Stock of a Consolidated Subsidiary ." That Issue
deals with the accounting in the consolidated financial statements for debt 
issued by a consolidated subsidiary or a parent company that is convertible 
into the
stock of a consolidated subsidiary. As part of the discussion of Issue 99-1, 
Task Force members agreed to consider further whether to clarify this Issue by
indicating that equity shares of any entity under the control of the 
consolidated entity are considered "a company's own stock."

A related issue was discussed at the May 19-20, 1999 meeting in Issue No. 
99-3, "Application of Issue No. 96-13 to Derivative Instruments with Multiple
Settlement Alternatives ." That Issue deals with how certain derivative 
contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own stock that 
contain
multiple settlement alternatives should be accounted for.

The Task Force discussed another related issue in Issue No. 99-7, "Accounting 
for an Accelerated Share Repurchase Program ." That Issue addressed the
accounting for, and pooling-of-interests implications of, purchasing treasury 
stock and simultaneously entering into a forward contract indexed to the
company's own shares.

At the March 16, 2000 meeting, the Task Force discussed a related issue in 
Issue No. 00-6, "Accounting for Freestanding Derivative Financial Instruments
Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, the Stock of a Consolidated 
Subsidiary ." That Issue addresses how freestanding derivative instruments 
entered into
by a parent company that are indexed to, and potentially settled in, the 
stock of a consolidated subsidiary should be classified and measured in the
consolidated financial statements.

Another related issue was discussed at the March 16, 2000 meeting in Issue 
No. 00-7, "Application of Issue No. 96-13 to Equity Derivative Instruments 
That
Contain Certain Provisions That Require Net Cash Settlement If Certain Events 
outside the Control of the Issuer Occur ." That Issue deals with how certain
derivative contracts indexed to, and potentially settled in, a company's own 
stock that require a cash payment by the issuer upon the occurrence of future
events outside the control of the issuer should be accounted for.

No further EITF discussion is planned.

EITF Action on Derivatives on a Company's Own Shares

July 21, 2000

At its July 19, 2000 meeting, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF)=20
tentatively resolved how certain settlement features affect accounting for=
=20
equity derivative contracts entered into by a company on its own stock.=20
Specifically, the EITF sketched out a model governing how such features=20
affect whether the contract should be treated as (a) an equity instrument a=
nd=20
reported in stockholders=01, equity or (b) an asset or liability at fair va=
lue=20
with changes in fair value reported currently in earnings.

EITF Issue No. 00-19, "Determination of Whether Share Settlement is Within=
=20
the Control of the Issuer for Purposes of Applying Issue No. 96-13 ," was=
=20
taken up to address implementation of the EITF's March 16, 2000, consensus =

EITF Issue No. 00-7, "Application of EITF Issue No. 96-13 to Equity=20
Derivative Transactions That Contain Certain Provisions That Require Cash=
=20
Settlement If Certain Events Occur ." The final consensus in Issue 00-7=20
generally stated that equity derivative contracts that contained provisions=
=20
that implicitly or explicitly required net cash settlement outside of the=
=20
control of the company must be treated as assets and liabilities and carrie=
d=20
at fair value rather than equity instruments carried at original cost and=
=20
reported as part of permanent equity as provided for in EITF Issue No. 96-1=
3,=20
"Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentiall=
y=20
Settled in, a Company's Own Stock ."

The Task Force also tentatively provided an extended transition period for=
=20
existing contracts and contracts entered into before a final consensus is=
=20
reached. The goal is to reach a final consensus at the September 2000 EITF=
=20
meeting.

The Model=20

The model=01,s governing concept is that, for a contract to be accounted as=
=20
permanent equity, the contract's provisions should put the company=01,s=20
counterparty in no better position than the company=01,s common shareholder=
s.=20
Specifically, the EITF tentatively concluded that contracts in a company=01=
,s=20
own stock, such as written puts or forward purchase contracts, that come=20
under the scope of Issue 96-13 and have net share settlement provisions tha=
t=20
keep a contract from being classified as an asset or liability must have th=
e=20
following characteristics =01* otherwise the contract must be treated as an=
=20
asset or liability at fair value with changes in fair value reported=20
currently in earnings.

The contract must permit the company to settle net in shares, at its option=
,=20
in either registered or unregistered shares. (It was determined that the=20
ability to deliver registered shares was outside of the control of a compan=
y.)
The contract must contain an explicit cap on the number of shares to be=20
delivered in a net share settlement. This cap must exist even if the contra=
ct=20
terminates when the stock price reaches a stated price trigger. (The need f=
or=20
a cap was determined to be critical in determining whether a company had=20
sufficient authorized and unissued shares to settle the contract.)
At contract inception and on an ongoing basis, the company must have=20
sufficient authorized but unissued shares available to settle the contract=
=20
considering all other claims on authorized shares for stock options,=20
convertibles, and other transactions that may require the issuance of stock=
.=20
(This requirement was deemed critical as the ability to have a request for=
=20
additional authorized shares approved by the shareholders was deemed outsid=
e=20
of the control of the company. In this context, "the company" is defined as=
=20
the company's management rather than its management and shareholders.)
There is no requirement in the contract to post collateral at any point in=
=20
the contract or for any reason.
There are no required cash payments to the counterparty (true-ups) if the n=
et=20
shares initially delivered are insufficient to provide the counterparty wit=
h=20
full satisfaction of the amount due. However, true-ups may be included in t=
he=20
contract if the company only, not the counterparty, can choose whether to=
=20
satisfy the true-up in shares or cash and the true-up is subject to the=20
explicit cap discussed in item 2.
There is no economic penalty in the contract for net share settlement that=
=20
would economically compel the company to settle in net cash. (The right to=
=20
increase the number of shares delivered based on the fair value differentia=
l=20
between registered shares and unregistered shares was not deemed to be a=20
penalty.)
There are no provisions in the contract that would indicate the counterpart=
y=20
had creditor rights, or would otherwise contravene the objective of this=20
model that the counterparty=01,s rights would rank no higher than those of =
a=20
common shareholder. (Subject to future EITF discussions, it may be possible=
=20
to meet this criterion by having a legal letter addressing the issue or a=
=20
specific statement of this concept in the contract.)

Related Issues

There was also discussion of the provisions relating to termination and=20
settlement in the event of a merger or change in control. There was general=
=20
support for a position that, as long as the counterparty received the same=
=20
choice of compensation as other shareholders (for example, stock for stock,=
=20
stock and cash for stock, cash for stock), the fact that the counterparty=
=20
might receive cash in such circumstances would not preclude equity treatmen=
t=20
for the contract.

Similarly, in the event of nationalization or liquidation, a net cash=20
settlement of the same type afforded a common shareholder would not preclud=
e=20
equity treatment for the contract.

In addition, counterparty rights that did not exceed rights of common=20
shareholders should be acceptable, for example, rights to sue for damages i=
n=20
the event of misrepresentations or a breach of warrranties or if a company=
=20
simply refused to perform under the contract, as long as a common sharehold=
er=20
would also have those rights.

With respect to events that would cause a contract that was compliant with=
=20
the model at inception to later become noncompliant (for example, because a=
n=20
acquisition consumed enough authorized shares that otherwise were needed to=
=20
satisfy the contract), the EITF concluded that, at the time the contract is=
=20
no longer compliant, the fair value of the contract should be transferred=
=20
from equity to an asset or liability at fair value with prospective changes=
=20
in fair value reported currently in earnings. There would be no immediate=
=20
earnings effect at the time of this transfer.

Further, if, at a later date, sufficient shares were authorized to again=20
satisfy the contract, the carrying amount of the contract (that is, its fai=
r=20
value) would be transferred back to equity and the contract treated as equi=
ty=20
prospectively to the extent the contract continues to comply with the model=
.=20
(The company would not be permitted to reverse the gains and losses in fair=
=20
value recognized in earnings during the period the contract was treated as =
an=20
asset or liability.)

Transition

The EITF tentatively concluded that all contracts entered into after the da=
te=20
of a final consensus will have to comply with the model at contract incepti=
on=20
to achieve equity treatment. (The goal is to reach a final consensus at the=
=20
September 2000 EITF meeting.) For contracts entered into before the date of=
 a=20
final consensus, a company will have until June 30, 2001, to modify the=20
contract to comply with the final consensus.

For example, if a company entered into a contract before the date of the=20
final consensus, the company will have until June 30, 2001, to obtain any=
=20
shareholder authorization of shares needed to satisfy the criteria or to=20
modify their contract for the other criteria or any EITF changes to the=20
tentative model.

Since a variety of viewpoints are discussed at Emerging Issues Task Force=
=20
(EITF) meetings and it is often difficult to characterize the conclusions,=
=20
the following minutes may differ in some respects from the final minutes=20
available from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).

Bob and Sara -

 As we discussed, I enclose the cover page from the lengthy CFTC
policy paper relating to regulation of Ag Options.  This paper was never
approved by the full Commission and does not represent CFTC policy.  I also
enclose:

 (i) An outline of the application for designation as a contract
market (a recent example is the application of BrokerTec Futures Exchange
LLC, published at 65 F.R. 36667 (June 9, 2000));

 (ii) Excerpts from a report by the General Accounting Office
discussing issues relating to the reauthorization of the CFTC (May 1999).
(This represents much of the seed work for S. 2679 and deals with certain of
the issues we discussed yesterday.); and

 (iii) Introductory notes to CFTC revisions to its Rules relating
to agricultural trade options (December 6, 1999).

The exemption we discussed was for an entity called SwapClear, referred to
in the GAO report.  During one of our conversations, Bob referred to
multilateral transaction execution facilities.  The Commission has proposed
regulations on this subject.  They are reported at 65 F.R. 38985 (June 22,
2000) (CCH Commodity Futures Law Reporter paragraph 28,153).

Regards.

- Larry

Here's my stab at the Product Long Description.

Sara - please review and offer your comments.

RAC - I need a Sigma Factor, please.

William - I have built a test Product in the Product Manager and it appears 
to have worked okay. I have asked David Forster to review the description as 
well as the attributes that I built in TEST. I will begin to build this in 
Production once I have his and Sara's sign-off. David will also be checking 
on the issue that I mentioned to you about the number of characters that can 
be put in the Volume and Price feilds in the Stack Manager. This is the one 
thing that could really hold up the process, so we may want to think about 
alternatives (such as trading in 10,000 increments - so that 5 means 50,000; 
50 means 500,000; etc) 

Jennifer Denney will be contacting Clara Carrington to talk to her about how 
Clara will see trades come over in the EOL Bridge Monitor.

Things are progessing relatively well so far, with the exception of the issue 
of the character limitation.

Bob:  I am having a stack of materials relating to Enron Corp. equity trading 
sent to your attention via Federal Express on Monday.   DO NOT READ ANYTHING

Rex, Jim and I have been discussing the variety of Enron Corp. equity 
derivatives on ENE stock, the latest accounting issuances, ENE Board 
resolutions, confirmation templates and the like.  Rex should be contacting 
you shortly to schedule a conference call.

The package of materials MIGHT be useful when we discuss the foregoing issues

Hi, Clem!  Please see below message from Sheila Glover.  I believe that in

Bill and Sara,
We have been talking with Goldman Sachs, one of ECT Investment's prime 
brokers,  about ways to reduce our margin requirement and gain greater 
leverage.  Goldman suggested that we may want to consider putting an Enron 
Guaranttee in place.  

We also have a prime broker agreement with Morgan Stanley.  Per the 
documentation that I have... I do not see a guarantte with Morgan Stanley.

1) Can you confirm that no guarantee exists with either Goldman or Morgan?
2) Any comments regarding a Goldman guarantee by Enron Corp for ECT 
Investments Inc.?

Thanks, Sheila

Tana,

Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the 
assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who 
previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and 
with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is 
working on this.

I've left Mark Taylor a message since Carol's voice mail forwards all 
questions to Mark.

Could you let me know if you have any info?

Thx,
Tracyh

Paul:  Jason sent the following issues to me but Nos. 1,2 and 4 impact 
credit.  Please call me to discuss.  Sara

Sara,

The following items are outstanding issues with respect to the 
above-referenced ISDA:

1. Arizona Public Service Company plans on executing the ISDA as Arizona 
Public Service Company, on behalf of its Bulk Power Marketing Resource 
Operations Division ("BPMROD").  It is APSC's intent in the future to create 
a new entity for this division, such new entity to enter into all trading 
transactions.  As a result, it is ASPC's desire to  modify the definition of 
"Specified Transaction" to only include transactions between Party A and 
BPMROD.

2. Procedures for Entering into Transactions - ASPC would like 5 days to 
dispute or accept confirmations.  Apparently, all of their agreements provide 
for 5 days, therefore any shorter time period could cause problems for them.  
I had previously offered 3 days.

3. Part 5 (f) Recording - ASPC wants to consent to recordings on "trading 
lines only".  They do not want to consent to officers (non-traders) being 
recorded if the communication does not occur on a trading line.

4. Part 5 (g)(B) - Setoff -  ASPC wants to delete "or any of its Affiliates" 
from this section.  ASPC thinks this issue is related to their issue in #1 
above.  I don't see why.  What do you think?  I assume that we are not 
willing to strike "or any of its Affiliates".

The only other issue is a credit issue which I am handling with Paul Radous.  
So, we're close.  Let me know what you think.

Jason

Hi, Jason!  Please send me your phone and fax.  Do you still have voice mail 
over here?  Regarding your message, I have asked Paul to consider items 1,2 
and 4 since each bears upon credit.  I'll get back to you.
On a different note, how would you like some more work?  Call when you're 
free.  Sara

Ted:  I never received the updated list mentioned in our Monday meeting.  
Could you please email one to me?  Thanks.  Sara

Mark:  Russell Diamond in credit said that you took a call from the WPS 
lawyer about 10 days ago.  You entered the call into Lotus Notes.  
(1)  What was the conversation about?
(2)  Did you assign this file to anyone?

Thanks.  Sara

Carol:  Hope all is well.  We are missing you every day.

(1)  On a "swap" related note, we have a Canadian party requesting the 
ability to post cash collateral to ENA.  Can you recall where we left off on 
the issue?  I seem to  remember conflicting advice (Peter's insistence upon 
the Stikeman memo and ENA simply not agreeing to accept cash) and uncertainty 
as to how ENA could perfect its interest and what law governs (in cash held 
in a U.S. account).

(2)  On a "credit" related note, I was forwarded the 7/24/00 Margin Exception 
Report (originally sent to your attention).  What were you doing to follow up 
on this report?  Yesterday, Mary gave me a copy of a "collateral letter" 
being sent by Molly Harris.  Did you speak with Mary about working on this 
project in your absence?

Edward Ondarza is moving to EBS.   Stephanie Panus starts on Monday.  That's 
all the news for now.
 
Talk to you soon.  Sara

P.S.  Can you send photos over the net?

Clint:  after the meeting, Jim advised me that the ENE board resolution will 
be drafted for the Oct. meeting.  In the interim, he is convinced that only 
Enron Corp. should be a swap party to these equity swaps, forwards, etc.  I 
am going to speak with Rod Nelson (credit) and make some changes to our 
approach.  This should also make life easier negotiating with Lehman and Bear 
(from a credit perspecttive) but we'll reach an obvious stalemate when they 
ask for an Enron Corp. resolution (forthcoming after the relevant board 
meeting.  Sara

I need your expertise.  Attached is only a start.  SS

Mary:  Please let me know what happens.  All calculations should be made as 
of a specific date.  Sara

	Mary Cook
	08/02/2000 01:12 PM
		 
See the attached proposed letter for ParPak.  I need the rest of the 
calculations, the Value of the Posted Credit Support as of the Valuation Date 
and the difference.  Do you normally have the trader review this type of 
letter prior to sending?  I think we should in this instance.  I expect 
ParPak to reply with a request for a Return Amount.  As this occurs, please 
let me draft that letter as well.  Thank you. 
I will finalize the letter for you when I get the calculations.  Any 
questions, please call.  Mary

Cathy and I left a message for Per since he originates hedge funds.  SS

Anyone know anything about this?
	Mary Tudon
	08/04/2000 09:11 AM
		 
Everybody,

Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
status of the master.

Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
this and pass the info on.

Ken:  In connection with our new product (and  absence of any physical 
activity in that product), I have the following question:

If neither ENA nor its counterparty is able to qualify as an offeree for 
purposes of the Trade Option Exemption (17 CFR Sec. 32.13, as amended) but 
each is an eligible swap participant (or better yet, each party has $10 
million in net worth as per Sec. 32.13) can the option still be exempt from 
CFTC regulation under the Swap Policy Statement or any CFTC interpretive 
letters?

I have concerns about not relying fully on the Trade Option Exemption but I 
also understood that the CFTC has informally said that the Swap Policy 
Statement provides a safe harbor for both swaps and options.

I am available to speak at your convenience.  Thanks.  Sara [713/853-5620]

Sara, Samantha,
I spoke with Guillaume this morning.  He suggested that we do the PrimeTrade 
Access Agreement first.  This allows us to get the CD for the PrimeTrade 
application  and to install it on a  PC here, roll it out to the traders, and 
have CSFB come in for trainng.
At the same time we can complete the clearing agreement.
We will not do the give up agreement.  If we decide we can do easily in the 
future.
Guillaume suggested that you call him if you have any questions.  He will be 
happy to facilitate.

Sheila 
Dear Sheila

My colleagues have told me that you have received the following CSFB
documents.

* PrimeTrade access agreement
* standardized give ups
* clearing docs
* futures fees.

Please let me know if you need any help or have any questions , I will make
sure that you get answers right away.

Sincerely

here is online (web based) convertible trading site hat I could use - kindof 
like an online broker where they match up buyers and sellers.  I take it that 
before we enter to any agreement with them you need to approve it all.  

 I have not looked at this document yet, so please feel free to make any 
comments you may have.

The attached confirm is a swap.  There is no need for a rep in the confirm.  
If a weather deal is structured as an option, Gordon Heaney (backed by Diane 
Anderson) who confirms weather transactions, adds the weather-specific Trade 
Option rep into the confirmation.  The desk uses a template for options.  Let 
me know if you have any other questions.  Sara

this feasible?

Jeff says Floating Price language is ok.  SS

From the contract specification documentation provided by the OM to us I 
would say that for the "pulpex futures contract", reference to the term
"Daily Settlement Price" is the same as reference to "daily closing price" or 
"last traded price" for the Pulpex Futures Contract after reading contract 
specification section 2.1.13 of their documentation.  The OM simply defines 
it as the last traded price on each business day.  However, "Daily Settlment 
Price" for the pulpex options contract per contract specification 2.2.6 
defines it as the mid price of the closing bid and offer price.  
Give me your fax number and I'll send the documentation to you for review.

That being said I think your floating price language is OK and we should move 
forward in order to close the books on this one.

Thanks for your help.

The London office is forwarding recent legal advice from our lawyers in South 
Africa regarding FX clearances.  It seems that prior to transacting with a 
South African party, we need copies of the party's "certification" from the 
National Bank allowing the party to make payments out of the country (thereby 
converting local currency to USD).  Such approvals are severely restricted.  
I will forward the memos to Susan Bailey for inclusion in our "database" of

market in BA. 
In this regard we have contacted Perez Companc, active both in Oil trading 
and Power Generation, and as a result we have a possibility of structuring

Ken:  In connection with our new product (and  absence of any physical 
activity
in that product), I have the following question:

If neither ENA nor its counterparty is able to qualify as an offeree for
purposes of the Trade Option Exemption (17 CFR Sec. 32.13, as amended) but 
each
is an eligible swap participant (or better yet, each party has $10 million in
net worth as per Sec. 32.13) can the option still be exempt from CFTC 
regulation
under the Swap Policy Statement or any CFTC interpretive letters?

I have concerns about not relying fully on the Trade Option Exemption but I 
also
understood that the CFTC has informally said that the Swap Policy Statement
provides a safe harbor for both swaps and options.

I am available to speak at your convenience.  Thanks.  Sara [713/853-5620]

transactions between the participants of the Wholesale Electric Market 
(Generators, Transmission Co, Distributors, Marketers and End Users).

This DTE is published around the 5th or 6th day of each month and reports all 
transactions for the previous month. It is accessed by calling into Cammesa's

We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
change MG's status.

Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
"arranger" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
solutions:

The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
and Switzerland.

Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
you need any further information, please let me know.

Many thanks.

Get ready...decimalization is coming soon!

Dear SARAH:

To bring the U.S. securities markets in line with foreign markets and
make the pricing easier to understand, the Securities Industry
Association and the Securities and Exchange Commission have agreed to
convert the existing U.S. stock and exchange-traded options markets
from fraction to decimal-based pricing. The SEC has recently mandated
that this project be initiated no later than September 5, 2000.

As of this date, it hasn't been decided whether stocks will be traded
in nickel or penny increments. The NYSE will begin testing the decimal
system in September with a group of 50 stocks traded to the penny,
while all others will continue to be quoted in fractions. To ensure
that the transition progresses smoothly, with no disruption to the
functioning of the market, other stocks and options will convert
gradually to decimal pricing over a period of six months.

What this means to you as an E*TRADE customer:

Decimalization means you'll soon see the prices for stocks and options
quoted the same way they are at the grocery store or the gas station:
$20.50 (not $20-1/2) and $35.25 (not $35-1/4). By April 1, 2001, every
price you see on your trade confirmations, statements, on the E*TRADE
Web site, in the newspapers, and on the stock tickers on television
will be expressed in decimals.

E*TRADE is prepared to do everything possible to make this transition
from fractions to decimals a smooth one. Beginning in August, we will
post more information about the conversion to decimal pricing on our
Web site. Please check regularly for updates.

As always, thank you for investing with E*TRADE. We look forward to
serving you for many years to come.

Sincerely,

Suzi White
E*TRADE Vice President, Service Quality

The US entity we're considering at the moment is an FCM, regulated by the 
CFTC and which is a member of NYMEX/COMEX. It currently clears the NY 
exchanges metals business for the group. It will probably be utilised to 
clear the NY exchange energy business following the Enron tie up. It may 
assist in clearing CSCE business but is unlikely at this stage to be looking 
to be a CSCE exchange member. 

It currently has capital of $2 million and subordinated debt of $20 million. 
Profits are generally paid out in the form of a dividend so although it may 
have a small amount of retained profit it won't be material. Currently it has 
about $10 million of regulatory capital requirements.

Depending on your advice, we may consider an un-regulated company with, at 
the moment, not very much capital. This latter point could be rectified, 
either with subordinated debt or capital injection. The EFP customer 
facilities (approximately 50% of the business) may prohibit this.

I hope this is enough info.

Best regards.

Jon

For example, is it currently regulated in any respect?  Is it, or will it be, 
engaged in any other businesses?  How large is it in terms of assets or net 
worth?  Thanks.  I'll get back to you soon.

Further to our recent telephone conversation, we would be grateful if you 
would
give us a brief written summary on the regulatory and/or legal issues 
governing
a US corporation transacting foreign exchange with US and non-US customers. My
basic understanding of our telephone conversation was that, as a non-bank,
neither the Fed, the SEC nor the CFTC have any jurisdiction. However the
Commodities Exchange Act prohibits us from contracting with certain types of
counterparties.

The potential business we are looking at currently covers outright foreign
exchange with counterparties such as banks, securities houses, funds, 
corporates
and, possibly, high net worth individuals. The business also covers the
provision of EFP facilities for these customers whereby they ultimately 
receive
a currency futures position on the IMM division of the CME or on FINEX. This
latter area is one where, from the Exchanges' points of view, we would
effectively be acting as an executing broker.

I hope this brief description is enough for you to be able to respond but if 
you
have any questions or would like further clarification, you can contact me by
e-mail or by telephone on +44 20 7265 5421.

Thank you for your help in this.

FYI

We have decided NOT to proceed with the swap agreement.  Enron and Shell will
each write a guaranty in favor of TBS for their pro rata share of the negative
difference between the gas price received and gas price paid resulting from 
the
differential in the gas price escalators.  Any positive difference in TBS's
favor will run through the TBS accounts to the TBS distribution account and,
subject to the blocking test in the Accts and Disbursement Agmt, will then be
distributed to E & S.
Dean & John: Can you propose a draft guaranty for internal review?  Once we're
happy with it we can send it to Shell for their consideration/sign-off.  
Thanks.

Regards,
     John

I am sending this e-mail message to address several issues related to the
swap and to circulate a proposed confirmation for your consideration.

Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to
me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather
than a guaranty.  If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know
so that we can stop this process.

Comments on the Draft Schedule:

     1.  Part 1(a) "Specified Entity":  A Specified Entity is an entity
other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a
termination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified
Entity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a
Specified Entity with respect to TBS.

     2.  Part 1(b) "Threshold Amount": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which
seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.

     3.  Part 1(h) "Additional Event of Default":  If we use a swap
arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one
for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want
an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest
in TBS could result in termination?

     4.  Part 2  "Representations":  I think that we need someone in tax
to determine whether TBS can make the representations.

     5.  Part 4(d) & (e) "Credit Support Provider": Shell will be the
credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.

     6.  Part 4(g) "Governing Law", 4(h) "Arbitration": The schedule
proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem
to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to
those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami,
under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of
the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).

Comment on the Proposed Confirmation:

     I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas
Supply Agreement under the "Fixed Amount Details" but have not done so under
the "Floating Amount Details", which cross-references the provisions of the
SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.

     Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments
or any comments on the attached confirmation.  I will contact Nasim to
discuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to
completion.

Regards, Dean

where they wind up at each such stage - hopefully a more friendly on the eyes

Jason had a few ISDAs for Cayman Islands (the Tudor group of docs) which he 
advised were final.  Samantha prepared final docs.  I looked them over just 
generally and signed off.  I am however asking Samantha to just check with 
you regarding the docs before we send to credit since they are Cayman/FX and 
I think you worked with Jason on them.  Thanks.  Mary

Jason:  Two more electronic agreements.
Samantha:  Please enter into database.

We are considering several online trading platforms for trading investment 
grade, high yield and convertible corporate bonds.  

The sites we are considering are as follows:

Market Axess & LIMITrader - I will send you documents for these sites today.

Buy Side Direct, for which documents are being reviewed by your group.

Trading Edge / Bond Link - The review of documents for this site was 
originally handled by George Weber, who has since forwarded these agreements 
to Carmen Ayala.

Thanks for your assistance in reviewing these documents.  Please let me know 
if I can provide additional information during your review.

Intelligent Markets ?  Could I get an update on the status of this review and 
any outstanding issues ?

Thanks.

Justin/Paul:  The Houston contingent of EnronCredit.com Limited has a number 
of agreements which they would like to have executed.  All ENA/Enron Corp. 
affiliate brokerage/futures agreements are signed by the Enron trading party 
TOGETHER WITH Ted Murphy (for control purposes).  I am currently reviewing  
about 4-6 of these agreements.

How should we handle review of the referenced agreements originating from 
Houston?  Shall I continue to review?
Do you have trading resoutions/authorized trader lists in place for 
EnronCredit.com Limited?

I look forward to hearing from you.  Sara

What entity are these agreements in.  If they are in ECT Investments name, I 
think you should do.  If they are in ENA name, London can sign.

I've been working with our desk to create draft confirm which Brent received 
yesterday.  Should I be dealing with Julian?  SS
A few minutes ago Scott Neal spoke to Claudio Majul from C. Puerto and 
executed the swap.
Puerto is now waiting for the confirmation.

Sara, let's work on the terms of the confirmation, and once ready send it to 
Scott for him to fax it to Puerto.

We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
change MG's status.

Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
"arranger" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
solutions:

The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
and Switzerland.

Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
you need any further information, please let me know.

Many thanks.

I would very much appreciate your support re: other legal issues, CFTC, etc

Our understanding is that FX traded from the US is effectively unregulated. 
If we use MG London Inc, there would be the possibility that the CFTC would 
have some type of oversight on the unregulated business. Only the posting of 
the IMM EFPs needs to be done through the FCM.

There are other practical issues here in that that MG London Inc currently 
lacks the infrastructure needed to do the outright FX business as it has no 
bank FX lines and no bank accounts for all the currencies. There are other 
issues where the main settlements/back office expertise is here in London. 
These are obviously not insurmountable but we need to do a lot of work to get 
either MG London Inc or, for example, MG Newco Inc ready for the business. Is

Jon,

I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX 
Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory 
issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM 
entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity?

[Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & 
Cromwell paper]

Thanks.

09/08/2000 16:37

My suggestion would be for the FX business be run out of a NON FCM firm in 
the states (NY) since it is a non-regulated product.

The US entity we're considering at the moment is an FCM, regulated by the 
CFTC and which is a member of NYMEX/COMEX. It currently clears the NY 
exchanges metals business for the group. It will probably be utilised to 
clear the NY exchange energy business following the Enron tie up. It may 
assist in clearing CSCE business but is unlikely at this stage to be looking 
to be a CSCE exchange member. 

It currently has capital of $2 million and subordinated debt of $20 million. 
Profits are generally paid out in the form of a dividend so although it may 
have a small amount of retained profit it won't be material. Currently it has 
about $10 million of regulatory capital requirements.

Depending on your advice, we may consider an un-regulated company with, at 
the moment, not very much capital. This latter point could be rectified, 
either with subordinated debt or capital injection. The EFP customer 
facilities (approximately 50% of the business) may prohibit this.

I hope this is enough info.

Best regards.

Jon

Thanks.  I will prepare a memo.  One question on your e-mail -- can you give 
me a bit more information about the US entity that will be the FX dealer?  
For example, is it currently regulated in any respect?  Is it, or will it be, 
engaged in any other businesses?  How large is it in terms of assets or net 
worth?  Thanks.  I'll get back to you soon.

Further to our recent telephone conversation, we would be grateful if you 
would
give us a brief written summary on the regulatory and/or legal issues 
governing
a US corporation transacting foreign exchange with US and non-US customers. My
basic understanding of our telephone conversation was that, as a non-bank,
neither the Fed, the SEC nor the CFTC have any jurisdiction. However the
Commodities Exchange Act prohibits us from contracting with certain types of
counterparties.

The potential business we are looking at currently covers outright foreign
exchange with counterparties such as banks, securities houses, funds, 
corporates
and, possibly, high net worth individuals. The business also covers the
provision of EFP facilities for these customers whereby they ultimately 
receive
a currency futures position on the IMM division of the CME or on FINEX. This
latter area is one where, from the Exchanges' points of view, we would
effectively be acting as an executing broker.

I hope this brief description is enough for you to be able to respond but if 
you
have any questions or would like further clarification, you can contact me by
e-mail or by telephone on +44 20 7265 5421.

Thank you for your help in this.

Kind regards.

All:  I am trying to determine what issues are currently being addressed with 
respect to MG London, Inc. from a U.S. regulatory perspective and WHO is 
addressing them.  My concern arises from questions I am being asked by Gary 
Hickerson's group regarding FX trading AND (agricultural) trading where the 
existence of an Enron FCM or CTA could become significant.  I will try to 
have a short call arranged so that we can all understand the planned course 
of action, etc.  I realize that other individuals may be involved and we can 
include them as necessary.  Thanks.  Sara

When you have execution copies ready, have Kaye type on letter for me to 
sign.  Thanks.  SS

Please review the attached letter and comment.  I'll be glad to sign or would 
you prefer?  Sara

David:  I'm  just reviewing your fax and although your recap of the floating 
rate calculation was correct on the phone, there is no language in the 
confirm.  Were you going to respond to this as well?  (interest rate to apply 
to reduced notional, etc.)

All:  (1)  Please provide the name of the Enron party to this agreement.  If 
it is the London credit group, we need to verify authority to execute.  I 
never heard back from Paul Simons.
(2)  What is the priority?  I think we are waiting to hear back from Mike 
because we have had a conversation with the BuySideDirect people and can give 
an additional explanation.

All:  Attached are the following docs:
 (1)  Talon I LLC/Harrier I LLC equity swap confirm
 (2)  Harrier I LLC/EBS Investments, L.L.C. equity swap confirm
 (3)  revised ISDA Master Agreement Schedule for Harrier I LLC and EBS 
Investments, L.L.C.

Please review and provide me with your comments.  I do not have all necessary 
address and account information.
The swaps are subject to the  ISDA 1996 Equity Derivatives Definitions.  
Section 7.4 (of those Definitions) contains the payment obligations and 
provides that the Equity Amount Payer pays a positive Equity Amount and "the 
other party" pays the absolute value of a negative Equity Amount.  Also, I 
believe that Accounting Issue 00-19 is inapplicable to this Total Return Swap 
or else we may have issues with the "Extraordinary Events" elections.

Kaye:  Please print out the 3 docs for me.  Thanks.  SS

Have you followed up on our solution of sending cash in respect of our
credit requirements? (We are actually thinking that you could withhold a
couple of monthly payments to IPP (currently $680,000/month) in respect of
JDI's requirement. We would provide a letter approving this.)

Mark:  I scheduled a meeting with you at 4:30 pm today to discuss the MG 
acquisition, in particular, MG London, Inc. (a U.S REGULATED NYMEX clearing 
member, FCM, CTA).  NO ONE is looking into this from a US regulatory/legal 
perspective and I think it should be the swap group.  Enron's "regulated" 
product areas are metals (since MG clears its own trades on the NYMEX/COMEX 
and has FCM/CTA status) and potentially agriculture if we (some Enron entity) 
choose to become a regulated "ATOM" (ag trade option merchant).  From a legal 
perspective, I think we should have a "whitepaper" drafted by Sullivan & 
Cromwell, and, it should include an analysis of the MG London, Inc. existing 
situation.  This would tie into the ag regulation.  Also, have you thought 
about ENA and MG as NYMEX members and whether we keep both designations, 
whether we move all/part of ENA's existing clearing business to MG (and 
perhaps eliminate the need for margin/brokering arrangements such as Paribas, 
etc.) and any other related issues?  For efficiency purposes, Donna Lowry has 
asked to join us.  Donna and I had a conference call this morning with 
Justin, Paul, Jon Barrett, Sheila Glover and Trena McFarland to figure out 
who's on first (with MG).

Also, I am attaching an update of my workload.  I have reached the breaking 
point and I need more help (even with Jason's help on brokerage agreements 
the new electronic trading platform agreements are reaching multiple 
proportions with a new request for agreements for ENA, ECT Investments and 
EnronCredit.com London).  Gareth and Craig Clark want to meet today about the 
prepay (Delta/Citibank) and I REALLY need help on the Global Finance side.

See you later.  Sara

I am requesting that online trading agreements be executed with the following 
bond trading platforms which we are evaluating:

         Site   Initial Corporate Bond Categories *       Type  Site Status

Buy Side Direct   Convertibles (+ Equity Hedge)  ** Cross Matching  Aug 15th 
Launch

Trading Edge / Bond Link High Yield, Convertibles   Cross Matching  Live

LIMITrader   High Yield, Convertibles   Cross Matching  Live

Market Axess   Investment Grade   Multi-Dealer ***  August Launch
        
*   Additional corporate bond categories may be added in the future.  For 
example, Market Axess expects to add high yield and convertible bonds within 
3  to 6 months.   

** John Greene is aware that convertible bond transactions through Buy Side 
Direct will involve offsetting equity hedges.

*** We have execution agreements in place with all current Market Axess 
dealers.

Potential benefits offered by online sites include trading flows and improved 
execution efficiency.  In addition, these sites provide opportunities for 
generating demand for EnronCredit.com credit derivatives, given that users of 
these sites are buyers or sellers of corporate credit risk.  The ability to 
trade will greatly enhance our evaluation of these sites.  

As noted above, 3 of the 4 sites are cross-matching, where trading is 
completely anonymous and the site's sponsor or clearing firm are the nominal 
counterparty for all trades.   One of the 4 sites will be a multi-dealer 
system where counterparties transact directly with a particular dealer. 

Trades for all sites would be cleared through prime brokers with whom we have 
existing agreements.

As you suggested, we should ensure that agreements with online trading 
platforms allow for trading by ENA, ECT Investments and EnronCredit.com.   My 
understanding is that Sheila's group would coordinate the opening of any 
additional accounts required to facilitate trading by each entity.

I suggest that Madhur Dayal be designated initially at the person to receive 
notification of material changes to agreements.  We should retain the ability 
to change this contact person.

Thanks.

I'll review the guaranty after lunch.  Have we sent our comments back?  Lisa 
just did a 5-year deal with Xerox!!!!!!!!!  ss

The interest component was eliminated from the terms of this Transaction (as 
was the switch from a price return swap to a total return swap and the name 
change).  It seems that Ben and Scott S. had a subsequent conversation (after 
ours) and the agreed changes were communicated to me.  SS

I need someone assigned to assist in amending this agreement.  Most of the 
work is done.  Please let me know ASAP.

Mike and Sara,

There is generally "no give" on the Enron language regarding affiliates 
language which I have provided below.  

"The following entities shall also be deemed to be included in the term 
Subscriber and shall have the right to use the Service:  Subscriber's 
wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliated companies and those affiliated 
companies in which Subscriber or one of its subsidiaries or affiliated 
companies own an equity interest and which is under the direct or indirect 
control of Subscriber or one of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies.  
Furthermore, Subscriber shall also be allowed to have any agent or third 
party service company or facility manager of Subscriber's IT functions to 
assist it to the degree necesssary so that the Subscriber can fully access 
and utilize the Service."

I will be happy to discuss any procedures we utilize and/or provisions in the 
document.   It is also my understanding that Mike is expecting more contracts 
of this nature so standardized and acceptable language will be to our 
advantage.  Sara, our legal counsel is Mark Holsworth and he is "charged with 
reviewing all the IP documents".  

Let me hear from you soon.

Sam:  Please get on my calendar for Friday.  We need to update agreements, 
status, etc.  Also, we need to add a "Futures Agreement" designation to Lotus 
Notes.  Please bring your latest printouts for existing agreements and 
provide a copy for me.  Let's take about an hour.  Thanks.  Sara

ps  Also, if you have any questions about masters, etc., bring them along!

Good Morning Everyone,

The Swap Group will hold a Forms Meeting to discuss potential form changes to 
our financial trading forms on:

Date:  Thursday, August 17th

Time:  10:30 a.m.

Location: Conference Room   EB38C1

Susan S. Bailey

Shane:  Here's the scoop

(1)  ENA has an existing ISDA Master Agreement with Citibank N.A.. dated as 
of November 17, 1992.  The Master is not restricted to any particular type of 
transaction but it clearly anticipates commodity and rate swaps.  ENA is the 
Calculation Agent.  Also, only commodity transactions are netted.

(2)  Citibank proposed an amendment to this Master in February, 2000.  The 
amendment was primarily to amend the collateral annex to INCREASE the 
collateral threshold to USD 30 million for BBB (and above) rated entities.  
It also states Citibank to be "multibranch" with NY and London offices acting 
under the Master.  Apparently, the proposed FX language to be added to the 
Master was dropped (I think in the interest of time).  Mollie Harris in 
credit is trying to have Citibank sign the amendment.

(3)  ABN Amro is in my office ready for signature.  I will have it executed 
and email you when done.  Samantha Boyd (Ext.39188) will help me with the 
followup.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

	Shane Dallmann@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
	08/14/2000 10:15 PM
		
Sara,

Does this mean we have an ISDA and it is just being revised, so I can 
theoretically do a deal with them.

I also sent an email to Jason Peters ( don't know if he's still around) 
regarding the ABN Amro futures agreement. Do you know anything about this one?

Regards,

Shane

Sara,

I think we must mention the following as the source of the index price for 
energy: "Documento de Transacciones Economicas" (DTE). This is an electronic 
document published by Cammesa, and is available to all participants of the 
Wholesale Electric Market in Argentina. It's a summary of all the economic 
transactions between the participants of the Wholesale Electric Market 
(Generators, Transmission Co, Distributors, Marketers and End Users).

This DTE is published around the 5th or 6th day of each month and reports all 
transactions for the previous month. It is accessed by calling into Cammesa's 
server and replicating the corresponding database.

The attached word file shows you different screens of this electronic 
document. The second zipped file is the DTE for June.

(See attached file: IndexView.doc)(See attached file: dte9906.zip)

Have a look at it and give me a call if you have any questions.

Regards, Julian

Sam:  Please get on my calendar for Friday.  We need to update agreements, 
status, etc.  Also, we need to add a "Futures Agreement" designation to Lotus 
Notes.  Please bring your latest printouts for existing agreements and 
provide a copy for me.  Let's take about an hour.  Thanks.  Sara

ps  Also, if you have any questions about masters, etc., bring them along!

All:  I have once again revised the confirm for the EBS Raptor deal.  There 
will be only one swap transaction:  Harrier I LLC/Talon I LLC.   
Please note the following changes:

(1)  the Initial Equity Notional Amount has been corrected
(2)  I have expanded the definition of Cash Dividends
(3)  I have ADDED a provison for "Payment Obligations" to avoid confusion for 
those of you unfamiliar with the 1996 Equity Definitions.  Since I have 
removed the interest payment feature, the only payments changing hands will 
be upside/dividends and downside.  The "Equity Amount Payer" pays the upside 
(difference between Initial Price (on the relevant Valuation Date) and Final 
Price) and dividends; the other party pays the downside.
(4)  I have retained the concept of multiple optional termination dates.
(5) Kevin:  I NEED the Harrier account/notice information.

This confirm should serve as a template for additional Raptor equity share 
swaps so please review and comment.  Thanks.  Sara

   

Darren:  Laurel mentioned that you were interested in existing/pending 
brokerage/futures agreements.  Attached are our most recent matrices by Enron 
company.  ALL of these agreements are negotiated by legal and must be 
executed by the business unit (VP or higher) and Ted Murphy.  Sheila Glover 
always sends a request and explanation for new account to legal, compliance 
and Ted Murphy.  Legal keeps a comprehensive listing by Enron company in an 
effort to avoid confusion.  Legal updates authorized trader lists and trading 
resolutions.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

I am receiving calls from Gina Karathanos in Global Finance about this deal.  
She's inquiring about preparation of certificates, authorizations and 
signers.  Susan, please coordinate with Mary on that end (I presume we follow 
the same format as Carol).  As far as I know, closing is scheduled for Aug. 
24.  Apparently, lots of ENE officers will be out of town next week.  Do we 
know who will sign for ENA?  Thanks.  SS

Will focus later today.  
How are we handling ABN Amro?  I want to have executed.  Were you going to 
revise the notice page and add the location on the trading floor in the other 
agreement (?).  Please talk to Sam.  The docs are in my office.  I have 
meetings all afternoon.  Thanks.  Sara

Currently, we have three ISDA Master Agreements under process.  Our potential 
counterparties are Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co., The Industrial Bank 
of Japan and Sanwa Bank Ltd.  We have produced these documents based on the 
credit worksheets prepared in Houston and in conjunction with Baker &

them to the potential counterparties.

I am not aware of any brokerage arrangements to which Enron Japan Corp. is a

Thanks for your response John, I think it provides the clarification that we 
need to move forward.
I have one further question for you relating to current ISDA/exchange 
agreements that we have in place in Enron Japan.

Below are all exisiting ISDA and brokerage agreements that Financial trading 
currently has in place. Does Enron Japan have any ISDA/broker agreements in 
place that we can use for the purpose of executing financial trades?  
(perhaps with some of the names on the attached list?)If so, do you know what 
sort of credit has been extended and/or whether there is netting versus other 
commodity books or dedicated activity credit?

If we do not have any agreements in place which would allow us to conduct 
trades, do you know who I should contact regarding necessary documentation?

Sincerely,
Darren

From "daddy" with love.  "Manu" arrived on July 27 at 22:26pm.

Further to Mary's memo of 8/18/00, I would like to add the following comments:

(1)  I initially drafted the share swap confirm as a PRICE RETURN swap.  
Scott then requested a TOTAL RETURN swap (ie, dividends included).  I met 
with accounting this morning and (Ryan believes that) the swap is price 
return only:  the asset holder is only swapping price exposure and the 
business unit should recognize the immediate dividend benefit to its asset.

PLEASE VERIFY WHETHER THE SHARE SWAPS ARE PRICE RETURN OR TOTAL RETURN

(2)  With respect to the right of "multiple optional partial swap 
terminations", please verify that:
 (a)  the business unit has the right to request that Harrier partially 
terminate the swap prior to the scheduled termination, any number of times, 
without restriction as to frequency, minimum or maximum number of shares, or 
any other limitation, irrespective of whether the asset owner actually sells 
the underlying shares.  How is this right of termination (and the multiple 
requests) to be documented?
 (b)  the "Initial Price" of the shares on the Effective Date of the swap 
WILL ALWAYS BE USED to calculate the gain or loss (vs. using the share price 
on the date of each partial termination)

Sara:  I  heard rumors today about the move next week so I called Joya.  We 
need to pack up your office by 5 pm next Thurs. (8/24).

I'll order the boxes.

Kaye

Mark:  (1)  Did you consider my voice mail about updating authorized trader 
lists and resolutions (by Samantha or Tana)?

(2)  Have you thought about electronic notice provisions?  Shouldn't 
default/termination notices be in writing to the appropriate counsel/Corp. 
secretary?  And, can we agree to "electronic notices" at all?  There is no 
electronic address for a Documentation Desk or Assistant General Counsel.  I 
am seeing this type of provision in electronic trading agreements.

Thanks.  Sara

Tana:  Have you responded to either Greg or Molly?  Please call.  Sara

The following power point presentation graphically sets forth the steps 
necessary to integrate MG plc into Enron NetWorks L.P.  This presentation 
differs from that sent to several of you last week in that there are now 
dotted lines in red around those pieces of MG that are affected at each stage 
of the reorganization and solid red lines around the same pieces reflecting 
where they wind up at each such stage - hopefully a more friendly on the eyes 
presentation.  Please do not hesitate to call regarding any piece of the 
presentation.  My best to all.  Steve.

All:  During the fourth quarter, 2000, MLB intends to transfer all FX 
business to MLIB Ltd.  ENA and Enron Corp. have been asked to agree to this 
transfer with the result that any executed master agreement with MLB will be 
transferred to MLIB Ltd as principal.  ENA has an ISDA Master Agreement dated 
effective 7/1/95; I cannot locate a master between Enron Corp. and MLB.

Will someone in credit approve this transfer?  Please let Stephanie Panus 
(X53249), our newest paralegal, know.  Thanks.  Sara

I have an allergist appointment at 8 am on Monday.  I should be in by 9 or

for "Cash Settlement Amount":

If for any Determination Period, the Floating Price is less than or equal to 
the Strike Price, an amount equal to the product of (i) the Notional Quantity 
per Determination Period multiplied by (ii) the excess of the Strike Price 
over the Floating Price, which amount shall be due and payable by the Seller 
on the applicable Payment Date for such Determination Period.

P.S.  Melissa:  In the future, send me the deal ticket for review.

I just received this from Stoner.  Tanya:  I haven't reviewed this agreement, 
but my guess is that it may change some of the additional definitions 
contained in our March draft.  Sara

Why don't we talk about this.  I have initiated Samantha as the trading 
agreement guru.  That's why she needs to be in the loop on all of these 
agreements (amendments included).  Let's distinguish margin lines from 
trading agreements (although the margin line concept obviously includes a 
futures or other arrangement)  I maintain a list ("in the pipeline") which I

brokerage agreements or amendments or amplifications of established accounts 
to trade other commodities.  I have the paperwork Refco sent.  Maybe we 
should sent down and visit re all of the brokerage matters.  Should I handle 
these, or stick with the ones related to margin lines.  Should we send this 
kind of stuff to Jason?  Please advise.  Mary

Hi,

1. Refco

Refco's paperwork will be submitted to you today to review. It is my 
understanding
that the following rates have been negotiated (on a round-turn basis):

$2.50 Brokerage
$0.55 Exchange
$1.20 Clearing
$4.25

Our contact there is Steffen van Keppel at 713-266-0050

2. Cargill

Our traders want to renew crude oil trading with Cargill at a lower rate. 
Which legal documents do we need to sign to ensure that this lower
commission rate is established and honored?

3. GNI-Next advisors

We are talking to Stephen Purdy upon the request of Spencer Vosko. We have 
been advised that the rate will be $5.25 on a roundturn basis.
This broker will be forwarded their paperwork to the trader, and, I'll ensure 
that you receive it.

Please keep me updated on any other new brokers which we may be negotiating 
with for new agreements and/or existing brokerage agreements
which may be establishing a line of credit.

Many thanks,

during the convention. We want to have lunch with you. Are you free for
lunch at all next week. We will come downtown to meet you. Sorry I
missed you last week during my break from the South Texas Mineral Law
CLE seminar. Mary Ogden, a good friend, showed me your office and
introduced me to some of your co-workers. Everyone says you are the
best. It is nice to be able to say that I am a friend of Sara's from New
Orleans and watch everyone's face light up. You and Julia have a great
group of co-workers there.

I hope you and the hounds are well.

Jennifer below are MAP's legal department's comments on the Enron OTC 
agreement from July 14..

  1. On the address at the top of page 1 the address for MAP should be 
correctly identified.  I don't believe "Document Department" is correct. 
CHANGE TO ATTENTION DALE BARWIG

  2. Under the provision titled "Floating Amount Details", "Floating Price" 
at line 3, change the word "entitled" to "titled".

  3. Under Governing Law change "Texas" to "New York".

 On the last page, information should be inserted for notices for MAP and 
another provision for communications.  Under "Communications" insert "Prior 
to the close of business on the next business day following the trade date, 
ENA will prepare and forward this contract electronically (faxed or attached 
to an email in a mutually acceptable format) to MAP's trader with a copy to 
the supervisor of Feedstock Acquisition and Derivative Accounting as listed 
below under Contractual Invoices".

 Then for "Contractual Invoices":

Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (MAP)
Name: Fred L. Bennett
Title: Supervisor, Feedstock Acquisition and Derivative Accounting
Address: Room 444-M, 539 South Main Street, Findlay, Ohio 45840
Tel No: (419) 421-4200
Fax No: (419) 421-5040
Email: FLBennett@MAPLLC.com"

  4. Under Annex A General Terms and Conditions under the provision titled 
"Market Disruption Event", line 3, change "ENA" to "both parties".
Here starts my comments on the contract language.

5.  As we talked about I am confused that which crack sale has occurred.  The 
fixed price referencing the attachment should indicate USGC 74 Grade (Pipe) 
Heating Oil.  I am unclear where in the document we mention Low Sulfur.

Floating Price: The average of USGC platts oilgram midpoint for USGC Pipeline 
No. 2 74 Grade OIl, multiplied by 42, less the First Nearby NYMEX WTI Crude 
Oil futrures settlement prices

Where is the settlement paragraph?  Something like:

If the Fixed Amount exceeds the Floating Amount for such calculation period, 
the fixed price payor shall pay the floating price payor an amount equal to 
such excess.  If the floating amount exceeds the fixed amount for such 
calculation period, the floating price payor shall pay the fixed price payor 
an amount equal to such excess.

Thanks for you help.

We have decided NOT to proceed with the swap agreement.  Enron and Shell will
each write a guaranty in favor of TBS for their pro rata share of the negative
difference between the gas price received and gas price paid resulting from 
the
differential in the gas price escalators.  Any positive difference in TBS's
favor will run through the TBS accounts to the TBS distribution account and,
subject to the blocking test in the Accts and Disbursement Agmt, will then be
distributed to E & S.
Dean & John: Can you propose a draft guaranty for internal review?  Once we're
happy with it we can send it to Shell for their consideration/sign-off.  
Thanks.

Regards,
     John

I am sending this e-mail message to address several issues related to the
swap and to circulate a proposed confirmation for your consideration.

Before addressing the swap, however, I should note that it is not clear to
me that the project team has finally decided to proceed with a swap rather
than a guaranty.  If we are not, I would appreciate someone letting me know
so that we can stop this process.

Comments on the Draft Schedule:

     1.  Part 1(a) "Specified Entity":  A Specified Entity is an entity
other than the parties whose actions can cause an event of default or a
termination event.  The draft schedule does not contemplate a Specified
Entity.  I think we should consider whether EPE and/or SCG should be a
Specified Entity with respect to TBS.

     2.  Part 1(b) "Threshold Amount": proposes $1,000,000 for TBS, which
seems low given that Enron Corp. is backing it up.

     3.  Part 1(h) "Additional Event of Default":  If we use a swap
arrangement, there will be two: one for 72.5% between TBS and ECT, and one
for 27.5% between TBS and a Shell entity.  If that is the case, do we want
an additional event of default under which a sale by Shell of its interest
in TBS could result in termination?

     4.  Part 2  "Representations":  I think that we need someone in tax
to determine whether TBS can make the representations.

     5.  Part 4(d) & (e) "Credit Support Provider": Shell will be the
credit support provider under the other swap arrangement, not this one.

     6.  Part 4(g) "Governing Law", 4(h) "Arbitration": The schedule
proposes Texas law with AAA arbitration to be held in Texas.  It would seem
to me that we would want to use arbitration procedures that are similar to
those in the gas supply agreements, with ICC arbitration, held in Miami,
under New York, with joint arbitration if the same issue arises under one of
the gas supply arrangements (such as the proper calculation of price).

Comment on the Proposed Confirmation:

     I have reproduced the gas supply pricing provisions from the EPE Gas
Supply Agreement under the "Fixed Amount Details" but have not done so under
the "Floating Amount Details", which cross-references the provisions of the
SCG Gas Supply Agreement, because of the length of those provisions.

     Please let me know if you have any reactions to the above comments
or any comments on the attached confirmation.  I will contact Nasim to
discuss the process for pushing the swaps (or, alternatively, guaranties) to
completion.

Regards, Dean

All:  Please review for content.  This deal has been recast as a "Price 
Return Swap" and I hope it is self-explanatory (i.e., you won't have to drag 
out the 1996 Equity Definitions).  I will forward a draft letter shortly.  

The business guys are:  Kevin Cordesman and Andrew Conner
If you email John Stoner, please cc these guys (and me).  Thanks.

Kay:  I left you a voice mail yesterday at Sheila's suggestion regarding 
Midwest.  Greg and I discussed the use of ENA's format of ISDA documentation 
by Midwest and I have a couple of questions about how our docs will be used, 
whether Midwest will be competing with us and who will be negotiating hedge 
agreements on behalf of Midwest (i.e., will ENA swap lawyers be involved?).  
Please call me so that I can comply with Greg's request..
Thanks.  Sara

Greg:  I will have the boilerplate sent to you separately.

Stephanie:  Please send the boilerplate ISDA Master Agreement and Credit 
Support Annex to Gregg Penman in our Chicago office.  Thanks.  Sara

All:  Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to 
put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:

Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited
Credit Agricole Indosuez
CSFB International
Lehman Brother Finance S.A.
Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
Deutsche Bank

These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury 
group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the 
appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.

Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process?  Thanks.  Sara

insert language that will allow Enron to get a second lien on the assets 
after the primary lender instead of using the CSA.  Cross default thresholds 
are $1MM and $100MM, respectively for Empire and Enron.

Please send the draft to credit first and we will check the new language.

Please provide and notice and account information for the discussed

Attached is my response.  Sara

John:  I just wanted to stay in the loop for Japan as to Gary Hickerson's 
FX/rate/equity counterparties.  My understanding from Gary is that  EGM 
(through ENA) will continue to hedge the business originating in Japan, 
subject to tax and any regulatory input.  I don't know if this has 
necessitated an agency arrangement  between Japan and Houston (or another 
office, similar to London or Australia).  Also, for netting reasons, Japan 
would not duplicate existing counterparty  ISDA's with ENA, and to the extent 
Japan is transacting with a bank having an agreement with ENA, we could amend 
the agreement for multibranch purposes if necessary (e.g., Bank of Montreal 
if the bank is transacting from multiple locations that need to be added to 
ENA's agreement).

Please advise if you have already had these discussions with Mark Taylor.  I 
look forward to hearing from you.  Sara  

Robert:  The executed "Representative Agreement" was executed by  both ENA 
and Enron Australia; it was sent to David Minns via Federal Express on July 
6, 2000.  Let me know if you need anything further.  Sara

Sara/Mary,

Koch Energy Trading, Inc. has contacted me several times over the past couple 
of weeks in order to request that we change our Confirmation procedures.  
Currently, per the Master Agreement, we send our form of Confirmation and 
they sign and return those to us.  With the volume being well over 50 deals 
per day with Koch, they are now seeing this as cost prohibitive on their end, 
as they are doing all of the work related to Confirmations (Comparing details 
to their system and return faxing).  Now, Koch would like to go to both 
Counterparties sending confirms, comparing each other's paper to the system 
and notifying only in the case of discrepancies.  I suggested to Koch that we 
might try using a system similar to Sempra's in which we send our Confirms 
and they return a one-page fax which lists our deal numbers and their 
agreement or disagreement with those deals.  Still, they considered this to 
be very manual on their end and leaves them responsible for notifying of any 
discrepancies.  I'm sure the legal departments will be getting involved soon, 
so I wanted to get your thoughts on changing our current process before it 
comes to that.

Thanks,
Joe

John:  I just wanted to stay in the loop for Japan as to Gary Hickerson's 
FX/rate/equity counterparties.  My understanding from Gary is that  EGM 
(through ENA) will continue to hedge the business originating in Japan, 
subject to tax and any regulatory input.  I don't know if this has 
necessitated an agency arrangement  between Japan and Houston (or another 
office, similar to London or Australia).  Also, for netting reasons, Japan 
would not duplicate existing counterparty  ISDA's with ENA, and to the extent 
Japan is transacting with a bank having an agreement with ENA, we could amend 
the agreement for multibranch purposes if necessary (e.g., Bank of Montreal 
if the bank is transacting from multiple locations that need to be added to 
ENA's agreement).

Please advise if you have already had these discussions with Mark Taylor.  I 
look forward to hearing from you.  Sara  

Tomorrow!  Carson is gonna call you and coordinate.  Sara

Gary's voice mail directs callers to a gentleman with the last name of

I am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in 
Houston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in 
the name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are 
backed to EnronCredit.com Limited.  

In particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ 
International Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have 
no master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit 
derivatives?

FYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.

All:  I would like to take Friday, Sept. 29 as a vacation day.  Please advise 
if there are any conflicts.  Thanks.  Sara

EnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) 
is responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of

Sara,

Please contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  
Rod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be 
available in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but 
I am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other 
things Credit support for his business.  

It does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without 
Treasury's approval.

All:  Just a status update on the growing number of brokerage agreement 
requests, and, I will circulate an updated list shortly.

On 8/8/00, Mike requested agreements for Market Axess, LIMITrader Securities, 
Inc. and Trading Edge on behalf of EnronCredit.com Limited.  We have sent 
comments to the first two.  
Sheila requested a Morgan Stanley agreement for EnronCredit.com Limited (low 
priority).
ENA sent comments to Ing Barings (fka Furman Selz) some time ago and has not 
heard back.  We were going to dupe for ECT Investments, Inc.
Denis is the responsible lawyer for EnronCredit.com Limited..
If in fact these electronic agreements should be in the name of ECT 
Investments, Inc., then we'll negotiate from Houston (or divide and conquer!)
Sheila, your email of 8/18 seemed to refer to BuySideDirect's agreement with 
ECT Investments, Inc. (and not the agreements requested by Mike).  Also, you 
should note that BuySideDirect requires use of its designated broker, Weiss, 
Peck & Greer (I believe to take the other side of the trade or broker the 
deal with a third party)...We have received a copy of that agreement as well.

My goal here is to make certain that we are all on the same page and can 
continue to approach these agreements in an organized manner.  Please let me 
know your comments or questions.  

Thanks.  Sara

Willie received a call from Mike Billings, the trader at Dow,
and he requested that deal #EY0963.1 from 6/15/99 be revised
from Dow Hydrocarbons to Dow Chemical.

He is currently signing and sending back the other trades that were
changed.  

Is it okay to change this deal also, and on a "going forward" basis, all
trades must be through Dow Hydrocarbons...

As you know, Peoples has been eagerly awaiting templates (ISDA, Guarantees, 
L/Cs) from Enron for the MEH JV. At this point, their credit officer is 
leading the charge with People's legal department and moving forward to 
create something!  I have shared that we do not want to utilize the existing 
People's agreement as a standard.

Do you have templates we could give them now and explain they are under 
revision?  They have wanted to begin reviewing and are now anxious.   Don't 
we want Enron to lead the way for these templates?  Please advise.

Thank you

Midwest.  Greg and I discussed the use of ENA's format of ISDA documentation 
by Midwest and I have a couple of questions about how our docs will be used, 
whether Midwest will be competing with us and who will be negotiating hedge 
agreements on behalf of Midwest (i.e., will ENA swap lawyers be involved?).  
Please call me so that I can comply with Greg's request..

Before further distribution, I wanted to make certain that we were in 
agreement.  SS

Bill:  Thanks for your message.  Here's the information you requested:

(1)  Merrill Lynch:  1 year deal effective 8/4/00; 1,388,110 shares at 
$79.125 initial price

(2)  CSFB International:  1 year deal effective 5/11/00; 1,761,200 shares at 
$76.125 initial price

Jeff Nogid is familiar with these transactions.   Sara

Attached are drafts of the foregoing items in connection with the equity 
swap.  We will revise the swap again in the morning.  Thanks.  Sara

I spoke with Dale Neuner (confirm desk) a few minutes ago.  It seems that 
Scott Neal sent the deal ticket to EI and not ECT.  We have retrieved the 
ticket and Dale is talking to Scott about having the deal entered into trade 
capture.  Dale is in touch with Brent and will advise when deal has been 
entered.  SS

Sara,

Stuart advises that his request equally applies to the option to purchase 
Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. capital stock held by Sundance Assets, 
L.P. ( not the dreaded spark spread option which you worked on in the same 
transaction, which spark spread option was repurchased and terminated some 
months ago ). Let me know when you would like to discuss the matter. The 1997 
Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which the option was originally granted 
was signed today ( we are still waiting on an attachment to that agreement to 
be delivered by the other side before we release the document to them), and 
we did modify the option and some transfer restrictions in that Agreement 
that will apply to the Raptor analysis. A registration statement registering 
the CCSI common stock that would be acquired upon exercise of the option was 
filed yesterday with the SEC. Let me know when you would like to meet to 
discuss this matter. 
	Barton Clark
	08/30/2000 11:24 AM
		
Does the request apply as well to options to purchase? There is an option in 
the Catalytica transaction - recently renegotiated ( we are signing the deal 
up today) to purchase 500,000 plus CCSI shares on a cashless basis. The share 
number is subject to adjustment in a stock split to occur upon the spin off 
of CCSI prior to the merger of its parent sometime before year end. The 
option expires in February 2001.

If any of the Raptor investments for which you are responsible is comprised, 
in whole or in part, of warrants, please provide a copy of the warrants (and 
any related documentation which governs the exercise of the warrants) to 
either Sara Shackleton or Mary Cook.  For the public companies this should be 
done ASAP (i.e. no later than the end of business today) and for the privates 
this should be done by the end of the week.  Also, please arrange to meet 
with either Mary or Sara to provide a brief explanation as to how the 
derivatives work (they need to understand the nature of the derivatives in 
order to properly structure the Raptor hedge).  Once again, I apologize for 
the short notice but hope that each of you recognizes that the internal 
pressure to push investments into Raptor has increased exponentially.  Thanks 
in advance.

Attached are the final documents:

This confirm is ready for execution.

Let's eliminate future problems with Dow and their trader Mike Billings.

Credit has given the O.K. to trade in the name of The Dow Chemical Company.  
We will document trades on the "omnibus" UNLESS we are able to negotiate an
 ISDA with the counterparty.

Tell Mike Billings that we will not keep changing from "Dow Hydrocarbons and 
Resources, Inc." to the parent company.  We waste too much time and energy.

 Call if you have questions.  Sara

The ISDA Master  does not circumscribe the trade term or trade parameters. 
The issue which we discussed is authority.  The Merced resolution of March 
16, 1999 specifically authorizes the general manager "...to develop and 
provide appropriate information, and certifications for completing Master 
Trading (ISDA) Agreements with energy vendors and execute Master Trading 
(ISDA) Agreements and appropriate vendor Schedules to the ISDA Agreement for 
the purpose of acquiring energy and stabilizing energy costs.  Such 
executions are subject to Counsel review of the agreement and schedules as to 
form."  There is no specific mention of authority to enter into transactions 
(by Merced's traders).
Intuitively one could draw the conclusion that the ISDA Master contemplates 
transactions, Merced authorized the ISDA Master and therefore Merced 
authorized transactions under the ISDA Master.  Since Merced is a 
governmental entity, the safer view is that we should not assume that Merced 
authorized transactions.  Merced probably intended to authorize transactions, 
and if so, should not have an issue with specifically providing a clarifying 
resolution.

You need to call Jim Day 916-441-0131 to discuss any authority issues

Russell:  Thanks for the info.  I do need to send a REMINDER to the credit 
group about the authority issues raised by municipals (governmentals, cities, 
etc.) entering into financial trades.  Where can I obtain the most recent 
list of credit people (you know how those credit people are) who deal with 
financial trading?  Thanks.  Sara

P.S.  the early production payment docs typically conveyed an undivided 90 % 
interest in the producer's net revenue interest in particular properties.  
The other 10 % was considered "excess" for purposes of you know what.

Sara,

According ot Financial Settlements, the City of Dublin transaction that I 
told you could have some legal risk because it is a municipality, was 
actually the trigger to a physical transaction.  I asked if they could book 
this in the system as a Physical Swap so we show no financial exposure.

Russell

Laurel:  Will John be trading in the names of BOTH ENA and ECT Investments, 
Inc. or only one of them?  Is John located in London temporarily?  Will 
Houston book the trades pursuant to the agency agreement? (I'm not certain 
which companies are covered by the agreement).  Let's discuss.  Thanks.  Sara 

	Laurel Adams
	09/01/2000 07:50 AM
		 
Sara,

I'm sure that as soon as the technical kinks are worked out, John will want 
to begin trading European stocks right away.  Could you please have a look at 
the Instinet agreement, and see what changes might be necessary to facilitate 
this?  Please let me know what you think.  THanks.
John Greene
09/01/2000 02:47 AM
Julie,

This is the Instinet install.  Who do you think is the best person to 
coordinate the install?  Please forward this to them and ask them to contact 
me on ext. 3-5534 in London.

Laurel,

Please be aware that we are wanting to add european equity trading to the 
existing Instinet contract.  Although it may change at a later date, we would 
like for this activity to be done in the name of ECT Investments so I am not 
sure how much the contract will change.  As I have mentioned, there is a 
chance that we may have to have such trading done out of another entity but 
we can worry about changing any contracts when that happens.  I want to get 
the technological kinks worked out during the "down time" so that as soon as 
we have figured out how this activity is going to be structured we can begin 
trading immediately.  I will direct the Instinet contract contact to you as 
soon as I find out who that is.

Thanks and regards,
John

Hi John,

Thanks for taking the time to chat with me regarding your new London office.
You are very smart to start setting up the equipment ahead of time.  My
colleague in London is Mark Freeman.  He will be calling you to discuss the
details of your account.  If you need to reach Mark in London call 44 207 680
3191.

As we discussed on the phone, we will need to pass your account through credit
committee at Instinet London.  It sounds like Enron Houston is the same entity
as Enron London.  Hopefully this will make the legality issues simple.  In
addition, you mentioned that the phone lines to Reuters have been installed.  
We
can usually hook the Instinet terminal right up to the Reuters phone line.
Please let me know once you have the name of the technician handling the 
account
so we can contact him/her.

I ran you through some of the functionality Instinet provides on the
international side.  We should probably talk about this in more detail soon.  
I
will be in London the week of 9/11-9/15 so perhaps I could bring your new
coverage person over to meet if you think that makes sense.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, comments or concerns please 
contact
me on 212 310-7268.  As I mentioned, I am still on jury duty but hope to be 
off
by next Tuesday.  I always check messages from the road.  Good luck with the
apartment search.  You can not go wrong in Chelsea it's fantastic.  Have a 
great
weekend!!!

The Trade Date should be July 23, 1999.

   
	
	

Scott/Sara/Dale,

Does anyone disagree with the below (Trade Date should be July 23).  The 
confirm will go out immediately when you respond.

thanks,
Joe

Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
07/26/99 03:11 PM
Since Scott Neal's phone call with the counterparty was July 23 I believe 
that should be the correct date.  The call made by Julian and Federico on 
July 20 was not effective to bind ECT.  Please confirm this with Sara and 
Scott and make sure everyone is on board with this.  I am sure Scott was just 
using the draft deal ticket Julian prepared and Julian used the date they 
called rather than the date that Scott did the deal.

Brent,

One last question on the Central Puerto S.A. doc.  We currently have the 
Trade Date as July 23, but the tickets we received say July 20th.  Is July 
20th correct?  

Thanks,
Joe

Sam:  A couple of items from the meeting for you to follow up on:

The IT Contract group has been involved in reviewing documents for Trading 
Edge's Bond Link online bond trading site.  George Weber, who has since moved 
into another area, discussed various issues with Trading Edge early this 
year.  Laine Borgman, a contract administrator in the IT Contracts group, has 
become involved in the Trading Edge review during the past week.  Attached 
below are Trading Edge agreements and their responses to issues raised by IT 
Contracts.  

The primary issues Laine and I discussed yesterday are as follows:

Jurisdiction:   
Our preference is Texas, but we would accept New York.  Trading Edge's 
response is unclear, although I believe they will readily agree to New York.

Indemnification (similar to issues with Buy Side Direct):  
Agreement assigns no liability to 3rd parties which the agreement describes 
as "providers of software".  As Trading Edge is the nominal counterparty for 
all trades, this may be acceptable if the agreement held Trading Edge liable 
for settling trades.  However, I do not see where section 11 addresses 
Trading Edge's liability for trades.   
We would also like assurances / liability regarding the accuracy of order and 
trade information.  

Limits of Liability:
Review language in both the Access and TIPs agreements (per Trading Edge, 
they will not agree to modify the TIPs Agreement, which is dictated by a 3rd 
party).

Assignment:  
Trading Edge's agreement does not allow Enron to assign the agreement to 
other parties.  Initially, only EnronCredit.com personnel in Houston and 
possibly London would use Trading Edge's site, so this would not be an issue 
initially.  Although we would prefer that the ability to assign be included, 
this issue could be addressed later as needed.
 
Electronic Mail (#18):
We do not want to accept email communication in the event of a lawsuit.  From 
the tone of their previous response, I believe they will agree to include 
lawsuits in the definition of extraordinary matters, for which email will not 
be employed.  

Sara, how would you suggest we proceed with the Trading Edge review ?  I will 
speak with Sheila Glover regarding the involvement of Credit and Risk Control 
in our request to utilize Trading Edge's trading platform.

Thanks.

Mike

Per your e-mail, I would like to delete (ii) in the defininition of 
"reasonably withheld" as there is only one party that has a possibility to 
have a material unhedged position (ie. Enron).  

Thanks,

Ryan

The (i) Termination Date and (ii) each date specified as such in a written 
notice from either party to the other party with respect to a designated 
Number of Shares specified in the notice (the "Notice"), to which the party 
receiving such notice consents, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld.  For purposes of this Confirmation, the parties agree that consent 
shall be deemed reasonably withheld (i) if the party receiving the Notice has 
a reasonable business purpose for maintaining the Transaction (excluding any 
business purpose relating specifically to the existing or anticipated value 
of the Transaction or any other Transaction subject to the Agreement) or (ii) 
if consenting to the Notice would result in a material unhedged exposure or 
liability for the party receiving the Notice.  For the avoidance of doubt, a 
Notice shall be sent from either party to the other party on the Termination 
Date.

have a material unhedged position (ie. Enron).  

Thanks,

Ryan

The (i) Termination Date and (ii) each date specified as such in a written 
notice from either party to the other party with respect to a designated 
Number of Shares specified in the notice (the "Notice"), to which the party 
receiving such notice consents, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
withheld.  For purposes of this Confirmation, the parties agree that consent 
shall be deemed reasonably withheld (i) if the party receiving the Notice has 
a reasonable business purpose for maintaining the Transaction (excluding any 
business purpose relating specifically to the existing or anticipated value 
of the Transaction or any other Transaction subject to the Agreement) or (ii) 
if consenting to the Notice would result in a material unhedged exposure or 
liability for the party receiving the Notice.  For the avoidance of doubt, a 
Notice shall be sent from either party to the other party on the Termination 
Date.

Kristina, please forward as you deem necessary to EBS persons for final 
approval.  Thank you.

Please see attached language concerning the Raptor swaps in respect of the 
Valuation Date mechanism and advise me as soon as possible of your approval 
or comments, if any.  We are trying to finalize all public swaps (save Active 
Power) today, so your timeliness will be GREATLY appreciated by me!  Mary

Welcome back!  Please follow up with Florida P&L and DLJIC.
Please send the marked Guaranty to Harvard.  I do not need to see Clem's 
comments.
Let's schedule a call about BuySideDirect.
Thanks.  Sara

Arizona Public Service:  They have agreed to all of our changes.  I'm going 
to send a blackline out today and I will get with Samantha for execution 
copies.

Florida P&L - No response yet.

DLJIC - No response yet.

Harvard - C. Abrams made comments to the Guaranty.  Before I send them out I 
will wait to hear from you.

I see that Buy Side Direct came back with comments.   I will wait to hear 
from you to see where we are.

Thanks,

Jason

Tanya and I have scheduled a meeting in my office to discuss SITA at 9:00 am

Sara:  If the PacifiCorp ISDA we discussed last week is in or through the 
hopper, will you please forward a copy to me?  The guys on the floor would 
like to pull together a form of confirm that they can show to PacifiCorp when 
they meet with them later this week.  The date hasn't yet been set, but it 
could be in a few days.

I hope you had a good weekend.

Perhaps we can talk tomorrow.

Thanks.

Attached are the clean and redline versions for the swap.  The changes are in 
the "Valuation Date" section.  This is a final edit.  Please call if you have 
any questions. Thanks.  Sara

Tana:  Can you make a copy of the most recent draft and get on my calendar 
before Monday so that we can discuss.  Thanks.  Sara

(1)  Will the ISDA be negotiated prior to execution of your trade?
(2)  Are the trade terms correct?  You did not send me a deal ticket.  Who is 
the trader?  Who will be responsible for payments under the swap (i.e., will 
it be you)?
(3)  What happened to comments on the Schedule?
(4)  Who is reviewing the Schedule from a credit perspective?

Could you please refax my comments to your Schedule?  I have misplaced my 
version.  Thanks.  Sara

All:  During the fourth quarter, 2000, MLB intends to transfer all FX 
business to MLIB Ltd.  ENA and Enron Corp. have been asked to agree to this 
transfer with the result that any executed master agreement with MLB will be 
transferred to MLIB Ltd as principal.  ENA has an ISDA Master Agreement dated 
effective 7/1/95; I cannot locate a master between Enron Corp. and MLB.

Will someone in credit approve this transfer?  Please let Stephanie Panus

Attached are the transaction documents for Project Tahiti.  Each of the 
documents is marked to show revisions against the version circulated last 
Wednesday, August 30.  As we discussed on the phone, we have incorporated the 
business agreement reached between CIBC and Enron, as follows:

The Tahiti Series Trust Agreement has been revised to require the consent of 
all certificateholders (which includes Fiji Z LLC, which can only consent 
with the consent of its Class B Member - CIBC) prior to (i) the creation of 
any series after December 31, 2000 (see definition of Series Supplement) and 
(ii) making any amendments to the purpose provision (which specifically 
limits the purposes of the Trust to holding Trust Property - defined as the 
warrants) or the definition of Series Supplement.

The Subscription Agreement has been revised to provide that CIBC's commitment 
to fund on December 31, 2000 will be terminated if the Bali Trust receives 
any funds except in connection with the issuance of debt of the Bali Trust 
(which would require the consent of CIBC as the beneficial owner) or funds 
received from CIBC.

Please be aware that because of the revisions described above, it was not 
necessary to incorporate  all of Tim Elwood's comments received September 3, 
2000.

The documents in WordPerfect format are identified as follows:

The following Enron companies have recently booked financial trades with 
ENA.  I think these should be booked directly with RMT.  Please advise.

Enron Netherlands Holding BV

Enron Development Funding Ltd.

EnronCredit.com Limited

Thanks for your help.  Sara

Per Sara's  instructions, attached is her Brokerage Agreements status report.

MG Ltd. is entering into FX transactions through ENA.  The companies have 
also entered into financial copper trades (first trade 6/16/00).  I think RMT 
and MG Ltd. should enter into an ISDA Master but I don't know the long term 
plan for MG Ltd.   Please confirm.  Sara

P.S.  Have we assigned a single paralegal to handle RMT Masters?

Cyrus/Julie,

Can you please coordinate with Jamie White at ITG on this install.  I don't 
really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group 
worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original 
install.  If so, please use the same architecture.  If not, please consider 
the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being 
in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London 
install so the two sites are in synch.

This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may 
want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on 
this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it 
Thanks and regards,

Here's Trading Edge (the comments are from an internal Enron group).  This is 
a high priority.  I'll review over the weekend and let's talk on Monday.  Sara

The IT Contract group has been involved in reviewing documents for Trading 
Edge's Bond Link online bond trading site.  George Weber, who has since moved 
into another area, discussed various issues with Trading Edge early this 
year.  Laine Borgman, a contract administrator in the IT Contracts group, has 
become involved in the Trading Edge review during the past week.  Attached 
below are Trading Edge agreements and their responses to issues raised by IT 
Contracts.  

The primary issues Laine and I discussed yesterday are as follows:

Jurisdiction:   
Our preference is Texas, but we would accept New York.  Trading Edge's 
response is unclear, although I believe they will readily agree to New York.

Indemnification (similar to issues with Buy Side Direct):  
Agreement assigns no liability to 3rd parties which the agreement describes 
as "providers of software".  As Trading Edge is the nominal counterparty for 
all trades, this may be acceptable if the agreement held Trading Edge liable 
for settling trades.  However, I do not see where section 11 addresses 
Trading Edge's liability for trades.   
We would also like assurances / liability regarding the accuracy of order and 
trade information.  

Limits of Liability:
Review language in both the Access and TIPs agreements (per Trading Edge, 
they will not agree to modify the TIPs Agreement, which is dictated by a 3rd 
party).

Assignment:  
Trading Edge's agreement does not allow Enron to assign the agreement to 
other parties.  Initially, only EnronCredit.com personnel in Houston and 
possibly London would use Trading Edge's site, so this would not be an issue 
initially.  Although we would prefer that the ability to assign be included, 
this issue could be addressed later as needed.
 
Electronic Mail (#18):
We do not want to accept email communication in the event of a lawsuit.  From 
the tone of their previous response, I believe they will agree to include 
lawsuits in the definition of extraordinary matters, for which email will not 
be employed.  

Sara, how would you suggest we proceed with the Trading Edge review ?  I will 
speak with Sheila Glover regarding the involvement of Credit and Risk Control 
in our request to utilize Trading Edge's trading platform.

Thanks.

Steven:

I am trying to finalize this master during Carol St. Clair's absence.  I have 
a few questions prior to our comments.  They are:

(1)  Have you already commented on the new form of Letter of Credit 
Provisions which Carol sent to you?  This is referred to as Exhibit A to 
Paragraph 13 of Annex A.  I did not see your response.

(2)  Have you reviewed the latest Letter of Credit format?  I did not see 
your response.

(3)  What is the genesis of Part 5, Section 18 of your redline.  I know that 
DB acquired Bankers Trust, but did Carol ever review this provision?  Have 
both parties agreed as to existing transactions?

Please let me hear from you.  Thanks.  Sara

Here's your answer.  We need to put an IMMEDIATE halt to the booking of

P.S.  Lynn:  Is there someone we need to notify with Enron Development or

	09/11/2000 11:02 AM
		
Steve is absolutely correct -- all intercompany swap transactions between ENA 
and Enron Corp. affiliates should be confirmed directly by RMT. 
- Rhett

Hopefully, none of these transactions have been "booked" for ENA by a trader 
located in a foreign country.  That said, the general rule is that 
intra-company transactions are generally booked directly to RMT rather than 
to ENA and then back to RMT.  I have cc'd Rhett Jackson on my reply so that 
he can confirm this since Rhett has become the "keeper" of the RMT technology 
for our group.  Sorry for the delay in responding.  Steve.

The following Enron companies have recently booked financial trades with 
ENA.  I think these should be booked directly with RMT.  Please advise.

Enron Netherlands Holding BV

Enron Development Funding Ltd.

EnronCredit.com Limited

Thanks for your help.  Sara

Sharon:  Thanks for your fax and markup of the Schedule dated Sept. 6.  There 
is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the counterparty 
identity itself.  It appears that you have identified a DIFFERENT party to 
the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named "SITA", which is not 
the entity which we originally proposed,.  This does not appear to be the 
credit which we evaluated.  

Also, we insist upon a Credit Support Annex.  As you know, the agreement 
contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major 
issue, particularly for long-dated pulp deals.  

Can you call me tomorrow?  We need to address the major issues upfront.  You 
can reach me at 713-853-5620.  Thank you.  Sara

Are you still working every other day?  Please see my SITA message to Sharon 
Lewis and let me know the most efficient way of proceeding.  Thanks.  Sara

the preexisting ECT Investments agreement so that Merrill can duplicate for 
ENA.  Sara

Sara, long time no see.  I won't be over for this autumn's ECT conference but 
hope to be around next year.  

Please do me a favour and look through the doc attached below, which is 
governed by New York law (in particular the reps under Section 2(d) and the 
governing law language/jurisdiction language).  The contract gives rise to 
some issues (e.g. deficient default language), which I thought I could 
address myself.  The matter is somewhat urgent.  Tks.

Laurel:  Will you please contact Treasury per Lynn's email below?  Thanks.

Sara:  I suppose that it is Treasury that is doing all of FX transactions 
with Enron Development and Enron Netherlands.  I do not think that these 
activities get pushed down to any of the regions involved.  I would contact 
Cathy Moehlman or Robin Veariel in Treasury and see who does these 
transactions for them and gat that person involved.

Lynn

Here's your answer.  We need to put an IMMEDIATE halt to the booking of 
EnronCredit.com Limited trades with ENA (as well as the others).  Sara

P.S.  Lynn:  Is there someone we need to notify with Enron Development or 
Enron Netherlands?
	Rhett Jackson
	09/11/2000 11:02 AM
		
Steve is absolutely correct -- all intercompany swap transactions between ENA 
and Enron Corp. affiliates should be confirmed directly by RMT. 
- Rhett

Hopefully, none of these transactions have been "booked" for ENA by a trader 
located in a foreign country.  That said, the general rule is that 
intra-company transactions are generally booked directly to RMT rather than 
to ENA and then back to RMT.  I have cc'd Rhett Jackson on my reply so that 
he can confirm this since Rhett has become the "keeper" of the RMT technology 
for our group.  Sorry for the delay in responding.  Steve.

The following Enron companies have recently booked financial trades with 
ENA.  I think these should be booked directly with RMT.  Please advise.

Enron Netherlands Holding BV

Enron Development Funding Ltd.

EnronCredit.com Limited

Sara, 
we are currently working with John to establish a corporate structure for 
equities trading out of London. I am due to meet with him today or tomorrow 
so will follow up on these particular trades.
Regards
Janine

Thanks for being on top of this.  As I mentioned in my voice mail to you on 
Friday, no trader should conclude a transaction on behalf of ENA while 
located in a foreign country.  On several discrete occasions we have 
sanctioned exceptions to this rule but each such case had unique facts that 
permitted us to conclude that those transactions were OK.  Further, any 
physical presence by ENA is a foreign country is generally a bad idea because 
it supports a foreign tax authority's argument that ENA is doing business in 
their country.  Thus, because of that general concern, no Instinet terminal 
should be put in place on behalf of ENA in a foreign country (especially 
since for what purpose would such a thing be used - trading?) but, rather, an 
appropriate foreign affiliate of Enron should contract for such service (in 
this respect, you should speak with Janine Juggins in our London tax group - 
Janine is our resident trading tax expert in London and will be very familiar 
with the things described in this E-mail).  I will be out of the country this 
week (returning the week of the 18th) and can be reached at the Vancouver 
Hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Best regards.  Steve.

FYI - also, as I mentioned, Janine should have her conclusions Tuesday.  Sara

Sara,

Please do not have anyone do any work on this aside from the install 
agreement.  I am waiting on a ruling from London's tax group and no trading 
will be done whatsoever until that point.  There is indeed a question as to 
what entity our London activity will be done out of but this is already being 
considered by the correct individuals herre in London.  I am waiting 
anxiously for the ruling on it as it is the only thing holding up my being 
able to start trading.  

The reason I am setting up a desktop in London under existing documents is 
that I want to begin trading as soon as I get the go ahead from tax and 
legal.  In other words, I do not want to get to the point where everyone has 
signed off on the structure only to be held up by technology constraints.  I 
fully expect that additional documentation/agreements will be required once 
we know exactly which entity we will be operating out of and have told 
Instinet (as well as ITG and eventually Autex) this. 

Please let me repeat: no activity will be executed on these systems until we 
get a final ruling from London's tax, legal and regulatory personnel.  Please 
do not have anyone do any additional work aside from signing the agreement 
for the install.

Thanks and regards,
John

Bill:  I couldn't recall if I mentioned the above entity (35% Enron owned and 
65% Burlington owned, I understand) but I was contacted by Ranabir Dutt 
(X35274) to review an ISDA and 10 year rate swap for Lost Creek and Barclays 
Bank PLC..  I told Ranabir to contact credit.  He said that was Enron was 
immediately selling its interest.  The swap becomes effective 9/15/00.

futures, authorization of the individual(s)
who signed the documents to be able to do so, trading guidelines and any
applicable resolutions.

With regard to the Give-up Agreement, please have this document executed on

There is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the
counterparty identity itself.  It appears that you have identified a
DIFFERENT party to the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named
"SITA", which is not the entity which we originally proposed,.  This does
not appear to be the credit which we evaluated.

contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major

All:  Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to 
put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:

Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited
Credit Agricole Indosuez
CSFB International
Lehman Brother Finance S.A.
Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
Deutsche Bank

These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury 
group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the 
appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.

Mike and Sara,

There is generally "no give" on the Enron language regarding affiliates 
language which I have provided below.  

"The following entities shall also be deemed to be included in the term 
Subscriber and shall have the right to use the Service:  Subscriber's 
wholly-owned subsidiaries and affiliated companies and those affiliated 
companies in which Subscriber or one of its subsidiaries or affiliated 
companies own an equity interest and which is under the direct or indirect 
control of Subscriber or one of its subsidiaries or affiliated companies.  
Furthermore, Subscriber shall also be allowed to have any agent or third 
party service company or facility manager of Subscriber's IT functions to 
assist it to the degree necesssary so that the Subscriber can fully access 
and utilize the Service."

I will be happy to discuss any procedures we utilize and/or provisions in the 
document.   It is also my understanding that Mike is expecting more contracts 
of this nature so standardized and acceptable language will be to our 
advantage.  Sara, our legal counsel is Mark Holsworth and he is "charged with 
reviewing all the IP documents".  

Let me hear from you soon.

Sam:  Until Gary's group receives access to this part of our Lotus Notes 
database, we will have to rely on my "in the pipeline" list.  The following 
agreements from that list need to be added to Lotus Notes:

(1)  BuySideDirect

(2)  Ing Barings

(3)  Thomas Weisel Partners

(4)  Market Axess

Weiss, Peck and Greer (WPG) has addressed the fee and margin issues noted in 
my previous email.

Fees:  We will not be assessed any fees from WPG.  Thus, I suggest that 
section 9 state this, or be removed.  

Margin:  Section 14 should note that margin for our transactions through Buy 
Side Direct would be maintained at our prime broker.  WPG would only request 
margin if our prime broker disaffirms a trade.  

Has the WPG attorney agreed to a time to discuss their agreement ?

Thanks.

My only suggestion regarding your comments on the WPG agreement would be not 
to change the 2nd line of 5a from "your Prime Broker" to "the exchange".   

Mike Minnich emailed you and me the following language to incorporate WPG's 
obligation as our nominal counterparty: 

WPG is responsible for the clearance and settlement of all affirmed trades
executed on the BuySideDirect trading system.

This appears reasonable to me (unless you or Sara feel that this could be 
interpretted as excluding trades for which the other counterparty fails).

Rather than waiting until my issues regarding fees (#9) and margin (#14) are 
resolved, I suggest that you forward your comments to Mike Minnich (who will 
provide to WPG's attorneys) and note that we have requested an opportunity to 
discuss fees (#9) and margin (#14) with Mike Minnich and WPG.  We suggest 
deleting #9 as our understanding is that we would not incur charges from 
WPG.  Regarding #14, we would incorporate our Buy Side Direct trading 
activity into our margin account with our prime broker.    Jason, I'll 
provide additional feedback after I discuss these issues with WPG. 

Please call me (713-853-9990) if you would like to discuss.  

Thanks.

The online bond trading sites we are evaluating have stated that they and 
their clearing broker are our nominal counterparties.  However, I was 
informed yesterday by Weiss, Peck & Greer that our exposure on affirmed 
trades is to our prime broker.  (Our prime broker has exposure to the site's 
clearing firm.)  We confirmed this with our prime broker and with Sheila 
Glover.    

Thus, statements that 1) transactions will be cleared through our prime 
broker and 2) the site is responsible for the accuracy of terms of offers and 
executed trades (as Buy Side Direct added) may sufficiently address the issue 
of our exposure.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss.

Thanks.

This appears reasonable to me (unless you or Sara feel that this could be 
interpretted as excluding trades for which the other counterparty fails).

Rather than waiting until my issues regarding fees (#9) and margin (#14) are 
resolved, I suggest that you forward your comments to Mike Minnich (who will 
provide to WPG's attorneys) and note that we have requested an opportunity to 
discuss fees (#9) and margin (#14) with Mike Minnich and WPG.  We suggest 
deleting #9 as our understanding is that we would not incur charges from 
WPG.  Regarding #14, we would incorporate our Buy Side Direct trading 
activity into our margin account with our prime broker.    Jason, I'll 
provide additional feedback after I discuss these issues with WPG. 

Please call me (713-853-9990) if you would like to discuss.  

Thanks.

Mike

I will be coming into the office late tomorrow morning, I will be waiting for

from home.  I will be available at my home number if anyone needs to reach 
me.  My number is 281 866 8797, my cell number is 832 368 3286.  

I would like to take the following Wednesdays as vacation days if it does not 
cause a conflict in staffing:  September 27, October 11, October 25 and 
November 8.   I would also like to take December 27 through 29 as vacation 
days.  Please let me know if this will be problem.

Tax has confirmed that the MG deals should be confirmed in the name of RMT 
(and NOT ENA).  I will have an RMT/MG Ltd. ISDA master put in place.

Joe: (1)   Please confirm the exact name of the MG entity.
          (2)  Please confirm that the first trade date was [6/16/00].

 Thanks for your note and sorry that I haven't called recently.  I have 
joined some day time tennis leagues at our club and between that, Charles, 
Arthur etc.  life has been fairly hectic.  I keep trying to pick a good day 
to come up to the office, but so far have not found a day that works for both 
Bill and I but hopefully I'll see everyone soon.  By the way, you and anyone 
else in the group are always welcome to come out here!!  I know that it is 
far and that you all are busy but feel free to plan something if you want.

How are the legal assistant's and the rest of the group?  How are you doing?  
I must say that I am enjoying my time away from the office.  Charles is doing 
great.  He is now 13 pounds, 6 ounces and allot 23 inches.  He is growing 
like a weed and eats often which keeps me busy round the clock although he 
has started to sleep some more at night.  We are slowly but surely getting 
into a routine with him and I feel blessed to have Bill here to help.  It's 
hard to believe that 2 months has already gone by!  Time flies when you are 
having fun.

Anyway, hang in there and keep me posted.  Say hi to Mike for me and if he 
ever wants to play some tennis, please call us.

Jean:  per our conversation, attached is a draft template.  Thanks.  Sara

Why are you referring to "futures contracts" for the equities?  I thought 
that the only futures were equity index contracts.

Hi, Susan!  I work with the FX/rate desk and Darren Delage is currently 
residing in Tokyo and trading.  I have a conversation this evening with Alan 
Aronowitz, John Viverito and Darren to discuss Japan issues.  

At the moment, Darren has exeacuted several trades.  These are being 
documented in Houston AS ENRON NORTH AMERICA CORP. trades.  I had assumed 
that all trades would be done in the name of the Japanese financial trading 
entity; I have no idea who is handling back office functions.  

Can you update me?  Thanks.  Sara

P.S.  We MUST confirm all trades.

Hi Sara--

There are open issues regarding the L/C faciltity, so Carol and I decided not 
to comment on specific clauses until those issues were resolved.  I believe 
Carol was ok with Section 18, but it was added shortly before she left for 
maternity leave.  Because we are still trading with you under the existing BT 
ISDA, the clause is simply meant to sweep-in any exisiting BT-Enron trades 
under the new DB-Enron facility.

Please let me know if you have any further questions.  My understanding is 
that we are now scheduled to talk on Wed. at 11am NY time. I look forward to 
talking with you then.

Regards,

Steve

Sara.Shackleton@enron.com on 09/08/2000 04:36:32 PM

Steven:

I am trying to finalize this master during Carol St. Clair's absence.  I have 
a
few questions prior to our comments.  They are:

(1)  Have you already commented on the new form of Letter of Credit Provisions
which Carol sent to you?  This is referred to as Exhibit A to Paragraph 13 of
Annex A.  I did not see your response.

(2)  Have you reviewed the latest Letter of Credit format?  I did not see your
response.

(3)  What is the genesis of Part 5, Section 18 of your redline.  I know that 
DB
acquired Bankers Trust, but did Carol ever review this provision?  Have both
parties agreed as to existing transactions?

Please let me hear from you.  Thanks.  Sara

ASAP - what's going on?  SS
Any news?
Pls fax me a copy of the confirmation once you send it to C.Puerto. Tks

Jim Kopley with LIMITrader informed me that they have no objection to many of 
the changes you suggested to the LIMITrader agreement, and he is confident 
that he can address, to our satisfaction, the other concerns we raised.   Jim 
encouraged you to call him at 212-499-2909 to discuss.

forwarded to their attorney.

Bill:  I am resending my earlier message which identifies the correct legal 
entities with which Enron Corp. would like to execute ISDA Master Agreements 
(for the purpose of entering into equity trades).  In addition to the 
entities listed below, we need to include "Merrill Lynch International" 
("MLI").  ENA just negotiated an agreement with MLI, so the Enron Corp. 
master should be fairly simple.  Also, Clint and Jeff are interested in 
transacting with Toronto Dominion Bank.  In that regard I note that Enron has 
an Interest Rate and Currency Agreement with Toronto Dominion Bank, New York 
Branch.  I'll review this agreement to see if it requires amendment.

Jeff/Clint:  Do want to deal with a specific Toronto Dominion branch?

All:  I will expect that Bill will provide credit worksheets and I'll either 
begin the ISDA process or change "ENA" to Enron Corp. on those agreements 
which have previously been sent.

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

All:  Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to 
put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:

Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited
Credit Agricole Indosuez
CSFB International
Lehman Brother Finance S.A.
Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
Deutsche Bank

These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury 
group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the 
appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.

Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process?  Thanks.  Sara

My understanding is that the following issues are outstanding with regard to 
the Buy Side Direct agreements:

Buy Side Direct Agreement:

Notice - Sara is developing proposed guidelines for notification (how + who 
should receive).

Indemnity (#6) - Jason and Sara will discuss.  

I would encourage you to discuss these issues without me unless you prefer 
that I participate.   

Weiss, Peck & Greer Agreement:

Fees:  We will not be assessed any fees from WPG.  Thus, I suggest that 
section 9 state this, or be removed.  

Margin:  Section 14 should note that margin for our transactions through Buy 
Side Direct would be maintained at our prime broker.  WPG would only request 
margin if our prime broker disaffirms a trade.  

Mike Minnich noted that WPG had agreed to our other comments.  Have we 
received a revised WPG agreement with these changes ?

As noted below, I have asked Sheila to provide information required for the 
BSD and WPG agreements.  

Please let me know if there are other issues which I should be involved in 
discussing.  

Thanks.

Mike

It appears that we are close to resolving outstanding legal issues regarding 
the agreement to allow online bond trading through Buy Side Direct.   Sheila, 
is your group the appropriate area to complete the Subscriber Application and 
Attachment 2 documents provided below ?  

We will also execute an agreement with Buy Side Direct's clearing firm 
(Weiss, Peck & Greer) which will direct them to clear our trades through the 
prime broker we designate.    Sheila, I will leave you a paper copy of the 
preliminary version of this agreement.  Is your group the appropriate area to 
complete the information this agreement requires on pages 7 and 8 - 
essentially, tax ID # and account # ?

Eric / Tom, please handle any communication required with our prime broker 
required before we initiate trading on Buy Side Direct.

Sara / Jason, please let me know if I am overlooking any other information 
that we will require from Sheila's group related to Buy Side Direct.  

(Approval from our Credit group is expected this week.)

Thanks.

I made the two remaining changes:

1. added limits on clearly erroneous policy time limits.  We will promptly
notify other side and will make a decision within 4 hours of the issue being
raised or by 6PM whichever is sooner.
2. deleted first sentence from 5.4

I am still trying to get further resolution from WPG with regard to your
insert #6.

Please call with any questions.

Regards,

Mike
415-369-5016
I apologize for the delay.  I made the changes as discussed except:

1.  I did not put a limit on the Clearly erroneous policy--not because I
didn't agree, but because I did not see an obvious answer in the Nasdaq
agreement.  I will look at it more tomorrow, but I wanted to get this to you
rather than delay further.
2.  Striking first sentence in 5.4--I have not heard back from our lawyers.
Hopefully tomorrow.

Also, I attach the broker dealer attachment 2 which you said you didn't
have.

I think we resolved most of your WPG questions.  WPG is OK with all of your
changes except Insert 6.  I will try to get further resolution as to why
they object so that you can negotiate further if you like.

If all goes well, hopefully this can be wrapped up tomorrow.

Regards,

Mike

that you may want to delete the reference in any case. I went ahead and

Attached is my suggested language.  The confirms already provide for Market 
Quotation and Second Method; the Optional Early Termination provision should 
be the only exception for using the Calculation Agent for termination 
purposes.  Of course, the Calculation Agent will determine AECO prices for 
payment purposes, but that is not related to termination.

I noticed we have a master with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.  I 
am under the impression that there is another master with Duke that is being 
negotiated because the business guys said that the negotiations on an ISDA 
master agreement is holding up another power trade that the Duke entity down 
here wants to do through its US subsidiary ECT is negotiating with.  Could 
you update me on what is being negotiated with any of the other Duke 
entities.  Also where is Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. located 
and what types of trades does the master cover?  Thanks for your help.

Bill:  We are proposing the following compromise language to the bank 
regarding "Transfer": 

Party A may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in 
whole but not in part, to any Affiliate that is a resident for income tax 
purposes of the United States or Canada.......

We typically don't resrict the jurisdiction of our Affiliates.

Is this O.K. with you?

Attached are the revised Proposal Sheets and Exhibit A thereto that I have 
initialled and given today to  Lisa Mellencamp. Also included are copies 
marked to show changes to the versions you forwarded me this am. Re your 
voice mail this afternoon, I understood the 6% dividend rate in the memo 
asset description was calculated by someone in your group from data in the 
Stock Purchase Agreement ( I did not independently make the calculation), and 
that you may want to delete the reference in any case. I went ahead and 
returned the attached to Lisa Mellencamp without waiting for your response as 
they are trying to get these all in today, but if the 6% should come out, I 
can rerun the Proposal Sheet to delete it, or if it is correct or otherwise 
is immaterial, we can leave the Proposals alone on that point. Let me and 
Lisa Mellencamp know if you have any other questions or comments on the

Mark-

Today, we received IBJ's responsive comments to the points that have been=
=20
raised, which are set forth below for your review.

IBJ has stated "In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral=
=20
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA."  During our recent=20
meeting they did not deny that IBJ had entered into CSAs with financial=20
institutions.  I note that IBJ also raised the point that Enron had a loan=
=20
from IBJ of roughly US$ 100,000,000.
Jonathan Whitehead has raised this issue with John Suttle to receive his=20
input. =20

IBJ's specific responses are quoted below as follows:-

"Part 1

(a)  Agreed not include Affiliates of PartyA.

(g)  We prefer to terminate the Transactions when as a result of merger as=
=20
for a party, a surviving party of such becomes materially weaker than befor=
e.

Part 3

We usually accept to deliver a copy the list of authorized signatures only.

Part 4

(f)Even though deleting the word "not" in this provision, we can net the=20
payments with respect to the same Transaction.   Due to our system=20
incapability, we are not able to net the payments with respect to two or mo=
re=20
Transactions in the same currency.

(h) Agreed.

Part 5

(a)  If your suggested language is included, a Non-defaulting Party has to=
=20
continue to make payment to a Defaulting Party with no payment obligation,=
=20
which does not seem realistic.  We prefer to terminate Transactions when an=
=20
Event of Default occurs.  We do not like to include the provision which=20
releases a technical error.

(c)  Agreed.

(e)  We propose 5 business days instead.

(g)  We do not think the definition of the Affiliate includes a party's=20
branch offices. If our branch have a deal with Enron Japan, we will amend=
=20
this Master Agreement to include such branch as Multibranch Office.  We hea=
rd=20
that in most jurisdictions of the world,  it is not effective to set-off th=
e=20
obligations between a party and the other party's Affiliate.

(i)  Agreed to include this provision.

(j)  We do not prefer that a party could transfer its rights and obligation=
s=20
without the other party's consent to even its Affiliates. We might not get=
=20
approval of the transfer from our Credit Department or such transfer might=
=20
cause an additional payment of tax or other cost.

(k)  We will revert to you later.

(m)  Agreed.

(n)  Agreed to include this provision.

Part 6

We still prefer to include the provisions relating to the Commodity=20
Transactions in the respective Confirmations."

I look forward to receiving your input.  I note that Jane McBride has start=
ed=20
here at Enron Japan, therefore I have copied her on this correspondence. =

Thanks for your input.  I agree with all of the comments you have raised.  =
As=20
to Part 5 (n), the use of the English language is not uncommon in Japan wit=
h=20
regard to these types of arrangements and should be insisted upon for=20
transactions under the ISDA documentation.

I think that it will be useful to better understand Japanese market practic=
e=20
relating to the use of the Credit Support Annex. Therefore, I have asked=20
Baker & McKenzie to provide a clear picture as to the situation in Japan an=
d=20

Thanks,

John

=09Mark Taylor@ECT
=0909/06/2000 09:00 PM
=09=09
 I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle (Credit) and it=
=20
looks like he's going to insist on the CSA.  We are going to talk tomorrow=
=20
and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While =
we=20
have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a=20
master agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many=
=20
of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have=20
trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be=
=20
helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a=20
mark-up.

Following are my points responsive to their revisions:

Part 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the=
=20
possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for=20
example, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy=
=20
this agreement would be in default).

(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk=
=20
to the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a=
=20
reason to remove it.

Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells=
=20
out exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed ar=
e=20
not acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we=
=20
agree we will put it in the agreement.

Part 4 (f)  By deleting the word "not" in this provision, IBJ is saying tha=
t=20
payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not ne=
t=20
(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to=
=20
make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to o=
ne=20
payment).  This is not acceptable.

(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or E=
NA.

Part 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to=20
receive payments due even though technically in default under another=20
provision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other=20
possible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be=
=20
honored.

(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same=
=20
city.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if n=
ot=20
impossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.=20

(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can no=
t=20
have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go=
=20
as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market=20
practice.

(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed t=
o=20
multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each=
=20
IBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never=
=20
trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we=
=20
will never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like=
=20
to restrict ourselves that way.

(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If=
=20
there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it bu=
t=20
wholesale deletion is out of the question.

(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while=
=20
maintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency=
=20
with which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is=
=20
important to us.

(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty tha=
t=20
went into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money. =
=20
We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without o=
ur=20
revision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rathe=
r=20
high rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate i=
s=20
more appropriate.

(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it=20
protects us both.

(n)  You know more about this than I.

Part 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them=20
individually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisio=
ns=20
are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a=
=20
significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)=
=20
and we need to know now if they object to any of them.

Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  =
I=20
hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discus=
s=20
any of these issues at greater length if you want.  It sounds to me like=20
IBJ's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given th=
e=20
volume and nature of their comments.

Dear Mr.Viverito

Attached Word file is ISDA draft amended by our legal desk.
(please take the amended points as our comment on your draft)
Please check it all and kindly reply ASAP.
(CSA is not acceptable as I mentioned you before, and we'll check your
LETTER OF CREDIT after
the schedule is almost agreed)

In your draft, we cannot understand the meaning of "EDGAR" on page4,
so please show us what it is.

We are very hoping to conclude this process rapidly.
So, I very much appreciate it if you could send back your comment before
Holiday in U.S.(4th Sep)
(it's ok if only the rough prospects of concluding ISDA)

Best regards,
Konishi IBJ Tokyo

Bill:  The attached memo was distributed to legal last week.  We have had a 
number of questions arise on the power side lately regarding financial 
transactions (ranging from short term to quarterly) with governmentals.  As 
you will see in the memo, the risks are significant.  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.  Sara

It is becoming increasingly clear that the development of eCommerce will ha=
ve=20
a significant and continuing impact on the conduct of business in a broad=
=20
array of industries.  Through EnronOnLine, Enron has quickly become a major=
=20
catalyst for the transition to the web in the gas and electric industries. =
=20
EnronOnLine has been an enormous success since its launch.  Since launch, w=
e=20
have completed 67,043 transactions on line, with a total dollar value of ov=
er=20
$25 billion.  EnronOnLine is now the largest eCommerce site in the world.

We believe that the competitive success of EnronOnLine is due to one very=
=20
specific reason.  In addition to providing a web-based platform for=20
transactions, Enron acts as principal to provide direct liquidity to the=20
site.  We stand ready at all times, in any market conditions, to buy and se=
ll=20
at the posted price.  This converts a =01&bulletin board=018 (the more typi=

eCommerce concept) into a true market.  There are very few, if any,=20
competitors that can provide this capability.

We are increasingly convinced that this competitive advantage can be=20
dramatically expanded to other products and other geographies.  If we are=
=20
correct, this could provide an enormous new opportunity for growth for Enro=

Accordingly, we are initiating a major new effort to capture this=20
opportunity.  Effective today we are creating a new business, Enron Net=20
Works, to pursue new market development opportunities in eCommerce across a=
=20
broad range of industries.  It is likely that this business will ultimately=

be our fifth business segment, joining transmission & distribution,=20
wholesale, retail and broadband services.

Included in this business will be our entire IT and technology group along=

with significant talent and resources in market making and finance. =20
Initially, North America will provide primary direct support for staff=20
services and back office, however, over time we will be requesting support=

=20
new eCommerce platforms, Enron Net Works will work closely with the merchan=

Enron Net Works will be headed by Greg Whalley, Chief Executive Officer; Mi=

Replacing Greg Whalley as President and Chief Operating Officer of Enron=20

After my discussion with Julia I thought I'd try to clarify the documents 
that need to be generated.

1. Confirmation of the trade between ECT and Citibank under the existing 1992 
Master ISDA Document
2. New Master ISDA Document between Garden State LLC and Citibank with a 
Performance Guarantee from Enron Corp. and confirmation of the trade.
3. Master netting agreement that nets obligations under the Master in 2. 
above with those in 1. above without having to modify the Master in 1. above.

We are trying to target first drafts to have discussions with the Bank on 
Monday afternoon.  Please let me know if this is too aggressive to have a 
first cut.
Thanks,
Rodney

Marie is checking with Pat Cini for latest update.  We sent this master on 
6/23/99.  Also, looks like Pat told you about Empresa.  SS

I noticed we have a master with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.  I 
am under the impression that there is another master with Duke that is being 
negotiated because the business guys said that the negotiations on an ISDA 
master agreement is holding up another power trade that the Duke entity down 
here wants to do through its US subsidiary ECT is negotiating with.  Could 
you update me on what is being negotiated with any of the other Duke 
entities.  Also where is Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. located 
and what types of trades does the master cover?  Thanks for your help.

Attached are the swap forms we have utilized in round one of the raptor off 
balance sheet swap project.  I have tried to clean them, and have also 
incorporated comments received thus far from Kirkland & Ellis, firm for 
Talon.  Please review these forms and provide any further comments or 
suggestions to them by Tuesday morning of next week.   As I mentioned, we 
plan to forward to you proposal sheets as and when received for all the 
remaining swaps to be placed into the raptor vehicles for preparation of the 
swaps by your firm.  We should know more about the timing of the next round 
of swaps next week.  As other and varied investments may be placed in the 
vehicles, we will ask that your firm develop the forms to be used on the 
basis of the proposals and any documents applicable to the underlying 
investment.  Finally, please finalize the memorandum on termination and 
forward to my attention next week, if possible.

Thank you for your continued assistance.  Please confirm receipt and ability 
to have comments to me by Tuesday.

John:  Hi, there!  As you are aware of the structuring for tax purposes, 
until the U.K. corporate agent is actuallly formed, there is nothing further 
that I can do.  That formation should happen today or tomorrow.  With the 
actual name and agreements with ENA and ECT Investments, Inc., I can provide 
that information to Instinet and the other trading platforms you are 
interested in transacting on.  Just FYI, the Instinet people are merely 
waiting for the agent agreement in order to proceed. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions.  Sara

The additional Raptor SWAP meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, September 26, 
2000 at 9:30 a.m. in EB38C1.

Please comment on the attached draft Citibank agreement.

John:  The "signature block" for ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. trades done 
through the U.K. agent actually looks different.  It should read something 
like "Company X, as agent for ENA", for example.  Therefore, Insitnet needs 
to see the agency agreement between Company X and ENA (which is in the 
process of being drafted).  You are correct in that the original ENA/Instinet 
agreement will be utilized.  However, Instinet needs to review the agency 
arrangement before proceeding.

You are also correct about the ITG agreement.  In fact, ENA DOESN'T have an 
executed agreement with POSIT.  I spoke with the POSIT lawyer several months 
ago and was shocked that the service would operate without anything in 
writing.

Thanks.  Sara

	John Greene
	09/25/2000 02:32 PM
		
Sara,

As ENA and ECT Investments, Inc., will be the entities where all trades are 
actually booked, I would not think that any new agreements would need to be 
signed between the new "agent" entitiy and any outside vendors (ie, brokers, 
online trading platforms, etc.)  The new entity will never take actual 
ownership of the securities.  Therefore, I would presume that the Instinet 
agreement should just be an addendum to existing documentation.  The 
Posit/ITG agreement will have to be an entirely new agreement because the 
ownership structure of ITG Europe is different than that of the States.  This 
agreement, however, should reflect exactly the same sort of 
structure/language as was used to negotiate the contract between ITG and ENA 
and ECT Investments, Inc. 

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks and regards,
John

John:  Hi, there!  As you are aware of the structuring for tax purposes, 
until the U.K. corporate agent is actuallly formed, there is nothing further

Per Sara's request, following is the language she requests for Optional 
Termination:

Either party may, upon    ( ) days written notice to the other Party, 
terminate this Transaction by designating to such other Party the termination 
date for this Transaction.  In the event a Party exercises its right of 
optional termination hereunder, the provisions of Section 6(e)(ii)(2)(B) 
shall apply to this Transaction for purposes of establishing a settlement 
amount.

Sam:  Please let me know ASAP whether Jason should be marking the Deutsche 
docs based on Sheila's message!

For clarification.
Deutsche Bank is the new Name..  ENA currently has an agreement in place with 
BT Alex Brown who has been assumed by Deutsche. 
It apprears that only an agreement  with ENA was set up previously.  ECT 
Investments should have one,  as well.

Equity Trading is requesting an Executing Broker Agreement be set up for ECT 

Tiffany:  Per my voice mail, please insert the following language into the 
confirms you are preparing for the Citibank transactions:

FOR THE CITIBANK/GARDEN STATE CONFIRMS:

Optional Termination: Either party may, upon sixty (60) days written notice 
to the other party, terminate this Transaction by designating to such other
                                                party the termination date 
for this Transaction.  In the event a party exercises its right of optional 
termination hereunder, the
                                                provisions of Section 
6(e)(ii)(2)(B) shall apply to this Transaction for purposes of establishing a 
settlement amount.

FOR THE CITIBANK/ENA CONFIRMS:

Optional Termination:  Either party may, upon sixty (60) days written notice 
to the other party, terminate this Transaction by designating to such other
                                                party the termination date 
for this Transaction.  In the event a party exercises its right of optional 
termination hereunder, the
                                                provisions of Section 
6(e)(ii)(2)(B) shall apply to this Transaction for purposes of establishing a 
settlement amount.

   The foregoing provision for optional termination of this Transaction shall 
not be cause for Early Termination under the 
                                                Agreement, and provides for 
termination of only this Transaction.

Tanya and Rodney:  attached is the side letter

Mark:  I know you'll eventually get to this message in the near future.  
Based on the VOLUME of activity, I would like to have a printer in my office 
if at all possible.  Thanks.  Sara

Attached is a redraft of your letter.  RMT knows nothing about the execution 
or termination of any collar between Elektro and WestLB (since RMT was not a 
party to that transaction). Also, we have been unable to internally trace the 
source of the $387,250.00 received by RMT.  We are trying to trace this 
through Chase and expect an answer on Thursday (if we're lucky).  Otherwise, 
call me about the letter.  Sara 

  

This is actually the PacificCorp master which should be redrafted on our new 
form.  There is a RUSH on this and Dale Rasmussen would like to have the 
master (I would check with him first to see if this should go to anyone 
else).  SS

Paul/Alan,

We need to have someone check into the legal issues associated with our 
trading equities in each of the respective countries we are interested in 
trading.  We need to get rulings on shares, futures and options for both 
exchange traded and over the counter activity for each country.  This 
"research" should be performed in much the same way as when we began trading 
in Australia.  Some of the countries involved may have already been "green 
lighted" a few years ago.  The countries we need to look into initially are:

Germany
France
Italy
Norway
Netherlands
Spain
United Kingdom

Once we get feedback on these countries we should continue on to secondary 
countries which include:

Austria
Belgium
Denmark
Ireland
Israel
Sweden
Switzerland
Portugal
Turkey

I will leave up to yourselves to decide where this project should be 
coordinated from but as we are a US coporate and ECT Investments, the 
principal booking entity, is a US entity I would imagine it should be handled 
from the States.  Please let me know if anyone has any questions or would 
like to discuss issues associated with this request. 

Thanks and regards,
John

Attached is a draft of a term sheet for a financial resid-power spread option 
purchase by EPMI from FPL for NEPOOL.  I am hoping to share this term sheet 
with the customer sometime early-mid afternoon on Tuesday 9/26, so I'd 
appreciate any comments you all might have.  I will be out of the office in 
the morning at a customer meeting, but will be available by cell 978-314-5614 
or pager 877-246-3206 (i'll be in the car for a good 3-4 hours between 8 AM-2 
PM Eastern traveling to and from the mtg).   If you have trouble reaching me, 
please feel free to go through Joe Gordon at 5-8956; Joe is an Associate 
newly assigned to the Northeast mid-market team (Joe will only be around in 
the AM though).  

Some specific points I'd like to raise:

Oil price index/curve -- Pearce Hammond (structuring) and I spoke with Dave 
Botchlett (our resid trader) Monday about:  (1) the most appropriate resid 
oil index to use; and (2)  the "correct" resid curve consistent with that 
index.   Dave did not sufficiently answer these two questions, so I called 
Paul Racicot and asked him what he thought.  Paul suggested using the Platts 
Daily New York Harbor Resid Cargo Mean index (which i've included in the term 
sheet attached), as that was probably the most hedegable index.  Other 
alternitives that I am aware of include Platts Daily New York Harbor Barge 
Mean and perhaps others.    We have the daily option to "dispatch" the energy 
or not, so I think we want to use a daily oil index rather than a first of 
the month index, etc.  Paul Broderick - do you have any thoughts on this?  
Assuming the Cargo Mean is the right index, we then need to make sure the 
resid curve we use is consistent with that index.  Pearce - could you perhaps 
connect with Dana/Paul Broderick/Ed Baughman/Joe Gordon to see if we can come 
to aggreement on index and appropriate curve.
Resid-power coorelation -- Dana - what coorelation do you want to assume;  
Pearce, please connect with Dana to confirm that number.
Janice/Ed -- if it's not evident, this proposed transaction is with the 
unregulated marketing sub of Florida Power & Light, not the regulated 
utility.  We have done other trades with this entity so I'm assuming we're 
all set with Master Agreement, etc.  Does our basic Master cover financial 
structures like the one outlined in the attached?

Any comments/feedback you have would be much appreciated.  Thanks

advise me of any particular form used in Houston for the purpose of such 
novation. Tks.

Steve, Catherine,

Please have your legal teams for ENA and ECTRIC speed up the process to put 
the
two ISDA Master agreements in place.
That should avoid future problems with documenting our trades.

Thank you in advance.

Ellen, 

At Sara's request, attached is ENA's form of Deemed ISDA Confirmation, which 
includes footnotes to guide one in the preparation of the document.

Please contact me with any questions.

Susan S. Bailey

Attached is a first draft of the swap for the Raptor 2 structure.  Please 
consider the following questions and I will amend the confirmation 
accordingly:

1.  I have bracketed the concept of multiple notices for purposes of multiple 
partial terminations and therefore multiple Valuation Dates.  Before we 
eliminate this concept, I just want to make certain that everyone is in 
agreement as to how this swap will terminate.  [Do we want partial 
terminations based upon partial asset sales?]

2.  Assuming that termination occurs upon sale of 100% of the assets, I need 
to be sure that the word "sale" is sufficient.  Should we use "financial 
close" or some other term of art?  I have concerns that a sale may be 
contingent or subject to some waiting period.

Stephanie:  Are these identical to our docs?  need to check ASAP

Folks,

National Bank of Canada has forwarded the attached draft documents for our 
review.  I asked if they had electronic versions of the ENA - NBC  documents 
and they have apparently gone a step further and actually generated the draft 
Garden State - NBC documentation without the confirms.  Finley will continue 
to drive forward on the confirms.  I would appreciate any comments on the 
attached documents by mid-day tomorrow so that we can possibly get this in 
place.

Thanks,
Rodney

Brent-

The deal has changed (see bottom) and according to Rolo it is still in the 
development stage.

Regards,

Pat

 
Pat,

That's a good question. Actually we are still defining prices with Eden to 
see what we are going to offer Siderca.

Following steps:
Eden and Enron to agree on structure and pricing;
Eden will present the structure to Siderca;
Siderca has to agree to the proposed structure and prices and will start 
negotiating documents.

I suggest that we hold on until we agree with Eden on point 1, and once that 
is decided, we can start working on it.

Regards,

Rolo

Rolo-

Where are you with this deal?  We will need to have underwriting become 
involved if you are looking at paying 12MM up front.

Please let me know when you are ready to have a conference call with 
underwriting and myself to discuss this deal in detail.

Regards,

Pat

Importance:  High
Pat,

Fede and I met this morning with Eden. For the time being, we are going to 
work with them on another deal (which I will explain below) and we will 
suspend the Swap deal that we were currently working on..

Eden - Siderca - Enron Deal

Eden has a full-requirement PPA (140MW) with a TOP of around 50 MWs with 
Siderca that ends on May 31st, 2006. The contract price is approximately $30 
/Mwh (adjusted with a formula) clearly out of the money.   The contract also 
states that Siderca will have to pay $12MM penalty to Eden in the event 
Siderca wants to early terminate the contract. We have proposed to Eden the 
following structure:

Enron will pay Eden an upfront payment of $12MM so that Eden terminates the 
contract with Siderca, and then Enron can transact with Siderca. Enron will 
sign a MSA with Siderca selling (financially) for around 70 MW flat during 
the term of the agreement.
Enron will sign a MSA with a Generator (possibly CTSN - an AES Co. - or 
Central Puerto) to buy (financially) 70 MW flat during the term of the 
agreement.
Siderca will sign a physical power contract with a generator for 70 MW @ spot 
prices.
Term of the agreement: Nov '99 - March '06.

One important point is to determine what will the concept for the Upfront 
Payment that Enron will make to Eden. Fede and I
thought about two options:
Dummy Option or,
Direct Payment to the Main Shareholders of Eden on an off-shore basis

I am attaching a slide were the transaction is described. If you have any 
questions about the deal structure, do not hesitate to call either Fede or 
myself.

I am told by our confirm desk that the faxing of the confirm was attempted on 
September 11 and every day thereafter until September 26 when the Duke fax

Tiffany:  Per my voice mail, please insert the following language into the 
confirms you are preparing for the Citibank transactions:

FOR THE CITIBANK/GARDEN STATE CONFIRMS:

Optional Termination: Either party may, upon sixty (60) days written notice 
to the other party, terminate this Transaction by designating to such other
                                                party the termination date 
for this Transaction.  In the event a party exercises its right of optional 
termination hereunder, the
                                                provisions of Section 
6(e)(ii)(2)(B) shall apply to this Transaction for purposes of establishing a 
settlement amount.

FOR THE CITIBANK/ENA CONFIRMS:

Optional Termination:  Either party may, upon sixty (60) days written notice 
to the other party, terminate this Transaction by designating to such other
                                                party the termination date 
for this Transaction.  In the event a party exercises its right of optional 
termination hereunder, the
                                                provisions of Section 
6(e)(ii)(2)(B) shall apply to this Transaction for purposes of establishing a 
settlement amount.

   The foregoing provision for optional termination of this Transaction shall 
not be cause for Early Termination under the 
                                                Agreement, and provides for 
termination of only this Transaction.

Steve,
As discussed I have enclosed most of the documentation required.

1) Master ISDA between Citibank and Garden State Paper Company LLC - 
boilerplate ISDA will follow by hand delivery.
2) Schedule to the Master ISDA between Citibank and Garden State Paper 
Company LLC.

3) Letter agreement for netting and set off purposes between the Citibank - 
Garden State Master ISDA and the Citibank - ENA Master

4) Sample Trade Confirmations for the ONP & NP swaps between Citibank and ENA
     

5) Sample Trade Confirmations for the ONP & NP swaps between Garden State and 
Citibank

   

We are still working through the final numbers for the confirmations but I 
thought it would be helpful to get up to speed on the language in them and 
the netting letter now.  Also the right to terminate the trades as we 
discussed is in each of the confirmations.

 If there are any questions don't hesitate to call.  Let me know as soon as 
possible if you think there is going to be any difficulty in getting this 
closed by Friday.

Thanks,
Rodney

This should clarify my voice mails from earlier today.  I am a little nervous 
that Citibank may not come through and as a reault need to create a backup up 
plan.  The backup plan is to B) do the ONP & NP swap with National Bank of 
Canada or C) do the ONP swaps with Waste Management and the NP swaps with 
National Bank of Canada.   In order to do this we will need to create the 
following documentation:

1) New Master ISDA with National Bank of Canada and Garden State Paper LLC.  
There will be no netting side letter and no special optional termination 
event.  The Master ISDA should match the ENA - NBC Master exactly except that 
the collateral threshold needs to be $1million dollars.  Finley will create 
the confirmations.

2) New Master ISDA with Waste Management and Garden State Paper LLC.  There 
will be no netting side letter and no special optional termination event.  
The Master ISDA should match the ENA - Waste Management exactly.  Finley will 
create the confirmations.

Please let me know ASAP if there will be any problems in getting these doc's 
prepared for mid morning tomorrow.

Thanks for all the hard work on a tight time frame.

I will take off the Monday and Tuesday PRIOR to Thanksgiving.  Please advise 
if any problems.  Sara

John:  I spoke with  Kevin Meredith this morning.

1)  Trade Date was 9/11.  EOL system generated confirm 9/12.  All fax 
attempts failed until 9/26 when fax went through.

2)  EOL daily volume excessively heavy (approx. 1400 confirms per day).  Duke 
volume extremely heavy as well. All Duke faxing  unsuccessful.

3)  Duke called Kevin and said "haven't received any confirms since 9/14."  
Kevin hand faxes all confirms since 9/14.  Duke makes no mention of confirms 
prior to 9/14.  Confirm desk runs a "fax failed" report on 9/25 and picks up 
the missing confirm.

4)  When Duke receives EOL 415670, John Miller (who seems to be the TRADING 
SUPERVISOR) calls Kevin (who signed confirm as agent) several times.  Miller 
says that he has spoken with the traders and no one did this deal.  However, 
this deal shows up on the "back office user."

Let me know if you need anything further.  Kevin's number is 39555.  Sara

With so much paper distributed last night, is it prudent to have a call 
whenever possible this morning with the three banks and all of the internal 
people on the line to sign off on the documentation and develop a plan for 
obtaining execution of all the paper?  I would think we need to have 
everything signed today in order to initiate the wire transfers tomorrow, 
which means we are basically out of time on negotiating the paper.

Let me know what you think.

Don't know if I have the name spelled correctly but I received a call 
requesting an ISDA Master (for Pushkar Shahi) for trading rate/currency.  
Thanks.  Sara

Deb:  I had a great time seeing you.  Hope you've recovered from the weekend 
and that Jennifer got back to school alright and Zachary is ready for another 
week.  How's the house?  Maybe you've seen this message before.  Love, Sas

And so, for all of us, our families & our friends we ask:

    May we get a clean bill of health from our dentist, our psychiatrist, our
ophthalmologist, our cardiologist, our gastroenterologist, our urologist, our
proctologist, our gynecologist, our podiatrist, our plumber and the IRS.

     May our hair, our teeth, our facelift, our abs, our honey cakes, and our
stocks not fall and may our blood pressure, our triglycerides, our
cholesterol,
our white blood count, our weight and our mortgage interest rates not rise.

    May we find a way to travel from anywhere to anywhere in the rush hour in
less than an hour and when we get there, may we find a parking space.

    May we all relax about the third millennium of the common era, and realize
that we still have 239 years until the dawn of the sixth millennium of the
Hebrew calendar by which time the computer will be long since obsolete and so
will we.

    May G-d give us the strength to get through this presidential campaign and
may some of the promises made be kept. May we believe at least half of what
the
candidates propose and may those elected fulfill at least half of what they
promise and may the miracle of reducing taxes and balancing budgets come to
pass.

    May we be awe-struck by G-d's sense of humor as we realize that a
professional wrestler could have become president of the United States and
that
an Orthodox Jew has risen to prominence in American politics while remaining
true to his Jewish roots. It is my belief that G-d's joyous humor is the
reason
he really does not want us to touch our toes while exercising or he would have
put them further up our bodies; and, the reason so many of us take up jogging
is
to hear heavy breathing again.

    May what we see in the mirror delight us and what others see in us,
delight
them.  May someone, as well as G-d, love us enough to forgive our faults, be
blind to our blemishes and tell the world about our virtues.

    May the telemarketers wait until after we finish dinner to call us.

    May our checkbooks and budgets balance and may they include generous
amounts
for charity.

    May we remember to say "I love you" at least once a day to our spouse, our
child, our parent, all of our significant others but not our boss, our intern,
our nurse, our masseur, our hairdresser or our tennis instructor.

    And may the Messiah come this year, and if he does not, may we live as if
he
has, in a world at peace, with awareness of G-d's love in every sunset,
flower,
baby's smile, lover's kiss, and every wonderful astonishing beat of our heart.
May we smile and laugh throughout the year.

L'Shana Tova.    Sam

?Investing Wisely in Volatile Markets
When markets turn volatile, we have a tendency to turn our heads away for=

Sharon Lewis asked me to contact you about this.  Our client has instructed 
us that it is SITA which will enter into the ISDA master agreement.  SITA as 
the main company must have a better credit than the company that you 
identified.

We cannot agree to a credit support document.

We suggest that you evaluate the credit of SITA and then get back to us.

Kind regards
Susan

Sharon:  Thanks for your fax and markup of the Schedule dated Sept. 6.
There is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the
counterparty identity itself.  It appears that you have identified a
DIFFERENT party to the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named
"SITA", which is not the entity which we originally proposed,.  This does
not appear to be the credit which we evaluated.

Also, we insist upon a Credit Support Annex.  As you know, the agreement
contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major
issue, particularly for long-dated pulp deals.

Can you call me tomorrow?  We need to address the major issues upfront.
You can reach me at 713-853-5620.  Thank you.  Sara

In the event of any technical difficulty with this email, please contact

Do you have further information about your pending trip to Canada?  I am 
reviewing the final letter prepared by Kevin Zemp and he is trying to 
coordinate with Calgary authorities.  I may be out of town during the week of 
Aug. 16 and I want your trip to run smoothly.  Give me a call sometime.

Dear Susan -

As per our phone conversation of last week, attached for your review please 
find
a revised draft (both clean and blacklined) of the Schedule to the ISDA Master
Agreement. The attached draft incorporates all of Morgan's comments and should
be self-explanatory. The motivation behind many of our comments was a 
conscious
effort to keep the credit terms nearly identical to those already agreed to 
with
other Enron entities.

Please review the attached and feel free to call, fax or e-mail me with any
questions or comments.

Sincerely yours,
Mike Stolfi

Dear Dan,  I have attached the updated PWD with the changes that you and I
discussed the other day.  I apologize for the wait, I ended up being covered
up by an avalanche for the last several days.  I hope that your trip was
good.

We are excited about how things are turning out with the project.  It looks
like the final project is going to be fantastic.

Thanks for all of your help.  Call me if you have any questions.

Aaron:  You never told me who in London negotiated the EnronCredit.com Ltd. 
agreement with Morgan!  I can try to work off of that ISDA.  Thanks.  Sara

Greg:  I spoke with Joe and he IS working on the internal rate swap with John 
(i.e., ECC/RMT and RMT/ENA).  Sara

Greg,

The matrix I was given doesn't mention an internal rate swap.  I'll have to 
check with John Griffith in Structuring.  

Sara,
Do you know if the Interest Rate swap is also being backed out to RMT?

Thanks
Joe

Greg Johnston
10/02/2000 02:54 PM
Joe, I understood that there should be an internal interest rate swap in 
addition to the commodity swap that you just faxed back to me.  Is someone 
other than you preparing that document?

Thanks

Greg

   
	
	

I have recieved everything.  I'll send copies of the TD & RBC signatures as 
soon as I recieve them.  The Risk Management deal you signed is, in effect, 
the Confirm between ENA and ECC.  For tax purposes, ENA does not deal 
directly with ECC, so the Risk Management vehicle takes the place of ENA.  

Thanks,
Joe

Greg Johnston
10/02/2000 10:50 AM
I believe that, as you requested, I have now had executed and returned to you 
by fax copies of the commodity swaps between Enron Canada and each of RBC, TD 
Bank and Risk Management as well as the two rate swaps between Enron Canada 
and each of RBC and TD.  I believe the only other confirm requiring Enron 
Canada's execution in this transaction is the back-to-back rate swap between 
Enron Canada and ENA, whereby Enron Canada swaps the floating rate for the 
fixed rate with ENA.  You can send that confirm directly to my attention by 
e-mail and I will get it signed and sent back to you.  I understand that you 
will be attending to obtaining counterparty execution of these confirms.  
Could you do me a favor and, when you receive the fully executed confirms 
back from the respective counterparties, fax fully executed copies of all the 
confirms to my attention at 403-974-6707.  I am aggregating copies of all the 
documents relating to this financing for our files and will need the executed 
confirms as part of that process.

Thanks

Greg Johnston

Kay:  Attached is the email I received from Steve Curlee.  Who is performing 
legal/credit for Enovate?  Sara
	Sara Shackleton

Kay:  What is this all about?  I don't know anything about "ENOVATE" .  Is it 
an Enron company?  Sara.
	Steven Curlee@ENRON

Sara, I am forwarding this to you because as you will notice your last name 
has been misspelled.  I have been speaking with Peoples recently about the 
potential sale of some financial options via Enovate.  This has brought up to 
issue of the ISDA agreement.  I don't know if you are the one working on this 
specific ISDA, but I got your name off a document showing you as the person 
working in general on ISDA agreements between Enovate and third parties.

I will call shortly to insure you receive this, and one more to follow, and 
that you are the appropriate person.  If you need to reach me, my extension 
is 36900.

Thanks,

Sara,

We were trying to finalize the ISDA between PEC and Enovate.
Fred is going to be out of the office until Thursday, but I wanted to
forward the ISDA information he has been working on.
Based on the ISDA materials attached, do you know how close (best quess:
number of days, weeks or months) we are to finalizing the contract?

Thanks,
Brian

Thanks Sara.  Are you going to be at the conference this week?

Greg:  I spoke with Joe and he IS working on the internal rate swap with John 
(i.e., ECC/RMT and RMT/ENA).  Sara
	Larry Joe Hunter
	10/02/2000 05:04 PM
		
Greg,

The matrix I was given doesn't mention an internal rate swap.  I'll have to 
check with John Griffith in Structuring.  

Sara,
Do you know if the Interest Rate swap is also being backed out to RMT?

Thanks
Joe

Greg Johnston
10/02/2000 02:54 PM
Joe, I understood that there should be an internal interest rate swap in 
addition to the commodity swap that you just faxed back to me.  Is someone 
other than you preparing that document?

Thanks

Greg

   
	
	

I have recieved everything.  I'll send copies of the TD & RBC signatures as 
soon as I recieve them.  The Risk Management deal you signed is, in effect, 
the Confirm between ENA and ECC.  For tax purposes, ENA does not deal 
directly with ECC, so the Risk Management vehicle takes the place of ENA.  

Thanks,
Joe

Greg Johnston
10/02/2000 10:50 AM
I believe that, as you requested, I have now had executed and returned to you 
by fax copies of the commodity swaps between Enron Canada and each of RBC, TD 
Bank and Risk Management as well as the two rate swaps between Enron Canada 
and each of RBC and TD.  I believe the only other confirm requiring Enron 
Canada's execution in this transaction is the back-to-back rate swap between 
Enron Canada and ENA, whereby Enron Canada swaps the floating rate for the 
fixed rate with ENA.  You can send that confirm directly to my attention by 
e-mail and I will get it signed and sent back to you.  I understand that you 
will be attending to obtaining counterparty execution of these confirms.  
Could you do me a favor and, when you receive the fully executed confirms 
back from the respective counterparties, fax fully executed copies of all the 
confirms to my attention at 403-974-6707.  I am aggregating copies of all the 
documents relating to this financing for our files and will need the executed 
confirms as part of that process.

Thanks

Greg Johnston

Hi Sara

We are Enron Trading Services Inc. (FCM) in New York. We came along with the 
MG purchase and report through London. 

We handle clear/broker US Futures and act as an IB for Enron Metals Ltd. Our 
client base is the Americas with an overlap to Houston. 

We would like for funds and commercial clients to have one Swap document 
including several commodities and Enron units. For example we understand from 
Per that you are working a document for Catequil that should include metal.

Justin

 Could you advise

Thanks

Jason:  please hold off on hedge funds for the moment.  Paul may need to 
rethink the provisions.  Sara

I spoke with Kim and she would like for Tim to explain the rationale.  He is 
traveling today.  She thinks this provision "will not hurt" to have in the 
agreement since Harvard does not want to change its form!  Also, why don't we 
say what type of entity Harvard is?  I think it are created by Mass. state 
law.  How does it go bankrupt?
	"Noble, Kimberly" <noblek@hmc.harvard.edu>
	10/03/2000 01:51 PM
		 
Sara:

In answer to your question, Harvard makes and expects to get the
representation from its counterparts that they are financial institutions
under FDICIA because of the additional argument  we think it offers a
non-defaulting counterparty for netting and setting off obligations. The
regulation says that a party may rely on the representation of its
counterparty in determining whether or not FDICIA applies, giving it the
rights created by FDICIA to net and set off the obligations created under
the swap contract.

Harvard makes the rep, and it seems that Enron should be able to because

we "engage in financial contracts as a counterparty on both sides of one or
more financial markets" and we believe we meet one (or both but only one is
required to make the rep) of the following financial tests

 1. had contracts with a total gross dollar value of at least
$1billion in notional principal with counterparties that are not its
affilitates and
 2.  had total gross mark-to-market positions of at least $100
million in one or more financial contracts with counterparties that are not
its affiliates.

This rep has been made for some time in all relevant trade documentation and
is therefore a matter which is well known by senior management.I hope that
this addresses your concerns in this regard. Please do not hestitate to call
if you should have further questions.

The relevant regulation is found in Title 12 of the Code of Federal
REgulations Chapter II Federal Reserve System Subchapter A Board of
Governors of the Fed... Part 231 Netting Eligibility for Financial
Institutions Regulation EE.

Thanks

Kim Noble

either amend all of our masters or put a separate netting agreement in

Per my voice mail. you need to insure that the right people in London keep me

(2)  I am contacting Instinet but will need the agency agreement which was

language between EIS and ECT Investments has been finalized we should be able 
to begin trading in London.  Instinet, Autex and ITG/Posit are all very

between EIS and the vendors executed as soon as possible.  Who will be our

Please see the attached currency description for USD/JPY and EUR/USD. Unlike
the USD/CAD par forwards, these products are very straighforward - they are
simple exchanges of currencies at a specific rate on a specific date. For
example, the counterparty agrees to pay USD and receive JPY at 107.00 for
10/31/00. Just a simple forward transaction for internal counterparties
only.

Sara, please review/modify. Our goal is to have these approved so that they
can be added to EOL on Monday or Tuesday of next week.

letter" in these situations.  ENE has written a vague letter of ENE's 
relationship to its sub.  It is possible that the current ENE corporate 
viewpoint on providing "comfort letters" has changed.  Let me know what you 
would like for me to do.  SS

Sara,

John Glotzbach at Prudential (312-588-5613) has been calling me for credit 
support to back futures trading for oil, gas and financial trading.  I am not 
aware of where our broker agreements stand but it is my understanding that we 
will provide a letter of comfort from Enron Corp backing ENA and not a 
guaranty.  Has this position changed?

Let me know.

Thanks,
Bill

1 - Credit Support Annex :

SITA's position is unchanged. SITA does not wish to have a Credit Support 
Annex.  SITA have asked that ENRON come up with a proposal on the term and 
volume of the transactions on the basis of no Credit Support Annex.

2 - SITA does not provide investment services ancillary to its main

The JV between ENA (or some Enron sub) and Peoples Energy Corporation is 
called Enovate.  I was on a conference call this afternoon with  Greg Penman, 
Molly Harris, Stacy Dickson and Kay Mann.  The issues is WHO will negotiate 
ISDA's ffor the JV (and negotiate the basic ISDA between Peoples and the 
JV).  You will recall that Haedicke did not want us to negotiate on behalf fo 
Bridgeline.  Kay is meeting with Mark in about an hour and will raise these

Bill:  I am resending my earlier message which identifies the correct legal 
entities with which Enron Corp. would like to execute ISDA Master Agreements 
(for the purpose of entering into equity trades).  In addition to the 
entities listed below, we need to include "Merrill Lynch International" 
("MLI").  ENA just negotiated an agreement with MLI, so the Enron Corp. 
master should be fairly simple.  Also, Clint and Jeff are interested in 
transacting with Toronto Dominion Bank.  In that regard I note that Enron has 
an Interest Rate and Currency Agreement with Toronto Dominion Bank, New York 
Branch.  I'll review this agreement to see if it requires amendment.

Jeff/Clint:  Do want to deal with a specific Toronto Dominion branch?

All:  I will expect that Bill will provide credit worksheets and I'll either 
begin the ISDA process or change "ENA" to Enron Corp. on those agreements 
which have previously been sent.

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:

Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited
Credit Agricole Indosuez

These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury

appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.

Hi Sara -

Hope we get to see you next time you're up here! I don't know when we'll be 
able to ship direct to TX - it's too dicey right now, but there are lawsuits 
underway that will hopefully change all that in the not too distant future. 
As to the sales tax issue in selected other states: in NY,
FL, & MI the only way to ship there is through a shipper that is also a 
licensed wholesaler & retailer in that state, and to do so they must charge 
the local sales tax to run it through the three-tier system within that 
state. In Louisiana, wineries must have a permit to ship there, and
they have just (in the last few weeks) made it a condition of the permit that 
the winery must collect LA sales tax and file reports with the state every 
month. What a pain! Someday soon this will all get a lot easier, we hope...

Thanks so much for your interest, and your order - enjoy the wine!

All the best,

Scott & Martha Wright

We would like for funds and commercial clients to have one Swap document

I am forwarding to ;you one of the Raptor 2 hedges which was to be finalized 
earlier this month.  My most recent draft was dated October 5 and I never 
received comments until this morning (from Ryan Siurek) which prompted the 
revisions attached.  Ryan is also expecting comments from Rodney Faldon.  

I don't know if you have been updated on the various Raptor swaps which have

Apparently, two (2) identical trades were executed online on 9/11/00, one at

John:  I spoke with  Kevin Meredith this morning.

1)  Trade Date was 9/11.  EOL system generated confirm 9/12.  All fax 
attempts failed until 9/26 when fax went through.

2)  EOL daily volume excessively heavy (approx. 1400 confirms per day).  Duke 
volume extremely heavy as well. All Duke faxing  unsuccessful.

3)  Duke called Kevin and said "haven't received any confirms since 9/14."  
Kevin hand faxes all confirms since 9/14.  Duke makes no mention of confirms 
prior to 9/14.  Confirm desk runs a "fax failed" report on 9/25 and picks up 
the missing confirm.

4)  When Duke receives EOL 415670, John Miller (who seems to be the TRADING 
SUPERVISOR) calls Kevin (who signed confirm as agent) several times.  Miller 
says that he has spoken with the traders and no one did this deal.  However, 
this deal shows up on the "back office user."

Let me know if you need anything further.  Kevin's number is 39555.  Sara

I am told by our confirm desk that the faxing of the confirm was attempted on 
September 11 and every day thereafter until September 26 when the Duke fax 
lines were open.  Upon receipt, John Miller called our confirm desk alleging 
that he never did the deal (the EOL "back office user" shows that the trade 
WAS done).
Please let me know if you need legal assistance.

Good Afternoon Sara,

Here is the original confirmation created for the FX trade that took place on 
9/26/00. The comments provided by Merrill are as follows:

1) The want to reflect "Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc., New 
York"(MLCSNY) rather than "Merrill Lynch International Bank" (MLIB).

2) They want to reference the Master Agreement dated 12/2/92 rather than 
7/1/95

3) They want to change the wire instructions to correspond with Merrill Lynch 
Capital Services, Inc., New York.

They penciled in there comments and returned the comments via fax. 

The questions are as follows:

1) Is this acceptable?

2) If so, should we just countersign on the version wherein they made their 
corrections and return to them?

3) If not, should we recreate a new confirm with the requested changes?

4) Going forward if there is a Merrill Lynch London trade, should we be using 
MLCSNY or MLIB?

We have historically only booked Interest Rate Swaps with MLCSNY until now.

Looking forward to your response.

Have a great weekend!

Regards,

Jorge

the Enron trading signatory(ies).  Thanks.  Sara

Sorry for the last minute (general unavailability of attendees), but I have 
arranged a meeting to discuss general issues on the paper & pulp desk at 2 pm 
in EB 38C2.  Dale Neuner, Tanya Rohauer, Rudi Zipter, Ted Murphy should be 
attending.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Sara 

Brent:  

In order to track the proliferation of electronic trading agreements, 
licensing/software agreements and electronic platforms, we (Sam, Stephanie 
and me) have established a "process" which includes the following:

1.  sending immediate email to Ted Murphy, legal and credit (Bradford) from 
the commercial group identifying the Enron party needing the agreement, and 
necessity for agreement

2.  depending on the type of agreement, credit may or may not need to get 
involved.

3.  the paralegals enter the agreement onto Lotus Notes so that we can track 
the process.

4.  upon execution, a copy of the agreement is kept in a red file (near Sam's 
desk), a copy is sent to Ted Murphy, and the original is sent to global 
contracts.

To my knowledge, we have not established a procedure for tracking passwords 
(to the extent required/changed).

I understand that Jason is handling three ENA weather license agreements for 
you (Risk Management Solutions,Inc., Foresight Weather LLC and Air Worldwide 
Weather).  Jason has (or will have) access to Lotus Notes to enter his

The questions are as follows:

1) Is this acceptable?

2) If so, should we just countersign on the version wherein they made their 
corrections and return to them?

3) If not, should we recreate a new confirm with the requested changes?

4) Going forward if there is a Merrill Lynch London trade, should we be using 
MLCSNY or MLIB?

We have historically only booked Interest Rate Swaps with MLCSNY until now.

Looking forward to your response.

Have a great weekend!

Regards,

Jorge

what about PrimeTrade (which is owned by CSFB)?

Sorry to be so picky here, but do we also have CSFB's signature?

Tracy:  Netting (payment or closeout) only applies between the parties under 
a single master agreement.
Are you asking about the right of setoff in the event of an early termination 
under one of the masters?

	Tracy Ngo

Susan, Thanks for your prompt response to Waste Management!

Sara, per my voice message, I wanted to check with you re. our "netting 
rights" btw the Waste Management ISDA and a potential ISDA between ENA and a 
sub of Waste Management, Wheelabrator Shasta Energy Company Inc. (ENA to get 
a gty from Waste Management)...however, I told Chris Foster to try and have 
the cp do an intracompany swap transfer.

Thanks!
Tracy

Tracy,

Per your request, attached is the excerpt from the ISDA Master Agreement 
dated February 2, 1999, between ENA and Waste Management, Inc., which 
provides notice information. 

Hope this is sufficient.

Susan S. Bailey

I spoke with Steve Kessler this morning.  He told me that he agreed with 
Carol to net commodity transactions (which was actually more than he wanted 
to agree to!).  However, DB does not have the systems to net within other 
product groups.  Sara

I know it's on your list.  I'm only sending this message so that I don't 
forget!  ss

Mary:  Attached is an early draft of notice which I had prepared for the 
AVICI swap.  I thnk we may changed the Termination provision of the confirm 
shortly after this was drafted.  Hope this helps.  Sara

Jorge:  You are trying to be too efficient!  Just kidding, because I just had 
a conversation wtih the U.K  tax person and the following issues remain 
unresolved but are in the process of being addressed:

1.  credit.com payment, back-office and negotiation
2.  Enron Japan trading (online/offline)
3.  London online FX hedging
4.  London equity hedging

Sorry I can't give you any answers right now.  All of these issues are 
tax-driven and are being addressed.  Sara

Good Afternoon Sara,

I was just reviewing some old notes and wanted to ask if the Enron Japan 
issue was ever resolved. The issue was Darren Dalage doing Japanese Yen FX 
trades in the name of ENA. I am holding some old confirmations pending the 
resolution of this issue.

Regards,

Jason:  (1)  You were going to verify whether or not arbitration (for the 
executing brokers) is mandatory.  Have you heard anything?  

(2)  Did you ever speak with Mark Elliott about ITG?  Are you still having

Sara

My schedule is currently open and I will make myself available to meet with 
Janine.  Sara

You are correct. By copy of this message,  I will ask Tana to finalize.  Sara

	William S Bradford
	10/25/2000 07:55 AM
		
This refers to settlement or payment netting only, not close out 
netting....correct?
If so, we can probably live with it.

Thanks,

Have you ever heard back from Liz Fernandez or Desiree Monroe?

Sam:  Please be sure to let Russell know when Cinergy goes out today.  He 
should have sent you the addressee.  Sara

Jim:

Pursuant to our recent conversation, I have attached below a DRAFT of ENA's 
standard (1) municipal ISDA Schedule and (2) Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit 
Support Annex.  These two documents are intended to supplement the 
boilerplate for the ISDA Master Agreement and the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  
The forms are generic, that is, they have not been tailored for use by a 
specific municipal counterparty; they would necessarily be the subject of 
specific negotiations.  

Energy New England's agency relationship with the various municipalities 
appears to cover physical trading.  Notwithstanding the agency agreement, the 
financial trading world requires much more specificity, including but not 
limited to, evidence of authority to execute a master financial agreement and 
transactions thereunder.  Additional information, including a legal opinion, 
is also required.  

I assume from our prior conversation that you already have in your possession 
copies of the ISDA boilerplate.  Please advise otherwise.

You should feel free to contact Ed Sacks with questions regarding collateral 
support documentation.  As I mentioned, the attached Paragraph 13 has not 
been customized.

Please feel free to call if you have any questions.

Sara

Agreement.

I have talked to Joe Gordon this afternoon
regarding the credit & collateral issues.

It is my understanding that Enron would
prefer to have the agreement in place &
we would hold back on transactions pending
further credit discussions with Ed Sacks.

I am out of town on Thursday & Friday; I will
touch base with you on Monday.

Thanks again for your assistance in this regard.

IF YOU HAVE A PRINTED LIST (DATE 07/13/99), PLEASE, PRINT THE UPDATED ONE.

I'M ATTACHING TWO FILES: PHONE LIST and ASSISTANTS (with the names of the 
bosses and their respective assistants)

Tanya:  Based upon our earlier conversation, I will begin preparing masters 
for the following parties with (1) no CSA, (2) bilateral cross-default at 
US$100 million and (3) uncapped (or min US$100 million cap) guaranties for 
counterparties required to post guaranties.  The parties on Clint's list are:

(1)  Lehman Brothers Finance S.A. [have form of master and a form of guaranty 
from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] - Stephanie Panus

(2)  Credit Suisse First Boston International [no form of master]

(3)  Deutsche Bank [have a form of master from ENA negotiations]

(4)  Bear Stearns International Limited [no form of master] - Samantha Boyd

(5)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. [may develop form from ENA 
negotiations]

(6)  Credit Agricole Indosuez

Tanya:  Please let me know if any of the foregoing require parent guaranties.

Clint:  Please identify the lawyer to whom I should address comments.  Also, 
are there any others?  ENE has an agreement with Toronto Dominion, NY Branch.

Samantha:  Please assign Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank and let me know who 
is handling.

My notes reflect that we last spoke with CSFB on 9/15/00.  I do not have a 
revised confirm (much less a signed confirm) in my files.  Sara

Attached, in Word Perfect, are the initial drafts of the closing documents 
necessary for the new Hawaii II 125-0 two year facility.  The documents are 
marked against the original Hawaii 125-0 facility entered into in March of 
this year.

Please note that it is the intention of Enron to roll over all of the 
tranches in the current Hawaii facility into this two year facility on the 
closing date.  Accordingly, we have utilized the existing trust and merely 
amended and restated the trust agreement (renaming the trust Hawaii II 
125-0).  Because we are utilizing the same trust, I believe that we can roll 
over the existing tranches with minimal paperwork - perhaps one omnibus 
amendment for each series, setting forth the appropriate references to the 
new Nov 15 documents.

I will send Hawaii I 125-0 Facility documents, marked against the Hawaii 
II125-0 Facility documents on or before Monday morning.

The attached documents are identified as follows:

Steve:  I don't believe that I have seen a revised forward confirmation since 
our conversations in mid-September.  I have only a "draft" confirmation dated 
May , 2000 which I marked and which served as the basis of further 
discussions.  Also, I thought that CSFB was going to send language addressing 
concerns raised by EITF Issue No. 00-19.  FYI, I have not received comments 
from Mike Enerson.

Is someone in your shop preparing a revised confirmation?  

Thanks.  Sara 

fine with me - just verify final time and location.  Sara

Gary is going to provide me with a list of OTC products for priority 
trading.  He has been in discussions with tax and structuring in Houston for 
the S. Cone.  The group has considered (i) trading onshore, (ii) trading as a 
sub of Elektro (and can this be a sub of an offshore entity?) and (iii) 
trading offshore.  They have studied the CC5 account requirements and have 
had conversations wtih JP Morgan and BofA.  There appears to be little 
communication with anyone in Brazil and Joe Kishkill is going to Sao Paulo 
next week.  I'll be more specific in a day or so.  I'm still having problems 
tying into the database (this is ridiculous!).  Did you receive my voice 
mail?  SS 

Have you been able to get a better handle on what it is that Gary wants to do?

will need to be talked about while I am over there?  Let me know when you are

they're free.  Sara

I have a question that needs to be answered on Wednesday morning:

 What company actually employs John Greene?

I am now being told by Instinet that the company employing the trader must

Please advise by email or voice mail

Apologies - I have been out of the office for the past 10 days.

I will call you this afternoon to discuss the status of the agency agreement 
and any other requirement that you may have - let me know when you are 
available.

Any word yet on creation of the new entity?  Sara

Tanya:  Bill was assigned to this master which we sent out in 1997.

Per my email yesterday, we need new credit and a new person assigned.  

I think Rod will handle credit when we dupe the ENA master for

Please let me know who will handle.  There are some issues that credit and 
legal can determine before we resend a first draft.

Andy:

In the spirit of "full disclosure", I thought I would let you know what ENA 
has agreed to on the ISDA side with various Merrill entities.
ENA has ISDA's with Merrill Lynch International Bank (8/25/95), Merrill Lynch 
Capital Services Inc. (12/2/92) and Merrill Lynch International (8/25/95).
There is no arbitration provision in any of these agreements; there is merely 
silence as to jurisdiction (ENA began negotiating arbitration around 1997).  
All of these agreements contain our standard limitation of liability language 
(in boldface) and all permit some type of assignment to an affiliate (in 
general, without negative tax impact or with sufficient credit support).  All 
of the agreements provide for setoff (including affiliates of non-defaulting 
parties) and all contain confidentiality provisions.

I would therefore propose the following changes to Annex I:

change the margin deadline time to 10:00 a.m. (NY time)
delete Par 9(b) - and you can send your additional no custody required 
language
delete the arbitration provision in its entirety

I hope that you can resond to the remaining issues tomorrow morning so that 
we can finalize docs by the afternoon.  Thanks for your assistance.

Sara

Ellen:  When you have a minute, give me a call and let's discuss, especially 
notice, assignability.  The BIG ENRON issue is limited liability (I have no 
choice here).  Setoff can be compromised with credit's approval (Paul Radous 
is credit).  Sara
	"Waskow, Andrew (OGC)" <AWaskow@exchange.ml.com>
	10/31/2000 06:33 PM
		 
Sara:

Thanks for the additional information and the recommended changes, each of
which we accept.

In order to accommodate the deletion of 9(b), we recommend revising your
number 6 to read as follows:

6. Substitution

 (a) Paragraph 9(b) is hereby deleted in its entirety.

 (b) Seller shall not retain custody of any Purchased Securities
under any Transaction governed by this Agreement.

NOTICES:  Your suggested language regarding notices is potentially
problematic.  Under the Paragraph 13 of the MRA, notices may made orally,
"to be confirmed promptly in writing....", and confirmation of delivery is
not expressly relevant.  The unquestionable ability to make oral margin
calls pursuant to Paragraph 4 is vital in fast-moving market conditions, and
was expressly included in the standard agreement to avoid any doubt as to
their validity.  In the default context (Paragraph 11), proof of delivery of
written notice is of no concern because the exercise of a party's rights
under that Paragraph is not contingent upon delivery of notice.  Notice must
be given "as promptly as practicable."  We believe that the proposed
language could cause confusion or uncertainty regarding the validity of oral
margin calls and would conflict with the operative provisions of Paragraph
11.  We therefore request deletion of your number 8.

NON-ASSIGNABILITY:  As we discussed earlier today, we have a general
aversion to assignments of repurchase transactions due to our regulatory
obligations as a broker-dealers.  For that reason, we must be free to
withhold consent to assignment with confidence that such withholding will
not be challenged as "unreasonable."  We therefore request deletion of your
number 9.

We are still reviewing your proposals regarding SETOFF and LIMITED
LIABILITY.  I will also have to review Section 5-1401 of the NYGOL before
commenting on that.

I look forward to the prompt completion of our negotiations.  Thanks again
for the information and recommendations.

Best regards,
Andy Waskow

OK, this is hot off the press.  
Tanya:  our Performance Impairment language limited the collateral call to 
1.1 times outstanding exposure.  The collateral was defined only as Letters 
of Credit and the issuing bank was at least A- S&P rated.  As to the 
Threshold, well, you can read the response.
Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
SS

Sara,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  Internally we have been
discussing the main hurdle issues which you and I discussed in our last
telephone conversation.

The results are as follows:
Harvard will not agree to change its Additional Termination Event in favor
of your Performance Impairment clause.  We find this to be too uncertain and
are more comfortable with the certainty of the ratings as set out in our
Additional Termination Event clause.
Harvard believes that it can get comfortable with the idea of Letters of
Credit, however, they must come from a middle single A or better
counterparty and we would like to know who you intend to provide such LOCs
from at the time of contract negotiation.  Harvard will not provide letters
of credit as collateral but rather US Treasuries.
Harvard cannot accept or give cash as collateral.
Harvard is willing to raise the threshold for a BBB+ from $0 to $500,000,
but cannot agree to the increase of $10,000,000 which you have requested.
Harvard cannot agree to Minimum Transfer Amounts of $1 and requires the
threshold and minimum transfer amount table as set out in our CSA to remain
in tact.
Harvard will accept a guarantee from Enron Corp., however, it must be
Harvard's standard with no changes.

Please advise where this leaves us.  I will await your response prior to
addressing issues raised in your facsimile dated 7/20/99.

Regards,
Jo-Ann Bigwood
Harvard Management Company, Inc.

Andy:

I am reviewing your comments and will have an answer shortly.  I thought, 
however, that you should know that the limitation of liability provision is 
non-negotiable from Enron's viewpoint.  If this is problematic, please advise 
and we can halt further discussion.  Thanks.  Sara

Hi Sara

We are Enron Trading Services Inc. (FCM) in New York. We came along with the 
MG purchase and report through London. 

We handle clear/broker US Futures and act as an IB for Enron Metals Ltd. Our 
client base is the Americas with an overlap to Houston. 

We would like for funds and commercial clients to have one Swap document 
including several commodities and Enron units. For example we understand from 
Per that you are working a document for Catequil that should include metal.

Monday, November 20, I have scheduled the following appointments:

Beginning at 4 pm:

Deb - facial, then massage

Sara- massage, then facial

Steve- massage, then !!!!!!!!!!!!

Villagio does not have reflexology.  I didn't know if Steve wanted a facial 
(but if he does, there is no one to do the facial at 5!)
Seriously, check their website for other services for Steve (and you).  I was 
only trying to time all of our services together, but that may not be 
entirely necessary.
I don't know what time dinner is on Monday but I'm assuming it is late enough 
to allow us to change clothes and shower (and wash hair if we feel like it).  
The spa has lot's of availability earler in the day and on Sunday.  So we can 
make changes.  This is particularly important since all changes must be made 
within 24 hours of the service or it gets charged to my credit card.  And I 
really hate unnecessary charges.

On a slightly different note, I am compiling places I'd like to visit since 
we have no itinerary.  Then we can have a tribal meeting to vote.  Big Tiger 
Feather has changed his plans to stay until Tuesday so we'll have two cars.

Bye now!  Love, Sas (the future Miss America over FFFFFFFFFFFFF)

Paul:  Please let me know if you can be available for a conference call with

Sara,

The desk has transacted two five year swaptions.  Do you recall where we were 
on the ISDA?  Negotiations had cooled significantly in light of the 
structured Skeena deal dying; however, now may be a good tome to resurrect.  
I have made the ISDA a condition precedent to exercise of the swaption.  I 
seem to recall the open issue was the definitions for the financial covenants 
of the MAC clause (cross border lease, etc.). I seem to recall that they 
didn't provide us with some of the definitions within the definitions.  I 
will pull my file to see if I can determine where we are.  Please let me know 
what your file indicates.

Thanks.

Paul:  We'll meet Friday at 2 pm to call Jason.  Can you come up to my 
office?  Sara

	Paul Radous@ENRON
	11/01/2000 05:37 PM

Paul:  Please let me know if you can be available for a conference call with

Thanks.  Sara

Paul was too nervous using the local firm of Tindall & Foster.  Kevin Zemp 
was recommended by our Calgary office.  Kevin refined the prior information 
and will "pre-clear" Paul with authorities for Paul's trip entering through 
Calgary around 8/24/99.  Do you have any comments to the new attachment?  SS

Further to your telephone conversation with Janet Burton this morning, 
attached please find a draft supporting letter for Mr. Saverance's Employment 
Authorization.  Mr. Zemp will be contacting you today to discuss the above 
matter.

Regards.

Do you have a paralegal yet?

Christian, these guys have their act pretty well together.  I spoke with Burt 
Dunn (his boss was also listening over Burt's shoulder and helping to confirm 
information).

Recently their Board approved a "general plan" of the transaction 
contemplated.   They did not do formal Board action in the form of a specific 
resolution, but I think the general approval will likely prove to be 
sufficient.

Here is what they are sending me:

1.  a copy of the "general plan" so that we can confirm just what the Board 
saw and what, if anything, might be seriously missing.

2.  a letter confirming the Board vote approving the "general plan."

3.  a copy of the resolution adopted by the Board several years ago exempting 
power purchase contracts from public bidding requirements.

4.  material from their Risk Management manual detailing the approval and 
individual authority to enter into provisions with regard to specific types 
of power contracts.

I asked Burt to fax these.  It may take a little while to pull it all 
together, but I expect to see it no later than early tomorrow morning.

Let me know if there is anything else on EWEB.

I just left a voicemail for Tom Grim re: Clatskanie.  I will continue to 
follow-up call him until I get a specific answer to your questions.  I 
acknowledge your 3 this afternoon deadline.

More when its available

We may find out today so hold the Master.  We are waiting for Lehman to 
revise the confirm and the Lehman trader (Paul Rosica) was going to "clean 
up" behind his attorney to make sure that there are really not any other 
changes to the Schedule!  Paul has been traveling for the last two days and 
should be back in the office today.  Clint Freeland (our trader) will let us 
know more.  SS

We revised the Master to include the Moody's ratings.  Do I need to send it 
to Lehman or hold onto it for now?  I think you were going to call the Lehman 
trader to discuss.

Thanks.

Pat:

I will be negotiating the ISDA Master Agreement with EWEB, probably with Jmi 
Deason directly.  ENA requires that governmentals provide specific evidence 
of authority to enter into derivative instruments (including certified 
resolutions specifically authorizing execution of the master agreement and 
all transactions thereunder, legal opinion and additional reps/warranties).  
I was curious as to the specific documentation you had reviewed from EWEB.  
It sounded from your email which Christian forwarded to me, that you were 
reviewing evidence of authority to enter into physical transactions.

I would like to speak with you directly, if possible.  I am in a Central time 
zone and my direct line is (713) 853-5620.  I look forward to speaking with 
you.  Thanks.  Sara

Attached is our form of confirm with attached Annex A (general terms and 
conditions).  Assume the confirm is governed by Texas law.  Most 
counterparties sign the confirm and fax it back to us WITHOUT the attached 
Annex A.  Is this sufficient under Texas law as having received the 
"executed" confirmation?  Do we need to modify our language incorporating the 
Annex A?  Thanks.  Sara (713/853-5620)

Without having more detail, I do know that Gary is interested in trading from 
Houson (if at all possible).  ss

Is Mark Taylor aware of Gary's plans?  I know from my conversations with Mark 
about support for trading in South America that very few people in Enron, 
other than Don and a few commercial guys in Brazil, believe that there will 
be any action to speak of on the trading side in South America.  If Gary does 
anything other than trade from ECT on exchange or through swaps that he will 
have to take into consideration who will provide legal and administrative 
support and from where.

Andrea has not confirmed any meetings with me yet.  But I would not wait too 
long to make the reservations.

Importance:  High
Have you been able to get a better handle on what it is that Gary wants to do?

Russell:

I spoke briefly with Paul about your long-dated commodity deal and have a few 
comments.

(1)  Have you spoken with anyone on the confirmation desk about preparing a 
draft confirm?  Joe Hunter (X33316) is a good start.

(2)  Paul advises that you will be transacting pursuant to the existing ISDA 
Master Agreement between ENA and CSFB Int'l (name change from Credit Suisse 
Financial Products).  In that regard, you should be sure to add the following 
items to the confirmation and discuss with your counterparty:

 (a)  ENA should be the Calculation Agent for purposes of this transaction.

 (b)  You should provide for "Payments on Early Termination" as:  "For the 
purpose of Section 6(e) of the ISDA Master Agreement,  (i)  Loss will apply, 
and (ii) the Second Method will apply."

Also, you should obtain evidence of the name change (usually a certificate of 
name change).

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara

All appointments on Monday, November 20 have been moved to 3 P.M.

Deb:  facial, then massage

Steve:  80 minute wellness massage

Steve:  the spa didn't have anyone to do a facial after 2 pm so I thought 
you'd like a longer massage.  There are facial appointments available Sunday 
morning and afternoon.  You may want to check the website and change the 
service.  You can have my facial appointment if you like (it's at 4 P.M.) and 
I'll take yours.

Sara,

An Interest Rate swap was entered into with the above counterparty in October 
1997.  This was part of a large structured Coal deal.  (Coal Capital Co.?)  I 
believe the confirm was created in Legal.   Is it possible for me to get a 
copy of this confirmation?  We are having a real problem getting this 
settlement booked each month, so we want to refer to confirm to see what is 
said.  I am out next week, but could you ask someone to send a copy to Todd 
Warwick?  he is in ENA reporting and is helping me out with this.  Thanks.

Jane:

If you have time in the morning (Nov. 9 Tokyo), I would like to discuss ENA's 
view of the CSA/Schedule relationship.  In a nutshell, we provide that a 
ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule (normally 
a MAC in the CSA).  John's preferance, of course, would be a unilateral event 
triggering an IBJ default (which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate).

I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the 
office after 4 pm (Nov.8 in Houston) and I could then conference in John.  
Alternatively, please feel free to contact me at home (after 7 pm Houston 
time on Nov. 8) at 713-664-3207.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara

	Jane McBride@ENRON

Dear John,

Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to 
the end.  They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly 
their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in 
place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course.  They 
acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards 
CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank.  They did 
say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do 
so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are 
set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask 
them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now.

We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you 
are still willing to do so.  The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess 
this means US$15 million credit limit.  

On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract 
without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting.  I should be 
able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the 
drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?     

Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the 
"Threshold Amount" definition to US$10 million.  Is there any flexibility on 
this?

Thanks.

Jane McBride

	John Suttle@ECT

Jonathan,

One thing we might be able to propose is a "Credit Matrix" which prescribes a 
Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact - with collateral 
rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each 
counterparty.  We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and 
they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC) 
clauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot 
automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  We 
are comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates, 
the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose to 
IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is 
it possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract without 
using a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a 
CSA).

Rating (S&P)     Credit Line
AA or above    $20MM
BBB+ to AA-    $15MM
BBB     $10MM
BBB-     $7MM
BB- to BB+    $5MM
Below BB-    $1MM

These terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC 
clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively 
reduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty with 
diminishing credit quality.

What do you all think?

John

Jonathan Whitehead @ ENRON   09/25/2000 08:18 PM

Sorry, Pressed send too early:

John, Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA, and they have asked us to 
consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA. I propose to meet 
with them again to try and explore why, but I would like to be prepared to 
offer them a solution whereby we don't enter into a CSA, and we would limit 
the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ. My feeling is that we 
would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions (over 2 years) at 
this stage anyway, and would prefer to get the relationship going, as I am 
not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet. They appear to be quite 
willing to discuss all the other points. We can always press for a 
renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals. 
I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate.

What are your thoughts on this, and what limitations would you want to put on 
trades if we do not have a CSA?

Thanks,
Jonathan

John-

During our last meeting with IBJ, we pushed hard for the implementation of 
the CSA.  I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the 
requisite activities relating to the CSA, as we understand that they utilize 
same with certain financial institution counterparties.  We expressed our 
view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in 
our recent conference call.  

IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financial 
institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the 
first.  We requested that they raise this issue with their respective 
superiors.  As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this 
issue was "In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral 
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA."  The legitimacy of this 
statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be 
something entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do 
not want to enter into a CSA with a non-financial institution.  

We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron, 
however it is uncertain if this is achievable.

Yes.  I thought you understood as much from our meeting.  I have asked A&K 
repeatedly to add you to the email list.  Also, it was my understanding from 
Mark Taylor that you would be responsible for the "structured" equity 
derivatives (with assistance from the swap group as needed).  Please let me 
know if I'm assuming too much.  Thanks.  Sara

Received a call from Perez lawyer, Javier Casal, saying that they have been 
occupying most of their time in another priority Project and this is why they 
are delayed with their answer on the MSA proposal. He said that they have 
scheduled an internal meeting for next Monday, Aug. 9 to tackle this MSA with 
Enron Corp. and they will contact us asap with their comments.

I told Perez that it was not worth while to delay it further than one more 
month. Casal answered that he took resposability for taking care of this 
matter.

keep you posted.

Hey, Lawyer Daigle:

On November 17, I'll be exercising my wheelchair along the winding roads of 
Napa and Sonoma Valleys.  However, would you two kids be interested in the 
more popular seminar at Galatoires on Dec. 8, entitled "Dot.com for Seniors", 
3 hours CLE credit requested?  Please let me know as soon as possible so that 
I can request my cheap senior fare on Southwest Airlines, a reduced rate 
rental car and other freebies afforded through the AARP.  Sara

Dear Sara:

    I am sending this to both addresses I have for you.  I don't know
which one is right.

    James L. Burlingame, IV, Esq. and I are thinking about attending a
seminar at Galatoires on Nov. 17, 2000.   The title of the Seminar is,
"Elder Law and You".  Please let us know if you can attend and if you
have special needs such as wheelchair, walker, Depends, or supplemental
oxygen.

P. Keith Daigle, Esq.

Janine:  Thank you for scheduling the meeting last week.  Let me know if I 
can be of any help whatsoever.  Also, whatever flowcharts or schematics you 
can offer would greatly appreciated, as well as a list of services agreements.

Dale Neuner is anxious to resolve the issues surrounding FX transactions on 
EOL.  Have you concluded that we need RMT as the EOL party for internal 
hedging FX products for London and Japan.  Am I correct in the following?

RMT will be the party transacting directly with international Enron 
affiliates (i.e., ECTRIC, through EEFT, and Enron Japan) under new/existing 
services agreements. 
ENA will be the financial party transacting directly with third parties.  
Does ENA also act directly with non-affiliated Japanese customers (if the 
situation should arise?)

Thanks.  Sara

Not really.  I usually ask to be conferenced in when the swap is discussed, 
give my comments to Danny Sullivan only (if A&K is outside counsel) or listen 
to as much as I need to.  It's really your call.  SS

	Jane McBride@ENRON
	11/09/2000 07:23 PM
		 
Sorry, a fairly basic question.

Background:

We have two legal entities here in Japan, Enron Japan Corp. ("EJC") and Enron 
Japan Marketing Corp. ("EJMC").  EJMC is used just for physical trades for 
reasons of US tax.

The draft ISDA schedule we are working on lists EJC as the Enron trading 
entity.  I am still checking how the lumber, oil and pulp trades will be 
settled but even if they are all to be settled physically, at some stage we 
may want to do financially settled trades with IBJ in which case EJC will be 
the relevant entity.

Question:

If we will be using two Enron trading entities, do we need two ISDAs with the 
counterparty?

Thanks.

Jane 

	Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
	11/10/2000 06:31 AM
		
Jane,

All trades settled physically should go into Enron Japan Marketing Corp.  
What kinds of pulp, oil or lumber trades are we looking at?  Information on 
this would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,
Susan

P.S.  Had dinner with Heidi Mason while I was in London this week.  It 
sounded like the opening was a success! 

Jane McBride@ENRON
11/09/2000 03:19 AM
Dear Susan,

If we were to do any pulp or oil or lumber physical trading in Japan, should 
this be done by Enron Japan Corp. or Enron Japan Marketing Corp.  I am not 
clear on whether it is only electricity or all physical trading which needs 
to go through EJMC.

Thanks.

Jane

Dear Paul,

I have just found out that we will be doing back to back trades for other 
Enron companies with IBJ.  IBJ has already been talking with UK and US Enron 
entities re pulp, lumber and oil trading but wants to have its ISDA with a 
Japanese Enron company so we are negotiating it.

What information do I need to give you so that you can check whether we are 
authorized to do such trades?

Carson,
I've been out of town on business a lot lately.  I'd love to have dinner again
and I've heard great things about Benji's.
Sara has a "special"  birthday coming up on the 17th.  I don't know any of her
friends here since she's gotten out of the
business in Houston.  Wouldn't it be great if you could get her two "birthday
pals" together with us for the occasion!?  Isn't
Monty a mutual friend of yours?  (I've never met him.)  What do you think?
Donna

Hi Donna:

I have not heard from you in a while, so I wanted to touch base. No real
news here. I had a nice lunch with Paul Dunning this week. He is still
very busy and recovering from a back injury but in good spirits as
usual. I still want to go to Benji's one evening if you are available.

Take Care,
Carson

In preparation for the 2:00 p.m. meeting today regarding the Bank of America 
term sheet, please consider the following:

(1) Proposed Trust/LLC Structure.  Trust would own 99% of LLC with ENA as 
managing member owning other 1%.   LLC would purchase/own VPPs.

 Legal prefers the two-tier structure but 

 (i)  would prefer the use of a Delaware business trust with Wilmington Trust 
Company as the trustee instead of a Texas trust to own equity in underlying 
LLC/LP, and 

 (ii) as to the proposed Delaware limited liability company which would own 
the VPPs, asks the tax and commercial teams to consider (a) whether this 
entity might or will derive significant income from Texas based 
properties/operations or otherwise be subject to material Texas franchise 
tax, and (b) if so, whether we should use a Texas limited partnership instead 
of the LLC.

(2) Proposed Certificate and Trust Terms and Conditions.  

Clarify that certificate holders commit to fund their pro rata portion of 
aggregate A and B loans/investments (similar to contribution obligations of 
equity owners of  LLC, i.e., LLC terms expressly provide that Trust and ENA 
must make pro rata (to their respective ownership interests) contributions to 
LLC for purchase price of VPPs].
Identity of A and B holders, e.g., banks get A and [who?] get B?

(3) LLC Terms.

Is proposed 99% and 1% ownership of LLC by Trust and ENA (as managing 
member), respectively, ok?  Same ownership percentages if we use LP?

VPP commercial and legal teams need to determine acceptability of proposed 
terms of:

(i) Master Balancing Agreement between LLC and ENA,  Note re item 1 of 
Mandatory Cost Advances:  only require ENA to make specified expenditures 
where it has control of, or not prohibited by, specific situation or 
governing contract.
(ii) Master Natural Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement between LLC and [need to 
determine correct Enron  counterparty since Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. does 
not exist] (provide for Texas governing law?),
(iii) Master Crude Oil Purchase and Sale Agreement between LLC and Enron 
Reserve Acquisition Corp. (correct counterparty?  provide for Texas governing 
law?), and
(iv) Eligibility/engineering criteria for new VPPs.  Query regarding item 
10:  why can't LLC buy a VPP from a seller in  bankruptcy on a free-and-clear 
basis?

Clarify whether specified New Company Asset Procedures are alternatives (i.e.
, either proposed new VPPs (1) meet specified eligibility criteria as 
certified by ENA or independent third party, or (2) new VPP are approved by 
Engineering Banks (with no objection by majority of Trust certificate 
holders, rather thaneither proposed new VPPs (i) meet specified eligibility 
criteria as certified by ENA and independent third party, or (ii) new VPP are 
approved by Engineering Banks (with no objection by majority of Trust 
certificate holders). 

Enron Corp. Performance Guaranty.  Presumably "performance" guaranty is one 
of payment or can be reduced to a pre-agreed payment amount.  Try for Texas 
governing law.  Start with Enron Corp. standard form of guarantee with 
revolver reps and covenants.

(4) Swaps (interest rate and energy price)

Should these be assets of Trust or LLC/LP?  Any related tax issues?
Who is swap counterparty (ENA?)
Is non-ISDA format acceptable?  If so, is Texas law (as opposed to NY law 
typically covering an ISDA) ok?

(5) Production Pricing Flexibility

 Consider consistency between pricing parameters contained in VPP purchase 
documents on the one hand (e.g., Crescendo), and financing documents on the 
other hand (e.g., Master Purchase Agreements under (3) above and swaps under 
(4) above).

Teresa, as I mentioned, attached is revised term sheet intended to reflect 
latest commercial changes but subject to legal review.  Please particularly 
consider (with commercial and operational teams as appropriate) Engineering 
(eligibility) Criteria applicable to proposed VPPs, and proposed terms of 
Balancing Agreement, Master Natural Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement, and 
Master Crude Oil Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Of course, any other thoughts 
you have are most welcome.

We are having an internal meeting (global finance, accounting and tax) to 
discuss term sheet at 2:00 PM on Friday, 11/10/00 in EB 2868.  

If you can meet with us on Friday or otherwise give us feedback by Friday 
afternoon, it would help facilitate finalization of term sheet and movement 
to drafting of definitive documents.

Sara,
In response to your questions below:

1. Rod Nelson will be handling credit as the deal is now being executed by 
ENA.

2. Tax is being handled by Steve Jacobson in the London office ( he is our US 
tax person )

3. Accounting is Matt Landy

4. The confirmations are being handled by Kim Theriot and John Wilson is the 
trader who will be signing on behalf of ENA. We have a call with them today 
at 3.00pm UK time  so if there is any change I will let you know.

5. We are still waiting for the term sheet / confirms from TD and are 
expecting them this afternoon. I will forward them to you asap.

6. TD have proposed using the 98 ISDA which I believe is already in place 
with ENA and TD Texas.

7. This is just one transaction with 3 individual wti swaps, two of which are 
with Enron, Enron/TD , TD/Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley/ Enron

I will send you the transaction diagram from TD and the ISDA agreement.

If there is anything else you need please feel free to call me on 0207 783

Joya,

Here is Sara's report.

Treasa:

Your diagram identifies "Toronto-Dominion Bank, Toronto".  
Are we using the 12/18/98 ISDA agreement as a model for a new master ISDA 
agreement?  Did the bank change its name?

Brent:  I wanted to inquire about SMUD.  After the legal/credit meeting, it 
sounded as though special deal language was going into the Schedule as 
opposed to the confirm for the Transaction.  Thanks.  Sara

I was looking forward to seeing you tomorrow and hope that we can arrange 
something soon.  I'm not sure about my plans during the Thanksgiving holiday 
but I think I'll be spending most of it in Houston.  I am taking a long 
weekend (this weekend) in Napa with my sister, brother-in-law and Mike to 
celebrate my birthday so I'm anticipating somewhat of an eating 
exttavaganza.  Talk to you soon.  Sara

receipt.  Need to negotiate early termination.  Thanks.  SS

All:

PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING BASED UPON MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE PARTIES TO THIS 
PREPAY

(1)  The Toronto Dominion (Texas) master agreement with ECT is a restricted 
master.  It was negotiated for a prepay several years ago and is not 
necessarily market (or ENA) standard.  It should be reviewed immediately by 
legal and credit.

(2)  The Morgan Stanley Capital Group master agreement is very old.  IT IS 
NOT AN ISDA .  It is a 1992 Master Energy Price Swap Agreement (limited to 
simple transactions and commodities).  The terminology is not even ISDA 
terminology.  This master has been on the credit/legal radar screen for 
upgrading to an ISDA.  

Rod:  You need to take a look at the Toronto Dominion (Texas) master 
agreement now and we should discuss.

Treasa:  Will there be a rate swap?  Under which master(s)?

you can review relevant products before we let the traders loose.  Sara, Greg 
Whalley and Andy Zipper just called me and are very anxious to get sign off 
to trade financial products.  Marcus, Wade Hicks called me and is anxious to 
trade LPG products.  We have a financial contract in place with Dynegy which 
will govern financial transactions, so it's just a matter of approving the 
products.  However, we do not have a liquids contract in place so you, 
Marcus, need to sign off on the Dynegydirect on-line terms and conditions 
that I sent you before we can commence trading.

If you have trouble logging on, give Sheri Thomas a call -- she has already 
logged on to use the system.  I believe you are going to need to download 
some software to use the system.

There are TWO (2) Enron affiliates having master agreements with Morgan 
Stanley Capital Group Inc. ("MSCG"):

(1)  ECTRIC has an ISDA Master Agreement with MSCG dated 3/25/99 but 
effective as of 8/29/97

(2)  ECT (now ENA) has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement with MSCG dated, 
and effective, as of 6/16/92

I have spoken to Kim Theriot and she has said that that you are the person 
who needs to sign off on the Master ISDA agreement which TD wish to use. 
Could you let me me know if this is ok,  I need to get back to TD today. Kim 
has confirmed that the ISDA has been fully executed.
Also could tell me which ISDA,  ENA have in place with Morgan Stanley Capital 
Group Inc. Kim says its was executed on 2nd March '99 but I don't know if it 
is the same ISDA as  the one TD want to use.

Sara,

Procter & Gamble has proposed that we start negotiating using their ISDA 
schedule.  Enclosed is a note (that addresses a few critical issues) from my 
business counterpart and a draft schedule.

P&G is the largest buyer of pulp and containerboard in North America - two 
key commodities for our business.  Executing a Master with them is very 
important.  If at all possible, I would like to accomodate their requests to 
negotiate from their schedule.

However, as you know, I am not a lawyer.  Please review and share your 
thoughts with me.  Thanks.

Ed Quinn

larsh.rt@pg.com on 11/06/2000 09:27:56 AM
Ed-

As promised, I have attached our standard ISDA Schedule.  All bank and 
non-bank
(commodity financial instrument) counterparties with whom we transact have
signed essentially the same ISDA Schedule without non-reliance and set off or
cross default.  As I have discussed previously, I think that it is beneficial 
to
both of us to work directly versus sleeving transactions through a third 
party.
Given our credit limit policies, we will require some form of credit 
enhancement
from you, but I think that cost effective alternatives exist beyond using 
banks
as stand-in counterparties.

I realize that our approach may differ from other companies, but I think that 
we
can dramatically assist in the development of the pulp and paper financial
instrument market.  Certainly, as Enron is an important market maker, we would
like to be in position to transact a significant portion of our volume with 
you.
Net, very positive results for both of our companies.

I will be interested in your response to the attached schedule.

Regards

Roger

Sara,

P&G (largest buyer of pulp and linerboard in orth America) has received Board 
approval to financially hedge pulp using OTCs instruments.  They want to put 
an ISDA in place with Enron.  I will be the contact for the business group.  

P&G's lawyer, Libby Rutherford, has requested that we start where we left 
off.  I told their business representatives that we preferred starting from 
scratch but that you would contact her directly to discuss.  Her number is 
513-983-2513 and e-mail is rutherford.em@pg.com.    

Susan Bailey compared the 1999 negotiated document to our latest schedule for 
our review - see below.  Please give me a call to discuss when you get a 
chance ext 30418.  Thanks.

Ed Quinn

Ed,

Attached is blacklined version comparing ENA's latest version (dated 
8/9/2000), which was sent to Roger Larsh @ P&G and the version dated 
5/25/99.  The biggest difference between the two versions is that the 
8/9/2000 version includes (a) ENA's newest changes, and (b) the inclusion of 
a credit support annex.

Hope this helps.

Thanks Jason,

How long has this request been in Clements hands, that group has a
tendency
to have a slow response time.  Is there no other way we can proceed with
execution of the document while we wait on the Guaranty?  Also, Midcoast
has been transacting at the parent level (Midcoast Energy Resources) and
these trades will need to be assigned to Midcoast Marketing under the
new
ISDA.  I think it would be a good idea to prepare assignment documents
as
well to have the trades moved. Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks.
Russell

I'm waiting on Clement Abrams response to one comment on the Guaranty.
everything else is finalized.

Jason,

Please let me know the status of this ISDA.

Treasa:

Do you have a deal diagram?  Is there a commodity swap between ENA and 
Morgan?  
The TD/ENA commodity swap has language regarding "loan repayment" and the 
"fee".  Has Matt seen this?  Shouldn't this be in a separate document?  Also, 
I'm not sure what TD is tyring to net (quarterly payments under the swap with 
other payments due on the same day in the same currency under the Master?).  
Do want TD to be the Calc. Agent for the commodity swap and the rate swap?  
Are you satisfied wtih the Disruption Fallback (which is the same as the 
Master but for the reduction in  Postponement from 5 to 3 days).
I am trying to speak with Rod.

The only change from our previous conversation is the addition of a bilateral 
additional event of default tied to a debt rating (below BBB-) of the 
counterparty or the guarantor if applicable.

Guarantors:
1. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
2. not required; entity rated AA
3. not requried; entity rated AA
4. Bear Stearns Cos. Inc.
5. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.
6. not required; entity rated AA

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

Tanya:  Based upon our earlier conversation, I will begin preparing masters 
for the following parties with (1) no CSA, (2) bilateral cross-default at 
US$100 million and (3) uncapped (or min US$100 million cap) guaranties for 
counterparties required to post guaranties.  The parties on Clint's list are:

(1)  Lehman Brothers Finance S.A. [have form of master and a form of guaranty 
from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] - Stephanie Panus

Just to update you:

1.  I think that our travel plans are fairly well set and I know that Kaye 
has spoken with you on several items.
2.  Mark wanted to be sure that in Sao Paulo, meetings were being scheduled 
with outside counsel (which I believe Andrea is handling), with Randy Young 
(can you attend to that please?) and ESA necessary commercials (Andrea 
handling?).
3.  Mark wanted to make certain that we got on Don Black's calendar while in 
B.A.  Could you look into that as well?

For my own edification, who are Luiz Maurer and Orlando Gonzalez?

Please let me know if there is anything elso you need form me. 

I'll bring you up to date on Hickerson shortly.

Thanks,  Sara

A Florida judge will hold a televised hearing at Noon ET on a Democratic
legal challenge to uphold hand recounts of presidential votes in several
Florida counties. The move is a challenge to Florida Secretary of State
Katherine Harris' decision Wednesday not to allow counties to modify their
vote totals.

Matt Dawson in London was inquiring about this agreement.  He'll want to know 
when we are finished because he has a London paper trader nagging him.  SS

Marcus:  

TD has scheduled a conference call with me at 10:30 am Houston time to 
discuss the crude swap (related to the prepay).  Mataly Sahoni (?) said that 
they wanted to discuss some "credit issues" and that it was "no big deal."

You are welcome to join me.  Sara

Does the fact that  you put the phrase "no big deal" in quotations indicate a

is signing on the basis of their authority under the investment services 
directive".  Would you please provide directly to SITA's lawyers as follows:

Sara, here's the transcript of a conversation with Bob whereby I mistakenly 
inform him that he needs to post a $240k LC and he doesn't object.  Please 
comment on how useful this will be to our efforts to enforce the deal.  Also, 
as mentioned previously, I called Bob a week ago, left him a message and 
haven't heard any response.  Should I try again?????  What are our next 
steps?   (I'm pulling more tapes to try to find the conversation or message 
in which I tell Bob that he's actually got $250k of credit).

Thanks,
Alan

SITA now insists on having the Termination Currency and the Contractual 
Currency, except as otherwise agreed in any Transaction/Confirmation, as the 
Euro.  They will not agree to USD.  [By the way, SITA's lawyers had already 
agreed to USD]  Effectively, if we agree to this, the trader will need to 
confirm each deal in USD (Contractual Currency) but if we early terminate, 
the currency will be Euro's (Termination Currency).

What do you want to do?  Other than the Enron Corp. guaranty, we are finished.

Sara

Yes, I have received your message.  I had lunch with Monty, Keith and my dad 
at the Big G and it was wonderful.  Then I dragged Lawyers Daigle and 
Burlingame to the offices of Gordon, Arata, et al to say hello to Guy Wall.  
We only stayed for a few minutes and the old firm sure looked the same.  The 
weather in N.O. was perfect and I also had dinner at Emeril's and a catered 
meal by P. Prudhomme, both of which were excellent.  Things are rocking along 
here.  I am actually going to have that eye surgery next Friday (I'm 85% 
convinced to do it).  It only takes a short time and I can't drive to the 
clinic myself but I can drive the following day.  Maybe they'll come up with 
something to help my brain.

Back to N.O., I also had drinks with Paul Dubroc.  I guess you heard that 
Neel Roberts has been receiving treatments at M.D. Anderson.  (So is Julia 
Heintz's mother, by the way).  Robert Soniat (a lawyer in N.O.) recently died 
of liver cancer.  

I have been for long weekends to Phoenix and N.Y.  It snowed in Phoenix (it 
was supposed to be 80 degrees) and I caught the 24-hour bug in N.Y.

So, Carson, what's new with you???????????????????????????

FYI - comments were sent to Duke and Duke's NY lawyer today.  I doubt that 
there will be any issues.  SS

Treasa:  Bob Bruce told me that there was no "swap" activity on the prepay 
during my absence.  
Houston is closed down until Monday, Nov. 27 for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Normally, I would ask Joe Hunter on the confirm desk to take a look at the 
confirms.  I marked up the TD confirm to reflect my comments and provide an 
attached "schedule" of volumes since I thought it would be easier for you to 
match calc periods, volumes and rate payment dates.  Such a format has worked 
well in other prepaid structures.

If I don't go out of town tomorrow,  you can  reach me at home. My number is 
(713) 664-3207.

This year is no different from any other year and we are always asked to 
review the swap component of the Global Finance structured deals.  We are 
also seeing lots of prepays.

Who is the credit person to be apprised of these transactions?  Should we 
immediately involve you and Bill?

At the moment, Mary Cook, Angela Davis (legal finance group) and I are 
juggling the deals.

Please let me know and I'll alert the swap group.  Thanks.  Sara

Stephanie:  Hope you had a great Thanksgiving!

Please follow up with this guy.  Looks like he's in London.  We need to 
verify that he's with Harvard, either through Caroline or asking that he send 
a faxed request so that we can see the letterhead, etc.  Also, please keep 
track of the fully executed master.  Thanks.  Sara

I have been speaking with Caroline Abramo regarding our trading relationship 
with the President & Fellows of Harvard College.  I am trying to obtain a 
copy of the ISDA that I understand has been signed with them.
I would be grateful if you could forward a copy of this to me.

Thanks for your help

Good Morning Sara,

Hope you had a nice holiday weekend! I wanted to follow up regarding several 
issues.

1) Please provide me with your e-mail authorization wherein you verbally 
approved the "Right to Terminate" language for the Merrill Lynch Interest 
Rate Swap Confirmation.

2) I faxed you Bank of Montreal's response to the "Right to Terminate" 
language on Friday for the Interest Rate Swap that was originally traded on 
11/3/00.. Please advise with your opinion. I have another trade with the 
identical language from 11/14/00 that I am faxing to you this morning. We 
received it at 5:37pm Friday afternoon.

3) Please advise your opinion on the Termination Agreement for the Default 
Swap with Deutsche Bank dated 10/12/00.

Looking forward to your response.

Regards,

Jorge

Jane:  Sorry for the delay.  I'm preparing a "cash only, two-way" section for

Hi Sara,

How are you going - did you have a good Thanksgiving?  Coincidentally 
Thursday was also a holiday here - we were celebrating Respect for the Aged 
Day though.

Actually, Sara, I was wondering how we are going in getting some drafting 
together for the credit provisions discussed recently with John Suttle and 
Jonathan Whitehead.

Thanks and sorry for the trouble.

If you have time in the morning (Nov. 9 Tokyo), I would like to discuss ENA's 
view of the CSA/Schedule relationship.  In a nutshell, we provide that a 
ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule (normally 
a MAC in the CSA).  John's preferance, of course, would be a unilateral event 
triggering an IBJ default (which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate).

I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the 
office after 4 pm (Nov.8 in Houston) and I could then conference in John.  
Alternatively, please feel free to contact me at home (after 7 pm Houston 
time on Nov. 8) at 713-664-3207.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara

Dear John,

Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to 
the end.  They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly 
their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in 
place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course.  They 
acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards 
CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank.  They did 
say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do 
so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are 
set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask 
them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now.

We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you 
are still willing to do so.  The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess 
this means US$15 million credit limit.  

On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract 
without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting.  I should be 
able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the 
drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?     

Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the 
"Threshold Amount" definition to US$10 million.  Is there any flexibility on 
this?

Thanks.

Jane McBride

Jonathan,

One thing we might be able to propose is a "Credit Matrix" which prescribes a 
Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact - with collateral 
rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each 
counterparty.  We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and 
they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC) 
clauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot 
automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  We 
are comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates, 
the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose to 
IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is 
it possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract without 
using a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a 
CSA).

Rating (S&P)     Credit Line
AA or above    $20MM
BBB+ to AA-    $15MM
BBB     $10MM
BBB-     $7MM
BB- to BB+    $5MM
Below BB-    $1MM

These terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC 
clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively 
reduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty with 
diminishing credit quality.

What do you all think?

John

Jonathan Whitehead @ ENRON   09/25/2000 08:18 PM

Sorry, Pressed send too early:

John, Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA, and they have asked us to 
consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA. I propose to meet 
with them again to try and explore why, but I would like to be prepared to 
offer them a solution whereby we don't enter into a CSA, and we would limit 
the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ. My feeling is that we 
would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions (over 2 years) at 
this stage anyway, and would prefer to get the relationship going, as I am 
not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet. They appear to be quite 
willing to discuss all the other points. We can always press for a 
renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals. 
I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate.

What are your thoughts on this, and what limitations would you want to put on 
trades if we do not have a CSA?

Thanks,
Jonathan

John-

During our last meeting with IBJ, we pushed hard for the implementation of 
the CSA.  I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the 
requisite activities relating to the CSA, as we understand that they utilize 
same with certain financial institution counterparties.  We expressed our 
view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in 
our recent conference call.  

IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financial 
institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the 
first.  We requested that they raise this issue with their respective 
superiors.  As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this 
issue was "In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral 
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA."  The legitimacy of this 
statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be 
something entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do 
not want to enter into a CSA with a non-financial institution.  

We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron, 
however it is uncertain if this is achievable.

With respect to Deutsche Bank (""DB"), we have one credit issue remaining, DB 
would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as 
Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat 
hesitant to do so, as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured 
loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement.  Sara and Bill 
Bradford in Credit are supposed to talk to the DB Credit people about this 
remaining issue.

With respect to First Union National Bank, the draft we were working from was 
so old that they agreed to look at our current form of agreement which was 
sent to them on 11/8/00 for review.  Sara is working on that with Susan

getting the operational side of the transfer into a new entity will take the

I have deliberately not placed ECCL anywhere because it is probably moving

On what basis should we decide whether to create ECHI and ECCI as LLCs or

mid-November and we'd like to confirm under a master.  Thanks.  Sara

John:  I don't know if you've been in touch with Instinet but they are now 
holding up the documents.  Instinet could not find the ECT Investments, Inc.

lawyer agreed to amend that agreement to add the London terminal.

This should be a minor item.

As you are aware TD were concerned about the basis risk embedded in the 
prepaid swap structure . They plan to hedge their Enron exposure by buying 
credit default swaps in the market. However under credit default swaps, only 
a default on debt as defined by GAAP is  included as a credit event, and 
swaps are excluded from this definition .  This basis risk  therefore occurs 
where  Enron defaults on the oil swap but has not defaulted on any debt. This 
does not trigger a payout to TD under their credit protection, their recourse 
will then be through  the Corp guarantee with time delays. 

To mitigate that risk it was proposed that  in the event of an Enron default 
under the prepaid swap, the MTM termination value of the swap would be 
converted into a loan and Enron would automatically default on that loan. 
TD's counsel came back late on Friday to say that they could not give a clean 
legal opinion on this  structure.

We therefore proposed an alternative structure which involves TD and Enron 
entering into a loan of $10.1m at the same time as the swap is executed. This 
loan will  be in the name of Enron Corp. In the event of an Enron default on 
the prepaid swap, this will cross default into the $10.1m   loan and that 
forms the required trigger for TD's  credit default swaps.   The lawyers 
signed off on this last night and Norton Rose are now preparing the loan 
documentation.
They are basing it on the May 2000, 364 day Enron Corp facility and we are 
expecting first draft tomorrow. I will forward this to you when I receive it.

The deal itself is still undefined as TD have  credit approval subject to 
presyndicating the loan to two other banks and putting a certain level of 
credit protection in place prior to executing the trade.
The confirm/term sheet has not changed from two weeks ago and I have 
forwarded Sara's  comments to TD but their focus has been on getting credit 
approval rather than docs until today.  We have not sent a confirm to Morgan 
Stanley yet as we plan to replicate  whatever  confirm we agree with TD.  

I will keep you informed as to TD's progress.

Regards

Mark:

Credit has asked us to pursue trading arrangements on behalf of Enovate.  

At least for the short term, Mark Haedicke told Kay Mann that ENA legal 
should handle Enovate legal work.  That work currently consists of 
establishing documentation for financial trading with third parties.  It is 
not clear what lawyers (ENA or Peoples) will draft/negotiate ISDA masters nor 
have any forms been agreed (but Peoples' lawyers have seen our forms and I 
have seen their forms which are poorly drafted).  Bill Bradford will have the 
final word on Enovate credit.

Credit has asked us to track Enovate masters on our Lotus Notes database.

Do you need to follow up with Mark about us negotiating Enovate's master 
agreements?  Or should we just handle as any other project?

Sara

Laurel:  Looks like this is being handled properly.  You just need to stay on 
top of it.  SS

Sara, RMT/NNG was put on hold per Tony Pryor's request pending restructuring 
of NNG.  This restructuring is finished (it involved NNG going from 100% 
Enron-owned to about 98%).  I talked with Tony yesterday on this and he says 
the ISDA may now proceed. Tax has confirmed this is still an RMT deal.

Re the fx trade you mentioned, the confirm desk has drafted a deemed ISDA for 
this that needs fixing. (not sure what they are doing drafting deemed 
ISDAs).  I am working with Melissa Rodriguez on this.  

I do have a voice mail in to Tanya to ask her if credit wants to re-review in 
light of the new NNG ownership structure.  Even though the ownership change 
seems minor, it seems like the procedurally sound thing to do is to run this 
by credit.  Have not heard back from Tanya and will bring this up at 
legal/credit meeting this afternoon.

I will take this over, including the ISDA master.  Susan, in the meantime, 
could you e-mail me the credit review sheet on this if you have one. -- Bob

Sara--  The arbitration set-up is OK, and JVD has approved.  My only comment 
is that eight years experience may be too much to ask, insofar as the third 
arbitor is concerned.   I won't have heartburn if we stick with that, but I 
do suggest that the agreement provide that less experience is acceptable upon 
request by the two arbitors and approval of both parties.   

Joe:

Susan Bailey (X34737) will be drafting the TVA master.  I don't think it will 
go out today; maybe, tomorrow.  Please feel free to call Susan (or me) if you 
have any questions. 

Negotiations proceed more quickly when legal has the name, phone number and 
email address for the counterparty's LAWYER (I know you tried!).  If the 
counterparty is truly anxious to trade, the commercial guys will pressure the 
legal department to pay attention to the documents and keep the ball 
rolling.  Otherwise, things will sit around and go nowhere.

Just remember that an ISDA negotiation is USUALLY longer with a governmental 
entity because ENA requires more information (legal opinion, copies of 
statutes, authority in the form of a full Board resolution, etc.) and 
government lawyers may be short staffed.  Sometimes the counterparty will 
hire outside counsel which may go more quickly, but not always.

If a counterparty is totally organized and familiar with financial trading 
documents, the negotiations may end within a week (but I have never seen this 
happen with a governmental).  Otherwise, it simply depends on the issues.

Sara  

Can you be more specific?  Is this for ENA?  What type of products?

I would've checked this with your assistant, but I am not sure who it is.
Thank you

1.  Finance deals for total return swaps may not have had such language.
   2.  A couple of masters may have excluded trade option exemption with 
respect to counterparty or used our "deemed" language.
   3.  Maybe some of Shari's weather masters excluded commodity items.
   4.  Credit Lyonnais AAA Master didn't address commodities.  Are there 
other AAA masters and/or bank masters like this?
   5.  The paralegals may remember something.

   
	
	

Do you remember negotiating any master agreements for ECT that did not 
contain the necessary elements for trading energy commodity derivatives?  In 
particular I'm thinking about things like the trade opiton exemption 
representations and the commodity derivatives definitions provisions.

You have attached a form of confirmation for a very specialized derivative 
transaction, namely, a CREDIT derivative.  The transaction that Enron and So. 
Cal. would be executing would be a COMMODITY derivative (that commodity being

later.  Sara

    Is the attachment the form of confirmation that would be employed for a

Sara:  Attached are EWEB's markup of Enron's response to EWEB's proposed
ISDA Schedule.  As we discusssed, in order to isolate the items that remain
to be resolved, I simply "accepted" all of your modifications and then
redlined items EWEB wants modified or returned to EWEB's original proposal.

Also, in regard to the Confirmations and our discussion regarding their
execution in connection with authorizing Resolution to be considered by the
EWEB Board on December 5th, EWEB proposes the following language be added to
the end of the first paragraph of each Confirmation:  "This Transaction will
become effective and enforceable upon the final approval of its terms by the
EWEB Board of Commissioners and issuance of an authorizing legal opinion by
counsel for EWEB."

As for the remainder the terms of the Confirmation, i.e., the "deemed ISDA"
portion, EWEB requests that you incorporate any proposed changes included in
our redline to the general ISDA Schedule.

Finally, I understand from Dick Varner at EWEB that he is in the process of
arranging a conference call tomorrow regarding the credit arrangements.
Thanks for assisting in setting this up.

Attached is the latest listing of executed equity agreements.  We have a 
separate listing for futures agreements but the brokers are different from 
equity brokers.

Dennis:

Attached are two "templates" for power trades confirmed under an executed 
ISDA Master Agreement, one is for a swap and the other for an option (cap or 
floor).  Ignore the symbols and elections which are only to feed deal terms 
into our confirmation system.  The specific terms of each trade (dates, 
notional quantities, price indexes and pricing, etc.) would be inserted into 
the format.  I hope this helps. Sara

Dennis:

Attached are two "templates" for power trades confirmed under an executed 
ISDA Master Agreement, one is for a swap and the other for an option (cap or 
floor).  Ignore the symbols and elections which are only to feed deal terms 
into our confirmation system.  The specific terms of each trade (dates, 
notional quantities, price indexes and pricing, etc.) would be inserted into 
the format.  I hope this helps. Sara

Do you also have fax and email address?

Sara,

In reference to our conversation this morning, the legal contact at Bear 
Stearns is Christine Durland at (212)272-4935.  Additionally, David said he 
will be available at 4pm today to discuss your questions.  He can be reached 
at x3-7143.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Laurel:

Jason is ready to send comments on this agreement requested by John Greene.  
Can you please provide Jason with the name, address, fax number of the party 
with whom we should be communicating in order to negotiate this agreement.  
If you need to speak with Jason, you can call him at (713) 220-4124.

Thanks.  Sara

Please confim that this file is currently inactive.  Thanks.  Sara

Sheila:  Please verify whether we need to pursue this agreement.  Thanks.  
Sara

Jason:  I believe you have this agreement as well.  Can you bring me up to 
date?  Thanks.  sara

Clem:

After our legal credit meeting yesterday, we noted that the following 
guaranties have not yet been executed:

Randy/Sara,  

Please confirm if Enron can or cannot execute a financial swap with Aracruz 
Brazil.

Alternatively, we need input on Enron's ability to execute a financial swap 
for pulp with Aracruz's off-shore, Panamanian  subsidiary. 

We are trying to prep for a discussion scheduled for tomorrow, Thursday 
afternoon, Sao Paulo time (4 hours ahead of Houston). 

Thanks your help.

Of course not!  Therefore, rank it LOW.

Chris:  We need to discuss the alternative to SP-15.  Please see the redline 
where I have incorporated a "Fallback Reference Price".  However, the 
definition is still vague.  SS

Sara:

I attach a clean copy of the nondisclosure agreement, which I have dated as
of today.  As we discussed, if you fax a signed copy of the agreement to me
tomorrow, I'll have it signed on behalf of Bertelsmann and fax it back to
you.  We will then exchange originals by mail.  It has been a pleasure
working with you on this.

Regards,

Sara,

    Is the attachment the form of confirmation that would be employed for a
Enron/SCWC "contract for differences" transaction? I pulled it from the ISDA
website you mentioned. For Dave's benefit, the site is www.isda.org. Sara,
Dave advises SCWC on energy matters.

This should do it except that I would add a heading "DRAFT - FOR DISCUSSION

the phrase "as published in ... caliso.com" at the end of the sentence.

I will attend.

Jorge:

(1)  Yes, I did verbally approve the Merrill Lynch "Other Provisions" section 
of the rate swap (10/26/00 deal).

(2)  Yes, I received your Fax of 11/21/00 from Bank of Montreal with your 
email to the bank.  The language which you sent to the Bank of Montreal 
("BOM") was to be based on the Merrill Lynch "Other Provisions" section of 
the above rate swap.  In that regard,
 (i)  you inadvertently left out a phrase when you retyped the Merrill Lynch 
language.  However, BOM's subsequent revision is acceptable.
 (ii)  it is not clear to me whether ALL of Paragraph 3 in the original BOM 
confirm is being replaced.  Your message to BOM seems to imply that it is 
fully 
        replaced (which is what we want).  You should definitely verify that 
this is the case in your latest BOM confirm.

(3)  Yes, the Termination Agreement format from Deutsche Bank AG looks fine.  
Just be sure that all transaction references are correct.

Sorry for the delay.  I am trying to identify another lawyer to back me up.

Good Morning Sara,

Hope you had a nice holiday weekend! I wanted to follow up regarding several 
issues.

1) Please provide me with your e-mail authorization wherein you verbally 
approved the "Right to Terminate" language for the Merrill Lynch Interest 
Rate Swap Confirmation.

2) I faxed you Bank of Montreal's response to the "Right to Terminate" 
language on Friday for the Interest Rate Swap that was originally traded on 
11/3/00.. Please advise with your opinion. I have another trade with the 
identical language from 11/14/00 that I am faxing to you this morning. We 
received it at 5:37pm Friday afternoon.

3) Please advise your opinion on the Termination Agreement for the Default 
Swap with Deutsche Bank dated 10/12/00.

Looking forward to your response.

Regards,

Jorge

Attached is an updated list of brokerage agreements under negotiation.  
Please let me know of any changes.  Sara

Sorry for delayed response.

Tom says below that the invoice is likely to be in French Francs (FF) , 
therefore, I would have thought that having contractual currency as FF (or 
Euro as / when it replaces the FF)  is the most sensible. 

As the early termination value is likely to be calculated in FF or Euro, I 
think that this would not be a problem either.

Please feel free to give me a call if you wish to discuss 207 783 6755

As you are perhaps aware, the Master for this CP has been arranged thru 
Houston.  Would you cast your eye over the comments laid out below and revert 
to either Sara or Tanya with your comments.  
As background, Houston has negotiated all the docs and were intending to 
trade out of Houston.  This CP has now been handed over to us and all trades 
will be generated from here.
Any help much appreciated.

Tanya:

SITA now insists on having the Termination Currency and the Contractual 
Currency, except as otherwise agreed in any Transaction/Confirmation, as the 
Euro.  They will not agree to USD.  [By the way, SITA's lawyers had already 
agreed to USD]  Effectively, if we agree to this, the trader will need to 
confirm each deal in USD (Contractual Currency) but if we early terminate, 
the currency will be Euro's (Termination Currency).

What do you want to do?  Other than the Enron Corp. guaranty, we are finished.

Sara

Of course.  You probably forgot that SITA requested both 
settlement'termination in Euros.  SS

	Tanya Rohauer
	11/30/2000 10:34 AM
		
How can the contractual currency be USD and the invoicing be in FF as 
indicated below.  I guess I don't really care what currency is used as ECTRIC 
will be responsible for hedging its currency risk with Hickerson; however, 
shouldn't the contractual and termination currency be the same?

Tanya:  Is Lee the right person to approve this change for SITA?  Remember, 
SITA is acutally with ECTRIC (nto ENA) and SITA wanted to settle in Euros.

Steve:

I just spoke with Bill Bradford and I understand that Bill and Mark 
Tarkington discussed the use of "Specified Entity" and agreed, subject to DB 
committee approval, to eliminate the use of Specified Entity in the ENA and 
affiliated masters with DB (i.e., "Specified Entity:  none").   Once you have 
confirmed this with Mark, please prepare a final blacklined draft for our 
review and then execution copies of the ISDA Master Agreement.   In 
connection with the final draft, Tana Jones will fax to you minor format 
comments.  [She will also fax to you the electronic trading agreements and 
password applications for London and U.S. based trading.]

The following ENA affiliates will also need to execute ISDA Master Agreements 
with DB:

(1)  ECT Investments, Inc. (Delaware corporation)

(3)  EnronCredit.com Limited (U.K. corporation)

Let me know when you want to talk.  SS

transactions on ENE stock.  Clint and Jeff are anxious to proceed with the

Bill:  I am resending my earlier message which identifies the correct legal 
entities with which Enron Corp. would like to execute ISDA Master Agreements 
(for the purpose of entering into equity trades).  In addition to the 
entities listed below, we need to include "Merrill Lynch International" 
("MLI").  ENA just negotiated an agreement with MLI, so the Enron Corp. 
master should be fairly simple.  Also, Clint and Jeff are interested in 
transacting with Toronto Dominion Bank.  In that regard I note that Enron has 
an Interest Rate and Currency Agreement with Toronto Dominion Bank, New York 
Branch.  I'll review this agreement to see if it requires amendment.

Jeff/Clint:  Do want to deal with a specific Toronto Dominion branch?

All:  I will expect that Bill will provide credit worksheets and I'll either 
begin the ISDA process or change "ENA" to Enron Corp. on those agreements 
which have previously been sent.

Thanks.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

All:  Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to 
put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:

Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited
Credit Agricole Indosuez
CSFB International
Lehman Brother Finance S.A.
Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
Deutsche Bank

These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury 
group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the 
appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.

Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process?  Thanks.  Sara

Please put me on the list for a flu shot.  My ext. is 35620.  Thanks.  Sara

Larry:

According to Steve Kessler (the DB lawyer in New York who is negotiating the 
ENA ISDA Master), London e-commerce issues are normally handled ty the London 
lawyer (Conrad Libischer at 44-20-754-52705).  If  NY trader is also 
involved, then DB must decide on one lawyer to handle password application, 
etc.

The ENA ISDA Master must first be approved by Frankfurt.  I don't know how 
long this takes.

You may want to let the DB trader start the EOL process.

Thanks.  Sara

We are not seeking authorization at this time.

Marcello:

I am also aware of the recent memo which you prepared for Brent Hendry re:  
internet trading.

I have two (2) followup questions for you limited specifically to financial 
trading (NOT VIA INTERNET):

 (1)  Do you have any changes to add to your memo of March 17, 1997 with 
respect to financial trading?

 (2)  Would you modify ENA's Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement (which I 
believe Brent Hendry recently forwarded to your attention)?

I look forward to hearing from you.  ENA is about to execute a trade with a 
Chilean corporate and I will most likely see the trade confirmation in the 
next day or so.  You can reach me via email or by phone at (713) 853-5620.  
Thank you very much.

The draft documents for the index/swap structure:

I will be out of the office until the 16th.  Jan will be able to get hold of 
me if I am out of cell range.

In my absence Christian has graciously volunteered to shepard the deal as 
needed.

Sara:  Have I done severe damage to the confirm/schedule?

ED:

(1)  The Alcoa lawyer wants to adopt the terms of the ENA/Alcoa Inc. master 
for purposes of the December deal.

(2)  EWEB has requested the following provision:

DEFAULT RATE shall mean the lesser of (a) the per annum rate of interest 
equal to the prime lending rate as may from time to time be published in "the 
Wall Street Journal" under "Money Rates" on such day (or if not published on 
such day the most recent preceding day on which published), plus two percent 
(2%) but not to exceed in total fourteen percent (14%) annually, and (b) the 
maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

Please let me hear from you.  

Sara

Bob:

Attached is a draft "forward template" for circulation by Enron Corp. to 
potential counterparties.  I based the template on the Lehman Bros. forward 
transaction (which I will fax to you separately).  Per our discussion, please 
take a look at the template from Enron's viewpoint and suggest improvements, 
comments, etc.  Enron Corp. has a potential counterparty in the wings and I 
would like to send out the template tomorrowl

Please call me with your questions.  As always, thanks for your help.  Sara

RE:  Alcoa - it's a one-month deal.  The issue is no netting absent a SINGLE 
agreement governing ALL trades.

Please respond about ALCOA and EWEB.  I'll be out Thursday and Friday.

Sara,

I will be out most of today as I am taking a Power Marketing course.  With 
respect to (1) below, the terms of the Alcoa agreement would probably be 
fine, so long as we get a guaranty from Alcoa, Inc.  (2)  How does this 
differ from the standard and/or is it material?

Rgds,

Ed Sacks

Please find attached a blacklined copy of the loan document relating to the 
prepay. Could I please have your comments asap as TD need to finalise docs 
before they syndicate the loan.

Please see attached black-lined version from the 364 day as requested.
Apologies for the delay - Norton Rose experienced some technical difficulties 
in
blacklining.

In terms of the Facility Amount and Term, I have asked Norton Rose to square
bracket both and make it clear on the front page that these two points are 
still
under discussion and may well reduce.  The amounts currently square bracketed
are maximums and are there to give us some flexibility should it be 
required.  I
trust this is satisfactory.

Please give me a call if there's anything else in respect of the loan 
agreement
you need to discuss.  We will update you as soon as possible on syndication

I finally reached Tom Seligson and he will change the guaranty (below) to add 
that ENA may assign the guaranty to any affiliate without the approval of the 
guarantor.

The remaining issue is whether to confirm on our omnibus or create a confirm 
and adopt by reference the provisions of the Alcoa Inc./ENA master.  I have 
left Ed Sacks a message.  Sara

I was hoping that we could speak sometime today as I will be out of the 
office Dec. 7 and 8.  I would like to discuss your comments the Schedule and 
receive your blackline to the Credit Support Annex.  I am available all day

hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara

Mark:

I am about to finalize comments to the SITA Master ISDA Agreement on behalf 
of ECTRIC.  I need your able assistance with respect to the following:

(1)  SITA has not passed a board resolution authorizing execution of the 
Agreement.  Instead, SITA proposes a certificate stating that its President 
Directeur General or Directeur General have, pursuant to the Articles of 
Association, full power and authority to execute the Agreement or to grant a 
power of attorney to do so.

(2)  SITA has requested evidence of EEFT's authority to sign on behalf of 
ECTRIC.  I have sent a copy of the power of attorney to the lawyer and will 
ask that she direct any questions to you if I am not reachable.

SITA's attorney is Susan Hopkinson at Lovells in Paris.  Her phone is 33153 
674747 and fax is 33147 239612 and email is susan.hopkinson@lovells.com.

I will be out of the office Dec. 7 & 8.  Stephanie Panus if assisting with 
the file.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara

Susan:

A few items to follow up with:

(1)  I understand that you are finalizing the Enron Corp. guaranty with 
Clement Abrams.  Please let me know when all is agreed and I will arrange 
with Clem for an executed guaranty.

(2)  Stephanie Panus will fax to you the power of attorney for EEFT to act 
for ECTRIC.  The acronyms will be obvious in the fax.  

(3)  Euros are fine for Termination and Contractual Currency.

(4)  I am considering your proposed certificate in lieu of a board resolution 
and checking your tax rep.

I will be out of the office Dec. 7 & 8.  You can contact Stephanie Panus in 
my absence.

Regards.  Sara

I will be taking Friday, Dec. 29 as a vacation day.  Sara

P.S.  I will also be on vacation Dec. 7 & 8.

Thanks for your email.? As regards your  points:
?
(1) I will let you know once the guarantee is  finalised.
?
(2)?I look forward to receiving the power.?  My client told me this morning 
that he has an email from one of your commercial  people saying that EEFT 
will be the counterparty and that ECTRIC is no longer  involved. I had 
thought that EEFT were simply signing on behalf of ECTRIC and  the fact that 
you are sending me a power suggests to me that this is still the  case.? 
However, given your commercial colleague's email to my client there  is still 
confusion regarding the identity of the counterparty which I would be  
grateful if you could clarify. 
?
(3) Thank you.

(4) Sita has had executed the certificate (which refers to two boardr 
esolutions) and a power of attorney.? I look forward to hearing from you  
regarding the Tax rep.

Lisa Palmer and I had a conference call with the Xerox lawyer and commercial 
person.  The main issues are the following:

No CSA (claim to have over 40 ISDA Masters none of which contain CSA's! and 
not set up to handle collateral)
Rating downgrade is a Termination Event.  (Maybe they'll agree to our posting 
L/C's 
MUST have cross-acceleration (POLICY).
Guess what else?  NO NETTING (can't handle netting internally)

Otherwise, Xerox is cool.

FYI - I faxed latest CSA and correspondence to you for our conference call 
tomorrow.  SS
P.S.  Do you know what the problems are?  I haven't heard a word.

All:

Enron's treasury group is reviewing some of the extremely high volume master 
swap agreements to see if rehypothecation of collateral is an alternative.  
The Bank of America ("BofA") agreement is an ISDA but the credit annex is our 
old format.  BofA has agreed with Bill Bradford to replace the existing Annex 
A (Collateral and Exposure Provisions) with the ISDA Credit Support Annex and 
Paragraph 13.  Soma Ghosh is spearheading this effort and she may contact one 
of you to assist in this effort.  

I told Soma that credit would need to provide a credit worksheeet.

I have attached a credit worksheet per Sara's request in order to amend the B 
of A master.  My understanding is that we intend to only amend the existing 
document for holding and use of collateral so that we may be able to 
rehypothecate collateral.  I have tried to construct the worksheet terms such 
that they reflect what is in the current document, but the old document terms 
should govern in the case of a discrepancy.  I will be out tomorrow, so 
please contact Bill with questions.

Thanks,

Please run the due diligence on Oregon Steel Mills.  We're looking at

Thanks,

We met with OSM and have another meeting scheduled for tomorrow to discuss 
proposed structures hopefully to be followed by specific pricing.  We're 
talking average monthly volumes of 7,300-7,500 MMBTU for approximately 6-8 
months at a price around $10/MMBTU.  I'm sending you this as a "reminder", as 
if and when we're able to agree upon pricing and a proposed structure we'll 
need to "paper" it by weeks end.  At this time we could be going either 
physically or financially.  Thanks,  John

Chris:

There is more and more interest amongst our custoemrs in the West in looking 
at Swaps.  I want to be able to show them how the ISA contract fits together 
with the credit support annex and confirmation letter.  I have built a pro 
forma Cofirrm based on the SoCal Water deal you worked on with me.  Can you 
make a pro forma master and credit support annex so we can fax or e-mail 
these to potential clients so we can try to get their interest and encourage 
them to get contracts and credit in place with us?  I know you are hesitant 
to do this, but it would help our marketing significantly.

Thanks

Initially, we asked that agreements for the various online bond trading sites 
(i.e. Buy Side Direct, Trading Edge, LIMITrader) be executed for both ECT 
Investments and ENA.  However, with the recent reassignment of our existing 
portfolio from ECT Investments to ENA, agreements should only be executed for 
ENA.

Bruce, 
It does not sound like we will be using the Enron Brazil Power Holdings' 
entity any longer to hold these shares.
We will need to know the entity and work with Legal to get the proper 
documentation necessary to open up an account at the prime brokers. 
Sara is legal and we work with her team to open up authorized new accounts.
Thanks for the update.

Bruce Harris@ENRON
12/08/2000 11:31 AM
Robert and Kay, thanks for all your work on getting the shares moved out of 
Brazil and into the parent CayCos.  I understand that by sometime early next 
week the physical ADR certificates will be returned by BONY to the Enron 
vault.  

Here is what we now need to do:

1. We are going to need to send one certificate back to BONY and split it 
into three new certificates.  Two certificates will be for approximately 
1.25M shares each, the balance for about 5M shares.

2. We need to form a new CayCo and sell or otherwise transfer (capital 
split?) the two 1.25M tranches to this NewCo.  This needs to happen next week.

3.  Pending Dan Boyle's structuring efforts and an affirmative Corp. decision 
(supervised by Joe Kishkill), the two existing CayCos which now own the Copel 
shares will be sold into Whitewing Fund.  That means about 12.5M shares will 
go to Whitewing and the certificates will remain in the vault.  This would 
happen last week of the year--if it happens (there are actually about 
15,443,000 total ADRs--I am approximating in this email).

4. The NewCo shares will remain outside this structure entirely. We will need 
to put one tranche of 1.25M into a brokerage account--Sheila at this point we 
will bring you in for assistance (again, hopefully next week).

5. Robert--we need to work out soon with Sheila, Skadden,and BONY to 
establish an efficient mechanism to convert the full 1.25M share certificate 
to unrestricted ADRs absent and prior an immediate buyer(s)--or we need to 
figure out foolproof mechanics for constantly reissuing new certificates for 
every small sale.  We will then be looking for effective points to sell these 
1.25M shares--and again, Joe Kishkill will provide price/volume targets 
(execution via Gary Hickerson's group who has not yet been informed).  In 3 
months time, we will repeat the process for the other 1.25M tranche.  

Robert--please call me so we can determine: (a) how to set up NewCo/transfer 
shares, and (b) how to work the 1.25M "unrestriction" with BONY and Skadden. 

Regards,  Bruce

Sara,
In response to your questions below:

1. Rod Nelson will be handling credit as the deal is now being executed by 
ENA.

2. Tax is being handled by Steve Jacobson in the London office ( he is our US 
tax person )

3. Accounting is Matt Landy

4. The confirmations are being handled by Kim Theriot and John Wilson is the 
trader who will be signing on behalf of ENA. We have a call with them today 
at 3.00pm UK time  so if there is any change I will let you know.

5. We are still waiting for the term sheet / confirms from TD and are 
expecting them this afternoon. I will forward them to you asap.

6. TD have proposed using the 98 ISDA which I believe is already in place 
with ENA and TD Texas.

7. This is just one transaction with 3 individual wti swaps, two of which are 
with Enron, Enron/TD , TD/Morgan Stanley, Morgan Stanley/ Enron

I will send you the transaction diagram from TD and the ISDA agreement.

If there is anything else you need please feel free to call me on 0207 783

later.  Sara

Susan:

The tax rep is fine.  We are following up on the P/A, and Clement should 
respond re:  the guaranty.  Sara

Justin:

I am told by Theresa Brogan that Enron Networks requires an account with one 
of the prime brokers frequently used by ENA and other Enron Corp. 
subsidiaries and that you are handling this particular agreement.  ENA has 
negotiated multiple accounts with Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. and Morgan 
Stanley & Co. International Limited (collectively, "Morgan").  We have an 
agreed form of Customer Agreement with Morgan which has been easy to 
duplicate for additional affiliates of ENA.  Also, we screen all agreements 
through credit and risk control (since our resolutions for opening brokerage 
accounts require dual signatures from both the Enron affiliate and risk 
control).

I don't know what your procedure is in London but let me know if we can be of 
any assistance.  Theresa is holding the docs until I hear back from you.

Thanks.  Sara

Stephanie:

Do we control the drafting?

As you suggested, I have spoken with Tanya re. the Credit Support Annexe, &

Please give me a call if you need anything else. 

Many thanks,

Tanya:

Both ENA (rate) and Enron Corp.(equity forwards)  are seekig master 
agreements with MSCS. Rod prepared a credit worksheet for the ENA agreement 
in June, 2000 and I will fax a copy to you separately.

(1)  With respect to the ENA master, is the ENA credit worksheet still 
current or does it need to be changed?

(2)  With respect to the Enron Corp. master (which will not have a CSA or an 
Enron Corp. guaranty), what cap should we request from Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter & Co.?  Should it be $25MM as requested in the ENA document?

Please let me know.  

I have a question about the ISDA Schedule and several comments to the form of 
confirmation.  To whom should I be speaking?  SS

Can we get the SITA blackline out today?  We should put ENE guaranty in line

Matthew:

Thanks for taking the time to chat this morning.  I am looking for a copy of 
the EnronCredit.com Limited documents so that I can speak with credit in 
Houston and have draft docs for you as soon as possible.

Please forward.  Regards.  Sara 

Further to my message of yesterday evening, I have spoken with the MSCS 
lawyer in London and learned that EnronCredit.com Limited ("ECCL") has 
finalized its ISDA Master Agreement and CSA with MSCS.  ECCL is awaiting the 
ENE guaranty.  The lawyer is forwarding docs to me this morning and I 
understand they were heavily negotiated.

 Tanya, will you be handling credit for both ENA and ENE?  I would like to 
chat with whomever is handling today, if possible.  I will forward ECCL to 
you both when I receive.

Thanks.  Sara

I just received the Instinet amendment to place additional access at Enron 
House.  The "Equipment" is described as follows:

2 Additional Instinet Access ID
   (GYO5, GYO6-OMS) - London, England

Please verify that this is what you need.  I can have this signed immediately.

Sara

Tanya:

I've been meaning to touch base with you about:

  In our form CSA, the Debt Rating Change is triggered ONLY off of S&P.  I 
thought this was a carry-over from ENE's previous split rating.  Does credit 
want to leave the trigger at "below BBB- by S&P" or also add in Moody's?

Thanks.  Sara

Matt and Denis:

I spoke with Matthew Flett about an hour ago and he advised that 
EnronCredit.com Limited had finalized its ISDA.  I requested a copy burt he 
has not yet sent it over.  Both ENE and ENA want to execute masters with MSCS 
and we would like to work from your document.

Can you email me a copy?

Thanks.  Sara

FYI until I get to it!

Dear Sara,

Attached please find our response to the draft Amendment to the CSA
for the above-referenced Agreement.  You will note that I have added
some additional language which our Legal Dept. prefers to include in
Amendments, which I trust will be acceptable to you as well.  As
mentioned briefly over the telephone the other day, I have also
incorporated some changes with respect to Letter of Credit provisions.

The changes to the LC terms are those which our Credit Department is
requiring as a result of a review of Cargill's LC language.  The main
issue is that an LC issued as collateral can no longer be transferable.
I note from the file on our ISDA negotiations that Enron may have
preferred transferability in order to be able to transfer an LC to
its Affiliates.  If this is still the case, we can certainly discuss
options which may specify and limit transferability accordingly.

I look forward to your response at your earliest opportunity.

Holli:

We need to talk about status.
I spoke yesterday with three EWEB lawyers and Dick Varner.
I have to comment back on the Schedule to the master agreement.  EWEB has not 
yet reviewed the Credit Support Annex and needs to submit their proposed 
legal opinion.  EWEB is reserving discussion of the confirmations pending 
resolution of the master agreement.

Most important, however, is the EWEB legal opinion which will be limited by 
the capacity of EWEB's traders to enter into financial trades at any given 
point in time.  EWEB is insisting that we assume the obligation of knowing 
whether an EWEB trader is authorized to act and how that EWEB trader is 
authorized to act under EWEB's trading policy because, under Oregon law (and 
the law of all states), financial trades executed by unauthorized persons 
(employed by governmental entities) are completely void.  

Your two trades (which began as physical deals and were transformed into 
financial deals) were authorized by EWEB's recent board resolution.  However, 
you cannot rely fully on this resolution for future trades.  Before you ever 
trade with EWEB again, you will not be able to rely upon your past 
relationship with an EWEB trader.  You will first have to conduct some due 
diligence with respect to the EWEB trader and the EWEB trading policy.

ENA has never agreed to this type of arrangement.

Let's schedule a time to discuss the agreement further.  Thanks.  Sara 

I understand your concern but negotiating your future position is part of the 
agreement.

As you are aware, we are finalizing the participation of Bank of 
Tokyo-Mitsubishi (BTM) into the Alberta Gas Prepay financing.? 

Recall there are three swaps:

(a) Commodity Swap between Enron Canada and RBC(b) Commodity Swap between 
Chase and RBC(c) Interest Rate Swap between Enron Canada and RBC

We will be participating BTM into the agreements to which Enron is party [(a) 
and (c) above].? As a result of this, Enron will not be re-signing any new 
ISDA's etc.?? However, Section 7 to the ISDA Master agreement governing 
Transfers requires the prior written consent for any transfer of "any 
interest or obligation" under the Agreement.? Our view is that the 
participation to BTM does qualify as a tranfer of an any "interest or 
obligation", ergo we need Enron's consent.? Attached please find a proposed 
Consent from Enron prepared by my lawyer.? This is the only document that we 
require signed by Enron.? Please take note of the key language contained 
therein:

??????? "Enron hereby consents to RBC assigning a 50% participation interest 
in the Swap Documents to Bank of Tokyo-???? ?????? Mitsubishi, Ltd., New York 
Branch; provided that (a) RBC's rights and obligations under the Swap 
Documents shall remain ??????? unchanged, (b) RBC shall remain solely 
responsible to Enron for the performance of such obligations and (c) Enron 
shall ??????? continue to deal solely and directly with RBC in connection 
with RBC's rights and obligations under the Swap Documents."

The commodity swap between Chase and RBC will be "split" and each of RBC and 
BTM will have a Swap with Chase for one-half the amount.

Sara(s), please advise whether you are comfortable with our approach and 
whether you require any changes to the Consent.? BTM has reviewed the 
Participation agreement and is moving forward to getting the doc's approved 
internally...we're targeting for a close mid next week (the week of Dec 11) 
and accordingly your execution of the Consent within that timeframe would be 
much appreciated.? Given that you continue to deal in all ways with RBC, I 
have not forwarded you a copy of the Participation agreement....

Thanks and have a good weekend!

Please see the attached Consent.

Many of you have been involved in recent efforts to either amend documents to 
provide for rehypothecation of securities or additional collateral 
arrangements, both resulting from cash constraints in the market. In that 
regard, it appears that our credit group will be very interested in accepting 
different forms of government obligations, including Treasury Bills, Treasury 
Notes and Treasury Bonds.  Our current version of Paragraph 13 does not have 
the "choice" for Eligible Collateral consisting of longer dated obligations 
such as Treasury Notes and Bonds; our earlier version did provide this 
option.  

LEGAL:  When preparing new master agreements, please be specific about credit 
requests to include securities and verify with credit the specific types of 
Eligible Collateral to be included in Paragraph 13. 

CREDIT:  When drafting credit worksheets, please be  specific when requesting 
types of Eligible Collateral other than cash.

We may consider amending Paragraph 13 again or adding additional forms of 
Eligible Collateral to Library Doc.

Jason,
 Below are the documents that need to be prepared by Enron Networks and 
forwarded to us so we can send them to the prime broker for set up of your 
account.

1. Prime Broker Agreement ( Request from Prime Broker)
2. Limited Partnership Agreement/ Corporate Resolution
3. Form W-9
4. Trading Authorization
5. Authorization to Transfer Funds

I have attached the Form W-9.  The rest of the documents need to be 
coordinated with Sara Shackleton, ENA legal because Enron already has a 
template for the rest.  Enron typically does not fill out the documents sent 
by the primebroker but prepare ones that they have created themselves which 
capture that same requirement.  Also before any trade is executed procedures 
outlined on the document I sent earlier must be followed.  You must be 
cleared by Donna Lowry in Compliance with regards to insider information and 
a signed DASH must be provided to the Equity Trading group before they can 
execute on your behalf.

Theresa

Please call me or schedule time to discuss Bridgeline ("CP").  In particular, 
you should note the following:

(1)  CP requests cross default with US 100 million for ENA and US 20 million 
for itself.
(2)  Change in ownership as default trigger is different from your proposal.
(3)  CP requests US 15 million Enron Corp. guaranty and increases its 
guaranty cap to US 15 million
(4)  Docs to be delivered:  ONLY CP's guarantor to deliver annual 
unaudited/quarterly unaudited consolidated financials 
(5)  Review setoff (elimination of affiliates)
(6)  Review transfer because CP has a proposal for ENA
(7)  Change to collateral thresholds - bilateral US 15 million

Also, I think Susan verified with you that you did not intend to use a 
non-specific MAC (even though the credit worksheet is marked as such).

Marcelo:

Thank you for your response.  Yes, I am still interested in having the two 
questions (mentioned in my email to you) answered.  We have several 
derivative transactions with Chilean parties and I would like to know of 
modifications to both the derivatives memorandum which you prepared for us in 
1997 AND changes to our form of Schedule.  Please let me hear from you at 
your earliest convenience.

Dear Sara,

I was out of the office last week and although I was checking my mail, for
some reason I could not receive yours. I will review my memos and let you
know of any update, unless you tell me that it is not necessary anymore.

Kind regards,

Marcelo

Your summary is correct based on information to date (in this regard the 
agreement between ENA and EEFT still requires amendment in respect of RMT and 
I undertake to get this done). 

However, please note that there have been some last minute changes in the 
Japanese tax advice, received I understand only as of last night. Susan Musch 
will be following up on these changes at a meeting today with Sheila Glover 
and Darren Delage, and has undertaken to keep you appraised of the position. 
The effect of the change would be to permit RMT to be the principal for the 
Japanese FX desk, with a Japanese entity acting as agent to arrange the 
transactions. 

Best regards
Janine

Janine:

With respect to the attached (internal) FX product for EOL, I just wanted to 
verify with you that internal counterparties should transact on EOL with:

(1)  RMT  (as principal for Houston FX desk)

(2)  EEFT as agent for RMT (as principal for London FX desk).  In this 
regard, was the services agreement between ENA and EEFT ever extended to 
include RMT for internal trades? 

(3)  Enron Japan Corp. (as principal for Tokyo FX desk)

There appears to be some confusion since our meeting of November 3.  Thanks.

Just got off the phone with the lawyer.  We have only minor comments and he 
needs to check with his credit people regarding the collateral threshold.  I 
will wait to hear back before sending out a revision.  Sara

We need to pursue now.  SS

Here is the credit worksheet that I had originally sent on 6/28/99.  Susan 
Bailey was working on this file when Argentina put the ISDA on hold.  
They are ready to move forward with this ISDA again.

Sara-

We had started an ISDA with this counterparty that was put on hold, but is 
now back on again.

The main issue was the change in ownership, which should be if AES Corp. 
fails to own 56.33% of Empresa Distribuidora de Energia Norte.

Let me know if there were any other issues with preparing this document.

Thank you,

As we discussed earlier today, Chris Foster is in the process of analyzing 
the economics of the proposed derivative structure to determine indicative 
price,term, etc., and Catalytica is considering whether the structure meets 
its requirements. The attached draft ECT/GE agreement should give you some 
useful background and other details about the transaction. Thanks for your 
assistance.
Sean Black
08/10/99 07:49 PM
Attached is the latest revision of the agreement for your review and comment.

With regards to the Catalytica/Enron agreement, we are still working with 
Catalytica to come to agreement on an acceptable structure for both parties.  
However, the basic agreement as it stands is that we are working on a spark 
spread derivative structure which 'mimics' the macroeconomics of Pastoria as 
much as possible (e.g., 750 MW, local spot PX prices and gas price, etc.) but 
would not have any contractual link to the project.  Under this agreement, we 
would always have the right at any time to buy back the spread for 10 MMUSD, 
or exchange it for the XONON credit if we could not use it at Pastoria or at 
another Enron project.

We are working with the West desk to come up with a indicative price for such 
a spread so we can begin to craft an agreement which we can then pass on for 
your further review and comment.

Keep you posted...

SUBJECT TO LEGAL AND CREDIT APPROVAL (as to a particular transaction), I have 
asked Dale Neuner on the ECT confirmation desk, to please forward to you a 
"suggested format" for a pulp and paper confirmation.  Dale is an invaluable 
resource for these deals.  Not knowing anything further, I am uncertain as to 
whether this transaction will be documented on ECT's "omnibus format" or an 
"ISDA format", so Dale will probably send the omnibus format.  Tanya Rohauer 
is the credit guru.  I will update our review of Brazilian counterparties to 
determine whether we have any legal issues.  I will be in Sao Paulo tomorrow 
afternoon.  Sara

Sara:

We are working with the Pulp and Paper group in Houston on a deal with a 
Brazilian Pulp company to offer a swap to them -paying them fixed prices for

this transaction?

We're still trying to trace the wire.  And Elaine is happy with my new letter 
(so far).  I'll keep you posted.  SS

Are Pat's conclusions accurate?  SS

Sara:

I just spoke with Rolo and he advised the ownership structure of 
Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. (TGS):

70% of TGS is owned by Compania de Inversiones de Energia S.A. (CIESA)
CIESA is owned 50% by Enron and 50% by Perez Companc.
In the corporate workbook the ownership structure of CIESA is outlined.  

The ownership structure of CIESA is somewhat complex and it appears that 
Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A. is the legal entity that owns the 
shares in CIESA.  

I am assuming the best way to structure the event of default is to say if 
Enron Corp. through its wholly-owned subsidiaries no longer owns 50% of CIESA 
and/or if CIESA no longer owns 70% of TGS then, a Change in Ownership Event 
of Default will have occurred.

Please let me know what you think of this.

Regards,

Pat

Pat,

Yetserday we had a meeting with TGS. We agreed to put an MSA in place to 
start hedging LPG. They are very interested in doing business with us, so I 
suggest we go ahead preparing the MSA.
Do you need TGS financial's or you already have them? Do you need anything 
else?

Antonio Felix,

As Enron is finding several opportunities involving financial derivatives in 
Brazil, we would like to get from Tozzini Freire Law Firm a summarized but 
concise read on the "cans and cannots" of these type of transactions in 
Brazil. Here is my understanding of the regulations from the memo you have 
already sent to us regarding swaps and prepays as well as a list of the most 
common examples of deals that Enron would be encountering in the marketplace. 
I would appreciate if you could comment on what is written here and also add 
further information so Enron can have some sort of menu of deals of this 
nature that can be pursued. I would like to ask you to add your comment in 
this same message to make the review process a little easier. Thank you 
inadvance for your attention.

Swaps (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

OTC Swaps

The Central Bank regulates swap transactions involving local financial 
institutions acting either as dealers for their own account or as 
intermediaries to the contracting parties. When the financial institutions 
act as intermediaries, the agreements are in fact private agreements 
negotiated by two non-financial companies, but become subject to the 
requirements and regulations normally applicable to swaps involving financial 
institutions. According to regulations currently in force, such swaps can 
relate to exchange rates, interest rates, gold and price indices.

All of the swap agreements involving financial institutions must be 
registered with CETIP or with another custody and clearing system authorized 
by the Central Bank or the CVM (Brazilian SEC). As a matter of practice, the 
agreements used by the banks that participate in the swap market do not 
follow a standard form, since normally each bank has a particular sample form 
with which it feels more comfortable.

Derivatives
In addition to exchange-traded derivatives and OTC swaps involving financial 
institutions, there is no legal impediment, in principle, to derivatives 
transactions being privately negotiated and entered into between two 
interested parties. As a general rule in Brazil, as long as no specific 
prohibition is found in the law, parties are free to negotiate agreements 
that best suit their interests.

International Hedge 
Central Bank regulations authorize that Brazilian companies enter into 
transactions abroad, either in exchanges or having a financial institution as 
their counterpart, to hedge against the fluctuation of interest rates, 
exchange rates or commodity prices in the international markets. 

Such hedge transactions must refer to payments in foreign currency scheduled 
to be made by or to the Brazilian company in respect of commercial or 
financial rights or obligations, or to payments in local currency arising out 
of certain financial obligations subject to the variation of exchange rates 
and payments relating to imports, exports or local transactions involving 
commodities priced according to their valuation in foreign exchanges. The 
commercial market exchange rates are applicable to foreign exchange 
agreements referring to remittances of currency in connection with hedge 
transactions.

When the underlying obligation/right is registered with the Central Bank, the 
corresponding hedge transaction must be informed to the Central Bank within 
10 days of its execution. When there is no registration with the Central 
Bank, the banks executing the foreign exchange agreements relating to the 
hedge transaction must verify the existence of the obligation/right being 
hedged.

Examples

Commodity swap between two Brazilian companies:
As per what has been said above, there is nothing that precludes Enron Brazil 
of entering into a swap with another Brazilian company regarding any 
commodity traded by Enron (Pulp, Paper, Petrochem products, Power, Gas). 
Enron does not need to be a financial institutions to provide swaps 
transactions. On the other hand, I am not sure yet on the following points: 
(1) Does such swap agreement should be registered with CETIP or any other 
clearing system to be valid under Brazilian regulations? (2) What are the 
taxes involved in a swap?

Commodity swap between a Brazilian company and an offshore company:
This kind of deal seems to be also available in the Brazilian market and the 
only difference from example 1 would be the fact that it must be registered 
with the Central Bank and it would involved transfer of foreign currency.

Commodity swap between two offshore companies but involving Brazilian exports:
I am not sure if Brazilian regulations would have anything to do with a 
transaction like this one. I would assume that a Brazilian exporter would 
sell to their offshore subsidiary and such subsidiary would sell to their end 
customer. Enron would step in and offer a swap agreement for the offshore 
subsidiary of the Brazilian company therefore Enron would not have any 
involvement with Brazilian regulations because it would not be dealing with 
Brazil. 

Prepays (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

The regulations currently in force governing export prepayments, especially 
Central Bank of Brazil's Carta-Circular 2624, of February 14, 1996, establish 
that all repayments of principal under such transactions must necessarily be 
made by means of shipments of the relevant exported goods.  Carta-Circular 
2624 allows cash remittances abroad only in regard to payments of interest 
under the facility.  Therefore, it is not possible to structure a transaction 
where the repayment of principal will be made only in cash or where the 
borrower has the ability to choose between paying cash or exporting the goods.

A transaction that involves structuring a direct loan to the Brazilian 
company where the value of the principal of which would be tied to the price 
of the relevant commodity is very difficult to be approved.  Under a direct 
loan registered with the Central Bank the borrower may remit all due amounts 
of principal and interest in accordance with the schedule of payments 
attached to the certificate of registration. The problem with such 
alternative is that, although there are no express regulations preventing it 
to do so, the Central Bank will most probably not issue a prior authorization 
for such type of loan, as it only normally issues authorizations for normal 
loans where the principal is a fixed amount and the interest rate is either a 
fixed rate or a floating rate (normally based on LIBOR or US Treasury).  It 
should also be noted that generally speaking all interest payments under such 
an agreement are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% p.a.

CC 5 Account

A possible alternative way to structure a prepay would be by using a 
non-registered loan with the Central Bank.  Under such alternative, the funds 
disbursed by Enron under the loan would be remitted to Brazil through an 
international transfer of Brazilian currency, as allowed by Circular 2677 of 
the Central Bank of Brazil. The international transfer of Brazilian currency 
("International Transfer") is a system which uses a non-resident current 
account in Brazil and the Brazilian interbank foreign exchange market to 
effect remittances of funds to and from Brazil.  Under such system, a lender 
that wishes to disburse funds to a Brazilian borrower makes a foreign 
currency deposit with a bank located outside of Brazil ("offshore bank")  and 
instructs the offshore bank to deliver such dollars to a Brazilian bank in 
exchange for Brazilian currency.  Such Brazilian currency is then deposited 
in a non-resident account held by the offshore bank in Brazil and thereafter 
transferred to the borrower. The repayments follow the inverse procedure, 
i.e. the borrower deposits the amount in a non-resident account of an 
offshore bank and instructs it to exchange the funds into foreign currency 
and deliver them to the lender abroad.

The main differences between the registered loans and the non-registered 
loans are that the non-registered loans are not subject to prior approval by 
the Central Bank of Brazil (and therefore not subject to scrutiny as to their 
minimum tenors and applicable interest rates) and the applicable foreign 
exchange rate to non-registered loans is the floating rate (as opposed to the 
commercial rate of exchange). All transfers of funds to Brazil as 
International Transfers are subject to a Financial Transactions Tax ("IOF") 
at the rate of 2% on the amount transferred, plus a bank fee that normally 
ranges from 0.4% to 0.6% of such amount.  Any interest payments under a 
non-registered loan are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% (or 25% 
if the lender is located in a tax-haven jurisdiction).

I don't think this type of transaction is the best way to circumvent some of 
the Brazilian regulations regarding prepayment given the bad press that deals 
via the CC 5 Account mechanism would bring to Enron but I have it addressed 
just in case someone does not share the same opinion. 

Examples

Financial prepay between two Brazilian companies
Not allowed unless the company providing the prepay qualifies as a financial 
institution as per Brazilian law. Since it will not be the case in Enron's 
cases, we should not focus in these kind of transactions.

Financial prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
As it has been mentioned before it is allowed as long as Enron can structure 
the prepay in way where there is a pre-established amortization schedule for 
principal and interest. It is very hard to structure a prepay with specific 
split between principal and interest because the objective of the prepay is 
to lock on a certain volume of a product and not on a specific price. 
Therefore, if Enron prepays for a specific product on a floating basis the 
attached value of that commodity can go up or down as the market fluctuates 
as well as the total value associate to the deal. Such value can be either 
principal or interest and it is impossible to determine what it will be.

Financial prepay between two offshore companies but one being a subsidiary of 
a Brazilian entity
I think there is no restrictions in this case given the whole deal will be 
closed offshore and the Brazilian authorities are not going to be involved. 
It will most likely be a deal involving three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Physical prepay between two Brazilian companies
No restrictions.

Physical prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
No restrictions as long as there is physical deliveries.

Physical prepay between two offshore companies but  involving Brazilian 
exports
No restrictions. It would also involve three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Sara:

I just spoke with Rolo and he advised the ownership structure of 
Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. (TGS):

70% of TGS is owned by Compania de Inversiones de Energia S.A. (CIESA)
CIESA is owned 50% by Enron and 50% by Perez Companc.
In the corporate workbook the ownership structure of CIESA is outlined.  

The ownership structure of CIESA is somewhat complex and it appears that 
Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A. is the legal entity that owns the 
shares in CIESA.  

I am assuming the best way to structure the event of default is to say if 
Enron Corp. through its wholly-owned subsidiaries no longer owns 50% of CIESA 
and/or if CIESA no longer owns 70% of TGS then, a Change in Ownership Event 
of Default will have occurred.

Please let me know what you think of this.

Regards,

Pat

Pat,

Yetserday we had a meeting with TGS. We agreed to put an MSA in place to 
start hedging LPG. They are very interested in doing business with us, so I 
suggest we go ahead preparing the MSA.
Do you need TGS financial's or you already have them? Do you need anything 
else?

Regards,

Rolo

Help me understand HOW MANY Tozzini memoranda exist which address financial 
swaps and derivatives.  I e-mailed Michael about this attachment and I think 
his response was that Antonio Felix ADDED comments to the attachment.  I am 
not clear.  I am aware of only TWO Tozzini memos :  dated 12/26/97 (physical 
trading of energy) and 2/20/98 (local derivatives market).  Let's all start 
from the same point.  Thanks.  Sara

Don Black has suggested we get you in the loop on the below issues we are 
seeking answers on. We have some pending financial transactions that we would 
like to work through all the Brazilian mechanics before proceeding. Your 
primary contact down here for this issue will be Maria Ines Granado. Please 
provide us with your comments as soon as possible so that we do not encounter 
a transactional conflict. 

Gustavo thank you for all your work to date we will keep you briefed to make 
sure we have your input. Please follow up on the Tozzini issue we discussed 
to make a final decision on their input.

Thanks

Antonio Felix,

As Enron is finding several opportunities involving financial derivatives in 
Brazil, we would like to get from Tozzini Freire Law Firm a summarized but 
concise read on the "cans and cannots" of these type of transactions in 
Brazil. Here is my understanding of the regulations from the memo you have 
already sent to us regarding swaps and prepays as well as a list of the most 
common examples of deals that Enron would be encountering in the marketplace. 
I would appreciate if you could comment on what is written here and also add 
further information so Enron can have some sort of menu of deals of this 
nature that can be pursued. I would like to ask you to add your comment in 
this same message to make the review process a little easier. Thank you 
inadvance for your attention.

Swaps (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

OTC Swaps

The Central Bank regulates swap transactions involving local financial 
institutions acting either as dealers for their own account or as 
intermediaries to the contracting parties. When the financial institutions 
act as intermediaries, the agreements are in fact private agreements 
negotiated by two non-financial companies, but become subject to the 
requirements and regulations normally applicable to swaps involving financial 
institutions. According to regulations currently in force, such swaps can 
relate to exchange rates, interest rates, gold and price indices.

All of the swap agreements involving financial institutions must be 
registered with CETIP or with another custody and clearing system authorized 
by the Central Bank or the CVM (Brazilian SEC). As a matter of practice, the 
agreements used by the banks that participate in the swap market do not 
follow a standard form, since normally each bank has a particular sample form 
with which it feels more comfortable.

Derivatives
In addition to exchange-traded derivatives and OTC swaps involving financial 
institutions, there is no legal impediment, in principle, to derivatives 
transactions being privately negotiated and entered into between two 
interested parties. As a general rule in Brazil, as long as no specific 
prohibition is found in the law, parties are free to negotiate agreements 
that best suit their interests.

International Hedge 
Central Bank regulations authorize that Brazilian companies enter into 
transactions abroad, either in exchanges or having a financial institution as 
their counterpart, to hedge against the fluctuation of interest rates, 
exchange rates or commodity prices in the international markets. 

Such hedge transactions must refer to payments in foreign currency scheduled 
to be made by or to the Brazilian company in respect of commercial or 
financial rights or obligations, or to payments in local currency arising out 
of certain financial obligations subject to the variation of exchange rates 
and payments relating to imports, exports or local transactions involving 
commodities priced according to their valuation in foreign exchanges. The 
commercial market exchange rates are applicable to foreign exchange 
agreements referring to remittances of currency in connection with hedge 
transactions.

When the underlying obligation/right is registered with the Central Bank, the 
corresponding hedge transaction must be informed to the Central Bank within 
10 days of its execution. When there is no registration with the Central 
Bank, the banks executing the foreign exchange agreements relating to the 
hedge transaction must verify the existence of the obligation/right being 
hedged.

Examples

Commodity swap between two Brazilian companies:
As per what has been said above, there is nothing that precludes Enron Brazil 
of entering into a swap with another Brazilian company regarding any 
commodity traded by Enron (Pulp, Paper, Petrochem products, Power, Gas). 
Enron does not need to be a financial institutions to provide swaps 
transactions. On the other hand, I am not sure yet on the following points: 
(1) Does such swap agreement should be registered with CETIP or any other 
clearing system to be valid under Brazilian regulations? (2) What are the 
taxes involved in a swap?

Commodity swap between a Brazilian company and an offshore company:
This kind of deal seems to be also available in the Brazilian market and the 
only difference from example 1 would be the fact that it must be registered 
with the Central Bank and it would involved transfer of foreign currency.

Commodity swap between two offshore companies but involving Brazilian exports:
I am not sure if Brazilian regulations would have anything to do with a 
transaction like this one. I would assume that a Brazilian exporter would 
sell to their offshore subsidiary and such subsidiary would sell to their end 
customer. Enron would step in and offer a swap agreement for the offshore 
subsidiary of the Brazilian company therefore Enron would not have any 
involvement with Brazilian regulations because it would not be dealing with 
Brazil. 

Prepays (Pulp & Paper, Petrochem, Power)

The regulations currently in force governing export prepayments, especially 
Central Bank of Brazil's Carta-Circular 2624, of February 14, 1996, establish 
that all repayments of principal under such transactions must necessarily be 
made by means of shipments of the relevant exported goods.  Carta-Circular 
2624 allows cash remittances abroad only in regard to payments of interest 
under the facility.  Therefore, it is not possible to structure a transaction 
where the repayment of principal will be made only in cash or where the 
borrower has the ability to choose between paying cash or exporting the goods.

A transaction that involves structuring a direct loan to the Brazilian 
company where the value of the principal of which would be tied to the price 
of the relevant commodity is very difficult to be approved.  Under a direct 
loan registered with the Central Bank the borrower may remit all due amounts 
of principal and interest in accordance with the schedule of payments 
attached to the certificate of registration. The problem with such 
alternative is that, although there are no express regulations preventing it 
to do so, the Central Bank will most probably not issue a prior authorization 
for such type of loan, as it only normally issues authorizations for normal 
loans where the principal is a fixed amount and the interest rate is either a 
fixed rate or a floating rate (normally based on LIBOR or US Treasury).  It 
should also be noted that generally speaking all interest payments under such 
an agreement are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% p.a.

CC 5 Account

A possible alternative way to structure a prepay would be by using a 
non-registered loan with the Central Bank.  Under such alternative, the funds 
disbursed by Enron under the loan would be remitted to Brazil through an 
international transfer of Brazilian currency, as allowed by Circular 2677 of 
the Central Bank of Brazil. The international transfer of Brazilian currency 
("International Transfer") is a system which uses a non-resident current 
account in Brazil and the Brazilian interbank foreign exchange market to 
effect remittances of funds to and from Brazil.  Under such system, a lender 
that wishes to disburse funds to a Brazilian borrower makes a foreign 
currency deposit with a bank located outside of Brazil ("offshore bank")  and 
instructs the offshore bank to deliver such dollars to a Brazilian bank in 
exchange for Brazilian currency.  Such Brazilian currency is then deposited 
in a non-resident account held by the offshore bank in Brazil and thereafter 
transferred to the borrower. The repayments follow the inverse procedure, 
i.e. the borrower deposits the amount in a non-resident account of an 
offshore bank and instructs it to exchange the funds into foreign currency 
and deliver them to the lender abroad.

The main differences between the registered loans and the non-registered 
loans are that the non-registered loans are not subject to prior approval by 
the Central Bank of Brazil (and therefore not subject to scrutiny as to their 
minimum tenors and applicable interest rates) and the applicable foreign 
exchange rate to non-registered loans is the floating rate (as opposed to the 
commercial rate of exchange). All transfers of funds to Brazil as 
International Transfers are subject to a Financial Transactions Tax ("IOF") 
at the rate of 2% on the amount transferred, plus a bank fee that normally 
ranges from 0.4% to 0.6% of such amount.  Any interest payments under a 
non-registered loan are subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% (or 25% 
if the lender is located in a tax-haven jurisdiction).

I don't think this type of transaction is the best way to circumvent some of 
the Brazilian regulations regarding prepayment given the bad press that deals 
via the CC 5 Account mechanism would bring to Enron but I have it addressed 
just in case someone does not share the same opinion. 

Examples

Financial prepay between two Brazilian companies
Not allowed unless the company providing the prepay qualifies as a financial 
institution as per Brazilian law. Since it will not be the case in Enron's 
cases, we should not focus in these kind of transactions.

Financial prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
As it has been mentioned before it is allowed as long as Enron can structure 
the prepay in way where there is a pre-established amortization schedule for 
principal and interest. It is very hard to structure a prepay with specific 
split between principal and interest because the objective of the prepay is 
to lock on a certain volume of a product and not on a specific price. 
Therefore, if Enron prepays for a specific product on a floating basis the 
attached value of that commodity can go up or down as the market fluctuates 
as well as the total value associate to the deal. Such value can be either 
principal or interest and it is impossible to determine what it will be.

Financial prepay between two offshore companies but one being a subsidiary of 
a Brazilian entity
I think there is no restrictions in this case given the whole deal will be 
closed offshore and the Brazilian authorities are not going to be involved. 
It will most likely be a deal involving three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Physical prepay between two Brazilian companies
No restrictions.

Physical prepay between a Brazilian company and an offshore company
No restrictions as long as there is physical deliveries.

Physical prepay between two offshore companies but  involving Brazilian 
exports
No restrictions. It would also involve three parties: a company in Brazil, 
its offshore subsidiary and Enron.

Thanks,

Gustavo

 During   the  construction of the clerical area the clerks will do their 
best to continue to function in a normal manner.  The fax machines will be 
located in EB3837A  (cubicle area in front of Suzanne Adams).    There should 
be no interruptions in the fax lines per the Telephony Services.  Office 
supplies will also be boxed and stored in various areas throughout the 
floor.  There will be 2  phones  and computers available to the clerks.  
Reginald will be located at EB3808B x39288 and Tim and Kenneth will be 
located at EB3808B x31459.

 This may  cause time delays on various functions of the clerks:

Faxes being sent, received, copied and delivered in a timely manner;
ASAP deliveries/pickups/courier outgoing/incoming/scheduled and unscheduled 
daily runs to Allen Center;
Telephone accessibility will be limited;
Space preparation for large ASAP copy jobs;
Availability of clerks when needed;
Accessibility/ordering of office supplies; 
Mail being sorted and distributed in a timely manner.

 This will begin today Wednesday,  August 24th, and probably will not be 
finished until Wednesday,  September 1st.   We apologize for  any  
inconvenience this may cause. 

Attached is the first report identifying financial master trading agreements 
generated by ECT's derivatives legal group.  This report will be updated and 
distributed weekly.  It only reflects documentation originated by Houston's 
legal department and the status of negotiations.  If you have any questions, 
please call me at 713/853-5620 or e-mail.  Thanks.  Sara

Under separate cover, I am faxing to you a copy of a "Table of Contents" for 
a collection of memoranda on various Brazilian issues (physical trading, 
derivatives, tax, etc. which I have copies of.  I have also received from you 
this morning the response of Antonio Felix et al to the inquiry of Gustavo 
Junqueira.  It will become increasingly difficult to monitor our progress 
with the Tozzini firm if the business people have direct contact with Tozzini 
and bypass the Enron lawyers.  We will not be able to compile a comprehensive 
review and the requests will become disorganized.  Requests for legal 
research by Tozzini should originate with the Enron lawyers and be addressed 
to the Enron lawyers.  We can then discuss conclusions with our business 
people (and even meet together with Tozzini).  I hope that you concur with 
this procedure.  If you do, I think that it would be more appropriate for you 
to contact the Tozzini firm to convey the message (and also to our business 
people).

Please call me when you are back in the Sao Paulo office if you have any 
questions.

P.S.  I will prepare for you the "mini-book" containing the memoranda 
referenced above.

    

I would only solicit their comments on other "projects".  SS

Just got off the phone with the lawyer.  We have only minor comments and he 
needs to check with his credit people regarding the collateral threshold.  I 
will wait to hear back before sending out a revision.  Sara

Please call me at the office (713/853-5620) if you are still around.  
Otherwise, let's plan to speak with Richard Sanders(litigation)  first thing 
on Friday morning.  I have spoken with Julian.  Sara  

I have spoke to Jeff Harbert about the use of "Fallback Reference Price" in 
the confirms and the need for an additional provision addressing 
"Postponement" (which will override our defintion of Postponement in the 
Master Agreement).  Please take note of this in preparing new confirms.  I 
have appropriate language.  Please call if you have any questions.  Sara

We will e-mail or fax directly to you and then you can fax to TGS.  Susan 
Bailey will send.  Sara

Sara,

Are you going to send this directly to the customer or you will fax it to me 
and then I will have to send it to the customer?

Thanks,

Per our  conversation of date, attached is ECT's most recent version of the 
ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex designed for use with Argentine 
counterparties.  As we discussed, I would like for you to review this format 
and determine whether changes are required as a result of legal developments 
in Argentina.  Please call me when you have had an opportunity to review the 
document.  We have had sent out several recent drafts using the attached 
format.  Also, any written materials which might prove useful are always 
greatly appreciated.  Thanks.  Sara

P.S.  I will try to schedule some time when I am in the B.A. office.

Do you have her e-mail address?  I spoke with her earlier and wrote down " 
pla@marvel.com.ar ".  That address doesn't work.  Thanks.  SS

Via fax, I am sending to you the new and old Annex A forms and a variety of 
new and old option (cap,floor, call,put,collar) formats.  Per our earlier 
conversation, I would truly appreciate your input.  The fax is about 40 
pages.  Sara

Sara,

I hope you have now received instructions from your commercial swaps team to 
put together an ISDA  currency swap and confirm which ECT Corp will be 
providing to either Enron Europe Power 3 Limited or a subsidiary of that 
company. The subsidiary will be receiving dollars under a bond issue and 
paying pounds out (a spot transaction I believe) but will then receive pounds 
income which it will need to convert to dollars to pay interest on the bonds.

The precedent document is the Sutton Bridge currency swap.

Can you please confirm you have been instructed and let us know your timing 
for issuing a document.  The sooner we can see this next week the better.

The bond trustee will as usual require the swap to be backed with legal 
opinions from Enron in-house counsel (Mark Haedicke) re due execution and 
from V&E (Terry Yates) re enforceability. My understanding is that the swap 
will not be guaranteed by Corp (correct Julian?).

Linklaters are representing Enron - Julian Davies and Fran Xavier (tel: 171 
456 2000). Could you please send them your fax, telephone and email details. 
Linklaters have kindly agreed to prepare a first draft of the Mark Haedicke 
opinion and to send it out to you Sara.

Thank  you. I look forward to hearing from you.

     Mark

 

Hey, Carson!  Sorry to hear about you and Melissa but I know that life can 
always get better (if you let it).  
I've finally finished my two-year project of replacing most of my landscaping 
with "native plants."  Of course, I'm rarely home to enjoy them but 
everything looks great on the weekends.

I'm dying under a load of work here but I know better than to complain too 
much.

GO ROCKETS!

I understand that you spoke with Mark Taylor about eliminating references to 
individuals in confirms.  I need to speak with you about the ISDA, omnibus 
and industrial master templates under revision and whether the drafted 
language conforms to your proposal.  In that regard, you may recall that swap 
templates were given to you several months ago.  The legal group is 
concluding a massive form review which necessitates confirm changes.  
Thanks.  Sara

In Part C. Financial Swaps of your report, please clarify two "preparing 
Master Swap" entries:

(1) is "Edes" meant to be "Eden", each LDC activity?

(2)  What is "CGC"?

The "under discussion" entries are unknown to us:

(1)  Piedra del Aguila
(2)  PDA
(3)  Wintershall
(4)  Quintana
(5)  Minera Alumbrera
(6)  PAE

Thanks.  Sara

Marie will verify this information first thing in the a.m.:

The Duke master is dated August 16, 1999.  It was sent for execution (to 
Carol Graebner in Houston) on August 18, 1999.  I cannot verify whether 
execution copies have been received by ECT.  Sara

Thanks.  When you have Annex A ready, we'll have to tweak Annex B.  For 
example, I think we eliminated the term "Derivative Transactions" in Annex A 
(but it shows up in the Catalytica Annex B).  Bart Clark is the lawyer who is 
asking to receive the two annexes.

   

Attached is the Annex B for Catalytica.

Please take a look at the proposed language.  You will need to consider the 
time period before which a Market Disruption Event will kick in.:

Postponement:  For the purposes of the definition of "Price Source 
Disruption," as set forth in Section 7.4(c)(i) of the Commodity Definitions,
   the Maximum Days of Disruption shall be [thirty-two/sixty-four] days after 
the last date of publication of World Pulp Monthly,
   or any successor publication, published by Resource Information Systems, 
Inc. or its successor for the applicable 
   Calculation Period.

The meeting is on our calendars for 9:30 am 9/3/99.  Let's talk about the 
NYMEX hedge exemption/position limits process and the reasons why you need 
attorney backup when Mark is unavailable.  Also, highlighting specific NYMEX 
rules and regulations/Enron trading policy issues for me would be helpful.  I 
am only looking for broad oversight.  We can meet with Mark when he returns 
(and have Taffy put us on Mark's calendar). Thanks.  Sara

   

If possible, can we hold this meeting until Mark gets back.  I think Mark's 
input is the most important.

Please schedule a meeting with Tana (at her convenience) to discuss NYMEX 
hedge exemption and related issues.  Thanks.  SS 

Need to know value of dispute.  

I need to review the outstanding omnibus confirm for this paper/pulp 
counterparty.  I believe there is only one live trade.  Thanks.  SS

Under "Legal Issues ...", the fourth bullet point:  capitalize the words 
"Exemption" and "Eligible Swap Participant".

I'll be in the office for the next few days if something comes up.

I am still trying to resolve the question of who will advise you on the 
consulting and other agreements.  In the meantime, I have attached a form 
which you can use to create a report for your group.  This would be quite 
helpful to the lawyers in staffing the group more efficiently.  SS

Per our conversation, please advise of available dates.  We would like to 
schedule as soon as possible.  Thanks.  SS

please respond to my voice mail - ss

   

Here are the next four descriptions.  Per Awais's message below, he is still 
trying to get these by today.  I know it is a little late....let me know if 
this will be an issue.  Please give me your comments so I can coordinate 
responses.  Thanks!

Sorry for the delay.

Here are the next four descriptions.

Only the three liquids one waiting now.

I have sent these to David Forster in our Project group to review first 
before I send them to yourself.  If I don't get them back today I will send 
them over the weekend so they are there for you on Monday.

Could you please send me comments back on all the other descriptions today.  
Is your fax machine at your end OK?  It's just that the other fax you sent 
came through a dark background making the comments a little hard to read.

My fax is 44 171 316 5420.

Awais

   

Awais,

I have forwarded the descriptions you have sent us thus far to the respective 
Legal Trading Lawyers to sign off as far any legal issues we may have with 
the descriptions.  I understand your deadline is the end of the week.

When can I expect the remaining descriptions?

Please review the attached "paper & pulp" doc for accuracy.  I've already 
marked the doc for accuracy (as far as I can tell) but I don't know if the 
general statements are accurate.  Please coordinate through Tana Jones.  I do 
not know who wrote the document, but I presume it was someone in London.  Sara

Mark Taylor has asked me to forward the attached email to each of you.  Per 
Mark's direction and the email, we need to sign off, from a Legal (not 
business) perspective only, on the attached descriptions of the 12 product 
areas to be traded online.  So far we have only received 5 of the referenced 
12 descriptions.  I will forward the additional descriptions to the relevant 
Legal group when I receive them.  Per the attached email, Awais needs our 
Legal sign off by Friday.

I understand Alan may be out for the rest of the week so the attached 
descriptions on Coal, SO2 and NOX will need to be approved by someone else in 
his group.  I'm not sure who that would be.  Could you let me know?  Mark 
asked if Shari and Sara could sign off on the weather and pulp & paper 
description for our group.

Thanks for your help!

Tana,

I am afraid there is more than one description.  Some are quite lengthy,  US 
West Power (11 Pages) and US Natural Gas (5 pages).  There is a quite urgent 
deadline to get these uploaded into the web pages and then integrated into 
the site by the end of this week.  So any comments you can provide ASAP would 
be much appreciated.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to phone, or email me.  Tel 
no: 44 171 970 7377.

Thanks

Steven & Carol,

I am working for Louise Kitchen on the EnronOnline project.  As part of the 
site we are incorporating market descriptions of all the main market that we 
will be trading on the system to give users some general information.

I have collected and rewritten these into a standard format and am currently 
in the process of obtaining Legal and regulatory approval of these 
descriptions that will be visible to anyone on the web.

In Total there are 12 descriptions covering North Amercia.  These are listed 
below.

Canada Gas
LPG
NOx Emissions
Oil & Oil products
Plastics and Petrochemicals
Pulp & Paper
SO2 Emissions
US Coal
US Natural Gas
US East Power
US West Power
Weather Derivatives

I have below the completed descriptions to date.  Please could you pass to 
the respective people in your groups for their review and comments.  I would 
appreciate it if you could provide your comments as soonas possible as these 
have to be approved and loaded into the web site this week.  

Below are 5 of the descriptions.  I shall send the remainder to yourselves 
tomorrow.

If you have any questions my telephone number in London is  44 171 970 7377.

Thanks

Awais

I am planning to travel to Argentina and Brazil in the next 10 days.  Will 
you be able to provide me with your written comments on the draft ISDA 
Schedule by September 10?  Also, will you be in the BA office during the 
period from September 13 through 25?  I will schedule a meeting with you as I 
finalize plans.  

Enron's office will be closed on Monday, September 6.  I look forward to 
hearing from you after that date.  Regards.  Sara   

Thank you for your earlier response.  Enron's offices will be closed on 
Monday, September 6 and I understand that your office will be closed on 
Tuesday, September 7.  Will you be available for a conference call on 
Wednesday, September 8?  I would like to discuss generally the financial 
trading issues which I will need to address.  I look forward to hearing from 
you.  Regards.  Sara

Look's like Argentina is shaping up!  Sara

Sara:

You will have our comments on the ISDA before Sept 10.  In fact not much has
changed  at the documentation level.

I would be most pleased to meet with you.  Should you have time let's also
squeeze a lunch or a diner in your busy agenda.

Best regards

Patricia

 In regards to this trade, I talked with the trader, Randy Degner, about 
their confirmation.  He is in agreement on using our omnibus confirm since 
their confirmation was incorrect as far as referencing a Master Agreement .  
He would like to see if someone can speak with JoAnn Goza (316) 828-7169 in 
their Wichita office to establish a Master Agreement between KCI and ECT.

Thanks

selected. SS

(1)  I can confirm that the swap group has no financial (or physical) info on 
Bolivia.  You may want to check with Alan on the existence of any specific 
physical reviews on Bolivia. 

(2)  Do you have some time to discuss the omnibus confirm process?

(3)  Have you heard further of Duke? 

Our internal phone and voice mail system is all screwed up.  Is 3pm Houston 
(5pm BA) today too late for you to discuss omnibus?
I haven't heard a word from Richard.  Scott Neal left a message about the 
Friday letter.
Also, Bruce Harris called this morning about the issue of Elektro trading 
(Hickerson desk).  I am hoping that Antonio Felix can talk to me sometime on 
Wednesday.  He's then out for the rest of the week.  Coordination is getting 
complicated.  I'm supposed to get my visa today (so I can leave anytime).  
Talk to you soon.  SS

Sara, I can't get through to you on the phone.  I have tried two different

Spoke with Joe Manogue this morning. He has been speaking to their external 
council (S&S) daily trying to get a lined draft of the document with all 
changes. He was supposed to get it last Friday, is now promised it this 
morning. He plans to review and fax it out to you this afternoon, following 
up with a hard copy by Fedex overnight. He's doing all he can to speed the 
process along. I'll call you when I hear more from him. Per

I'll originate the call.  Also, I'd like discuss immediate trading objectives 
since I'm planning a trip down south in a few days and can be on the front 
end.  SS

London traders are transacting from London in the names of both ECT(Houston) 
and ECTRIC(London) with DAPSA and Sempra.  The deal tickets are still being 
sent to Houston for confirmation preparation (rather than from London where 
the trade is actually consummated).  With respect to Sempra, we were 
previously advised that Sempra would not transact directly with ECTRIC absent 
a Master but this cannot be accurate because some Sempra deal tickets recite 
ECTRIC's name.    

This message is FYI if there are no regulatory issues involved.

Houston will certainly document back-to-back internal transactions.

Please call to discuss.  SS

Just got the fax

   
	
	

Joseph Manogue at Tiger called me last night to say he had finally reviewed 
the draft ISDA doc with all agreed changes put in and lined from original. He 
faxed it to you and will have the original Fedexed overnight. Hope you'll 
have time to review it today.

S&S has again asked about the gtee and l/c wording. They do not have anything 
from us in writing confirming the agreed changes. Joe asked that you fax the 
revised gtee wording that has been agreed (I believe it was our agreeing to 
reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5) and the new l/c wording 
(drops the 2 day period to replace an l/c with a different bank if the first 
refuses to pay). I know we talked about these issues earlier, but Tiger's 
lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be 
issued for signing, even if we are the one's issuing the gtee and l/c.

Thanks! Call if you have questions or if I can be of any help. There is an 
outside chance we could have everything set to go this week.

With best regards,
Per

I'll call you at 3pm BA to discuss omnibus.  Then we'll break and I'll dash 
over to meet with both Lynn Aven and Rick Hopkinson at Allen Center and we'll 
call you back to discuss tax etc.  SS

Dan:  please see if the attached draft works.  My extension is 35620.  Sara

I would like the credit group to respond to the following:

1.  What person in credit is the initial contact for the preparation of 
credit worksheets for structured transactions?  How can we insure that the 
process will run smoothly?

2.  Can we (credit and legal) schedule a meeting with a trader to walk 
through the actual termination amout calculation process?

3.  With respect to L/C's, does credit review incoming L/C's for content?  If 
not, we need to establish a procedure?

The Alley is NOT holding any tickets for me.  All I want to know is whether 
"McKeogh" at "713-664-3207" has a ticket for a performance on Friday, March 3 
since I do not have the tickets in front of me.  They should be able to tell 
you or just email the Box Office phone number to me. Also, I can't do 
anything about flights until I return to Houston on Monday.  Thanks.  SS

I've called the Alley Theatre.  They wanted to know when the tickets were 
purchased, if they were purchased with a credit card, was a confirmation 
number given at the end of the transaction and were they for Hay Fever?  
Since I didn't know the answer to any of his questions, I said "Can you just 
check to see if there are any tickets waiting to be picked up for McKeogh".  
He said there were not any tickets to be picked up for McKeogh for Hay Fever 
on March 3.  He acted like there is more than one production being done.

Thank you for the message!  Let's schedule the following:
(1)  Phone call on Thursday, Sept. 16 to discuss parameters for financial 
trading discussion.  I can call you at 1 pm (Houston time) which is 3 pm (Sao 
Paulo time).

(2)  Meeting in Enron's Sao Paulo office on Tuesday, Sept. 21 in the

9 am?

I will not need to call you today if we can schedule our conference call and 
meeting in Sao Paulo via e-mail.  Thank you for responding promptly.

Dear Sara:

We can meet either on the 21 or 22.  As to our prior telephone call, please

Sara,
Stewart needs help with yet another ISDA situation.  It's gotten to the point 
where he's such an ISDA advocate that we are going to have to consider 
nominating him for Legal's prestigious  "Best With Legal Paper"  annual 
award.  Let me know if I can help in any way with this.--cgy 

Stewart,

Sorry this has taken so long, however we have a copy of a draft ISDA that
our legal folks have developed. I would appreciate Enron's comments
regarding this, so if you could, please pass this on to the appropriate
people and get back to me.  Thanks.

How about 2 pm on Thursday, Sept. 23 in your office?  Please let me know.  
Regards.  Sara

MEeting on the 23rd at your convenience is fine.  24th would be OK also in
the afternoon.

You should have received a fax with the comments on the ISDA. I will fax the
article.  Surprisingly enough it was on word, so you should have been able
to open it.
Best regards.

I'll be flying to Buenos Aires Wednesday evening.  I hope you'll be in the

Sara, would you please confirm that the additional changes being requested 
are consistent with the Enron Corp. Guaranty for the ISDA Swap Agreement?
j.nassos@pecorp.com on 09/14/99 05:52:53 PM
Sheila -

Attached are my comments to the Enron Corp. Guaranty.  The form you prepared
did not include the revisions proposed in the last round of ISDA Guaranty
negotiations which were agreed to by Sara Shackleton, and I have added them
in the attached marked draft.

Also, you will note that in our earlier discussions last week North Shore
Gas contracts were not addressed, and I have attempted to do so here.

We are still looking at the issue of whether specific designation of the New
York "Commercial Division" for state courts is acceptable, and expect to
have an answer tomorrow morning.  Also, I have added some additional
language more typical of an exclusive jurisdiction clause generally.

No one else at Peoples has seen these comments, so they remain subject to
further change.

Pleae call me if you wish to discuss (312-240-4413).

Market News

Equity markets were lower across the board amid fears of higher
inflation today.  The U.S.  Department of Labor reported that April's
Consumer Price Index (CPI) was up .7%, its largest gain since October
of 1990.  That news led to a market sell-off, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average closing down 193.87 (-1.75%) to 10913.32, the S&P
500 falling 29.76 (-2.18%) to 1337.8, and the Nasdaq dropping 54.14
(-2.10%) to 2527.86.  The 30 year bond was up .17 to 5.911.

Financial stocks were hit hard today.  JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) slid 5
13/16 to 140 15/16, American Express (NYSE:AXP) dropped 4 to 120 3/4,
and Citigroup (NYSE:C) fell 2 7/16 to 71.  Tech bellwethers were also
lower, with America Online (NYSE:AOL) down 6 3/4 to 125 7/8 and Intel
Corp.  (Nasdaq:INTC) down 2 1/16 to 58.

AtHome (Nasdaq:ATHM) withstood the market slide and closed up 13/16 to
150 1/8 and was as high as 156 1/2 Friday.  The Wall Street Journal
reported that Microsoft (Nasdaq:MSFT) will contribute about $5 million
to AtHome Solutions, a private venture that helps smaller cable
companies bring internet access to their users.  Microsoft lost 2 1/4
and closed at 76 7/8.

Go2Net (Nasdaq:GNET) was up 2 1/8 to 127 3/16 after announcing that it
will purchase IQC.com, an equity tracking service, for $20 million in
stock.  Go2Net said that it plans to integrate IQC's content into its
Silicon Investor web site.

reassured analysts at a meeting yesterday; Prudential Securities
upgraded the database company from accumulate to strong buy.

Dell Computer (Nasdaq:DELL) slid 4.77% (down 2 1/16) to 41 3/16 after
Paine Webber downgraded the direct computer maker to neutral from
attractive.  Dell reports earnings next Tuesday after the closing
bell; the First Call consensus estimate is 16 cents per share.

Motorola (NYSE:MOT) fell 3.07% (down 2 5/8) to 82 7/8 even after an
upgrade from BT Alex.  Brown from buy to strong buy, along with a
12-month price target of $100.

ING Baring initiated coverage on Micron Technology (NYSE:MU) with a
hold rating, saying that manufacturing costs may not decline quickly
enough to keep pace with declining DRAM prices.  Micron was off 5/8 to
36 15/16.

On the data networking front, shares of 3Com (Nasdaq:COMS) were up
7.29% (up 1 15/16) to 28 1/2 on speculation that the company may be
purchased by either Lucent Technologies (NYSE:LU) or Ericsson
(Nasdaq:ERICY).  Lucent was off 2 9/16 to 58 7/16; Ericsson was off 1
3/16 to 26 7/8.  3Com's competitor Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO) fell 2
1/4 to 115 7/16.

purchasing, is supportive of the merger.  Frontier closed down 4.67%
(down 2 3/4) to 56 1/8.

IPO News

Despite the heavy new issue supply and weak market conditions,
internet IPOs continue to outperform.  Investors continue to bid up
shares of well-known brand names, first movers, and any high-speed
internet related issues.  Both Nextcard (Nasdaq:NXCD), which offers
online credit cards, and Copper Mountain (Nasdaq:CMTN), which provides
high-speed internet connections, performed well on their first trading
days.  In contrast, Intelligent Life, which provides financial content
through its website Bankrate.com, failed to impress investors, closing
its first trading day unchanged from its offering price.  Apparently,
investors were not aware of Intelligent Life's internet business due
to the lack of media coverage or a ".com" in its name.

I have scheduled a conference call with Antonio Felix on Thursday Sept  16 at 
3pm Sao Paulo time.  I am initiating the call.  I will discuss the types of 
products which the Enron "family" is primarily interested in analyzing with 
respect to legality (in general), taxation, type of entity appropriate for 
conducting business and procedure for implementation.  I hope to narrow the 
focus of the legal review, identify other issues and will ask that legal fees 
be broken out by product.  On Tuesday, Sept 21, I will meet with Antonio 
Felix at Enron's offices in Sao Paulo at 9 am.  Everyone is welcome to join 
me for both the conference call and meeting in Sao Paulo.  Please let me know 
if you would like to participate.  Thanks.  Sara  

I will call you at 3 pm (Houston time) which is 5 pm (Sao Paulo time).   
Please confirm.  Regards.  Sara

This call has been changed to 3 pm (Houston time) which is 5 pm (Sao Paulo 
time).  Please let me know if you would like for me to conference you in.  
Sara

I will initiate the call and I will also conference in Andrea Bertone.  
Attached is a short list illustrating the types of financial products about  
which our commercial people are inquiring.  My goal is to discuss parameters 
for further legal/tax research required to assist Enron in deciding how to 
trade these products.  I look forward to our conversation.  Sara

Have you decided who will be assisting tax-wise for these two countries?

I have a conference call this afternoon at 3 pm (Houston time) with Antonio 
Felix de Araujo Cintra from the Tozzini firm regarding further research on 
derivative products for trading in Brazil.  Attached is a summary of products 
and the various Enron groups seeking answers.  If you would like to 
participate in person or by conference, please let me know.

I will be in Sao Paulo from Sept 20-22 and Buenos Aires from Sept 23-24.  In

I am forwarding to you guidelines prepared for global products trading.  It's 
a good starting point.  I am currently working on guidelines for Argentina 
which will address both physical and financial trading.  Other "guidelines" 
exist in limited form for the remote offices in Singapore and Australia.  I 
am checking on London.
I'm not exactly certain as to what you are looking for.  Obviously the 
foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the US (although LA. is 
about as close as you can get to a third world country).  One thing that 
doesn't show up in the attachment is the swap eligibility issue.   Let me 
know how I can help further.  Sara

Here it is -- we printed this 2-sided and laminated it.  Becky will bring you

shortly.
	
	

Joseph Manogue at Tiger called me last night to say he had finally reviewed 
the draft ISDA doc with all agreed changes put in and lined from original. He 
faxed it to you and will have the original Fedexed overnight. Hope you'll 
have time to review it today.

S&S has again asked about the gtee and l/c wording. They do not have anything 
from us in writing confirming the agreed changes. Joe asked that you fax the 
revised gtee wording that has been agreed (I believe it was our agreeing to 
reduce the claim period from 15 days down to 5) and the new l/c wording 
(drops the 2 day period to replace an l/c with a different bank if the first 
refuses to pay). I know we talked about these issues earlier, but Tiger's 
lawyers want to get everything agreed in writing now so final docs can be 
issued for signing, even if we are the one's issuing the gtee and l/c.

Thanks! Call if you have questions or if I can be of any help. There is an 
outside chance we could have everything set to go this week.

With best regards,
Per

Hi back!  and Happy New Year too!  To what do I owe this small pleasure?  I'm 
fine in Texas, still hanging out with Phoebe and Chloe, working hard, etc.  
Where are you living these days?  N.O.?  Atlanta?  Memphis?  Eleuthra?  St. 
Petersburg?  Amelia Island Plantation?  I've simply lost track!  As for me, 
well, I lead the simple life, own a little house in West University, own a 
little car (I had to buy a new one recently - the 14-year old 380 SE started 
scaring me a bit), you know, the usual.  Are you selling burgers up and down 
the east coast?  Have you gone international?  In a new franchise business?  
How's your family?  
 
Got to get back to work!  This weekend I'm off to Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires 
on business.  SARA

Mark, I mentioned this problem several weeks ago.  Did you ever respond to 
Willie's most recent inquiry?  Sara

To  maintain  a  more  accurate  record  of  deal  statuses,  I  have  been  
instructed  by  my  manager,  Jeff Sorenson  to
  have  the  Confirm  Center  to  execute  Ominibus  confirmations  returned  
to  us  without  the  attachments, (mainly  the  
  Annex  A).  These  deals  have  all  been  matched-up  and  signed  
satisfactorily  by  the  counterparties,  except  that 
  the  attachments  were  not  returned  with  the  executed  confirmations.  
Legal  will  continue  to    address  this  issue
  until  resolved,  when  time  permits,  for  my  request  for  a  letter  
of  approval  of  a  new  policy  making  the  return  of
  most  common  attachments  unnecessary.  However,  unless  otherwise  
instructed ,  we    will    be    executing    these 
  confirms  without  the  attachments  effective  immediately  5/9/99.

  PS:  I  will  be  out  on  Monday  and  Friday,  5/10/99  and  5/14/99;  
please  contact  Mary  Gosnell  @  3-1727  or
           Jefferson D Sorenson  @  3-5294   with  any   questions  or  
comments.  Thanks!

Sara- I'm disappointed that you described hearing from me as only a "small
pleasure" since I've always heard that size DOES matter. Do you disagree? I
am living in Atlanta ( very calmly as compared to Livin La Vida Loca as you
are. Leica is doing wonderfully and is still a great dog. I still have the
Corky's in New Orleans and 13 Wendy's in Florida with John Casey as my
partner. What kind of new car did you get? I'll show you mine if you'll show
me yours! My Mom is doing fine. Jill has been married for about 3 years,
Richard is doing his residency and getting married in Cleveland next month,
and Karen is a dietician ( those are Beverly's kids, in case you've
forgotten). Bev is dating a guy for several years and Helen is divorced and
living alone ( I hope) in Pensacola. How is your entire family? Why didn't
you invite me to S.America with you? Forget the lame excuse and just invite
me on the next trip-like the usual family trip at year-end!! Call if you can
be nice to me and come visit me or invite me to visit you!   Sam

I'm going blind.  Where's the attachment?  ss

   

Attached is a new term sheet with further changes.

Please review and give feedback.

I would like to close the books on this as soon as possible.  We have a 
request to issue "something" for a 7 year linerboard transaction as soon as 
possible.

Thanks,

JH.

FYI
Gary and Joe,

We should probably have a conference call sometime next week to discuss how 
we want to proceed on the financial derivatives/trading side.  I have  a 
number of concerns which I share here.

First, we do not have a tax-efficient entity in which to trade.  If we set up 
a Brazilian limitada solely for the purpose of trading, and we lose money, we 
will generate Brazil tax credits.  Enron already has at least $25M of these 
credits and I think we want to try to limit the possibility of generating 
additional credits going forward.  In addition, there is a possibility that 
Enron Corp. may begin limiting the utilization of these credits, so one might 
end up with minimal tax benefit if there was a loss (creating an asymetrical 
trading payoff).  I was hoping we could trade out of Elektro, but Lynn 
informs me that any gains in Elektro will be subject to both US and Brazil 
taxation.

Second, to the extent that we do take tax risk in a limitada, we still need 
to fund (and possibly) guarantee the limitada.  Currently, the only way to 
fund the limitada without being exposed to a whole host of tax/FX issues is 
through equity.  However, equity is difficult to repatriate (it would be 
repatriated probably only as far as Cayman for tax reasons) and we are 
subject to convertibility risk.  In addition, earnings in the company could 
most likely only be repatriated via shareholder loans (dividends would be 
subject to US tax), meaning that the cash would have to come back into Brazil 
when the loan expired (and then it would be sent back out if there was no 
convertibility event).

Third, trading stocks on the Bovespa may create Chinese Wall issues with 
regards to our ongoing M&A and Financing activities.  In all likelihood, one 
would be trading energy/telecom stocks.  Those companies are also the ones 
with which the ESA origination teams are trying to do business.  We might be 
able to create a Chinese Wall, but given the size of the ESA office (not big) 
and the limited scope of our intended trading operation, we have to consider 
whether it is worth potnetially limiting those core activities to spec. trade 
(or consider what cost would be incurred to ceate a Chinese Wall).  

The other two products--money markets and futures--can be traded (albeit in a 
more limited fashion) offshore.   Because money market instruments can't be 
shorted locally, they are really just passive investment vehicles (like a 
bank CD) off of which one trades the interest rate via swaps.  That is, you 
are shortening or lengthening your investment horizon based on one's 
expectation of rates and continually earning either a higher or lower carry 
than market.  Most of this type of trading can be done offshore through 
credit-linked notes (including R$ CDI, R$ prefixed and USD fixed) and 
short-term Brazil Bradys.  Currency futures of course can be traded via NDFs.

In sum, I think we need to better define the type of trades we will do and 
where we are going to do those trades.  My hope is that we can define a 
couple of products/ideas we want to implement now and then figure out in 
which entity to house that activity.  

I will try to set up a conference call for next week on this topic.   

Regards,  Bruce

I'll be glad to help you out from Enron's remote offices and while in Houston 
during the week of Sept. 27 - Oct.1.  Please note the following:

1.  I'll be in Enron's Sao Paulo and BA offices from Sept 20 - Sept. 24   AND

Hi Sara,

How are things with you, m'dear?  Have you any exotic destinations planned 
for this year's vacation?

Anyway - I'm planning to go on vacation with my family (yah - it's weird to 
say "family" now!)  to Perth from Thursday 23 September through to Saturday 3 
October and was wondering whether you could help 'babysit' the Petron 
matter.  Janice had mentioned that you'd done some due diligence on ISDA in 
the Philippines a year or so ago so I thought that you would probably be the 
most appropriate person to look after this matter in my absence.  Matt, who 
is a new attorney who joined us in the Singapore office last week, will also 
be keeping track of this file but he hasn't been fully 'Enronized' by Tana as 
yet (tho' he will be so before Thanksgiving as he'll be headed to Houston 
next month for a month's stint there) so I thought it best if you could be 
the main contact person for Petron as well as for our business folks during 
that week that I'm not around.  I really hope that you don't mind.

Assuming that you're OK with this, I would like to give your name and contact 
details to the Enron AP/A/CHI biz folks who are handling this - Manuel 
Gallego in the Philippines, Victor Santos who is presently relocating to 
Singapore and David Terlip to whom they report.  The traders in the Singapore 
office, John Chismar and Eng Wang Moi , will be providing the pricing.  Matt 
and my assistant, Angeline, will get hold of you should they hear from Petron 
during that week.  The plan is that Petron is interested in entering into 
some crack spread swaps with us.  So far, Citibank and Chase have signed up 
ISDAs with Petron.

In the meantime, I'll have Angeline fax to you copies of all the 
correspondence which I've had had with our Filipino counsel QTE to-date so 
that you'll get a good idea of what the regulatory and legal environment's 
like now in the Philippines. [Angeline - can you please do that today.  
Sara's fax no. is Houston Legal's fax no.]

So far, QTE has reviewed our draft ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex and 
I sent it across to Petron's inhouse counsel on 8 September (please see 
attached) and I'm now waiting for their written comments on those drafts.  

Please let me know whether you'll be able to look after this matter for me.  
Looking forward to hearing from you.

Thanks a mill,
Anita

Dear Luis,

I am the Senior Legal Counsel for Enron  based in Singapore and have been 
requested by my colleague, Manuel Gallego, to forward to you our proposed 
draft ISDA documentation for your review.  The attached documents are as 
follows:

our draft ISDA schedule (draft dated 7 September 1999) attached as 
petron-isda (7Sept99).doc
our draft ISDA Credit Support Annex (draft dated 6 September 1999) attached 
as petron-cs (6Sept99).doc
our form of legal opinion to be issued by your external legal counsel (draft 
dated 6 September 1999) attached as petron-isda (ext opn) (6Sept99).doc

Please note that the attached documents are in draft and are for discussion 
only and are as such open to any further changes which may be proposed by 
ourselves or our external legal counsel.

I would be most grateful if you could review the attached and thereafter let 
me have your written response to the same.  You may either e-mail your 
response to me at Anita.Fam@enron.com or fax me in Singapore at +65 
734-2868.   Should you wish to call me, my phone number in Singapore is +65 
838-9038. 

I look forward to hearing from you shortly.

No, in general there is a netting issue with French counterparties.  The 
"quick fix" is to only permit ONE Transaction using a deemed ISDA.  The 
broader issue to be resolved is that one of the parties must be a "financial 
institution" under French law.  We tried to push ECT into that defintion, but 
without success.  The next step is to require  an opinion from outside 
counsel identifying our counterparty as that financial institution.  
SS            
ps - Tanya is well aware of the situation

   
	
	

I'm pretty sure SITA is a French company.  Have we decided that French 
counterparties are ok?

This deal has already come and gone. We exercised an option for 2000 short 
tons a month, so I do not think that portion of this confirm needs to be 
revised. If it does please let me know. Dale is working on that language for 
all deals from now on.

We have committed to move forward with one Asset Monetization transaction to 
fully address and resolve the issues and complexities involved and establish 
a base template by which we can expand the strategy as we move forward in 
Brazil. Votorantim Cellulose e Papel (VCP) is the targeted transaction due to 
its size, diversity of opportunities, and management commitment.

The structure of the assets is as follows:

The currently identified opportunities are as follows:

The tasks to be accomplished are as follows:  

The Team that we see on the project is listed below:

I would first like to ask each of you to provide feedback on what I have laid 
out to date. With regard to process and go forwards I am seeking all input.
Below are some additional files for your use.  We will co-ordinate initially 
with each functional group and get everyone together as we move forward.
We have a commitment to complete Stage I with a proposal to the customer by 
October 1st. It will take all of us to make that happen.

I have sent the ISDA schedule to Barclays for their review as there are a few
issues that Barclays needs to respond to before I can forward the document to
Enron (the email is being sent separately by my word processing staff).  I am
confirming whether Credit Lyonnais is handling the schedule themselves since
that was my impression when talking to Daryl Stanley, although that was before
getting this email (however, if MBP is handling the schedule for both banks, 
the
schedules will be identical except as to the Tax representations, so the
negotiation of one schedule will make the other schedule easy to complete).

Daryl or Ricardo, can one of you confirm?

Sara,

I got an inquiry from a South African country today.  Off the top of your 
head do you know anything about our ability to do derivatives in that 
country.  I'm just wondering if you have any ready info...i.e. at this point 
it would not merit any incremental research.

Thanks,

We are presently contacting Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to facilitate opening 
of an account for EPHXII to trade ADRs.  You will need to provide a 
resolution authorizing opening of the account as well as an authorized trader 
list and other contacts.  We will provide you with drafts.  I am certain that 
the broker will accept fax signatures and then follow up with originals.  

For future reference, will this be an isolated instance (i.e., deal specific) 
or will these accounts become more routine?  Just wondering if S. Cone has a 
formal trading policy or if trading is still deal specific.  SS

**Please do not forward**

So everyone knows, here is how we plan to execute the purchase/sale of 
Millenium ADRs.  Please let me know ASAP if anyone sees any problems with 
this.

*We will have a formal ESA transaction approval and DASH signed by Diomedes 
and/or Jim and others.  These approvals will be shown to Corp. Treasury, Risk 
Management, and RAC.

1. Jeff Kinneman's team will execute all trades with the market.  They 
function in this respect as an internal broker for ESA: ie, ESA will direct 
and manage all trading decisions and they will execute.  Jeff reports to Gary 
Hickerson and Greg Whaley in Risk Management.  Gary has been advised and Greg 
will be advised that we will be taking a small trading position in these 
securities.  Jeff's team has been restricted from trading any other Millenium 
securities except at our request. 

2. We will use the CayCo that owns PEP (Enron Brazil Power Holding XII) for 
our trades.  Lynn chose this company for tax purposes, and Robert has 
indicated that there are no legal restrictions on using this company.  James, 
Diomedes and Joe are Directors of this company.  Joe can authorize Jeff, 
Pedro, myself (or whoever) to execute trades of the CayCo.  Appropriate 
corporate resolutions will be executed as needed.

3. Morgan Stanley will be the clearing broker for our ADRs.  The clearing 
broker is also custody agent for the securities.  Sara is in process of 
completing this application (as a domestic account).  MS is the primary 
clearing broker and custody agent for most of Corp's stock purchases.

4. Jeff's team already has a trading agreement with JPM.  We do not have an 
agreement in place with DKB.  We will execute that agreement once we have 
clarified several matters with DKB. 

5. Trades will be conducted in the following manner:

a) Pedro and I will discuss price targets/amounts throughout a given day
b) I will place an order with Jeff's team.  If I am out, Pedro will speak 
with Jeff directly.  Jeff's number is 713-853-5398.
c) We will get execution feedback on the order from the team as well as any 
market talk
d) If the order is filled, Corp. (Atlantic Commercial Finance) will be 
instructed to send funds on behalf of CayCo to MS.  Cathy Moehlman in 
Treasury will handle cash movements and has been briefed on this potential 
activity.

Regards,  Bruce  

AA has real problems with loans disguised as swaps.  Who is reviewing this 
from an accounting viewpoint?  The accounting treatment could impact the deal.

ps.  I'm leaving for a 1-week vacation on Friday, Oct. 1

Sorry, I've been tied up all day.  Rod and I just spoke and he is thinking 
about the NAV issue.  
Regarding setoff, we can agree to Tiger's language BUT credit will not permit 
ENA affiliates to trade with Tiger.  That's your issue.  Will you agree.
We will not agree that all collateral be held in NY.
There is still an issue about Relevant Price and the possibility of fewer 
than three dealers.
We cannot finalize L/C and MAC issues until we see Tiger's redraft which we 
have not received.

Let's talk.  ss

subsidiary, CIESA do an interest rate swap to fix rates on its $220MM 
floating rate note agreement.  The existing swap which was done in 1997 runs 
off on 10/22/99.  The tax department here at Enron (South America) have asked 
me to let them review any swap documentation we plan on entering into 
beforehand so they can look at any tax issues (i.e., tax law changes that may 
have occured since the last swap was done).  

I am not sure what documentation was used the last time around - I have asked 
the financial folks at TGS which manages the CIESA FRN on behalf of Enron and 
Perez Companc to send me a copy of whatever documentation was used before as 
a starting place but haven't heard back from them.  Do you happen to have any 
information on the previous swap?

I am on my way to Dallas for the day.  I will give you a call tomorrow to 
check in.  Thanks.

I sure hope you're wrong LA!  I can't wait to get out of town.  I'll be back 
in Sao Paulo soon. maybe late October. Regards.  Sara

Dear Sara,

Hope you have a terrible time in L.A.

Hope you come to NY soon.

Hope it's a long, complicated deal with lot's of derivatives stuff.

Hope I'm in town.

I love you so much.  And you send great messages.  My life has always been a 
mess.  I never had a chance to tallk to you about Cuba and I'm totally 
fascinated with the island.  I sat next to this lawyer from NY on the flight 
from BA to Miami and he's recently separated and wants me to dump Mike.  I 
have a "house sitter" while I'm on vacation (thought I'd try it out since you 
probably would!).  Mike asked the concierge at "The Argyle" to make 
reservations from a list I prepared.  All of your suggestions except Parkway 
Grill appear.  How do people in LA dress for dinner? HELP!  I have to pack 
tonight.  I need new shoes.  I'll be in the office tomorrow until 4:15pm.  
Bye now ................... Sass

Hey Sass,

My life is a mess!! I barely have time to pee.
These are the restaurants I remember as great--Patina (but you can't
wear jeans I don't think), La Campanile (maybe it's El Campanile) and
Parkway Grill.
Have fun.
Love,
Deb

I knew you were going to say that!  But, dubba, what KIND of clothes?  Do I 
need to bring jewelry? money? stockings?  I mean, what did YOU wear in LA?  
What would you like for me to bring you?  nachos?(ha, ha)  The phoebebee says 
hi.  Call me later if you're working.  ss

I think people dress in clothes.  I saw everybody in everything, it's
just that Patina seemed a little bit snootier than the others (the food
is fabulous though).  Maybe the Parkway Grill isn't on the list because
that's the wrong name of the restaurant.  Maybe it's really Perkway
Grillades.
Love you lots.
Deb

Attached is a general confirm outlining the proposed transaction with 
Deseret.  I am not sure where the original of this documet came from.   
However, I am providing it to you so that you can have the language for the 
general terms of the transaction.  

Let me know if I may provide any other information.  

In talking with Deseret, they felt that they had a much better chance of 
pushing a short form ISDA agreement for this trasaction through the general 
counsel than they would the long form ISDA.  That said, I think our best 
approach is to set up a short form ISDA agreement for Deseret.   As usual, 
the sooner the better on putting together the short form ISDA document.  
Today if possible.  Please let me know.

This is the first that I have heard about this deal.  Maybe Brian could call 
me tomorrow as well to discuss this transaction.  I will do some more 
checking around in the meantime to see if I can find anything out about this

Sara,

Consider the attached "work in progress".  It represents the latest info I've 
been able to extract from all dealmakers.

JH.

The only policy that I've seen is the "Interim Southern Cone Electricity 
Trading Policy" dated July 29th, 1999 and which does authorize financial 
electricity trading in Brazil.  I'm not aware of  policy (maybe there is 
none) or resolution (maybe each will be deal specific) which addresses the 
opening of brokerage accounts and equity trading (even for hedging 
purposes).   I think we should monitor the activity and see if it's going to 
be sporadic.  I'll be in the office today until 4 pm.  Sara 

Andrea Bertone@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
09/30/99 05:22 PM
We have a policy. I don't have it in electronic version. Maybe Don Black has 
it . He applied for it. If you want I can send you a hard copy.

Sara Shackleton@ECT
09/29/99 01:08 PM
We are presently contacting Morgan Stanley Dean Witter to facilitate opening 
of an account for EPHXII to trade ADRs.  You will need to provide a 
resolution authorizing opening of the account as well as an authorized trader 
list and other contacts.  We will provide you with drafts.  I am certain that 
the broker will accept fax signatures and then follow up with originals.  

For future reference, will this be an isolated instance (i.e., deal specific) 
or will these accounts become more routine?  Just wondering if S. Cone has a 
formal trading policy or if trading is still deal specific.  SS

Mark, you may recall my memo to you in April, 1999 which indicated that for 
netting purposes, the conditions included:

1.  The transaction must be governed by a market standard master agreement or 
occur on a French regulated market

2.  One of the parties must be (a) an "investment firm" within the meaning of 
the law of 2nd of July, 1996, (b) an instituion or firm benefitting from the 
provisions of article 25 of the Law or (c) a non-resident entity having a 
"comparable status"

The term "investment firm" embodies financial type institutions which recieve 
and transmit order for financial instruments for third parties.

There are 12 categories of article 25 firms (including Bank of France, 
insurance companies, broker types, etc.)  .For example, one murky designation 
includes "persons who supply an investment service which is ancillary to 
their professional activity, provided the rules governing such activity do 
not prohibt the carrying on of investment services".  Slaughter and May has 
advised that they could assist us in determining whether our French 
counterparty fit this category and it definitely needs to be discussed with 
the counterparty (and extract a rep from them as well).  There are other 
categories as well.   I have a copy of the law if you would like to review.

The non-resident entity having "comparable status" is the category WE were 
trying for fit into without much success.

Tana tells me that I have given you misinformation.  Perhaps the law has 
changed and Justin has a recent update.  

ENA has a Soc Gen master, and we have recently sent a Deemed ISDA to a French 
corporate (one shot deal only). 

Mark and I met yesterday.  I am NOT making my proposed changes to either 
Section 2 or Section 8 of the Omnibus other than adding definitions for  
"Option" and "Floor Amount" to Section 8.  This does not interfere with all 
of our other general changes to Annex A (which include the comment about 
"Total Premium" which should conform to the online version).  So, Annex A is 
ready to go!  Sara

Attached is the credit worksheet for the captioned.  Also attached is a word 
document which provides the credit definitions.  Sara or Marie, would you 
kindly provide me with the legal risks of entering into financial swaps with 
Deseret, a Utility/Co-operative domiciled in Utah and engaged in the retail 
sale of electric energy in Utah Arizona, Nevada, and Wyoming, and the 
implications this may have, if any, on our ability to enforce our remedies 
under this contract as well as take hold of our collateral. Separately, could 
you comment on any role the PUC or FERC may have associated with financial 
swaps, i.e.: approvals of the document and/or each transaction under this 
document.  

Thank you very much.  Sara, I understand you may not have time to answer the 
preceding inquiries prior to leaving for vacation.  Feel free to call me on 
such after you get back.  Please feel free to phone me with any 
comments/question.  Also, please provide me a complete copy prior to sending

Can you talk late this afternoon?
In connection with the "trading issue", have you taken a look at the services 
agreement ?

Hello there!  Hope all is well.  Will you be at the legal conference later 
this month?

Would you please provide us with information identifying the specific entity 
requiring the brokerage account and a brief description of the transaction 
for which the account is required.  Also, for purposes of your unanimous 
consent or resolution,  you should note that either of Ted Murphy or Rick Buy 
should be one of the two signatories required for opening the account.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Sara

I hope that there is no more confusion!

The opening of each brokerage account should require two signatures for 
control purposes.  ONE of those signature MUST BE either of Ted Murphy or 
Rick Buy (their titles frequently change but check the Enron Corp. corporate 
workbook).  The SECOND signature MUST BE an officer of the entity opening the 
account.  We suggest the level of authority used by ENA but certainly 
whatever appears in the entity's unanimous consent or resolution authorizing 
the opening of brokerage accounts.  I think that Marie previously sent you a 
form.  Let us know if you have any questions.  

What is the timing on the Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII Ltd. account?

Nancy Muchmore@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

I guess I meant Enron South America generally--Enron Brazil Power Holdings 
XII Ltd. is one of its companies.  I think you answered my question on a 
general basis--thanks very much.  Sorry if I confused you.

Also, I need to know if anyone from ENA needs to be appointed in addition to 
ESA people. 

Robert:  Who at Enron South America should be appointed?

Nancy

Marie Heard@ECT on 10/08/99 11:35:17 AM
Nancy,

I am confused by your e-mail.  I thought the brokerage account was going to 
be opened for Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII Ltd., not Enron South America.  
We typically require any one of the President, any Managing Director or the 
Vice President, Finance and Treasurer, together with any one of the Managing 
Director, Legal, Rick Buy or Ted Murphy.  Of course, the level of officers 
may vary from entity to entity. 

Marie 

Nancy Muchmore@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
10/07/99 03:35 PM
Marie:  Who are the people you normally appoint to sign, etc., on brokerage 
accounts?  Should Enron South America consider using the same people in order 
set up this account?  We could then appoint Enron South America people 
later.  Thanks.  Nancy

I spoke with Ted Murphy regarding setting up the brokerage account for the 
Copel shares.  He indicated that the easiest thing to do is coordiante with 
Sara Shackelton (ECT finance lawyer).  Typically, she sets up the paperwork 
and Ted (or Rick) signs off on setting up the account (she has done this many 
times).  Robert may have already done this or it may not be necessary in this 
case - I will leave that up to him.  Regardless, Ted (or Rick) does need to 
be one of the people who sign the documents.  Sorry for the delay.

Dale/Bart/Sara,

We need to clean up the confirmation and any other legal information that 
accompanies it (Bart/Sara, is the attached Omnibus T&Cs we proposed to use 
standard documentation or are any revisions necessary prior to sending out to 
CCSI?) so that we can send this out to CCSI for their review.

Looking at the confirmation, I see the following items that need to be 
revised:

Trade date/Signing date - Not yet confirmed; will insert date the deal is 
closed when it is known.
Need to specify which curve to look at in the Gas Daily Index (there is a low 
high and a mid or average); we did not specify which one we would refer to 
previously
Do we need to replace ECT with ENA throughout??
Catalytica should be Catalytica Combustion Systems (the subsidiary not the 
parent)
Need to add in details about CCSI (name/title/payment account info etc.)

Sean - I will get the info for 5 from CCSI

Dale - Could you correct number 2, advise on number 3 and review the document 
again to see if any other information is lacking that should be included?

Bart/Sara  - Could you advise about the details on the Omnibus (I have 
misplaced any copy of this)  I thought there were some credit issues that 
needed to be filled in at the bottom of this?

If anyone else could advise on other items that need to be addressed with

Sara,  great to hear from you.  The entity requiring the brokerage account is 
Enron Energy Services, Limited, which is a UK entity.  This company is buying 
100% of the shares of a UK engineering firm (called Torpy) in order to use in 
its facilities management business here.  The purchase price for Torpy is $4 
million, $1 million of which is payable in Enron Corp. stock.  For tax 
reasons this Enron stock needs to be purchased in the market rather than 
using treasury shares.  Thanks for the tip on account signatories.  Please 
let me know what else I need to do  Thanks again.

I just wanted to follow up on our very productive meeting of September 21, 
1.  cross-border swaps
 (a)  ENE offshore FINANCIAL INSTITUTION and Brazilian entity
 (b)  ENE offshore (not financial institution) through CC-5 Account with 
authorized Brazilian bank and Brazilian entity

 NOTE:  enforceability issues with 1(b)

2.  local swaps
 (a)  ENE onshore entity and Brazilian FINANCIAL INSTITUTION (or ENE onshore 
FINANCIAL INSTITUTION and Brazilian resident)
 (b)  ENE onshore entity and Brazilian entity (not financial institution) 
registered with the BM&F or CETIP through intermediary

 NOTE:  compliance with existing regulations as to specific reference 
products is required as to 2(a) and 2(b)

3.  "pure" OTC swaps
 (a)  ENE onshore entity and Brazilian onshore entity
 (b)  ENE offshore entity and Brazilian offshore entity

 NOTE:  3(a) presents enforceability issues under Brazilian law and 3(b) 
presents no issues whatsoever

We look forward to your response as soon as possible and would also like to 
know when we may hear from you.  In connection with your response, please 
note that we are interested in the recent changes to the laws for acquiring 
banks (bankrupt or otherwise).

Regards to Marcelo and Jose Emilio.  Sara

 

Would you please prepare and coordinate with Jeff Harbert?  Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

If appears from discussions with Mark Bettle today that interest levels at 
the top management of J.D. Irving is minimal to consolidate business under 
one master ISDA agreement.  As a result it seems prudent to move forward to 
assign the current Enron Canada master ISDA agreement over to Enron North 
America.

From my earlier conversations with Bryan Burnett he would support this 
decision.  I have not spoken personally with the originator of the  Enron 
Canada master ISDA, Chris Calger, but it is my understanding he would also 
support this move.  

Would you please take steps to get this done as soon as possible.  

If there are any questions, please call.

JH. 

Hi there!  A quick refresher course for me with respect to French derivatives 
trading (not a bank).  In transacting with a French corporate, should we 
request articles and bylaws for capacity and ALSO a due authorization 
opinion?  I think that this is correct.  However, if we are transacting with 
an "S.A.", we should NOT request articles and bylaws but only the due 
authorization opinion.  My notes on these items are confusing.  Could you 
please respond in the morning?  Thanks.  Sara

p.s.  We are currently operating under the "one Transaction rule" with French 
non-bank entities in order to avoid the netting problem.

(1)  Susan sent PSE&G a sample ISDA on 5/5/99

   (2)  I spoke with attorney on 5/13/99 and am awaiting further credit info 
from the CP before turning around a draft.

By copy of this e-mail, I am asking Susan to follow up and report back to 
you.  Sara

I am forwarding to you several e-mails received today regarding this 
transaction.  We are going to send out another draft confirmation for this 
commodity spread swaption.  Sara

RE your inquiry about the General Terms and Conditions of Confirmation ( 
Annex A to the Confirmation ) and Credit and Other Special Provisions (Annex 
B to the Confirmation) that were attached to the 9/1/99 "Summary of Proposed 
Agreement Between Enron and Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. ("CCSI")" ( 
which I understand was sent to Catalytica) , I went through all the E-Mails I 
had sent or received that attached the Confirmation or the Summary of 
Proposed Agreement as an exhibit, but I can't seem to find one that included 
these Annexes A and B. I've asked a clerk in the department to deliver to 
both you and Sara the copy of Annexes A and B that were attached to the paper 
version of the 9/1 Summary of Proposed Agreement in my files. Perhaps one of 
you will recollect from whom the Annexes were obtained, so we can retrieve 
them in electronic format and append them to the most current draft 
Confirmation.

Regarding your question about credit terms, they are embodied in Annex B. 
Regarding our exposure to Catalytica credit between execution and payment, 
remember that we will not execute the Option Repurchase Agreement until we 
receive CCSI's cash via wire transfer ( this was the deal Brad agreed to when 
he suggested we delete the receipt of CCSI's payment as an express condition 
to effectiveness of the Xonon Implementation Agreement with GE, the 
effectiveness of which agreement is in turn an express condition to 
effectiveness of the Option Repurchase Agreement). In short, my understanding 
is that we would not deliver the Option Repurchase or execute and deliver the 
Xonon Implementation Agreement until we had a good wire transfer from CCSI of 
the full payment amount. Perhaps we should add that stipulation expressly to 
the Option Repurchase Agreement and consider whether it would then be 
appropriate to delete Annex B. Note in this regard, however, that if CCSI 
were to default under other provisions of the derivative, I believe we would 
be seeking payment from CCSI for termination expenses and the like, but I 
don't know if this justifies the credit provision.

Brad Nebergall advises he has not sought formal approval of the Catalytica 
transaction because it is too early to know for sure that we have a deal ( 
ie, we still do not have GE's reaction to the latest draft Xonon 
Implementation Agreement and, as we discussed, we will still need to get the 
Option Repurchase Agreement blessed by Catalytica's auditors). Brad said, 
however, that he has met twice with underwriting on the transaction, and that 
Dave Delaney is in "general agreement" with the deal "in concept". I hope 
that addresses your inquiry, and I'll update you when (and if) we move to the 
next stage.

We are trying to revise the draft transaction confirmation per Sean's e-mail 
of date.  The original confirm was prepared for "Catalytica, Inc." and the 
credit included an additional event of default (cross-default) with 
thresholds of $10 million for Catalytica and $50 million for Enron North 
America.  Sean has requested that "Catalytica, Inc." be REPLACED with the sub 
"Catalytica Combustion Systems".  Should the credit remain the same?

We are withholding release of this confirm pending a response from 
underwriting.  Thanks.  Sara

In an effort to establish regular communication on the progress of trading 
issues (primarily related legal and tax perspectives)  in the S. Cone, Lynn 
and I have agreed to conference on Friday, October 15 at 9 am (Houston time) 
and weekly at that time.  Would anyone else like to participate this Friday?  
If you are interested in participating on a weekly basis, are Fridays at 9 am 
(Houston time) convenient for you?  My immediate concerns are financial 
trading issues.  However, we can focus on all relevant issues as we so 
determine.  I will create a "short list" to initiate discussion.  Thanks.

Just note that the sub's full name is Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc. 
Regarding the sub's credit, we should have pretty good info since we are an 
equity owner ( I think 30%) in CCSI. I understand CCSI has no revenues, that 
its principal asset is the Xonon system patent, and that the proceeds of 
Enron's investment in CCSI will be the source of the funds for the purchase 
of the spark spread derivative.

Attached is a draft report to initiate Friday's discussion.  Please provide 
comments, suggestions, etc.  Thanks.  Sara

I'm fine with Randy's suggestion.  Let me know about you and I'll e-mail 
Randy back.  I am still planning our Friday morning call (it should be short) 
because I want your input on "tracking projects".  Brent will participate and 
I haven't heard from anyone else.  Sara

Sara,  

Given the deal pressure we expect in the last quarter of 99,especially in 
origination, I am trying to eliminate as many duplicative meetings as 
possible.  Instead of having Andrea Bertone attend this weekly meeting, could 
you and Lynn Aven attend my legal staff meeting (along with Brent Hendry and 
Rick Hopkinson, who are already scheduled to attend) each week? They are held 
on Tuesdays at 10:00 am SP time. That way, we can get a direct report from 
you with a synthesized summary of the issues.  If you need to consult with 
Andrea, Robert or me on an offline basis, you can let us know in the meeting, 
and we will arrange a separate call. I believe this would be more efficient.

Thanks, and please let me know,

Regards,
Randy

Lucy Ortiz on the confirmation desk is awaiting your response re: my e-mail 
of 10/11/99.  Please let us know when you have determined the appropriate 
counterparty.  If you have any questions, please call.  Thanks.  Sara

Will you follow up with this guy?  Great seminar.  I enjoyed your talk.  SS

Hey Sara -
I think we might be doing a survey (I am not sure).  I ahve been telling 
select cities that Merced irrigation has signed a ISDA.

05/20/99 08:54 AM
Tom Kabat, Senior Resource Planner, Resource Management Division for the City 
of Palo Alto, Utilities Department, gave me his card yesterday and said he 
wanted to get an ISDA started for future trading.  He asked if we had ISDA's 
with any other cities, that is, it might make his job easier.  Are you guys 
sending follow-up letters to the attendees?  SS 

Phone:  650/329-2659

Fax:  650/326-1507

Sean's comments 
Sorry, I did not realize you were awaiting a response from me on this.

Our deal is with the subsidiary, not the parent.  So the name of the 
counterparty should be Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc., (CCSI) not 
Catalytica.

Regarding the credit issue (Annex B; Credit and other special provisions), I 
can't see how we are exposed to credit risk; we will not sign the XONON 
Implementation Agreement with GE until we have received the $9.9 million 
payment from CCSI.  If CCSI does not agree to return the spark spread 
confirmation upon our request, as defined per the agreement, then CCSI is in 
default of the agreement and the spark spread confirmation becomes worthless.

My main concern is with the general terms and conditions of the spark spread 
confirmation because I know there are some errors in there that need to be 
corrected:

There are three prices for the Gas Daily index referenced - low, high and 
mid.  We need to define which curve we want to reference.
We need to change the name from Catalytica to Catalytica Combustion Systems, 
Inc.
Also, if Lucy can review the document for any other errors that would be a 
good idea.

I was looking to get these items corrected in anticipation of sending to CCSI 
sometime around the end of next week.

Please feel to contact me with any other questions.

How would you like to handle?  We could do a Deemed ISDA if you feel 
comfortable that the counterparty will sign the ISDA.  How long is the deal?  
SS
Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
10/14/99 06:57 AM
How should we handle this do you think?  Call me when you have a minute.  
Thanks.
Brent, could we close a Swap with TGS without having the ISDA signed but 
then, a few weeks later after we sending the confirmation we sign the ISDA?

TGS wants to close a swap with us starting November 1st. The problem is that 
their lawyer, Enrique Prini (do you know him??) is going for vacation next 
monday for two weeks. I told the guy from TGS that he should have Chris 
Dougall taking over while he is outside, but he did not sound convinced. 
Maybe you could talk to Chris?? But still, let's wait until they send us 
their comments.

Hope you are well!  I had a wonderful vacation in L.A.  I never made it to 
either the Norton Simon or the Getty; I'll just have to plan another trip to 
the west coast.

In connection with your recent review of our standard ISDA Schedule, Credit 
Support Annex and legal opinion (the "Documents"), could you please advise as 
the whether additional provisions are required or advisable in any of the 
Documents when our counterparty is an Argentine public utility, municipality 
or other type of regulated entity.  In the U.S., we use the ISDA 
Multicurrency - Cross Border boilerplate and incorporate most of the ISDA 
municipal language and some of our own into the Schedule for municipals and 
governmental entities.  However, for public utilities which are general 
corporates (and not governmentally owned), we take a different approach and 
incorporate language which might trigger an "Additional Termination Event" 
for "regulatory type developments" (e.g., orders issued by a public utility 
commission) which would cause or might cause our master agreement to become 
void or unenforceable or similar swap agreements to become void or 
unenforceable.  For example:

"The filing of a motion, pleading, application or other similar action in any 
proceeding or action by Party B, a commission, regulatory agency or other 
entity having jurisdiction over Party B, in respect of Party B, or in respect 
of any other similarly situated entity organized under the laws of the 
state(s) in which Party B is located or regulated, to the effect that 
performance under this Agreement or one or more Transactions hereunder or 
similar agreements is unlawful or that this Agreement or one or more 
Transactions hereunder or similar agreements are void or voidable." 

By fax, I will send you our Municipal Schedule.

Please advise as to changes in both the (i) Schedule and (ii) legal opinion 
for both (a) public utilities (corporates, non-governmental) and governmental 
entities (municipals, public agencies, governmental utilities, etc.).  Please 
call if you have any questions.  Regards.  Sara

Randy,
I can certainly participate in your Tuesday morning meetings (and I can 
appreciate the time constraints under which Andrea is working!).  I believe 
that Lynn will defer to Rick's participation.  Please let me know if there is 
a call in number.  I think that I will be able to keep you updated through 
your meetings.  My need for meeting with Lynn and Brent stems from the fact 
that we are "offshore" Brazil and need to communicate regularly to keep the 
fires burning.
Have a great weekend!  I just got back from my vacation - I went to L.A. - 
and the weather was extraordinary.  So was the food.  I'm looking forward to 
Sao Paulo.  Will see you soon.  Sara

Did Chris call you about this?  SS
	
	

I spoke to Todd Busby.  He said he is trying to set this up as a transaction 
where we could directly link the two swaps.  It is my understanding that this 
would simplify the transaction in that the credit/contracting process would 
be fairly straightforward.  He said that he needs to get his internal ducks 
in a row before he is prepared to take a step forward with us.  He will call 
me if and when this occurs.   So, this might not come to anything.  I will 
let you know if and when he surfaces so we can decisde what we should do next.

Thanks!!

Chris

Sheer volume! (has kept me from being up to date).  It's at the top of the 
list and I promise it by next week.

I do need to speak with you about this Duke issue which has apparently 
created some confusion over here.  Seems to me there are three issues here:  
(1) ECT's consent toDuke Energy Trading and Marketing LLC releasing the 
master to its affiliate, (2)  credit's assessment of trading with two Duke 
entities and (3) issues particular to trading power in Argentina (if any).  
Who is in charge of addressing Duke?  SS

Pablo would like to know the status of our comments to PC on the master.  Has 
there been any progress?

In connection with the ISDA negotiations, PG&E is insisting on revising our 
"Limitation of Liability" language"

"...PROVIDED, HOWEVER,THAT NOTHING IN THIS PROVISION SHALL AFFECT THE 
ENFORCEABILITY OF SECTION 6(e) OF THIS AGREEMENT with respect to incidental 
damages."

PG&E claims that it will never be responsible for consequential damages and 
that certain elements of "Loss" comprise consequential damages (PG&E always 
agrees to "Market Quotation"). 
Have you ever prepared a list of the "Loss" components?
Can you assess before I go to Haedicke (or is this a non-starter)?
Thanks.  Sara

All,

Attached is the revised version of the captioned Schedule (dated as of 
10/18/99).

Shouldn't someone contact Amoco?  I mentioned this to Carol St. Clair last 
week but I don't know if anyone thought further about it.  Sara

   

FYI:  Jeff  I  know  that  you  are  busy,  however  I  have  received  
several  outside  calls  today  (10/13/99)  from  
            a  party  claiming  to  be  with  BP Amoco,  he  requested  deal 
#N16124.1  to  be  faxed  to  (281)366-4934.  The
            party  refuses  to  give  his  name  or  phone  number.  His  
reply  has  been  "If  I  have  to  give  my  name
            and  number  maybe  I  don't  need  your  confirm",  then  he  
hangs  up.  He  has  called  several  times  since
            I  stopped  you  and  Bob  Bowen  earlier.  I  also  suspect  
that  this  same  party  has  been  calling  and  
            hanging  up  without  answering;  and  calling  from  a  
different  outside  line  pretending  to  be  someone  else,
            but  making  the  same  deal  request ,  followed  by  hanging  
up  when  I  ask  for  his  name  and  phone
            number.  I  have  contacted  Susan  Flynn  in  legal  to  
inquire  about  these  calls  or  BP Amoco.  I  was  advised
            not  to  send  any  confirms  out  blindly  and  that  I  was  
handling  it  just  right .  Susan  is  currently  inquiring
            with  the  other  legal  staff  and  attorneys  about  the  
matter.  I  also  was  advised  to  inform  you  to  make  
            other  members  of  our  team  aware  "not  to  send  out  blind  
information  requests" .  The  party  was  calling 
            from  (281)493-0214.  I  will  keep  you  informed.

            Thanks,
            
            Willie

no way!  never mind, OK!  have fun.  I'll miss you.  Sara

I will be taking tomorrow and Friday as vacation days.

I am about to engage the Johannesburg firm of Webber Wentzel Bowens to 
proceed with a response to ENA's questionnaire.  ISDA has used this firm.   
Has ECTRIC done any previous studies in South Africa?  Please let me hear 
from you today, if possible.  Thanks and regards.  Sara

Yes, I've received messages but have not heard from the right person.  
However, I want to clean up the transaction itself.  Why is it a swaption?  
ss

I see that you completed an ISDA comparison in late September.  What has 
happened with it?  SMUD is calling.  Can you advise Stuart Rosman ASAP?  SS

jointly to Morris Clark and Steve Douglas

I have copies of the documents...

I will have them delivered to your office tomorrow ...if you let me know
who in tax you want the documents sent to, we can forward the documents
to them directly...thanks...mgg

Was this meeting cancelled yesterday?  It wasn't on my calendar?

I am sitting in on this conference call as I write this message.  Brent just 
mentioned that you were preparing an analysis addressing "trading locations" 
to present to Don.  Randy is interested in seeing your written response.  Do 
you need anything from me?

Also, I heard from AFAC by e-mail yesterday and he said that Marcelo was 
working on a memo (which I was to receive yesterday!).  We may need Randy to 
intercede and keep the lawyers working on ALL projects.  Apparently AFAC 
handles all Central Bank issues for Tozzini and Cuiaba has these issues now.

ss

Call me when you're free and we can talk to Rolo..  I've looked at their 
comments.  Sara

   

Rolo-

Sara and I are going to go through the comments and then get back to you very 
soon on the issues.  

I understand that they don't want to sign the CSA, but I am not in the 
position to eliminate this because Goldman Sachs did not make them sign one.  
They are partially owned by Enron and Perez Companc and both of these 
companies sign ISDAs that include CSAs.  

Will follow up soon.

Regards,

Pat

Rodolfo Freyre @ ENRON_DEVELOPMENT   10/18/99 03:10 PM

Pat / Sara,

I just talked to the commercial guy @ TGS. We just talked about the Credit 
Support Annex (CSA)and he basically said that they have signed many ISDA's 
(i.e.: with Goldman Sachs) and in none of those were they required to include 
the CSA. I do not know if the CSA is a thing we do require for every 
trasnsaction or not, but I see these guys unwilling to comply with the CSA. 

Why don't we schedule a conference call ASAP to determine our next steps. 

Rolo

Rolo-

We received the comments from TGS regarding our ISDA format.  They are making 
substantial changes to the document so, I believe that we need to discuss 
this and schedule a conference call with them as soon as possible.  Please 
call me so, we can talk about setting this up.

Regards,

Pat

Rodolfo Freyre @ ENRON_DEVELOPMENT   10/15/99 03:52 PM

FYI
Eduardo Pawlusek (TGS) just called me and we talked about the LPG Hedge. I 
did not tell him anything about the "imbedded loan structure" we are thinking 
of. 

ISDA Document: He told me that his lawyer (Enrique Prini) is reviewing the 
ISDA and will send us the comments on Monday. The problem is that the lawyer 
is leaving on Monday for two weeks. I told him that he should have Chris 
Dougall (who already knows our lawyers) take over while Enrique is out of 
town. 
Timing: TGS is looking for a swap starting November 1, 1999 until December 
31, 2000 (14 months). The problem is that we have to get the ISDA signed 
before we do any transaction, and given that their lawyer will be out, I am 
not sure we will be able to sign it before end of this month.
Volume: TGS sells 200,000 tons/yr of LPG. Approximately 30% of that 
(60,000tons/yr) is what TGS commercialises. They are analysing two scenarios: 
2,500 tons/month (35,000 tons/14months),
1,800 tons/month (25,200 tons/14months). 
Price: He wants us to send him the terms and conditions of a swap ASAP. He 
wants price, settlements and index to be defined. He also said they will be 
asking the banks to send them a quote. 

With regards to the loan we need to evaluate the amount cash involved in the 
swap. Then we can determine an appropriate loan amount. Jeff talked with 
Brian Swinford about this structure.

AFAC - Thank you for your response.  It is difficult for me when I do not 
hear from you since I am not in Sao Paulo but I understand that you were 
engaged in other Enron matters.  I am looking forward to your response since 
the trading issues are not going away (the issues seem to only multiply).  
Once "the Enron group" has had an opportunity to review, we would like to 
schedule another meeting with you and Marcelo in Sao Paulo.  I look forward 
to receiving the memo and chart.  Thank you and regards.  Sara

P.S.  Please phone or e-mail when you are sending the memorandum.

All:  I know that AFAC is busy with Enron matters.  However, I received this 
response from him on Monday (yesterday).  I have not spoken with either AFAC 
or Marcelo but it appears that they are very close to at least a "first 
draft".  My thought is that we review the response and identify specific 
areas and/or issues for refinement and then schedule a meeting in S.P.  I'll 
advise as soon as I hear further.  Sara 
Sara:

I am sorry for not replying your e-mail before.  Marcelo has prepared a memo 
and a chart summarizing the memorandum on the matters we discussed before.  I 
will review the documents and send a copy to you during the course of the day 
today.  Once you have received them we can discuss any comments or questions 
you may have.

Best regards,

I have spoken with Daivd Mitchell about the issue that I raised in my e-mail 
yesterday regarding which law would govern the "perfection" of our interest 
Peter, 
As I mentioned to you yesterday, with respect to LC's that are issued for our 
benefit, there could be a circumstance where we would draw and hold the cash 
as collateral.  In that circumstance, I think we need some guidnace from you 
and Stikeman as to what we should be doing to perfect our interest in such 
cash.  I would be interested in knowing whether in a bankruptcy context 
involving a Canadian counterparty, whether the court would hold that such 
cash proceeds are property of the estate.

Let me know what you think.  My assistant is trying to set up a call with 
you, me and Shari to go through the other Canadian law issues that I raised 
in my e-mail to you yesterday.

Dale:  can you have someone review the transaction terms.  I'm not sure that 
this is a swaption.  I'll also take a look.  I do not have a voice yet but I 
am in the office.  Sara
Sara,

When can we get a revised draft (credit issue outstanding) for the spark 
spread confirmation; should not take very long to revise the terms and 
conditions.

Brad and Chris will be in San Francisco meeting with the developers and GE 
tomorrow.  I ran into Randy and he suggested we should meet with him early 
next week to discuss the current deal structure.  I think we should be able 
to resolve the credit issue and any other remaining issues with this document 
at that time (if any remain) and we will want to send this document out 
immeadiately thereafter.  Therefore, I suggest that we should clean up the 
general terms and conditions in preparation of this so that we are in a 
position to send this document out ASAP once any remaining issues are 
resolved.

Many thanks for your cooperation in this matter.

Sorry, I did not realize you were awaiting a response from me on this.

Our deal is with the subsidiary, not the parent.  So the name of the 
counterparty should be Catalytica Combustion Systems, Inc., (CCSI) not 
Catalytica.

Regarding the credit issue (Annex B; Credit and other special provisions), I 
can't see how we are exposed to credit risk; we will not sign the XONON 
Implementation Agreement with GE until we have received the $9.9 million 
payment from CCSI.  If CCSI does not agree to return the spark spread 
confirmation upon our request, as defined per the agreement, then CCSI is in 
default of the agreement and the spark spread confirmation becomes worthless.

My main concern is with the general terms and conditions of the spark spread 
confirmation because I know there are some errors in there that need to be 
corrected:

There are three prices for the Gas Daily index referenced - low, high and 
mid.  We need to define which curve we want to reference.
We need to change the name from Catalytica to Catalytica Combustion Systems, 
Inc.
Also, if Lucy can review the document for any other errors that would be a 
good idea.

I was looking to get these items corrected in anticipation of sending to CCSI 
sometime around the end of next week.

Please feel to contact me with any other questions.

Sara Shackleton
10/11/99 05:23 PM
We are trying to revise the draft transaction confirmation per Sean's e-mail 
of date.  The original confirm was prepared for "Catalytica, Inc." and the 
credit included an additional event of default (cross-default) with 
thresholds of $10 million for Catalytica and $50 million for Enron North 
America.  Sean has requested that "Catalytica, Inc." be REPLACED with the sub 
"Catalytica Combustion Systems".  Should the credit remain the same?

We are withholding release of this confirm pending a response from 
underwriting.  Thanks.  Sara

I know nothing.  SS

Tracy and Sara, please provide with an update of what you know about this 
transaction at your earliest convenience.

Thank you

Christopher

William S Bradford
10/19/99 03:32 PM
Christopher,

I believe Tracy Ngo has begun to look at it from a credit perspective.  I 
don' have any of the details.  Aquila Energy Corp. is the guarantor for 
Aquila trading subs and is not anywhere near the equivalent credit quality of 
Enron Corp.  We need to be careful of how much incremental risk we take with 
Aquila without collateral because of our significant trading positions with 
them.  Please advise when you find out more details about the structure.

Regards,
Bill

I have not heard anything about this transaction.  Do you have a transaction 
diagram and/or a term sheet or any memoradum that describes anything about 
what they are trying to do?

Christopher 

Sara Shackleton
10/15/99 02:03 PM
Did Chris call you about this?  SS
	
	

I spoke to Todd Busby.  He said he is trying to set this up as a transaction 
where we could directly link the two swaps.  It is my understanding that this 
would simplify the transaction in that the credit/contracting process would 
be fairly straightforward.  He said that he needs to get his internal ducks 
in a row before he is prepared to take a step forward with us.  He will call 
me if and when this occurs.   So, this might not come to anything.  I will 
let you know if and when he surfaces so we can decisde what we should do next.

Thanks!!

asked her not to talk at all.  She is planning to be in the office tomorrow.  
If possible, could you try to commuicate through email as much as possible.  
She can hardly whisper and I promise you will feel really, really guilty if 
you ask her to talk.

I'll be happy to deliver any messages to her.  My extension is 3-5968.

Mark Evans

Julian,

let's leave it for Barclays to request the guarantee which they no doubt will.

Treasa and David will need to discuss with the currency swaps desk in Houston 
the issue of euro conversion.

      Mark

   

Barclays call on the guarantee. If they think about it then they probably
will want the Corp. guarantee. And of course the precedent swap was
guaranteed....we could send out the first draft though and see if they raise
the issue of the guarantee. Do you want to raise the question of
re-denomination into euro with them?

Sara,

I hope you have now received instructions from your commercial swaps team to
put
together an ISDA  currency swap and confirm which ECT Corp will be providing
to
either Enron Europe Power 3 Limited or a subsidiary of that company. The
subsidiary will be receiving dollars under a bond issue and paying pounds
out (a
spot transaction I believe) but will then receive pounds income which it
will
need to convert to dollars to pay interest on the bonds.

The precedent document is the Sutton Bridge currency swap.

Can you please confirm you have been instructed and let us know your timing
for
issuing a document.  The sooner we can see this next week the better.

The bond trustee will as usual require the swap to be backed with legal
opinions
from Enron in-house counsel (Mark Haedicke) re due execution and from V&E
(Terry
Yates) re enforceability. My understanding is that the swap will not be
guaranteed by Corp (correct Julian?).

Linklaters are representing Enron - Julian Davies and Fran Xavier (tel: 171
456
2000). Could you please send them your fax, telephone and email details.
Linklaters have kindly agreed to prepare a first draft of the Mark Haedicke
opinion and to send it out to you Sara.

Thank  you. I look forward to hearing from you.

                         Mark

In regards to the revised confirmations received from Merrill, do you need 
copies of the agreement as well.

The changes on the revisions are for the Payment Date and Fallback Reference 
Price that Marie had asked you about.

Please advise.

BR

Sorry to have to respond via e-mail but I've got laryngitis (although I 
should be in most of the day today).

The actual opening of the agreement is simple because we have a good broker 
relationship and the agreement is acceptable to us.  BUT, the broker WILL NOT 
open the agreement until we can submit the underlying authority which 
includes:

authorizing resolutions (or unanimous consent) from the account party
trading authorization
number of signatures for transacting

Marie previously sent "samples" of the the underlying documentation to Robert 
George.

We have not received anything to date.

When we receive the information, we can fax EVERYTHING to the broker and the 
account can be opened immediately and then followed up by original hard 
copies.

Let me know if you have any further questions.  Sara

You indicated that you'd be finished by Wednesday.  Can you give me the 
comparision?  Thanks.  Sara

Mike, thanks for your patience.  I have severe laryngitis so I cannot even 
speak.  I received a copy of the index for the Utah statute to which Deseret

Sorry I can't wish you well in person but I have a severe case of 
laryngitis!. Fortunately, I'm on antibiotics but the doctor said "Don't speak 
for 3 days.  I wish my wife would get laryngitis."  Maybe the desert air in 
Arizona would bring relief.  I love saguros (is that right?)  Daddy thought 
planning for Chanukah was a great idea.  Also, tell Daddy that if he used 
e-mail I could talk to him even when I have laryngitis.  Love, Sas

 Brent and Lynn:  I have a severe case of laryngitis and I can't even speak.  
I'm not sure that I'll be able to (or even should) speak on Friday for our 9 
am (Houston) conference.  Brent, I was wondering if you would be in Houston 
next week before our legal conference on Thursday and Friday.  If so, then 
maybe you, Lynn and I can meet to assess the situation.  If not, then let's 
please reschedule our Friday call for Monday or Tuesday of next week.  I can 
suggest Monday after 10 am.  Tuesday morning we have Randy's call which I may 
have to begin taking at home due to the early hour so if we decide on 
Tuesday, it should be after 10:30 am..  Please let me hear from you.  
Thanks.  Sara

p.s.  I have not had an opportunity to review the memo but I'm going to take 
a look today.

Kaye:  I e-mailed David Portz this morning and he hasn't opened the message.

Would you be available to take Andrea Calo to dinner next Wednesday (the 
night before the Legal Conference)?  She is coming in a day early to meet & 
chat with people here.

Credit needs to initiate (and it may have to be London credit) but Tanya 
Rohauer will know.  FYI - London told us that Sempra "will not trade with ECT 
International."   SS

If we anticipate having to document any trades under ECT International Carl 
Petersen is going to want a Master set up with that entity.  Who needs to 
initiate that?

Thanks,

Pat, your credit worksheets reflect ENA posting cash.  Is this a mistake?

I am trying to revise these draft masters and then I will tackle TGS.

I still have severe laryngitis so I cannot speak but I can communicate via 
e-mail or a paralegal.

Thanks.  Sara

I have retained Utah counsel.  I'll keep you posted.  I haven't looked at

Thanks for the update.  Any word on the Japanese FX desk principal?  Sara
	Janine Juggins
	12/13/2000 04:04 PM
		
Your summary is correct based on information to date (in this regard the 
agreement between ENA and EEFT still requires amendment in respect of RMT and 
I undertake to get this done). 

However, please note that there have been some last minute changes in the 
Japanese tax advice, received I understand only as of last night. Susan Musch 
will be following up on these changes at a meeting today with Sheila Glover 
and Darren Delage, and has undertaken to keep you appraised of the position. 
The effect of the change would be to permit RMT to be the principal for the 
Japanese FX desk, with a Japanese entity acting as agent to arrange the 
transactions. 

Best regards
Janine

Janine:

With respect to the attached (internal) FX product for EOL, I just wanted to 
verify with you that internal counterparties should transact on EOL with:

(1)  RMT  (as principal for Houston FX desk)

(2)  EEFT as agent for RMT (as principal for London FX desk).  In this 
regard, was the services agreement between ENA and EEFT ever extended to 
include RMT for internal trades? 

(3)  Enron Japan Corp. (as principal for Tokyo FX desk)

There appears to be some confusion since our meeting of November 3.  Thanks.

As you are aware, we are finalizing the participation of Bank of 
Tokyo-Mitsubishi (BTM) into the Alberta Gas Prepay financing.? 

Recall there are three swaps:

(a) Commodity Swap between Enron Canada and RBC(b) Commodity Swap between 
Chase and RBC(c) Interest Rate Swap between Enron Canada and RBC

We will be participating BTM into the agreements to which Enron is party [(a) 
and (c) above].? As a result of this, Enron will not be re-signing any new 
ISDA's etc.?? However, Section 7 to the ISDA Master agreement governing 
Transfers requires the prior written consent for any transfer of "any 
interest or obligation" under the Agreement.? Our view is that the 
participation to BTM does qualify as a tranfer of an any "interest or 
obligation", ergo we need Enron's consent.? Attached please find a proposed 
Consent from Enron prepared by my lawyer.? This is the only document that we 
require signed by Enron.? Please take note of the key language contained 
therein:

??????? "Enron hereby consents to RBC assigning a 50% participation interest 
in the Swap Documents to Bank of Tokyo-???? ?????? Mitsubishi, Ltd., New York 
Branch; provided that (a) RBC's rights and obligations under the Swap 
Documents shall remain ??????? unchanged, (b) RBC shall remain solely 
responsible to Enron for the performance of such obligations and (c) Enron 
shall ??????? continue to deal solely and directly with RBC in connection 
with RBC's rights and obligations under the Swap Documents."

The commodity swap between Chase and RBC will be "split" and each of RBC and 
BTM will have a Swap with Chase for one-half the amount.

Sara(s), please advise whether you are comfortable with our approach and 
whether you require any changes to the Consent.? BTM has reviewed the 
Participation agreement and is moving forward to getting the doc's approved 
internally...we're targeting for a close mid next week (the week of Dec 11) 
and accordingly your execution of the Consent within that timeframe would be 
much appreciated.? Given that you continue to deal in all ways with RBC, I 
have not forwarded you a copy of the Participation agreement....

Thanks and have a good weekend!

Mark:

Per our conversation, I understand that the Canadian company has a number of 
outstanding OTC FX transactions with one or more counterparties.  Each of 
those transactions should be documented by a confirmation which confirms the 
economic terms of each deal.  Each confirmation must be subject to (1) an 
existing type of master agreement (such as the ISDA, IFEMA, FEOMA), (2) a 
"deemed" version of such an agreement or (3) "terms and conditions" appearing 
in the confirmation itself.  It is quite likely that in any of these three 
types of confirmations, there are provisions for assignment of trades, credit 
event upon merger, material adverse change, additonal events of default or 
termination, etc.  which may be triggered by the pending acquisiton of the 
Canadian company.  Further, there may be credit issues associated with the 
transactions and/or master agreements (in the form of specific credit 
provisions in a confirmation or a credit annex to the master agreement).  As 
a result, a party attempting to "step into the shoes of the Canadian company" 
must review the existing documents, subject to any confidentiality 
restrictions, in order to evaluate the positions and risks associated with 
assuming those positions.

Thus, we need to conduct a thorough due diligence of the financial trading 
positions of the Canadian company.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.

Hi Sara:

I missed you and Julia at the Enron Xmas party at Enron field. It was a
lot of fun a the fireworks were fantastic. Did you, Monty and Keith hook
up in New Orleans on D-day December 7th, like you had planned? I hope
so.

I hope you and the hounds have a great holiday season. Also, I am
looking forward to the new millennium edition of the family photo. If I
am still on THE LIST of recipients.

Take Care,

Carson

Susan:

Thanks for the update.  Gary Hickerson wants this product available on EOL=
=20
now (which explains why I am called daily by the trading desk).  Do you kno=
w=20
when a decision on the Japanese FX principal will be forthcoming?

Sara,

Attached are two e-mails that I sent yesterday and today on the Japanese FX=
=20
trader.  In short, we are pursuing the dependent agency approach.  The=20
specifics are set forth in the e-mails.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional=20
information.

Best regards,

Heidi,

In response to your attached e-mail, I am attaching the e-mail message that=
 I=20
sent out yesterday regarding the structure for the FX trader in Tokyo and t=
he=20
EM-Japan traders.  (You were already copied on this but I want to make sure=
=20
that you got it.) =20

In this e-mail, I explain that PWC-Tokyo has recommended following a=20
dependent agent approach for these traders (which is what you reference in=
=20
your attached e-mail).  I recommend this approach saying that it is a=20
pragmatic approach and should be easily implemented.  I talked with Sheila=
=20
Glover and Darren Delage about this approach yesterday evening and they lik=
e=20
it as well.  (In fact, they were also copied on the e-mail regarding the FX=
=20
trader and the EM-Japan traders.)

The following points should be kept in mind in following the dependent agen=
t=20
approach, which I have already discussed with Sheila and Darren:

(1) Agency approach:  Enron Japan would be considered to be an agent of ENA=
. =20
In this role, it would facilitate trades that would be entered into between=
=20
ENA and the third party counterparties.  The trades would be entered into i=
n=20
the name of ENA.  Under this approach, Darren is limited in what he is=20
authorized to do, and his trading parameters will need to be reduced to=20
writing.  These parameters must restrict his activities so that they=20
constitute activities that have a preparatory or auxiliary character.  The=
=20
advice that we received for the FX trader's activities in Australia should=
=20
equally apply to our facts here.  The following is an excerpt from a memo=
=20
that I wrote last year summarizing this advice:

Guidelines and boundaries must be established on what the financial trader=
=20
can do (e.g. price parameters, product parameters, etc.). Activities cannot=
=20
include the negotiation of terms of master contracts, forwards and other=20
derivatives with counterparties. If a master contract must be executed in=
=20
Australia, then it should be executed by an independent agent (such as a=20
lawyer) having a power of attorney from the hedging party. Confirmations=20
should be issued by the hedging party, rather than by EA Finance in Sydney.=
=20
The Australian tax advisor recommended that the financial trader say:  =01&=
My=20
principal will deal with you within these parameters =01(.=018

(2) Darren's employment:  Darren must be considered an employee of Enron=20
Japan so as to avoid ENA being treated as having a permanent establishment =
in=20
Japan.
(3) Darren's agency role:  Darren should not identify himself as an employe=
e=20
of ENA Houston.  He should make it clear that the third parties are enterin=
g=20
into the transactions with ENA as principal.
(4) Service agreement:  A service agreement must be put in place between=20
Enron Japan and ENA (similar to what we did for the FX trader in Sydney).=
=20
Enron Japan should at least initially  be compensated at a cost plus 5%=20
mark-up.  Yesterday evening I also forwarded to Sheila and Darren by e-mail=
=20
the old service agreement that we put in place for the FX trader in Sydney =
so=20
that they could review what terms have been previously used.  (Incidentally=
,=20
the service agreement we put in place between Enron Australia and ENA was=
=20
very similar (almost identical) to the one that was put in place between=20
Enron Europe and ENA for the FX trader in London.)
(5) Potential issues upon Japanese tax audit:  Notwithstanding that this=20
approach is easier to implement, more workable and more pragmatic in=20
approach, we need to be aware that there could be questions upon a Japanese=
=20
tax audit.  In that event, transfer pricing issues could be raised.  That i=
s,=20
the auditors could question whether a cost plus 5% mark-up is commensurate=
=20
with what an unrelated third party would charge for similar services.  We=
=20
would then need to justify that service fee, or if unsuccessful, try to wor=
k=20
out a commission fee that would be acceptable to the Japanese tax auditors.=
 =20
Management needs to be aware of this potential.

I guess I wasn't clear in my attached e-mail.  I am sorry for any=20
inconvenience this may have caused you.  I hope this e-mail better explains=
=20
the recommended structure.  Please let me know if you would like to set up =
a=20
conference call to discuss this further (and let me know who you would like=
=20
on the call).

Best regards,
Susan

Jan-Erland,

I have not yet received the 2001 projections/budget for the Enron Metals=20
trading in Japan.  If you have already sent it, could you please re-send it=
? =20

Also, I talked with PWC-Tokyo late last night about structuring for the FX=
=20
trader and Japanese Metals traders to confirm Baker & McKenzie's advice on=
=20
not using a dependent agent structure in Japan.  PWC has advised that=20
although Baker & McKenzie's approach is more technically correct, foreign=
=20
traders usually set up their Japanese trading operations through the use of=
 a=20
dependent agent in Japan.  The Japanese dependent agent is usually reimburs=
ed=20
using cost plus 5%, at least initially.  Then, if the Japanese tax=20
authorities raise questions upon audit, a commission arrangement is general=
ly=20
used, with the question being what should the profit split be between the=
=20
agent and the foreign company.  Whether the Japanese tax authorities raise=
=20
questions upon audit is dependent upon the volume of trades and the magnitu=
de=20
of the trades.  The PWC Japanese tax partner suggested that we use this=20
arrangement for both the FX trader and the EM Japan trades.  I have asked P=
WC=20
to send this advice in writing by tomorrow.

This seems to be a much more pragmatic approach than the one suggested by=
=20
Baker & McKenzie.  And it should be easy to implement by year-end.  However=
,=20
management must be aware of the fact that PWC's approach could raise=20
questions upon a Japanese tax audit.  Note that if we follow this approach,=
=20
we would need to set up a services agreement between Enron Japan (whichever=
=20
the appropriate entity is) and ENA.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional=20
information.

Best regards,
Susan

Thanks for the note Susan. Like you, I would love to get the funding resolv=
ed=20
before year-end as we have finalised the amounting owing to Houston etc=20
(subject to some invoices etc being received) so it would be a good time to=
=20
get this done.=20

Re the FX trader, I have been harassing Sheila a bit this week, so I was=20
hoping to hear from you or her on the progress here. At this stage I=20
understand that the deals are still being done in the name of ENA, but ther=
e=20
have not been alot, so again if we can get this addressed before the volume=
=20
grows it would be best for all. I was reviewing this matter with JEB=20
yesterday and he indicated that his preference is for an agency style=20
agreement which avoids the need for the back to back deals.=20

will be following up on these changes at a meeting today with Sheila Glover=
=20
and Darren Delage, and has undertaken to keep you appraised of the position=

The effect of the change would be to permit RMT to be the principal for the=
=20
Japanese FX desk, with a Japanese entity acting as agent to arrange the=20
transactions.=20

Best regards
Janine

Janine:

With respect to the attached (internal) FX product for EOL, I just wanted t=
o=20
verify with you that internal counterparties should transact on EOL with:

(1)  RMT  (as principal for Houston FX desk)

(2)  EEFT as agent for RMT (as principal for London FX desk).  In this=20
regard, was the services agreement between ENA and EEFT ever extended to=20
include RMT for internal trades?=20

(3)  Enron Japan Corp. (as principal for Tokyo FX desk)

There appears to be some confusion since our meeting of November 3.  Thanks=

trading in Japan.  If you have already sent it, could you please re-send it=
? =20

Also, I talked with PWC-Tokyo late last night about structuring for the FX=
=20
trader and Japanese Metals traders to confirm Baker & McKenzie's advice on=
=20
not using a dependent agent structure in Japan.  PWC has advised that=20
although Baker & McKenzie's approach is more technically correct, foreign=
=20
traders usually set up their Japanese trading operations through the use of=
 a=20
dependent agent in Japan.  The Japanese dependent agent is usually reimburs=
ed=20
using cost plus 5%, at least initially.  Then, if the Japanese tax=20
authorities raise questions upon audit, a commission arrangement is general=
ly=20
used, with the question being what should the profit split be between the=
=20
agent and the foreign company.  Whether the Japanese tax authorities raise=
=20
questions upon audit is dependent upon the volume of trades and the magnitu=
de=20
of the trades.  The PWC Japanese tax partner suggested that we use this=20
arrangement for both the FX trader and the EM Japan trades.  I have asked P=
WC=20
to send this advice in writing by tomorrow.

This seems to be a much more pragmatic approach than the one suggested by=
=20
Baker & McKenzie.  And it should be easy to implement by year-end.  However=
,=20
management must be aware of the fact that PWC's approach could raise=20
questions upon a Japanese tax audit.  Note that if we follow this approach,=
=20
we would need to set up a services agreement between Enron Japan (whichever=
=20
the appropriate entity is) and ENA.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional=20
information.

Best regards,
Susan

Thanks for the note Susan. Like you, I would love to get the funding resolv=
ed=20
before year-end as we have finalised the amounting owing to Houston etc=20
(subject to some invoices etc being received) so it would be a good time to=
=20
get this done.=20

Re the FX trader, I have been harassing Sheila a bit this week, so I was=20
hoping to hear from you or her on the progress here. At this stage I=20
understand that the deals are still being done in the name of ENA, but ther=
e=20
have not been alot, so again if we can get this addressed before the volume=
=20
grows it would be best for all. I was reviewing this matter with JEB=20
yesterday and he indicated that his preference is for an agency style=20
agreement which avoids the need for the back to back deals.=20

With thanks

Janine:

Thanks for the update.  Any word on the Japanese FX desk principal?  Sara
=09Janine Juggins
=0912/13/2000 04:04 PM
=09=09
Your summary is correct based on information to date (in this regard the=20
agreement between ENA and EEFT still requires amendment in respect of RMT a=
nd=20
I undertake to get this done).=20

However, please note that there have been some last minute changes in the=
=20
Japanese tax advice, received I understand only as of last night. Susan Mus=
ch=20
will be following up on these changes at a meeting today with Sheila Glover=
=20
and Darren Delage, and has undertaken to keep you appraised of the position=
.=20
The effect of the change would be to permit RMT to be the principal for the=
=20
Japanese FX desk, with a Japanese entity acting as agent to arrange the=20
transactions.=20

Best regards
Janine

Janine:

With respect to the attached (internal) FX product for EOL, I just wanted t=
o=20
verify with you that internal counterparties should transact on EOL with:

(1)  RMT  (as principal for Houston FX desk)

(2)  EEFT as agent for RMT (as principal for London FX desk).  In this=20
regard, was the services agreement between ENA and EEFT ever extended to=20
include RMT for internal trades?=20

(3)  Enron Japan Corp. (as principal for Tokyo FX desk)

There appears to be some confusion since our meeting of November 3.  Thanks=

Please call. The parties need to exchange documents and the boilerplate

we could exchange fax signatures and your counterparty can fax evidence of 
authority to enter into the master and transactions.

In any event, we need to execute duplicate originals, one for each party.

Sara,

I don't think that we ever got around to talking about how we should notify 
Chase of this change.  Could we do that before I leave?  Hopefully sometime 
this week.
Does the ISDA cover publication changes?  Somehow I thought it did.  It does 
doesn't it?  I just can't remember in which section.
Many thanks,

Lucy,

Effective September 1st, Natural Gas Intelligence changed the reporting of 
the California Border and City-Gate 1st of month indices.  These indices were 
formerly reported in a separate table.  That table has been eliminated and 
these indices have been included within the general table.   These changes 
are minor; however, we need to ensure that Chase knows of the change.  Can 
you please handle this?  It affects Glendale, Pasadena and SMUD.

The following are the new definitions:

1.  Malin:  the "Bidweek Avg." price for California, Malin, published in 
Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor publication, in the first issue 
published on or about the first Monday of the delivery Month in the table 
identified as "Spot Gas Prices".

2. Kern River Station: the "Bidweek Avg" price for California, Kern River 
Station, PG&E, published in Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor 
publication, in the first issue published on or about the first Monday of the 
delivery Month in the table identified as "Spot Gas Prices".

3.  Topock: the "Bidweek Avg" price for California, Southern Cal. Border 
Avg., published in Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor publication, in the 
first issue published on or about the first Monday of the delivery Month in 
the table identified as "Spot Gas Prices".

4.  PG&E Citygate: the "Bidweek Avg" price for California, PG&E Citygate, 
published in Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor publication, in the first 
issue published on or about the first Monday of the delivery Month in the 
table identified as "Spot Gas Prices". 

Glendale and Pasadena are affected at Topock.  SMUD is affected at all four 
points.

Let me know if you need additional clarification or information.

Thanks for your help.

Per review of the Risk Management Policy and discussion with Rick Buy, the 
Chief Risk Officer is responsible for maintaining the list of authorized 
traders for Enron.  I am charged by Rick with the policy administration 
responsibility, and consequently, Veronica and I have been in the process of 
obtaining updated authorized trader lists.  I understand from talking with 
Legal today that in the past Mike Moscoso from Shona's group maintained this 
list and provided it to Legal, so I think there are several versions of 
authorized trader lists floating around.  I noticed this since the brokerage 
agreements and officer's compliance certificate that I have to sign had 
attached a list that was inconsistent with our records in RAC.

Anyway, we're getting the "official" list together - hopefully by Monday, at

ED:

(1)  The Alcoa lawyer wants to adopt the terms of the ENA/Alcoa Inc. master 
for purposes of the December deal.

(2)  EWEB has requested the following provision:

DEFAULT RATE shall mean the lesser of (a) the per annum rate of interest 
equal to the prime lending rate as may from time to time be published in "the 
Wall Street Journal" under "Money Rates" on such day (or if not published on 
such day the most recent preceding day on which published), plus two percent 
(2%) but not to exceed in total fourteen percent (14%) annually, and (b) the 
maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

Please let me hear from you.  

Sara

Holli:

I have still not received the above-mentioned comments.  I have also not 
received EWEB's proposed form of legal opinion.  I will go ahead and 
blackline the Schedule once again.

When the lawyers last spoke, we agreed to execute all docs prior to the end 
of the year.

Would you please call EWEB and inquire about these items?

Thanks.  Sara

Holli:

Please verify that the earliest TRADE DATE with EWEB was October 30, 2000 
(which was approved by the EWEB Board on October 3, 2000 according to the 
December 5, 2000 resolution).  I have a copy of the resolution.  Thanks.  
Sara

ED:

A second EWEB question:

EWEB wants the definition of "Applicable Rate"  to remain without changing to 
the Non-default Rate if the payee is the defaulting party.  They say they 
must have a "balanced rate".  Please let me hear from you.  Sara

We need to send today BUT we need an immediate cover letter (itemizing every 
step to be taken) and sample resolution format to email to the counterparty

Let me know if you have questions.  Sara

Maria:

Can you provide me with a blackline of one of the confirms below marked 
against the draft which Enron marked up and faxed to Steve on September 1,

     Attached is a draft of the equity forward contract which we believe is
     compliant with EITF Issue 00-19.  Please have your auditors review it
     to determine if this contract should get equity treatment under 00-19.

     The document is blacklined against your outstanding equity forward
     contract so that you can easily identify the changes.

     I'll touch base with you on Monday.

Just got your voice mail.  I have severe laryngitis and I cannot use my voice 
today or tomorrow.  Sorry.  We can e-mail or speak through Marie.  
Yes, we have a blackline.  Marie has finished going through it and I need to 
review (the lawyers blacklined the latest version over the second blackline 
so we had to revert to a comparision to the first blackline!).  Re: the 
credit support annex, I believe all is resolved.  However, I believe there is 
still an L/C issue.  If there is an L/C default (say the issuer is 
downgraded), Tiger is insisting that we post cash immediately without the 
right to post a  substitute L/C within two days.  I am not absolutely certain 
of this, but Carol has a 2 pm call with the lawyers and I will listen.  I 
don't know if Tiger responded to our guaranty.  I was out sick yesterday.  
Hope this brings you up to date.  SS

Chris:

The master you are referring to was drafted in March, 1999 in the name of 
"Air Liquide America Corp." and needs to be updated from both a credit and 
legal perspective.  Last time, Kelly Minear had to visit the counterparty's 
office to review financials since the company was private.  We will need an 
updated credit worksheet to prepare a new draft.

Tracy and Ed:  Will  one of you update the prior credit to begin the process?

Thanks.  Sara

A customer of John Malowney, Air Liquide, wants to revisit the possibility of 
executing a Master ISDA.  He said he thought we had already done one and sent 
it to them but he has lost it.  Can you check to see if you can find it and 
e-mail it to me?

Sam:

Don't you have a new address by now?  I remember you said that you were 
moving into a plush high-rise overlooking the great southern city of Atlanta, 
home of the Peach Bowl!   Please email me and let me know.

A belated thanks for the birthday card.  I had a fabulous birthday in Napa 
Valley at Auberge d'Soleil with my little sister and friends.  We drank 
wonderful wines and dined in great restaurants - and had great weather.

Hope you're doing well.

Have you started any new business ventures?  Maybe taken Wendy's to Amelia 
Island Plantation?  Or better yet, purchased the water rights to Palm Springs?

I'm just hangin' in Houston, same old job, etc.  I joined my two friends 
Monty and Keith for our annual birthday celebration at Galatoire's about two 
weeks ago.  It's always great fun.   I think I get to plan a reunion of 
Gordon, Arata et al ex-pats.  There are about thirty of us scattered around 
the country.

My regards to Beverly and Helen.

In connection with our disussion regarding Market Quotation and "Reference

clause (b) to the Section 12 definition), I am advised that it would be 
difficult to locate four leading dealers with offices in the same city.  With 
respect to the outstanding trades, for example, we would like to know which 
city has  four leading dealers  for quoting Mid-Columbia prices?  Please let

The only change from our previous conversation is the addition of a bilateral 
additional event of default tied to a debt rating (below BBB-) of the 
counterparty or the guarantor if applicable.

Guarantors:
1. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
2. not required; entity rated AA
3. not requried; entity rated AA
4. Bear Stearns Cos. Inc.
5. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.
6. not required; entity rated AA

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

Tanya:  Based upon our earlier conversation, I will begin preparing masters 
for the following parties with (1) no CSA, (2) bilateral cross-default at 
US$100 million and (3) uncapped (or min US$100 million cap) guaranties for 
counterparties required to post guaranties.  The parties on Clint's list are:

(1)  Lehman Brothers Finance S.A. [have form of master and a form of guaranty 
from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] - Stephanie Panus

(2)  Credit Suisse First Boston International [no form of master]

(3)  Deutsche Bank AG [have a form of master from ENA negotiations]

(4)  Bear Stearns International Limited [no form of master] - Samantha Boyd

(5)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. [may develop form from ENA 
negotiations]

(6)  Credit Agricole Indosuez S.A.

Tanya:  Please let me know if any of the foregoing require parent guaranties.

Clint:  Please identify the lawyer to whom I should address comments.  Also, 
are there any others?  ENE has an agreement with Toronto Dominion, NY Branch.

Samantha:  Please assign Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank and let me know who 
is handling.

Trigger/Determined Amount inverse relationship:

"In the event the Trigger Price is increased to equal the Other Trigger
Price, the Determined Amount shall be reduced so that the Effective Share
Price is increased in direct proportion to the increase in the Trigger
Price.  The "Effective Share Price" shall be the result obtained by dividing
X by Y where "X" equals the product of the Price Per Share multiplied by the
Number of Shares, and "Y" equals the Number of Shares plus the Determined
Amount."

Paragraph 3(a) first paragraph, 3rd sentence replacement:

"In the event that, but for this Section 3, titled "Other Provisions," Party
B would be obligated to deliver a number of Shares equal to the Determined
Amount plus the Excess Shares, Party B shall have an ongoing obligation to
satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares; provided however that the number of
Excess Shares to be delivered hereby shall not exceed [________] shares.
Party B may, at its sole option, satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares by
using its best efforts to increase its Authorized Shares or by delivery of a
cash payment equal to the [product obtained by multiplying the Excess Shares
by the Final Price]."

Hey, man, what's up?  Have we thought this through practically?
Thanks for the email update. Sorry to hear you're sick and hope the voice 
comes back soon.

I thought we discussed the l/c issue and agreed that if the l/c defaulted on 
payment that we would go to cash. The question was timing, i.e. was it 2 days 
or 5 days before the cash was do in. I have an appointment out of the office 
at 3pm my time and won't be bale to join the call, but if it helps I can call 
to follow up when I am free at aroung 5PM my time.

Let me know how the call goes.

Just got your voice mail.  I have severe laryngitis and I cannot use my voice 
today or tomorrow.  Sorry.  We can e-mail or speak through Marie.  
Yes, we have a blackline.  Marie has finished going through it and I need to 
review (the lawyers blacklined the latest version over the second blackline 
so we had to revert to a comparision to the first blackline!).  Re: the 
credit support annex, I believe all is resolved.  However, I believe there is 
still an L/C issue.  If there is an L/C default (say the issuer is 
downgraded), Tiger is insisting that we post cash immediately without the 
right to post a  substitute L/C within two days.  I am not absolutely certain

Jim:

I have not seen any Enron Corp./CSFB agreements.

ENA has two different agreements with CSFB:

(1)  ISDA dated4/21/93.  This had:  NY law, submission to non-exclusive 
jurisdiction of NY courts/waiver of objections to venue, limitation of 
liability

(2)  Futures Agreement dated 9/21/00.  This had:  NY law, arbitration, 
limitation of liability

Christine Lee has arranged for the UBS lawyer, David Kelly, to be available 
for a  conference call on Dec. 21 at 9 a.m. HOUSTON TIME (10 a.m NY TIME).  
Enron will call Christine at UBS.  Christine has discussed our document 
(markup of forward confirmation emailed to everyone on 12/19/00) with the 
lawyer.

Jim:  Can we get your small conference room?

Sara  

	"Dranguet, Beth Ann" <badranguet@velaw.com>
	12/19/2000 09:52 PM
		 
Sara,

I am still working on the share repurchase program question but wanted to
get to you what answers I had.

1. On UBS, the language we discussed could be drafted as follows:

"In the event the Trigger Price is increased to equal the Other Trigger
Price, the Determined Amount shall be reduced so that the Effective Share
Price is increased in direct proportion to the increase in the Trigger
Price.  The "Effective Share Price" shall be the result obtained by dividing
X by Y where "X" equals the product of the Price Per Share multiplied by the
Number of Shares, and "Y" equals the Number of Shares plus the Determined
Amount."

2. I was able to find a summary of the November 15-16, 2000 Emerging
Issues Task Force meeting discussing the "best efforts" language in
increasing the authorized shares.  I would propose revising the stricken
language in 3(a) to read as follows:

"In the event that, but for this Section 3, titled "Other Provisions," Party
B would be obligated to deliver a number of Shares equal to the Determined
Amount plus the Excess Shares, Party B shall have an ongoing obligation to
satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares; provided however that the number of
Excess Shares to be delivered hereby shall not exceed [________] shares.
Party B may, at its sole option, satisfy delivery of the Excess Shares by
using its best efforts to increase its Authorized Shares or by delivery of a
cash payment equal to the [product obtained by multiplying the Excess Shares
by the Final Price]."

Please confirm that the formula for the cash payment is appropriate.  Their
language puts a cap on the number of shares to be delivered but that cap is
tied to a value making the number of shares to be delivered indeterminate
and therefor outside your control.  The cap drafted above solves this
problem.  It is important to note that no interest can accrue while Party B
is waiting to get approval to increase its authorized shares, if so the
obligation would be accounted for as debt.

2.  We accepted Portland as a forum for arbitration.
3.  We need to discuss your invoicing procedure.
4.  We are waiting to comment back on the revised reps pending receipt of the 
CSA and legal opinion.
5.  We have added some language to the recording provision to acknowledge 
internal recording destruction policies.
6.  We have not revised the Reference Market-maker provision.  Have you had a 
chance to consider my email of 12/19/00?

Please let us know when we will receive the remaining documentation so that 
we can finalize our negotiations.

We emailed the Schedule on Dec. 18.

We Fed Exp'd the "package" (except the ENE guaranty which is being executed)

Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc. ("EMMT") has agreed to provide to 
ENA two (2) separate guaranty agreements:  (i) the first guaranty from Edison 
Mission Energy for four (4) specific swaps that were previously entered into 
with ENA, and (ii) the second guaranty from Edison Mission Midwest Holdings 
Co. for other financial transactions (previously entered into and for new 
swaps).

EMMT had previously provided to me their guaranty format (which actually 
looks like a combination of a previously accepted physical power gty and the 
financial guaranty format that ENA sends with ISDA drafts).  I have taken 
EMMT's format and took a stab at reviewing/commenting on their format by 
following our accepted format.  There are two guaranty format attachments 
below that have my red-lined comments for ENA financial legal's review.  The 
third attachment is my suggestion to add the 4 executed confirms for the 
Edison Mission Energy gty as a Schedule A to the gty (for your review and 
comments as well).

In summary and for clarification, the terms for both guaranties are as 
follows:
(i)  Guarantor:  Edison Mission Midwest Holdings Co.
Covered CP:  Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc.
(ii)  Guarantor:  Edison Mission Energy
Covered CP:  Edison Mission Marketing & Trading, Inc.
I made efforts on wearing my "legal hat" by the red-lined comments to the 
guaranty format.  Feel free to modify/accept/add comments, etc.  I would 
appreciate your immediate attention to the requested reviews.  I am available 
in Portland at 503-464-8755 or (cell 503-807-5633) should you have any 
questions regarding the aforementioned.  In the essence of time, Credit is 
requesting that legal provide comments given that there is NO EXECUTED MASTER 
ISDA.  It is critical that we accept the guaranties first once negotiated, 
and pursue an ISDA early next year.

Thanks for all of your prompt attention regarding this matter.

Regards,
Tracy

Stephanie,

I am following up on the above-referenced Agreement on behalf of Richard
Weiss of this office. Before we can send the execution copies to our Zurich
office for signature, we have to obtain an Apostille for the Certificate of
Incorporation and By-laws which you provided. Presently we are waiting on
that. The Guarantee has been prepared and the legal opinion is in the
process of being signed. I hope to have everything to you by next week
sometime.

Please feel free to reply with any questions you might have.

Thank you,

     Sara,

     Attached is the newly marked up version of the contract.  The
     highlights are as follows (not all changes are addressed below):

     1)  Dividend language has been inserted on page 6.  We may have to do
     something with the structure since there are two "Method of
     Adjustments."

     2)  On page 11 and 12, we reinserted our language in sections (iii)
     and (v) but conformed them to your Registration Provisions.  We needed
     to reinsert the language in (iii) for section (v) to work.

     3) On page 13, I reinserted our "best efforts ongoing obligation"
     language.  The reason I did this is because I realized that they way
     you had it drafted in the email does not work from an accounting
     perspective.

     4)  On page 14, 1st paragraph, the words "but prior to the Settlement
     Date" was added for accounting purposes.

     5)  The new ratcheting Trigger Price language was added on page 14.

     Please call me after you have reviewed the markup to verify that we
     are in agreement on the terms.

     Regards,
     Christine

I received your message and tried to speak with CSFB and Jim Armogida.  In 
each instance, unfortunately, I had to leave voice mails.  It was just about 
2 hours ago that I told CSFB that we were done (having left the negotiation 
of Paragraph 10.1 to Jim)!  

I am forwarding the latest UBS comments to you just in case I have the urge 
to call you for advice.

Have a Merry Christmas.  I'm off to New Orleans this evening for the holiday 
weekend.  In fact, there's a new Susan Spicer restaurant called "Herbsaint" 
and I should be dining there in about 6 hours.

     Dear Sara, Clint and Jeff:

     David Kelly reviewed the contract I sent you last night and asked me
     to make the following additional changes:

     1)  In Registration Provisions, change in two places "this equity
     derivatives transaction" to read "this Transaction."

     2)  Move dividend adjustment language to the "Amendment of the Equity
     Definitions" section.

     3)  On page 14, I inserted the necessary ratcheting trigger language
     that I inadvertently deleted yesterday.

     The revised document is attached.

     As Jeff and I agreed today, we are going to restructure the floating
     rate forward so that it will be a fixed rate forward.  We will
     therefore use the same confirmation for both transactions.

     We will restructure the forward as of 12/26/00 using $73.6797 as the
     base price.  This price represents the forward price as of 12/12
     ($73.5941) plus interest up to 12/26 ($0.2107) less the dividend paid
     on 12/20 ($0.1251).

     The rate we will use to calculate the interest on the forward will be
     interpolated between 3 and 4 month LIBOR set on 12/26 plus 65 basis
     points.  The forward price will be reduced by the expected dividend of
     $0.125 per share paid around 3/20/01.

     The maturity of the forward will remain April 12, 2001.

     I will be on vacation next week but Mike Collins will be able to help
     you.  He can be reached at 203-719-8385.

     Happy Holidays to you all!

     Regards,
     Christine

Enron is closed on Tuesday 12/26/00.  We can talk on Wednesday 12/27/00, at 
your convenience.  Also, I will be out of the office on Friday 12/29/00.  
Will I have your CSA before 3 pm Houston Time today?

Sara:  Thanks for the revised schedule and comments.  I will be reviewing
and discussing them with EWEB tomorrow (Friday, 12/22).  In the meantime,
attached for your review is our draft form of legal opinion resulting from
our discussion last week.

Perhaps we can arrange time for a conference call on Tuesday, 12/26/00, to
finalize our negotiations?

-Jim

Jim:

Attached is a revised Schedule.  We have accepted most of your changes.  I
believe that the outstanding issues include:

1.  Please note the revised Threshold which we previously discussed.
2.  We accepted Portland as a forum for arbitration.
3.  We need to discuss your invoicing procedure.
4.  We are waiting to comment back on the revised reps pending receipt of
the CSA and legal opinion.
5.  We have added some language to the recording provision to acknowledge
internal recording destruction policies.
6.  We have not revised the Reference Market-maker provision.  Have you had
a chance to consider my email of 12/19/00?

Please let us know when we will receive the remaining documentation so that
we can finalize our negotiations.

Regards.  Sara

Friday,  11/22/00 was an Exchange holiday.  "Preceding" is fine as the 
business day convention as long as the change is made in all of the relevant 
swaps.  SS

Sara, I assume that the below is okay.  Can you let me know if you have dealt 
with this, as I have been out of the office until today.

Thanks

Greg
I am not sure which of you handles the commodity swaps so I am sending this 
to all of you.? The final Pricing Date for the Commodity Swap (your reference 
Q19197) is today and we noticed a discrepancy in the swap we have with you 
and the one with Chase.? In our Chase swap we specified that the Pricing 
Dates for Floating Price are each Friday in the Calculation Period subject to 
adjustment in accordance with the Preceding Business Day Convention.? No 
Business Day Convention was specified in the swap we have with you and it 
will be an issue as US Thanksgiving in November was on a Friday.? Since the 
Floating Payments we make to Chase (which flow back to you) need to match the 
payments you give to us, we need to amend our swap with you to specify 
Preceding Business Day Convention.? Can you let me know if this is acceptable 
and I will prepare an amendment or please call me to discuss.

Sara/Tana, will you guys be preparing the amended confirms to include the 
language?  Once they are prepared, if you e-mail them to me, I will get them 
executed and sent to Tracy for execution by RBC.

Thanks

Greg
As discussed, the RBC/Enron swap confirmation needs to be amended so that the 
Pricing Dates are subject to the Preceding Business Day Convention.? As the 
original commodity swap confirmation was prepared by Enron therefore, can you 
please send out an amended confirmation which deletes Floating Price and 
Pricing Date(s) in its entirety and replaces it with the attached.? The 
amended confirmation should be sent to Ruth-Ann Marchis for signature.? Her 
fax number is 416-842-4314.

Please call me with and questions or comments.

This was received Friday evening.  Clint has not seen but we have been 
discussing this morning.  Sara
	Christine.Lee@ubsw.com
	12/22/2000 07:49 PM
		 
     Dear Sara, Clint and Jeff:

     David Kelly reviewed the contract I sent you last night and asked me
     to make the following additional changes:

     1)  In Registration Provisions, change in two places "this equity
     derivatives transaction" to read "this Transaction."

     2)  Move dividend adjustment language to the "Amendment of the Equity
     Definitions" section.

     3)  On page 14, I inserted the necessary ratcheting trigger language
     that I inadvertently deleted yesterday.

     The revised document is attached.

     As Jeff and I agreed today, we are going to restructure the floating
     rate forward so that it will be a fixed rate forward.  We will
     therefore use the same confirmation for both transactions.

     We will restructure the forward as of 12/26/00 using $73.6797 as the
     base price.  This price represents the forward price as of 12/12
     ($73.5941) plus interest up to 12/26 ($0.2107) less the dividend paid
     on 12/20 ($0.1251).

     The rate we will use to calculate the interest on the forward will be
     interpolated between 3 and 4 month LIBOR set on 12/26 plus 65 basis
     points.  The forward price will be reduced by the expected dividend of
     $0.125 per share paid around 3/20/01.

     The maturity of the forward will remain April 12, 2001.

     I will be on vacation next week but Mike Collins will be able to help
     you.  He can be reached at 203-719-8385.

     Happy Holidays to you all!

     Regards,
     Christine

Sharen:

In connection with the two (2) swap confirmations which you are revising 
(from a "Deemed ISDA" format to a regular ISDA format), I ask that you please 
contact  Stephanie to review the final forms.  Please note the following:

(1)  Melissa's prior "Deemed ISDA" drafts (dated Nov. 22, 2000) show ENA swap 
nos. as 447459.4 and 447459.02.  One of your confims doesn't match:  it says 
447459.04.  Please verify the correct number.

(2)  You can eliminate the "Payment Date(s)" section from the General Terms 
because individual Payment Dates appear in both the Fixed and Floating 
Details.

After either Tana or Stephanie have approved, please email to EWEB as follows 
(with a copy to Holli Krebs):

jdeason@chbh.com
Dick.Varner@eweb.eugene.or.us

NOTE TO STEPHANIE:  copies of my markups  and the Deemed ISDA's are located 
in a file entitled "EWEB confirmations".  Also, the ISDA has not been signed 
but will be dated October 30, 2000.

ED:

EWEB has requested a blackline of the ISDA and is ready to sign next week.  
Your MAC references the "Electric System" which is defined in the Bond 
Indenture which I sent to you earlier today.  It looks to me like the 
Electric System includes physical and intangible assets acquired by the Board 
as a separate utility system, including generating and transmission 
facilities and the Trojan Project (not sure what this is).  I've asked 
Stephanie to revise our docs to incorporate these definitions.  Please review 
the CSA when Stephanie sends it to you (and comment) and I can send first 
thing on Tuesday.  Thanks.  Sara

Stephanie:  Please send Ed a copy of the blacklined CSA when you are done.

Dick:

Sorry that I didn't have a chance to call you again today.  After reviewing 
the appendix (Board resolution summary), I would like to request an opinion 
from EWEB's bond counsel that swap/other transaction payments are payable 
from the Operating Fund (together and in parity with other operating costs) 
and precede EWEB's debt service payments.

Also, can you please describe EWEB's Master Resolution (relevant to long term 
bonded indebtedness) as this is to be referenced in Larry Cable's legal 
opinion.

I will be back in the office on Tuesday, Jan. 2.  Have a happy new year.

Thanks.  Sara

Stephanie:

Happy New Year!

I have assigned you to this former Marie Heard file.  We need to overnight 
copies of the master agreement (boilerplate and all) to Neel Lemon in 
Dallas.  He does not need ENA's or the CP's background documentation.  You 
can send the ENE guaranty.  This company has undergone a franchise tax

Please feel free to call Forest Felvey at CSI to check signals on the
confidentiality agreement issue you mentioned.  He will verify that Baker
Botts is assisting CSI on swap issues and that it is okay to communicate
with me.  [I've copied Forest with this email for his info.]

As we discussed, I will get you copies of the new LPS documentation relating

All:

Following is a list of outsanding items:

(1)  ISDA Master Agreement (Schedule and Credit Support Annex)
        I need to better understand EWEB's proposed settlement language.  ENA 
generally sends an invoice when the counterparty owes a payment (but not  
when ENA owes a payment).  The invoice reflects the outstanding transactions 
for a given Calculation Period and the net amount owed.  ENA can   generate 
this invoice in all cases.  Does EWEB intend that BOTH parties always send 
reciprocal invoices?  Is is necessary that the Calc Agent ALSO  make a phone 
call?  What does EWEB's language "separate invoices and documentation 
covering each Transaction sufficient to permit the other   party to comply 
with its interanl accounting and record keeping procedures concerning 
individual Transactions" mean?

 Please call me to resolve.

 When can we execute?

(2)  Cable Huston legal opinion:  please add

 (1)  opening paragraph:  "(iii)  the Confirmations for Transactions ENA 
Contracts Nos. 447459.02 and 447459.4 each dated October 30, 2000 ..."

 (2)  Paragraph 12 prior to the period in the first sentence:  "as  those 
terms are defined in the Master Resolution adopted by the EWEB Board on June  
16, 1986, as supplemented"

(3)  the two (2) confirmations
 These require execution by EWEB.  When will this be done?

(4)  Bond Counsel opinion
 Dick, I sent you  an email on Friday.  ENA is pleased to discuss with your 
counsel.  Please refer to Larry's legal opinion:  the deleted Paragraph 10  
of the December 21, 2000 draft and the Paragraph 12 of the  December 30, 2000 
draft for the type of information requested.

Please let me know if I have left out any items.  I would like to finalize 
documentation today.

Dear Danny 

We have had extensive discussions with Rabo concerning deal mechanics, and 
the relevant documentary issues.? Here is a summary of the salient points, 
none of which should hopefully be problematic:

1.????? Notwithstanding the structural logic, Rabo are not keen to purchase 
Psyche (the feeling is that it would cause all kinds of internal problems, 
and might disturb the credit process which to date is running smoothly).? As 
such, we should revert to the original idea of payments to Psyche by Heracles 
being irrevocably assigned to RBC, who will then assign them to? Rabo as a 
part of our deal with them.? We note that as currently drafted, the payments 
by Heracles to Psyche would still take place.? It would obviously be 
preferable if Heracles could be directed to make payments directly to RBC.? 
Alternatively, EAH would need to sign a direction on day one (as Member of 
Psyche) that all payments received from Heracles should be paid to RBC.? We 
understand that EAH would give a charge over the Member Interest of Psyche in 
favour of RBC.

2.????? The Sales Agency Agreement should lapse, as it currently allows. 

3.????? In its place, either a version of the old clause 6.07 should be 
reinserted into the Aeneas LLC agreement, or a new Sales Agency Agreement 
would be struck with Rabo, in either event stipulating a mandatory sale of 
the EOG shares (under Rule 144) in the event of either a failed auction, or a 
valid auction with Rabo as winning bidder.? There would be no other trigger 
events (ie no necessity for Enron to be downgraded). 

4.????? Rabo will negotiate directly with ENA/Enron on the EOG market swap, 
and ISDA. 

5.????? Rabo and RBC will negotiate as between themselves on the TRS and 
ISDA. 

At present, we are all shooting for execution on Jan 15th.? 

Kind regards 

David Bermingham 

Attached are first drafts of the following documents to be used in 
connection with the insertion of an insurance company into the 
transaction: (1) Assignment and Waiver Agreement, (2) Swap Confirmation 
between the Agent and the Insurance Company (blacklined against the 
current Cerberus Swap Confirmation) and (3) Instrument of Assignment 
whereby Aeneas will assign the balance of its note to RBC (blacklined 
against the Assignment executed on November 30, 2000). 
? 
With regard to the Swap schedule to be entered into between the Agent 
and the Insurance Company, it would be helpful to know whether RBC and 
the Insurance Company have entered into any recent Swap transactions so 
we can follow the general provisions. 
? 
I believe that RBC was going to produce a draft Swap confirmation for 
the Swap to be entered into between ENA and the Insurance Company, but 
please could RBC confirm.? It also would be helpful to see an example of 
a Swap schedule which may have been entered into between Enron and the 
Insurance Company in a different transaction (if one exists). 
? 
With regard to the Sales Agency Agreement, it would be our preference 
still to have RBC as the party to the Sales Agency Agreement, but 
agreeing to act at the direction of the Insurance Company in certain 
circumstances. 
? 
I will be in our Houston office for most of Thursday in Conference Room 
42 Main at 713-220-4242, returning to Dallas Thursday evening when I 
will be contactable at 214-659-4645.

Dear Sara,

Attached please find our response to the draft Amendment to the CSA
for the above-referenced Agreement.  You will note that I have added
some additional language which our Legal Dept. prefers to include in
Amendments, which I trust will be acceptable to you as well.  As
mentioned briefly over the telephone the other day, I have also
incorporated some changes with respect to Letter of Credit provisions.

The changes to the LC terms are those which our Credit Department is
requiring as a result of a review of Cargill's LC language.  The main
issue is that an LC issued as collateral can no longer be transferable.
I note from the file on our ISDA negotiations that Enron may have
preferred transferability in order to be able to transfer an LC to
its Affiliates.  If this is still the case, we can certainly discuss
options which may specify and limit transferability accordingly.

I look forward to your response at your earliest opportunity.

recalling?  SS

Lucy Ortiz
10/21/99 03:08 PM
What is the formal format we have for notifying Chase?  Do I need to send 
them the edition that announced the change or ???  
What is your suggestion?
I bring this up only because we were so adamant about creating the 
confirmation and then e-mailing it over to Chase so that they could be the 
confirming party.

~I mean, do we need to draft the changes that we want on the confirm and send 
it over to them and ask them to change the confirm???

~Or is all of this covered under the ISDA and we only need to make them aware 
that  the publication made some changes?

Sara Shackleton
10/21/99 01:28 PM
I thought we had devised a format for any response.  I'm glad to meet with 
you anytime.  Currently, I have severe laryngitis and I am unable to speak.  
I will probably be limited on Friday as well.  We can manage if you come to 
my office.  Let me know.  SS

Sara,

I don't think that we ever got around to talking about how we should notify 
Chase of this change.  Could we do that before I leave?  Hopefully sometime 
this week.
Does the ISDA cover publication changes?  Somehow I thought it did.  It does 
doesn't it?  I just can't remember in which section.
Many thanks,

Lucy

Lucy,

Effective September 1st, Natural Gas Intelligence changed the reporting of 
the California Border and City-Gate 1st of month indices.  These indices were 
formerly reported in a separate table.  That table has been eliminated and 
these indices have been included within the general table.   These changes 
are minor; however, we need to ensure that Chase knows of the change.  Can 
you please handle this?  It affects Glendale, Pasadena and SMUD.

The following are the new definitions:

1.  Malin:  the "Bidweek Avg." price for California, Malin, published in 
Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor publication, in the first issue 
published on or about the first Monday of the delivery Month in the table 
identified as "Spot Gas Prices".

2. Kern River Station: the "Bidweek Avg" price for California, Kern River 
Station, PG&E, published in Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor 
publication, in the first issue published on or about the first Monday of the 
delivery Month in the table identified as "Spot Gas Prices".

3.  Topock: the "Bidweek Avg" price for California, Southern Cal. Border 
Avg., published in Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor publication, in the 
first issue published on or about the first Monday of the delivery Month in 
the table identified as "Spot Gas Prices".

4.  PG&E Citygate: the "Bidweek Avg" price for California, PG&E Citygate, 
published in Natural Gas Intelligence, or successor publication, in the first 
issue published on or about the first Monday of the delivery Month in the 
table identified as "Spot Gas Prices". 

Glendale and Pasadena are affected at Topock.  SMUD is affected at all four 
points.

Let me know if you need additional clarification or information.

Thanks for your help.

Laird

After our conversation, I spoke with our settlements people again who 
requested an EWEB invoice when Enron owes money to EWEB.  I propose that we 
add a section to the Schedule entitled "Accounts" (Part 3(h)) as follows:

"Prior to each payment date for any Transaction, Party A (ENA) shall provide 
Party B with an invoice reflecting the net payment owed by a party.  
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Party B shall provide Party A with an invoice 
prior to any payment date on which Party A owes a net payment to Party B.

Happy New Year Dan!

Just checking to verify that you received the order form that I faxed to you 
on December 18.  Please confirm.

Also, we brought a bottle of Freestone Hill to Pappas Steak House (on New 
Year's Eve) for everyone to try.  The sommeliers raved.

Sara,
If you are going to email the agreement you can send it to Alejandro Espinosa 
and Francisco Ruiz-Tagle. Their emails are listed below. In case you are 
going to mail a hard copy I will talk to Francisco later today and get the 
correct address.
Thanks,

Gustavo,

CMPC would like to sell us fixed financial newsprint for 3 years (2000-3000 
tons per month).  I quoted a bid of $596/mt based on the RISI East index and 
$598/mt based on the PPW index.  Going forward all price questions should be 
referred to Jay, and the final price would need to be confirmed at the time 
of deal closure.

Alejandro and Francisco would like to review a draft of a contract, and a 
draft is currently being completed in Legal. You should call to confirm where 
they would like the legal documents sent.  I presume that they would like one 
set to go to their attorneys in NY and one set to themselves in Chile.

Their Contact information:

Alejandro Espinosa  56-24-41-2271  aespinosa@gerencia.cmpc.cl
Francisco Ruiz-Tagle  56-24-41-2271  fruiztagle@gerencia.cmpc.cl

Thank you,

After our conversation, I spoke with our settlements people again who
requested an EWEB invoice when Enron owes money to EWEB.  I propose that we
add a section to the Schedule entitled "Accounts" (Part 3(h)) as follows:

"Prior to each payment date for any Transaction, Party A (ENA) shall
provide Party B with an invoice reflecting the net payment owed by a party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Party B shall provide Party A with an
invoice prior to any payment date on which Party A owes a net payment to
Party B.  With respect to all payments hereunder, and except as otherwise
directed in writing, the parties shall comply with the following payment
instructions:

[bank, account no., ABA no.]"

Please provide me with EWEB's account data and let me know if you have any
comments.  I'll send the blackline immediately after I hear from you.

Also, I have not received EXECUTED CONFIRMATIONS.  Have these been sent to
anyone at Enron?  Sara

Earlier this year, I negotiated this agreement with GS&C.  I cannot locate 
the agreement so GS&C is sending a copy.  The Enron party is ENA.  We now 
need to amend the authorized trader list which I will email to you.  ENA's 
use of GS&C's platform is for trading US treasuries, agencies, money market, 
corporates, JGB's.  We need to:

(1)  remove Harry Arora (who was the sole authorized trader)

(2)  add the following:       Darren Delage
   Shane Dallmann
   Ellen Su
   Pushkar Shahi
   Gary Hickerson

THIS IS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR GARY AND WE SHOULD TRY TO COMPLETE TODAY.

Tom:

I'm trying to finalize the ISDA Master Agreement with these guys.  We have 
one issue:

If there is a long-term market disruption event (i.e. over 3 days), and we 
have no fallback price, then we negotiate a price and ENA would normally 
obtain 2 quotes and average them.  Our position is that we prefer to obtain 
the quotes because if a disruption were to occur, we would obtain quotes for 
hundreds of deals in the same manner (because our agreements will all have 
the same provisions) and it is possible that 4 quotes may not be available.

NYSEG would like for each of ENA and NYSEG to obtain 2 quotes and then 
average the 4 quotes.

Are you agreeable to this?

Sara

Sara Shackleton

Below is a document containing "General Terms and Conditions" which is ALWAYS 
attached to a financial confirmation when the parties have no executed master 
agreement.  If Ed, Tracy or someone in credit needs to add credit to the 
transaction, then we ALSO attach an Annex B (counterparty specific credit 
provisions),  Annex B-1(collateral and exposure provisions) and a letter of 
credit format. 

I am only attaching the General Terms and Conditions.

Let me know if you still want to see the ISDA Master Agreement (preprinted 
boilerplate consisting of an agreement and Credit Support Annex which I 
cannot email) together with a sample Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the Credit 
Support Annex (which are the two "customized" pieces negotiated by legal) .

To my knowledge, we will trade these instruments via internal broker 
platforms (i.e., ENA traders will trade online rather than over the phone), 
such as Goldman Sachs, or directly over the phone.  All trades will be 
confirmed either online or verbally and ENA will receive a daily statement 
reflecting trades done the previous day.  ENA does not prepare a confirmation 
but will need to check out the broker statements.

I believe that these debt securities are issued in either book-entry form (in 
variable denominations) or as registered certificates (e.g., undivided 
interests in a mortgage pool).

We will trade US agencies and Japanese bonds with Goldman.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Notice No. 01-10
January 8, 2001

TO:        ALL NYMEX MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
ALL NYMEX CLEARING FIRMS
ALL NYMEX OPERATIONS MANAGERS

FROM:     Neal Wolkoff
          Executive Vice President

SUBJECT:     MARGIN RATE CHANGE FOR BACK MONTH CONTRACTS

Effective Date:    Monday, January 8, 2001 (close of business).

Futures Contract:  Henry Hub Natural Gas.

Contract Months: April 2001 and all Subsequent Contract Months.

Rate Change:

NYMEX Division Margins for the April 2001 Contract and all Subsequent
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts

Effective Date:    Monday, January 8, 2001 (close of business)

Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):            Old:  $7,000  New:  $5,000

Member Customer (Initial Margin):                Old:  $7,700  New:  $5,500

Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):            Old:  $9,450  New:  $6,750

Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by 
first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads 
by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the 
outright margin required for each leg of a spread.

Because there is a difference between the outright margin required for the 
February 2001 and March 2001 delivery months and other months, each spread 
which includes one leg in either the February 2001or March 2001 delivery 
months will have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at 
$11,500 starting on Monday, January 8, 2001.  This figure is determined as 
follows:

Example at Clearing Member Rates

One Long February 2001 or March 2001 NG    (1 x $14,000)   =        $14,000
One Short April 2001 - January 2004 NG       (1 x $5,000)    =   -     $  
5,000
Net Scan Risk                         ($14,000-$5,000) =        $  9,000
Spread Rate                          (1x $2,500)     =   +     $  2,500
Total Requirement                                 =        $11,500

NYMEX Division Margins on Natural Gas Futures Spreads:
Requirements for Spreads with One Leg in February 2001 or March 2001 
Contract,  and One in the April 2001 Contract or Subsequent Contracts

Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):               $11,500

Member Customer (Initial Margin):                   $12,650

Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):               $15,525

Should you have any questions regarding these changes, please contact Arthur 
McCoy at (212) 299-2928 or Joe Sanguedolce at (212) 299-2855.  This notice 
supersedes all previous notices regarding outright margins for the NYMEX 
Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contract.

Everything About Enron's Insurance Programs

That You Were Afraid To Ask

(or Didn't  Know to Ask)

Presented by
David Marshall
Enron Corporate Risk Management

Thursday, January 11, 2001
11:30 - 1:00

The Houston Room
601 Jefferson
(We've reserved the Enron Shuttle to transport the "non-walkers")

Lunch will be served.  Please RSVP to Pat Radford at 39282.

One of the goals of Jeff Hodge and Barbara Gray is to increase the level of 
departmental information sharing activities.  Since we are faced on a daily 
basis with insurance matters in contract drafting and client advising, the 
East/Upstream Origination and Trading Group felt it would be productive to 
have Enron's Corporate Risk Management Group give a presentation on current 
Enron Insurance Programs, policies and contractual risk allocation 
preferences.  It then occured to us that this subject might be of interest to 
all of the lawyers on the 38th floor.   Please join us next Thursday.   

Sorry for the inconvenient location.  We'll make it worth your while with the 
quality of the food and the presentation.

Marcia:

Mike Kelly asked that I send you a copy of our GTC's for financial trades 
which must be attached to all confirmations (in the absence of an executed 
ISDA Master Agreement).  ENA has been using these GTC's for quite some time.  
Please let me know if you have any questions.  Sara

Sara Shackleton

Patricia:  I was just checking to see if you have had an opportunity to 
review our ISDA Schedule for the referenced entities.  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.  I believe that Susan Flynn in our office faxed you a 
copy of our form of Schedule last week. I look forward to hearing from you.

Tanya:

Enron Corp, (global finance) has a FASB 125 structured deal executed in Dec., 
2000 which requires amendment for tax purposes.  A new  total return equity 
swap on EOG stock will need to be executed between ENA and Rabo.  ENA must be 
the swap counterparty ("normal course of business") for the legal opinion 
which must be issued for the structure.  I would like to send Rabo our ISDA 
format so as to avoid any surprises; time is short.  I assume we do not want 
a CSA but will require an Enron Corp. guaranty.  Do we want cross default and 
Credit Event Upon Merger to apply to the parties?   Do we want to 
add/eliminate additional events of default?  The ultimate Schedule will 
probably look very different from our standard but we need to urge our format 
as much as possible.  

Please call me to update.  This update is currently scheduled to close next 
Friday.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara Shackleton

there may be some agreed to changes on the L/C side.  Carol St. Clair is

redraft.  Marie is not in the office today.  If you want to speak to a

Folks,

We are confirmed for our meeting next Wednesday the 17th in room 3125b at 3 
pm.  To reiterate, the purpose of the meeting will be to clarify the 
procedures for implementing ISDA agreements with counterparties interested in 
financial derivative transactions.  The goal is for everyone to understand 
the process as it relates to different types of counterparties and to 
streamline the internal process wherever possible.

See you next week.

-Mike
ex 3-3947

I've left a message for Dave Adams (legal) to call back AND described to him 
the following situation:

ENA and NRG have executed OVER 130 financial deals both online (EOL) and 
offline WITHOUT EVER CHANGING ANY OF THE GTC's.  
In the absence of an executed master agreement, we never want the GTC's to 
change!  The reason is that bankruptcy protection for swap agreements 
requires a single agreement for all swap transactions.  If you don't have an 
ISDA master agreement in place, you want your single set of GTC's to be 
viewed by a court as a single agreement.  Having different versions of the 
GTC's does not look like a single agreement.

I will try to convince Dave Adams that we should retain our GTC's but move 
forward on an ISDA which would then govern all online and offline trades.

How are you going - did you have a good Thanksgiving?  Coincidentally 
Thursday was also a holiday here - we were celebrating Respect for the Aged 
Day though.

Actually, Sara, I was wondering how we are going in getting some drafting 
together for the credit provisions discussed recently with John Suttle and 
Jonathan Whitehead.

Thanks and sorry for the trouble.

Jane:

If you have time in the morning (Nov. 9 Tokyo), I would like to discuss ENA's 
view of the CSA/Schedule relationship.  In a nutshell, we provide that a 
ratings downgrade is an Additional Event of Default in the Schedule (normally 
a MAC in the CSA).  John's preferance, of course, would be a unilateral event 
triggering an IBJ default (which I am sure would be difficult to negotiate).

I am not certain of the time difference but perhaps you could call me at the 
office after 4 pm (Nov.8 in Houston) and I could then conference in John.  
Alternatively, please feel free to contact me at home (after 7 pm Houston 
time on Nov. 8) at 713-664-3207.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara

Dear John,

Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to 
the end.  They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly 
their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in 
place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course.  They 
acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards 
CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank.  They did 
say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do 
so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are 
set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask 
them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now.

We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you 
are still willing to do so.  The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess 
this means US$15 million credit limit.  

On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract 
without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting.  I should be 
able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the 
drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?     

Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the 
"Threshold Amount" definition to US$10 million.  Is there any flexibility on 
this?

Thanks.

Jane McBride

	John Suttle@ECT
	09/27/2000 12:39 AM
		
Jonathan,

One thing we might be able to propose is a "Credit Matrix" which prescribes a 
Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact - with collateral 
rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each 
counterparty.  We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and 
they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC) 
clauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot 
automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  We 
are comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates, 
the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose to 
IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is 
it possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract without 
using a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a 
CSA).

Rating (S&P)     Credit Line
AA or above    $20MM
BBB+ to AA-    $15MM
BBB     $10MM
BBB-     $7MM
BB- to BB+    $5MM
Below BB-    $1MM

These terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC 
clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively 
reduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty with 
diminishing credit quality.

What do you all think?

John

Jonathan Whitehead @ ENRON   09/25/2000 08:18 PM

Sorry, Pressed send too early:

John, Have had a conversation with IBJ re the CSA, and they have asked us to 
consider proposing a solution that does not involve a CSA. I propose to meet 
with them again to try and explore why, but I would like to be prepared to 
offer them a solution whereby we don't enter into a CSA, and we would limit 
the types of trades that we could enter into with IBJ. My feeling is that we 
would be unlikely to enter into any long term transactions (over 2 years) at 
this stage anyway, and would prefer to get the relationship going, as I am 
not sure they are going to budge on this issue yet. They appear to be quite 
willing to discuss all the other points. We can always press for a 
renegotiation at a later stage if we do want to enter into longer term deals. 
I also want to keep the loan facility completely separate.

What are your thoughts on this, and what limitations would you want to put on 
trades if we do not have a CSA?

Thanks,
Jonathan

	John Viverito
	09/22/2000 12:04 PM
		
John-

During our last meeting with IBJ, we pushed hard for the implementation of 
the CSA.  I believe that they have the systems capability to handle the 
requisite activities relating to the CSA, as we understand that they utilize 
same with certain financial institution counterparties.  We expressed our 
view on these matters and also raised other issues that we had discussed in 
our recent conference call.  

IBJ informed us that they have never entered into a CSA with a non-financial 
institution counterparty and my response was that Enron can then be the 
first.  We requested that they raise this issue with their respective 
superiors.  As you know, their response to our discussions relating to this 
issue was "In terms of CSA, as we are not ready for running collateral 
operations, we still do not prefer to use the CSA."  The legitimacy of this 
statement is certainly debatable and the underlying reason may actually be 
something entirely different, including the possibility that they merely do 
not want to enter into a CSA with a non-financial institution.  

We will continue to attempt to persuade IBJ to enter into the CSA with Enron, 
however it is uncertain if this is achievable.

Tanya:

I know you're swamped so I'll try to make this easy and you can answer "yes" 
or "no", etc.

1.  Is First Union National Bank the correct name?  (as opposed to First 
Union National Bank, Charlotte)

2.  Threshold for cross default:  We used $100,000,000 for ENE and 
$50,000,000 for FUNB.  FUNB wants $100,000,000.

3.  Documents to be delivered:  FUNB will produce audited/consolidated 
financials for First Union Corporation.  We requested FUNB financials.

4.  With respect to the ENA master only (the CSA):

 (i)  FUNB wants to post 10-year government bonds in addition to cash and 
L'C's

 (ii)  I sent you the FUNB matrix  Is it acceptable?

 (iii) FUNB wants to revise the MAC trigger to include "Baa3 by Moody's" and 
"failure to have a Credit Rating from either S&P or Moody's".

 (iv) FUNB wants to revise the definition of "Qualified Institution" to 
include not only the rating we assign, but also "having assets in excess of 
$10 billion" and also not subject to approval by the non-downgraded party

 (v)  FUNB wants all demands for delivery or return of collateral to be made 
on a Valuation Date.  I think we should retain language that demands can be 
made on or after a Valuation Date.  But I think we could agree that demands 
be made prior to 5 pm New York time.

5.  With respect to the ENA master only (the Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of 
First Union National Bank):

 (i)  FUNB wants a $30,000,000 cap (as opposed to the $15,000,000 cap we 
proposed)

Two different FUNB people keep calling me, one on the ENA front and the other 
with respect to ENE.  Now you know why your assistance is always greatly 
appreciated.

Sara

Sara Shackleton

Hey, Clem:

Hope you had a great New Year!

I'll try to make this easy so that you can respond "yes" or "no":

(1)  FUNB wants ENE remain liable for payments covering "any other damages, 
costs and attorney's fees".  Do you agree?

(2)  FUNB only wants to make a demand for payment with no strings attached.  
I'll try to whittle the demand period down from five days to three.  Do you 
agree:

(3)  Guaranty to be governed by NY law.  Agreed?

I'm sure you enjoyed this little exercise if I hear back from you.

Thanks.  Sara

Sara Shackleton

Sorry, but I still can't talk.  Although Marie is not in today, I can have 
Susan Bailey (Ext. 34737) contact Morgan to alert them that the faxed docs

can't recall if Marie sent that already.  Please call Susan so that we can be 
more specific about what might happen today (and whether it can wait until 
Monday morning when Marie returns).  I have not received anything from

Enron Corp, (global finance) has a FASB 125 structured deal executed in Dec.,

swap on EOG stock will need to be executed between ENA and Rabo.  ENA must be 
the swap counterparty ("normal course of business") for the legal opinion 
which must be issued for the structure.  I would like to send Rabo our ISDA 
format so as to avoid any surprises; time is short.  I assume we do not want 
a CSA but will require an Enron Corp. guaranty.  Do we want cross default and 
Credit Event Upon Merger to apply to the parties?   Do we want to

Susan:  Per Tanya's message below, please prepare a draft Schedule for the 
bank listed below.  There is no CSA.  Angela can help you with the choices.  
THIS IS A DEAL SPECIFIC ISDA SCHEDULE and not for general use.

Angela:  I know that this Schedule will never be accepted in total but it 
highlights the ENA priorities.  You can forward to the Rabobank person who 
sent the email request the other day and David Barbour et al.  I would 
appreciate if you could handle and I'll let you know when I'm back in the 
office for good.

Thank you both.  Sara

I would use the following:

Rabobank Nederland   (per your voice mail that outside counsel is not sure):
No CSA
Enron Corp Gty - have they asked about a limit?  I would propose $25MM
Bilateral Cross Defualts of $100MM fopr Enron Corp and Rabobank Nederland
I'd leave out the Additional Termination Event since these guys are AAA rated
Is Credit Event upon Merger normally in our schedule or the CSA?  If we 
usually omit when we do not have a CSA, then I am ok with that.

I'll try to get to First Union this weekend.  Sorry for the delays - the 
insanity is at  the worst levels yet!!

Tanya

Tanya:  I'd like to send our Schedule to Rabobank today since we will be off 
Monday, Jan. 15 and I have been called for jury duty on Tuesday, Jan. 16.  I 
will ask Angela Davis (a finance lawyer with swap experience who is helping 
us out on the structured deals) to handle this for me.  I don't want to deal 
with Rabobank's form of Schedule as a basis for discussion and I am told that 
this deal closes Friday, Jan. 19..

A voice mail would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.  Sara

Tanya:

Enron Corp, (global finance) has a FASB 125 structured deal executed in Dec., 
2000 which requires amendment for tax purposes.  A new  total return equity 
swap on EOG stock will need to be executed between ENA and Rabo.  ENA must be 
the swap counterparty ("normal course of business") for the legal opinion 
which must be issued for the structure.  I would like to send Rabo our ISDA 
format so as to avoid any surprises; time is short.  I assume we do not want 
a CSA but will require an Enron Corp. guaranty.  Do we want cross default and 
Credit Event Upon Merger to apply to the parties?   Do we want to 
add/eliminate additional events of default?  The ultimate Schedule will 
probably look very different from our standard but we need to urge our format 
as much as possible.  

Please call me to update.  This update is currently scheduled to close next 
Friday.  Thanks.  Sara

there may be some agreed to changes on the L/C side.  Carol St. Clair is 
addressing that with Jennifer and Miriam.  In any event, I believe that Tiger 
needs to "OK" our response of yesterday since there were some errors on their

All -
Just wanted to let you know that Rabobank got their final approval today to 
become the swap counterparty in the Cerberus financing.  We are moving 
forward on the documentation with a target close of early next week (probably 
Tuesday).  

Issues that I am aware of that remain are:
1) For the tax folks, we need to assign EAH's interest in both Aeneas and 
Psyche to either EES or EBS (an Enron operating subsidiary), then have that 
entity contribute the Aeneas 0.01% economic interest to Psyche.  As I 
understand it, this will provide the sale for tax purposes that Tammy needs 
in order to spring the desired gain.  I am working with Mark Lindsay to 
arrange for one of the Enron operating entities to take the A shares.  Danny 
and David, please start putting the necessary assignment documents together 
to facilitate this.  I'll give you the name of the Enron entity when I get it.

2) Due to certain things going on in the default swap market (which Rabo is 
using as one of the factors in its pricing formula), we have agreed to pay 
RBC an additional 10bp upfront and raise the spread on the deal to L + 85bp 
from L + 75bp.  David and Danny, please make the necessary adjustments.

3) Rabo has requested that a couple of business points be changed.  Those are 
that they would like to have an assignment over the A share of Aeneas, and 
they would like the Sales Agency Agreement to be triggered upon and Enron 
bankruptcy (if it occurs before maturity).  David, I agree with you that we 
should not agree to these requests.  We must maintain control of the A share 
in Aeneas since that is where the EOG stock is housed, and an Enron 
bankruptcy should not trigger the SAA because Aeneas is a bankruptcy-remote 
entity which should survive a bankruptcy of Enron.  Besides, requiring them 
to wait until maturity of the deal to trigger the SAA was the business deal 
we agreed to a long time ago.   

If there are other issues that I have left out, please let me know.  I am in 
Austin all week, but will be checking in periodically so send me either an 
e:mail or a voicemail if you need me.  Talk to you soon.

Sara -

I have spoken again to Merrill Lynch about the guaranty for FX trading.  They 
agreed with your assessment of damages as they relate to the swap agreement, 
but they have asked us to provide a larger guaranty to cover the possibility 
of damages related to non-transfer of funds at settlement (we can discuss 
this issue, but I'm comfortable with their request on this).

So, the long and the short of this is that Merrill Lynch is asking for a $150 
million guaranty from Enron Corp. to cover this trading.  Can you please 
prepare the guaranty document to reflect this?  As we have discussed the 
guaranty should be from Enron Corp. to cover FX trading of Enron North 
America.  The beneficiary of the guaranty should be Merrill Lynch 
International Bank Ltd.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks for all your help,

Jay

Brenda, for future transactions wherein swaps are involved, please see that 
extra copies of executed swaps are made at closing so that copies may be 
immediately distributed to the applicable confirmation desks.  Since this 
aspect of the structured finance transactions include "trading" transactions, 
the confirmation desks need the paperwork immediately for their reference and 
audit trails and to avoid confusion with deal tickets etc.  Please forward  
this memo to the other paralegals and attorneys in your group.  For your 
reference, at this time the distribution of executed copies should be 
provided as follows depending upon the nature of the swaps:

Laurel Adams:  Interest Rate Swaps

Larry Joe Hunter and Bob Bowen:  Gas Commodity Swaps

Derek Bailey:  Crude Oil Swaps

Melissa Murphy:  Power Swaps

Dianne Seib:  Canada Swaps

I need the rest of the swap docs too, as well as copies to Larry Joe Hunter, 
all as previously requested.  Mary

Laurel, I do not have executed versions.  I did draft the swaps and they were 
signed at closing, but Global Finance Legal is in charge of distribution of 
executed docs.  To the extent it is helpful here are the final versions that 
I sent to closing.  If I can be of further help, please call.

It was my understanding (from Tim Proffitt) that the legal department drafted 
all of the documents related to Brazos.  Does this include the interest rate 
swaps?  Originally you had sent me to Brenda Funk to get copies of the 
confirms for my records, but I have not heard anything from her at all.  
Could you please forward to me a copy of the documents, even if it has only 
been signed off on by one party?  I would like to review them and send them 
on to our file room.  

IF LEGAL HAS NOT DRAFTED THE INTEREST RATE SWAP CONFIRMS, PLEASE LET ME KNOW 
RIGHT AWAY, SO THAT I CAN PREPARE THESE DOCUMENTS!!

I am not sure I understand the question.  What do you mean by RMT?  

Here is an explanation of what happened here in London:

Due to cash flows originated by tax in London before year end,  some Enron 
Europe companies had FX positions that needed to be hedged.  However, due to 
tax reasons we could not hedge the FX positions in the entities in which they 
arose because the hedge gains or losses would be subject to the 'sub-part F' 
income rules (and liable to double tax).  

Tax therefore suggested that we transact the hedges in the name of 'ECT 
Europe Accounting Entity' (company 912), where they would be consolidated 
into Enron Europe for management accounting but would be within a US legal 
entity and therefore not subject to double tax.  My understanding is that 912 
is a branch of ENA and therefore there is a hedge transacted between ENA 912 
and ENA.

We have been trying to identify the hedges within company 912 but cannot see 
them there.  Can you help with this?

Regards

Peter

Jim:

Pursuant to our recent conversation, I have attached below a DRAFT of ENA's 
standard (1) municipal ISDA Schedule and (2) Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit 
Support Annex.  These two documents are intended to supplement the 
boilerplate for the ISDA Master Agreement and the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  
The forms are generic, that is, they have not been tailored for use by a 
specific municipal counterparty; they would necessarily be the subject of 
specific negotiations.  

Energy New England's agency relationship with the various municipalities 
appears to cover physical trading.  Notwithstanding the agency agreement, the 
financial trading world requires much more specificity, including but not 
limited to, evidence of authority to execute a master financial agreement and 
transactions thereunder.  Additional information, including a legal opinion, 
is also required.  

I assume from our prior conversation that you already have in your possession 
copies of the ISDA boilerplate.  Please advise otherwise.

You should feel free to contact Ed Sacks with questions regarding collateral 
support documentation.  As I mentioned, the attached Paragraph 13 has not 
been customized.

Please feel free to call if you have any questions.

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=
=20
the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=
=20
European and Eastern Hemisphere operations.  Rick and Mark will also contin=
ue=20
to support all other Enron businesses operating in their respective regions=
=20
and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=
ef=20
of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=
al=20
basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=
=20
in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=
r=20
will have responsibility for activity outside North America and Europe as=
=20
well as providing support for Enron Global Markets and Enron Global Assets.=
 =20
These individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship=

to Mark Palmer, Vice President of Communications.
Business Analysis and Reporting =01) Wes Colwell will expand his role to co=

Baxter=01,s direction.  Jeff Sherrick, CEO of EGEP, and Jim Noles, CEO of E=

Chief of Staff.

COMMITTEE STRUCTURE

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=

growth, the Executive Committee will be expanded to include more of our=20
business unit leaders.  The primary role of this committee will continue to=

the coordination of activities across those businesses.  We will also be=20

After having conducted our first of several business reviews, Enron Global 
Markets - Office of the Chairman would like to outline the following 
organizational changes effective immediately.

The Global Risk Markets group under Jere Overdyke illustrates enormous 
opportunities given the size of those businesses.  To better focus on the 
different commercial functions and to capture market share and value, the 
group is being realigned.  Jere will continue to manage Global Risk Markets 
and build on our insurance capabilities.  Mark Tawney is responsible for our 
weather business and will now report to the EGM Office of the Chairman.  

Brent Price will be joining Enron Global Markets as Vice President of 
Operations and Chief Accounting Officer.  He will report to the EGM Office of 
the Chairman, and to Sally Beck, Vice President of Global Risk Management 
Operations.  In his role as Chief Accounting Officer, Brent will also report 
to Rick Causey, Executive Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer for 
Enron Corp.  Reporting to Brent in his new position will be Sheila Glover, 
business controller for Financial Products; Todd Hall, business controller 
for weather; and Scott Earnest, business controller for global products and 
coal.  In addition, Tom Myers will join Brent's management team as Director 
of Accounting.  Brent and his team are responsible for all accounting, risk 
reporting and trading operations for all the businesses within EGM.

Sharen and Kimberly, One of the financial paralegals (Stephanie Panus, Susan

order to send a revised confirm to Cargill (deal # 495432.01).  The template 
is called a deemed ISDA.  They want to change the format of the confirmation 
letter that we already sent them.  Sara will want to see this before it is 
sent out.  Call and find me in Portland if you have any questions.

My intent on the Credit Worksheet was to only require guaranties and to set

this can be taken care of outside of the CSA.  Let me know if this helps.

Yes,  the lawyers have requested separate guaranties for each fund.  SS

Not sure what you mean by other animal gtees. Are these the individual ones 
for each separate fund or the one single gtee to cover Tiger as umbrella to 
their funds?
Per

Sara Shackleton
10/22/99 10:02 AM
Yes, as long as the Tiger lawyers do their bit.  Please call Susan Bailey 
about the guaranty and she can have it prepared for execution.  Question:  
Are we only preparing the Tiger guaranty or other animal guaranties as well?  
SS

Email works fine. It must be a drag trying to work when you can't discuss the 
issues. Do you think we have a good chance of getting to signed docs next 
week? Have we gotten the process going to have our gtee issued now that the 
wording is agreed? (You mentioned it takes some time to get that pushed 
through the proper channels). 

Per

Sara Shackleton
10/22/99 09:41 AM
I still can't talk.  I think that our response should be final except that 
there may be some agreed to changes on the L/C side.  Carol St. Clair is 
addressing that with Jennifer and Miriam.  In any event, I believe that Tiger 
needs to "OK" our response of yesterday since there were some errors on their 
redraft.  Marie is not in the office today.  If you want to speak to a 
person, call Susan Bailey and she can come into my office and we can manage.

	01/11/2001 05:34 PM
		 
Tanya:

I know you're swamped so I'll try to make this easy and you can answer "yes" 
or "no", etc.

1.  Is First Union National Bank the correct name?  (as opposed to First 
Union National Bank, Charlotte)

2.  Threshold for cross default:  We used $100,000,000 for ENE and 
$50,000,000 for FUNB.  FUNB wants $100,000,000.

3.  Documents to be delivered:  FUNB will produce audited/consolidated 
financials for First Union Corporation.  We requested FUNB financials.

4.  With respect to the ENA master only (the CSA):

 (i)  FUNB wants to post 10-year government bonds in addition to cash and 
L'C's

 (ii)  I sent you the FUNB matrix  Is it acceptable?

 (iii) FUNB wants to revise the MAC trigger to include "Baa3 by Moody's" and 
"failure to have a Credit Rating from either S&P or Moody's".

 (iv) FUNB wants to revise the definition of "Qualified Institution" to 
include not only the rating we assign, but also "having assets in excess of 
$10 billion" and also not subject to approval by the non-downgraded party

 (v)  FUNB wants all demands for delivery or return of collateral to be made 
on a Valuation Date.  I think we should retain language that demands can be 
made on or after a Valuation Date.  But I think we could agree that demands 
be made prior to 5 pm New York time.

5.  With respect to the ENA master only (the Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of 
First Union National Bank):

 (i)  FUNB wants a $30,000,000 cap (as opposed to the $15,000,000 cap we 
proposed)

Two different FUNB people keep calling me, one on the ENA front and the other 
with respect to ENE.  Now you know why your assistance is always greatly 
appreciated.

I was interested in the 1991 and 1998 definitions because they referenced by 
name in the Rabo-RBC TRS Confirmation (Cerberus restructuring).  I didn't 
realize there was a newer version of the definitions.  Unless that 
Confirmation is scheduled to be modified to refer solely to the 2000 
definitions, I'd like to get a copy of all 3 if possible.

Hi, Dee:

A few pieces of information from credit.

1.  With respect to ENA's swap counterparty, we note that the rated entity 
per S&P is "First Union National Bank, Charlotte".  You need to let us know 
which entity is in fact the swap party.

2.  Regarding Threshold for cross default, $100,000,000 is fine.

3.  Regarding financials, if you want to provide us with First Union Corp. 
financials, we will need a guaranty and credit will switch to the guarantor.

4.  10 year bonds are OK with a haircut (probably 90 or 95%).

5.  Credit is still reviewing the matrix 

6.  Your changes to the MAC trigger are fine.

7.  Your comments to our definition of "Qualified Institution" have been 
rejected.

8.  The $30,000,000 cap on the Enron Corp. guaranty is fine.

I'll try to follow up with you tomorrow.

Ellen Su, bond trader in  Gary Hickerson's world, would like to know with 
whom we have repo agreements.  I'm pretty sure we have them with Goldman 
Sachs & Co. and with BMO/Nesbitt Burns.  Sara Shackleton has been working on 
getting an agreement signed with Warburg Dillon Read, but it appears that at 
present this document is not signed.  

Could you please advise if we have signed repo docs with any other 
counterparties?  Could you also update me on the status of the WDR agreement? 

Thank you very much for your help.

Please let me review your final confirm before you send to Cargill-Alliant.  
Thanks.  Sara

How about Friday.  

Wednesday might work, I will find out later today or first thing tomorrow, if 
I will be in town.  But Friday, definitely works.

Jason:

Here's my suggestion for item (ix) [Additional Event of Default] event on 
page 2 of the Schedule:

"Exposure" shall mean for any relevant date for which Exposure is calculated, 
the amount, if any, that would be payable to Party A by Party B pursuant to 
Section 6(e)(ii)(2)(A) of this Agreement as if all Transactions were being 
terminated as of the relevant date; provided that Market Quotation will be 
determined by Party A using its estimates at mid-market of the amounts that 
would be paid for Replacement Transactions (as that term is defined in the 
definition of "Market quotation") in order to ensure that Party A does not 
suffer an economic penalty."

I think that we agreed on everything else.

Please send new blackline.  Thanks.

NEXT TIME YOU THINK YOU=0F2RE HAVING A BAD DAY:

Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned out section of
forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased
male was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with scuba tanks on his
back, flippers, and facemask. A post-mortem revealed that the person
died not from burns, but from massive internal injuries. Dental records
provided a positive identification.

Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clad diver ended
up in the middle of a forest fire. It was revealed that on the day of
the fire, the person went for a diving trip off the coast some 20 miles
from the forest. The fire fighters, seeking to control the fire as
quickly as possible, called in a fleet of helicopters with very large
dip buckets. Water was dipped from the ocean and then flown to the
forest fire and emptied.

You guessed it.

One minute the man was making like Flipper in the Pacific, the next he
was doing the breaststroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the air.
Apparently he extinguished exactly 5'10" of the fire. Some days it just
doesn't pay to get out of bed.

This article was taken from the California Examiner, March 20, 1998.

STILL THINK YOU=0F2RE HAVING A BAD DAY?

A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in the
kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle when it
accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding onto the
handlebars, was dragged through the glass patio doors and along with the
motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house. The wife, hearing the
crash, ran into the dining room and found her husband lying on the
floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle lying next to him, and the
shattered patio door!

She ran to the phone and summoned the ambulance. Because they lived on a
fairly large hill, the wife went down the several flights of stairs to
the street to escort the paramedics to her husband.

After the ambulance arrived and transported the man to the hospital, the
wife uprighted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Since gas was
spilled on the floor, the wife got bunch of napkins, blotted up most of
the gasoline, and threw the napkins in the toilet. The man was treated
and released to come home.

Upon arriving home, he looked at the shattered patio door and the damage
done to his motorcycle. He became despondent, went to the bathroom, sat
down on the toilet and smoked a cigarette. After finishing the
cigarette, he flipped it between his legs into the toilet bowl while
seated. The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard the loud explosion and
her husband screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband
lying on the floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was
suffering burns on the buttocks, the back of his legs, and his groin.

The wife again ran to the phone to call the ambulance. The very same
paramedic crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the street. The
paramedics loaded the husband on to the stretcher and began carrying him
to the street. While they were going down the stairs to the street
accompanied by the wife, one of the paramedics asked the wife how the
husband had burned himself.

She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them
slipped and tipped the stretcher, dumping the husband out. He fell down
the remaining stairs and broke his arm.

Taken from a Florida Newspaper.

STILL HAVING A BAD DAY? Just remember, it could be worse.....

1. The average cost of rehabilitating a seal after the Exxon Valdez oil
spill in Alaska was $80,000! At a special ceremony, two of the most
expensively saved animals were released back into the wild amid cheers
and applause from onlookers. A minute later, in full view, a killer
whale ate them both.

2. A psychology student in New York rented out her spare room to a
carpenter in order to nag him constantly and study his reactions. After
weeks of needling, he snapped and beat her with an axe leaving her brain
damaged.

3. A woman came home to find her husband in the kitchen, shaking
frantically with what looked like a wire running from his waist towards
the electric kettle. Intending to jolt him away from the deadly current
she whacked him with a handy plank of wood by the back door, breaking
his arm in two places. Until that moment he had been happily listening
to his new Walkman.

4. Two animal rights protesters were protesting at the cruelty of
sending pigs to a slaughterhouse in Bonn Germany. Suddenly the pigs, all
two thousand of them, escaped through a broken fence and stampeded,
trampling the two hapless protesters to death.

AND FINALLY.......

5. Iraqi terrorist, Khay Rahnajet, didn't pay enough postage on a letter
bomb. It came back with "return to sender" stamped on it. Having
forgotten it was the bomb, he opened it and was blown to bits.

YOUR DAY'S NOT SO BAD, IS IT?

Since your plan is to assume the existing hedges, you need to determine from 
Sara Shakleton, our legal advisor, the issues related to assignability. Also, 
you should reduce the amount of CAD that you need to hedge by assigning the 
existing hedges. 

Sara: What should we do if there is a position with a bank in which we do not 
deal with or have agreements with?  

W. Stuart
 

Stuart:

Would it be possible for you to send us a tradeable forward curve (we need to 
use it for our base case and run sensitivities from there)?

Also here are some answers to  the questions you asked earlier this morning. 

1) Will the asset be in a mark-to-market book? If so, will you need 
mark-to-market accounting for this hedge? 
Answer:  We will plan to review with Kent Castleman
 
2) Under what entity name will the hedge be executed?
Answer:  Not yet determined

3) What will be done with the existing hedges that the entity currently has 
in place? Will they be assigned to Enron? Liquidated?
Answer:  Yes, we plan to assume the existing hedges on the date of purchase

Thanks a lot.

Pulp & Paper  has been approched by a broker to buy a Cap. Jeff Harbert's run 
it by Mark Taylor and Credit and everyone is okay doing the trade - as it is 
a short term trade where we have no exposure. Mark, however, wants to be sure 
we get the language relating to 'whereby you offered this transaction to us' 
in the Confirmation, in order to meet the trade optoins requirements.

Can you send this to me.

Thanks for the memo and we should discuss in a future meeting dedicated to 
form changes.

If we adopt the 2000 Definitions in our Schedule, we will also need to change 
the existing reference in Part 6(f)(iii) to "Negotiated Fallback" (to Section 
7.5(c)(iv))

Also, the term "Relevant Price" is used in the "Negotiated Fallback" 
definition. We should clarify whether we need to retain Part 6(f)(iv) of the 
Schedule when using "Negotiated Fallback" or whether we intend that "Fallback 
Reference Dealers" be an entirely separate and distinct fallback (i.e. the 
4th fallback in our Schedule).

Sometimes I have brilliant ideas and this may not be one of them.  Also, it 
would be nice if Jennifer had a singing role but I know how kids can be so 
don't you worry.  I'm not implying that Zachary shouldn't sing (or take on an 
acting role as well)  because that would be even better.  Or we could do a 
quartet.  Whatever.
But you ,dahling, are the centerpiece here because Mother and Daddy like you 
best.  So here are my preliminary thoughts for an Irving Houston off-Broadway 
play.  Naturally this is based on an Ada & Mike premise.

(1)  This old suitcase  (Daddy packed the Louis Vuitton without wheels a WEEK 
early but Mother wouldn't let him close it and then it wouldn't close)
(2)  Lovely Linda  (you remember Linda, don't you?)
(3)  Hi Debba, Hi Sara  (what's the story, morning glory, etc. and of course 
this is the information hot-line and Mother's source of e-mail)

 I'm sure I'll have many more brilliant ideas over the weekend but I wanted 
you to be the first to share these ideas with me.  Sas

Janelle and Tom:  Ed Sacks and I need to speak with you in the a.m. about a 
few issues.

I have questions about market disruption because Con Ed has asked:

(1)  that Market Quotation apply rather than Loss (in the event of Early 
Termination)
 Is this a very liquid market?  ENA agrees to market quotation only for FX 
and short term deals in liquid markets (e.g., gas)

(2)  to jointly determine when a Market Disruption has occurred (after 
consultation)
 Usually ENA as the Calculation Agent makes this determination in good faith.

(3)  to identify two brokers/pricing platforms for purposes of determining 
the daily MTM
 Each party typically assesses its own MTM for valuation purposes (whether 
for collateral calls or termination, etc.).  Sounds like Ed and I need to 
know what was said to Con Ed about marking

(4)  I think Con Ed was headed in the direction of asking that we each 
provide dealer quotes (rather than ENA coming up with two quotes in good 
faith) as a Disruption Fallback.  Tom, I think we discussed this in a 
different situation.

Ed and I agreed to conference at 10 am Houston time to discuss these and the 
draft docs (which were e-mailed to you).

Sara,

I will be sending to your legal assistant (under separate cover) a credit 
worksheet for a new ISDA with Inland Paperboard & Packaging, Inc.  This 
worksheet will reflect a $10MM credit support threshold, with a $15MM 
guaranty from Temple Inland.

Julie Beck (VP Finance - Inland Paperboard and Packaging) has given me the 
name of another attorney who will review the new ISDA and confirms:

 Jack Falconi,  (214) 360-4865,  jfalconi@gfbank.com

Temple Inland (the parent  -  will provide a $15 million guaranty) has worked 
with Jack in the past and wants him involved.  

It might be a good idea to call Jack.  I am not clear on the role that Grant 
Adamson will play (Grant gave us comments on the earlier ISDA).  From what 
Julie said, I think that Jack will be our main legal contact at this point.

Thanks,  Jim

Please plan to attend a meeting to discuss and learn about Confirmations and 
Transactions at 10 a.m. tomorrow in 38C2.   Email my assistant, Kaye Ellis, 
if you are unable to attend.

Thank you,

Paul:  Could you please resend the hedge fund email?  Thanks.  Sara

Sara Shackleton

Per:

I am told that Mark Taylor sent an email in December to Bob Shultz at EOL 
addressing the hedge fund issues (and CTA issues) associated with online 
trading and that you and Caroline received that email.  Apparently the hedge 
fund crises of last year have heightened regulatory scrutiny of the funds' 
derivatives activity.  EOL does not want to be subjected to any regulatory 
oversight.  I have not seen the email yet.  I will broach the subject with 
Mark when he returns to the office.

these are mark's comments for your info- CTA's are not a segment Per and I 
are going after right now on the energy side for the apparent restrictions 
they have trading OTC.  Metals is a different story as we do not take any 
credit exposure,  but the issue of linkage between the CTA customers and the 
fund itself are valid.......
Caroline:

here is some feedback from Mark Taylor in legal.  Please call me and let me 
know how this view squares with your understanding of the ability to get 
Hedge Funds and CTA's approved.  

Thanks

Be sure that Mark is aware of activity on this.  Has Caroline had an attorney 
involved in this as Mark is the EnronOnline expert.
Bob:

Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is 
that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus 
will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents 
before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic 
corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent 
elsewhere.

The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates 
to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term 
Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in, 
orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of 
teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of 
messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge 
funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying 
much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past 
and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested: 
notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal 
regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to 
speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a 
large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the 
financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.]

For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the 
internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or 
individuals - for similar reasons).  

Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their 
customers just as Brokers cannot.

Andy as we discussed Harry will begin contacting the Hedge Funds.  Caroline 
Abramo is starting to push the CTA's (for LME metals) and hedge funds 
(metals, energy etc) through the credit hurdles and legal.  Mark, you have 
visited this one before any comments?

Harry,

Further to our conversation last week, I have listed below, in two segments, 
the top CTAs who presently manage more than $100mill each, and the top Hedge 
Funds, based upon their likelihood to manage assets in diversified markets, 
that may include tangible commodities. My understanding of EOL is that it 
presently caters primarily to this latter group and offers only tangible 
commodity trading instruments.

As I explained, the principle difference between a Hedge Fund and a CTA 
(Commodity Trading Advisor), is the manner in which they control the assets 
that they are contracted to manage. In the case of a CTA, the money can not 
be held by the CTA itself. The underlying investor will open a clearing 
account with a respective Clearing House, the assets will remain in this 
account and the CTA will trade based on the full monetary value of that 
account - in many cases an investor may well fund this account with Notional 
Funding. NF are 'abstract funds' not actually deposited at the Clearing 
House, but acknowledged as being available should variation or original 
margin be required. The CTA has no control over these funds. All monetary 
transactions must be executed by the Clearing House, and must be authorized 
by the investor. The CTA does have the ability to execute trades at an other 
trading house - such as Enron, through a contractual document called an 
International Uniform Give-Up Agreement. We have quite a few hundred of these 
agreements in NY. Essentially, all parties involved in the execution of a 
trade - the CTA, the Investor, the Executing Broker and the Clearing House, 
agree to allow the CTA to trade wherever he/she wishes and Give-Up that trade 
to the Investor's Clearing House. Since every regulated trade must ultimately 
clear the respective exchange, for a CTA to trade OTC and Swap agreements, 
would require prior notification to an investor that his/her money may be 
required as collateral against such a trade, and would be required to be 
deposited at Enron. A Hedge Fund has greater flexibility to trade such 
instruments since in the majority of instances a Hedge Fund does exert 
control over the funds it manages. A Hedge Fund typically structures its 
investment vehicles as Off-Shore limited partnership funds. As such the Hedge 
fund has direct control over the underlying assets and can move those assets 
to wherever they may be required - if investing via Enron On-Line, it would 
move the assets to Enron, for example.

This first list, below, is comprised of the top flight CTAs :

The following list is of Hedge Funds that I believe are trading Commodities 
and other non-security investments. It is by no means complete ! :

I would be happy to make any introductions that I can to any of the above 
names. Some we know well, others we may have to network ourselves into. 
Caroline and I met a few weeks ago and I passed some names on to her - I am 
not sure where that has got to yet, but if you need any further information 
please call me.

In an effort to avoid loss of our executed agreements/files (master 
agreements, brokerage and futures agreements, repo agreements), we are 
testing out the  "library approach" and instituting a checkout procedure.  
Whenever you remove one of these files from the file cabinet, please "hold 
the file location" with a signed "card" (legal sized) available on top of the 
master agreement file cabinet.  You will also see a large sign reminding you 
to sign out for your file.  When the file is returned, just replace the 
"card" with the file and delete your name from the "card".  

Please be sure to check out all files currently in your office.

Thanks for your cooperation.

Thanks Sara. I don't remember seeing some of this so the full background was 
helpful. As we discussed, it appears that the reluctants to trade online was 
not in the context of full ISDA docs, due dil, etc that we have done to trade 
with the hedge funds we currently talk to.  I'll give some thought to this 
and talk to Caroline. More than likely we'll need to have a meeting in 
Houston with credit and legal to discuss not if but how to set up hedge funds 
on EOL. Trading with them is a business decision we made already, executing 
online seems to be a a logical extension and doesn't add any further legal 
risk, just monitoring issues.

I'm in Houston next week. If you're avaiable and Mark has time on his 
schedule, lets get together.

Sara, Janelle - The terms that we have agreed to are transaction specific.  
Given the unfavorable credit terms for Enron, we will have to give serious 
consideration if we should elect to trade with this counterparty in the 
future, unless we can force them to deviate from thier credit policies.  Good 
luck on the other issues.

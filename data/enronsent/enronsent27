Kent,

Here's a revised letter agreement.  It is being reviewed internally, but I 
wanted to get it to you today anyway, as I will be out of the office 
beginning tomorrow around 1100.

FYI, I am attaching the current term sheet for the Rio Gen EPC contract which 
is has been approved by AA and I believe Global Finance.

Here is the current rev of the EECC "standard" form which I am 
reviewing/massaging in connection with the 97 10 exercise.  It includes the 
exhibits, where I think you can find something useful.

If this doesn't help, please let me know and I will check elsewhere.

Kay, here's the near to last draft of the  form. Sorry of the delay and
thanks for being a sport about it, especially when your dvelope rtypes are
needig to get on down the road.. Please feel free to work on this, but
please  don't distribute this as our form, as you can see from the note
below that we still have a way to go before it is  the "form',but remaining
work is limited to speific content here and there, typos ,and some
litigation sturff. The structure will remain, so you can safely work into
this the West LB stuff.

John R. asked that  you and he have a chat about the directionyou are
headedand hwo to coordinate the changes that need to be made - in terms of
substance as awell as drafting - to get to an standard set of changes for
the off balance sheet work. I would be glad to participate.

09/21/2000 01:57 PM

Here's the next to last iteration of the form contract before we christen
it officially "FORM 2000 - Rev. 00",clean and compared. John R will need to
take this, diddle with it,  and use the product PDQ for a couple of crisis
applications, but before it becomed and gets advertized as "Form 2000" I
woanted to collect  last comments from you guys and get some fine tuning
from  our litigation mangers  onthe arbitration and dispute resoluton
materials, which is to be on my desk by the end of the day.
Because of Johnnie's urgencies, I did not have the chance to pretty up
format and section and page numbers, please forgive. We will get it next
time.

You guys also have the un-revised draft exhibits. I think Rigby was to
revise to try and revise them to fit  the form - I await the draft exhibits
withbaited breath.

Please collect your thoughts and we we schedule a time to get tehm in.

Angie, please print both attachemenst and this e-mail for me.

Mark,

I've reviewed the fax sent yesterday with the Proposed Conditions to Special 
Use for Livingston Energy Center.  Is Titan Land Development the Owner?  Will 
it be necessary for Titan to make the escrow payment prior to exercising the 
relevant land options and the commencement of construction?

I do not know whether these agreements and/or the making of the deposit would 
impact the balance sheet treatment, but I understand from Fred that we are 
not concerned about the balance sheet treatment for this project.

Kay

As you know we are scheduled to appear before the Livingston County Zoning
Board of Appeals ("ZBA") tomorrow evening for initial approval of the
Livingston Energy Center (the "Facility").  Assuming, we receive a vote to
approve the Facility, the ZBA will be approving the Conditions of Approval
of the Special Use sent out yesterday for everyone's final approval and
sign-off.   Please note that we have incorporated into these conditions the
stormwater management conditions, township and county highway roadway
conditions, and other matters. If there are any changes or modifications to
these conditions, our ability to incorporate may be limited if they are not
received by 4pm today.  Of course, if necessary, we will attempt to make
modifications after that time.  

It is possible based on on-going negotiations with the County and our
neighbors that additional changes may be required today or tomorrow.  We
will of course contact you immediately if that occurs.  If you have any
questions, please do not hesitate to call or email Karen or me.  Thanks.

The water could be 100 feet or more away from the dock, depending on how long 
it blows that hard.   I hope our shrimp come back.

Both!
I agree that having Matt come to our house the first time is best.
I had already looked at the weather. North winds to 25 mph. How much water
would be left in the bay?
Connecticut's new. You haven't been there with Enron have you? Better take a
coat!! Saturday the 14th is my Saturday to work. I can bring Michael with me
if necessary. No big deal.

I don't know if it is meant to make us feel better, or it just IS better.

I thought maybe Matt could come visit one of these off days.  Michael would
probably be more comfortable in his own home.  I checked the weather, and
it looks like we picked the right weekend to go to Palacios last weekend.

I'm still looking good for Monday at home.  I'll probably leave Wednesday
night to go to Connecticut, back on Friday.  It looks to me like next week
is my best travel week.

Kay

Please respond to <nmann@erac.com>

You were right, it does warm my heart. Thanks for sharing.
It certainly appears God is trying to show us we made the right decision,
don't you think.

Please tell Matt that I will talk to Michael, and I know that he will be
glad to come over soon.

As you anticipated, he is still adjusting, so he isn't fully relaxed yet,
but knowing Michael, he will settle down soon.  Are you going to be around
for the long weekend?  Maybe Matt could come over for a visit, letting
Michael build a little confidence in a familiar environment.

Kay

NikMat53@aol.com on 10/04/2000 03:00:27 PM

Dear Kay,

Glad to hear Michael has settled in already.  We seem to have a great class

and Mrs. Norris is a wonderful teacher!  Please call at any time if you
have
any questions  that I can help answer or point you in the direction of
trying
to get them answered.

We would love to have Michael over one day after school.  Matt has told me
they have been playing together and he wanted to know if he could come
over.
I told him I would talk with you and see if we could set something up.
Please call if you think Michael would like to come play and we can work
something out. (If Michael needs to settle in a while, I certainly
understand.) Our # is 713.984.0126.  Hope to hear from you soon!

Thank you for the heads up on the Schaeffer parcel.  Just a reminder that if
we want to use that site for a laydown parcel it may be necessary to obtain
approval from the County to do so.  After Thursday night we can discuss the
proper method of confirming this with the County.  Please keep in mind that
while a we hope to obtain approval of a motion on Thursday night, formal
approval will not occur until next month's ZBA hearing when written findings
will be adopted.

   Mark,  FYI  -  I plan to approach Mr. Schaeffer (the 28 acre tract
to the
   immediate west of the site) to option that tract as well once we get
done
   with the ZBA on Thursday (assuming it goes off without a hitch).

   We want to option that tract so it could be used as construction
laydown,
   and more importantly to control the parcel across from the plant
site.  The
   plan would be to buy the tract, but let him have rights to farming
it -
   once we're done using it for laydown.  This gives us a buffer tract
for
   sound mitigation etc. as well.

   Subject:  RE: Livingston County Approval Issues - ISSUES FOR TODAY

   Titan Land Development Co., L.L.C.  holds the options on the  3
properties
   in Livingston County. If  you were to acquire those properties and
develop
   the Facility it is my understanding that Titan would be the entity
that
   would be the owner of the Property and the Facility.  The proposed
   Conditions were drafted to apply to the party defined as the "Owner"
and
   not
   specifically to Titan or ENA.  Proposed Condition No. 12 provides
that:

             The Special Use approved by this ordinance and all of the
   conditions, obligations and rights provided for herein shall run
with the
   ownership of the land and the Facility.  For purposes of this
Special Use,
   "Owner" shall include the owner of the Property and the owner and/or
   operator of the Facility.

   Therefore, the conditions of the Special Use, including the
obligation to
   make the Escrow payment, should not apply to Titan until acquisition
of the
   Property or development of the Facility.  In the unlikely scenario
that
   Titan was to acquire the Property but not develop it, failure to
satisfy
   the
   Conditions should only relate to the right to use the Property for
the
   Facility.  I am working with the County to get a copy of the final
   ordinance
   or resolution (they have not completed it yet) to confirm that it is
   consistent with this proposal.

   Please let me know if I should pursue the balance sheet treatment
with your
   tax department.  If you have any questions or I can be of any
further
   assistance please let me know.

There's a rumor going around that you are signing up people for the pilot=

program. If true, I would love to volunteer, as I work at home frequently.

Thanks,

As you know, technology is critical to Enron; it drives our success and wil=

realize its benefits at home.

With that in mind, we are excited to let you know that we are introducing t=

ClickAtHome
program, which will give each employee a computer for use at home. Where=20
technology permits, we will also subsidize an Internet connection. With the=
=20
click of a mouse, a home computer plus Internet access will put a world of=
=20
Internet knowledge at your family=01,s fingertips. =20

We have just signed an agreement with Dell Computer Corporation to provide=
=20
the computer hardware. We wanted to let you know about the program now in=
=20
case you and your family were considering the purchase or upgrade of a home=
=20
computer or Internet connection in the next few months. The scope of=20
ClickAtHome includes the following:

? Basic package: Dell desktop computer with a high-speed processor, floppy=
=20
disk drive, mouse, speakers, monitor, modem, CD-ROM drive and Windows 2000=
=20
software. Employees will have the option to receive a subsidized Internet=
=20
connection, including broadband, where commercially available.
? Participation: This program will be available to active regular full-time=
=20
and regular part-time employees of Enron and its wholly owned subsidiaries;=
=20
however, employees of some Enron companies (Portland General Electric, EOTT=
,=20
Enron Facility Services) may not be able to participate due to legal,=20
accounting, tax, labor or business reasons.  Eligibility includes being=20
employed at the time of implementation. =20
? Timing: U.S. employee sign-up will begin in early 2001, with delivery of=
=20
the equipment and Internet connection to follow shortly thereafter.  Delive=
ry=20
of equipment to participating non-U.S. employees is targeted for late 2001.

Details about this program are still being finalized.  To address some of=

your initial questions, we=01,ve posted a question-and-answer document on=

We are excited to extend our investment in technology to you and your=20

by creating endless possibilities for you to experience and participate in=

the broadband Internet revolution. It is just another reason why we believe=
=20
Enron is a great place to work.

Gregg,

It is my understanding that Enron and Peoples intend to discuss the most 
appropriate form of ISDA documentation for enovate to use. Peoples has 
forwarded a form for our information, and we would like to reciprocate.

Therefore, attached per your request are sample ISDA documents as a starting 
point for discussions.  Since these are forms, there will certainly be 
aspects which will need revision based on discussions between Peoples and 
Enron.  These documents should be treated as confidential.

Hi Ben,

Janet has requested that we set you up with signature authority for

documents?

I attach the new draft of the Agency Agreement I received from Peoples a few 
moments ago.

Simon Helfrich called to comment on the credit provisions.  The essence of 
their proposal is that the LLC acts as a guarantor of all accounts receivable 
from parties for whom the LLC has performed the credit check.

I look forward to discussing this draft with you.

confidentiality agreements, exclusivity agreements, permit applications, and 
land/equipment option agreements.

Please forward this (if need be) to the appropriate internal individuals who 
get this set up. Thanks Kay.

Deb,

I'll get you the particulars, but you get the general idea. I'll have to 
check on the expense account stuff.

Kathleen, you  haven't done any thing with this request yet, have you?  Could 
you get the  names of the active development companies so that we can address 
those, as well as ENA?

Lisa,

I haven't seen a copy of the Sept 28th letter yet, but I've been at an 
offsite, so I might have missed something.  I'll get you a copy of CO #1.  CO 
#2 has been transmitted to GE for comment.  I'll have to confirm the status 
of the MOU and CO#3/#4.  These have bounced around a bit, so I need to nail 
it down so I don't give you bad information.

Kay

   

Kay, I was hoping you could provide me with executed copies of Change Orders 
1 and 2 and the September 28th letter agreement regarding Enron's title 
acceptance of units 1-6 and 9-14.  I need to provide them to WestLB as the 
ADA requires prompt delivery to them of executed contracts.

Also, where do we stand on Change Orders 3 and 4 and the ENA/ESA "MOU"?  I 
know that the last I heard Sheila was working the MOU, but I thought you 
mights know as I am writing to you.

My legal name is Ben F. Jacoby. Did I make VP?

Thanks,

Ben

   
	
	

Hi Ben,

Janet has requested that we set you up with signature authority for 
development documents.  How do you want you name to read on the corporate 
documents?

Thanks,

Kay

Hi.  Just checking in.  Michael and I are having a nice morning.  I've got my 
computer plugged in to my home line, but my cell phone is on.   Michael has 
an appointment at 230, so I will be out of a while.  

This is great stay home weather.  I have fires in the fireplaces.  All I'm 
missing is the smell of bread baking!

Kay

I thought the conference was pretty good.  I had a great room, with a HUGE 
jacuzzi tub.  Did anyone get promoted?  No one said anything about 
promotions, so I figured nothing interesting happened in that regard.  

I've been throwing out accumulated paper today, cleaned out my person, got 
out some clothes to give to the maid.  It all feels good.

I'm going to do email now.  See you tomorrow!

Kay

Make that cleaned out my purse, not my person.  Geez.

I'm not at the office today, but I probably have a copy of the Option.  I 
don't recognize the Memorandum of Option to Purchase.  Do you have a copy of 
it to see if it gets my memory working?

   
	
	

I am trying to find: (i) an executed copy of the Option to Purchase Real 
Estate; and (ii) recorded copy of the Memorandum of Option to Purchase Real 
Estate in connection with the Edgecombe County NC property (between North 
Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency and Tarheel Land Development Company, 
L.L.C.).  The option extension is due at the end of the month and I would 
like to get the extension documents ready.

Do either of you have copies of these documents?

Thanks - 
Kathleen

Probably tomorrow.  I got a feeling that Dave would like to visit with you about it.

Dismal here.  How are you?

When do you think the payment's due?

Paul/Nera - please hold the wire for Montana Megawatts I, LLC for $5,064,535.00 that was scheduled for pmt today.  I will let you know when it is ok to release it.

thanks!
theresa

	 -----Original Message-----
	By my calculation this payment is not due today.  I have advised Northwestern's attorney of this fact.

	Dave Duran wants to be advised prior to this money being sent.

	Thanks,

Jeff,

What's your suggestion?  We are looking at a PA in connection with Tennessee Pipeline's open season. (did I get that right?)

Thanks for your help.  The next step is to work on the Tennessee pipeline documents.  Hope you have some time or do you want me to coordinate the pipeline stuff with someone else?

Ruth

Looks good to me.

Good suggestions.  Take a look at this proposal.  I have talked with Julie Smith this morning and they are still interested in transacting with ENA despite the negative press.

Thanks,
Ruth

You don't need to get it signed, just substitute the new pages. Yes I like perfume.

Good for you.  Not like you'll get paid for it.

Just bought out Toys R Us.  Nothing for Paige.  I'm waiting until she comes home.

I have an am dr appt.  Fine with me if you carry on and give me an assignment. Otherwise, it woukd nedd to be early or after 100.

Got your back while you pick up wine.

Just looking to gossip. Nothing important.

I wish he would leave Deerfield alone.

Very nice.

Do they owe us $292, 554 in addition to the $360k?

Kay at this time MDEA has $292,544.40 that they owe us.  We have approximately $360,000  that we have made in profit according to our P&L from Risk.  At this time we are not doing any buying or selling for MDEA.  We run the load forecast, determine the position and then we get a market price from WRI.  We then call MDEA and inform them of the Market and their position.  They then tell us to buy the power from WRI.  We call WRI and they bill MDEA, not us.  We then do the tag. 

 << File: Coulter, Kayne.vcf >> 

Hi David,

Sorry I missed you when you came by. I'm glad A & K will be playing such a vital role in the upcoming months.  The level of service you give is very much appreciated, now more than ever.

Thanks for the wine.  It was quite good.

Merry Christmas (just in case I don't see you before the holidays).

Kay

I'll ask Jeff what he thinks.

Thanks for your help.  The next step is to work on the Tennessee pipeline documents.  Hope you have some time or do you want me to coordinate the pipeline stuff with someone else?

 << File: RioBravo4ENEL2.doc >> 

FYI.  This involves a non-bankrupt sub of ENA.

Chip:

As we discussed a couple of days ago, we have prepared a payment direction letter regarding our final payment from AES on the Haywood deal. The letter directs AES to make payment directly to our consultant ($100k) with the balance to us by check ($2,010k).

Please let Kay, Staurt and I know if you're OK with this (via return e-mail), and we will send it to AES. Stuart, Kay and I have each reviewed the letter.

I expect that we should be in a position to receive these funds hopefully late next week.

Thanks,

Ben

Kay:

I'd like to talk to you about the attached letter. Thanks.

 <<Volunteer Land Letter.doc>> 

Will you come get me?

It will all be public someday.

I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow am so I won't be able to be there.

I'm at the doctors office and won't be back that soon. I'm about done with my contracts.

Got here early.  Fannin is a mess by the Dome and elsewhere. I'll call later.

Michael was great this am.

Ckm

I talked to Peggy last night, and we are on for Christmas dinner with them.  Her inlaws won't be there, but friends will be.  Mikey is invited also.

Looking for some gift hints from you.

I'm at the drs office this am, but will be in the office later.

Mom

Early to my appt, so I'm working some.  Could you find Peter Mims number at VE? We will also need his fax number.

Talk to you later.

Kay

Ill probably page you.

He never ccs Ben. Ben could tell him about Pompano. You might forward the email to Ben,

I think Pompano has a queue spot.

I'm at the drs office, should be in later.

I would like to take Dec 26, 31 and Jan. 2 as vacation days.

I've put it on the calendar.  I'll check and make sure you actually got to take it.

I would like to take Dec 26, 31 and Jan. 2 as vacation days.

Thanks,

I stopped by to ask Richard or Lisa, and neither were there.  Since Debbie said we could pick, I picked the one with the smallest retainer and the lower amount. If I hear something I will let you know. 

Thanks Kay. Any idea how long this will take? Did you talk to Debbie about her proposal?

Kathleen:  I looked at a recent invoice from our service company and the total fee is $286.00 - There is a first year statutory representation fee charged by the registered agent of $160.00 on top of filing fee, certified copy fee and service company charge for handling filing.  Please call me if you have any questions.  Teresa

http://www.state.de.us/corp/corpfee3.htm#LLC

According to the schedule of fees from the above SOS site for Delaware:

Certificate of Formation costs:
$50.00 (State Tax & Filing Fee)
$20.00 (Certified Copy)
Same Day Fee, if we want it $100.00
24 hour fee $50.00

I will confirm these fees with the corporate secretary tomorrow.

It would be helpful to see the lease and the letter before commenting.

Thanks,

Kay

Please provide me with any comments to the letter.  I can work with Lorie to get it revised and send it out once we receive a consensus.

The lease is freely assignable. The lien rights are based not contractual, but exist in Texas law.  I used to have some info on Texas lien law, don't remember if I still do. I haven't worked a warehouseman lien issue. However, in general it is one thing to have a lien, and another to be able to foreclose on it, especially that quickly. In short, I don't know if whatever Morris is saying they will do in the timeframe described is permissible. 

Rigby, you have any info on warehouseman liens in Texas?

Still looking for a copy of the letter from Morris. My fax number is 63491 if someone has it handy.

Kay:

I didn't get a chance to send the letter out today, but will do so tomorrow. Is it OK for me to send it out to AES without your initials, but with you intialing the copy we retain for our records? In the past, we typically provided payment direction to AES by e-mail.

Let me know.

Thanks Dave. We'll send the letter out today.

Not bored, just having a hard time getting into doing anything work related.

I'm thinking KC might be a bit bored this afternoon.

I can't imagine that Neil had much in '89, but hell, we'll take anything!

I ran Enron in the Unclaimed Property SOS of TX and found $.  Also, there is also some $ for a Neill Mann (from 1989 or something).

At lunch.  What's up?

Neil has been asking around.  Can't get anyone at Enron to think that far ahead.  I hate doing this, but I owe it to Michael, since I really want to keep him in private school. We've already eliminated his speech therapy.  Geez, I sound pathetic.

It is unclear to me that the coop has the authority to bind the members.  What do we know about that?

ckm

I appreciate your concern about the lack of timing, but this one went from 0-60 in 5 secs flat as their board meeting is this Wednesday and they have it only once a month.  I will def. be more sensitive to allowing some more lead time going forward.

Blue Ridge is a Coop which consists of the members listed below.  I believe we can sign one CA which binds Blue Ridge and all its affiliates, but when it comes to signing final deal documents, we'd have to do it via individual towns.

Regards,
- R

I'm in, but with lots going on.

What is the Blue Ridge Power Agency, as in what type of legal entity is it?  It sounds like it isn't one, if we would be signing CA's with each member.  Sounds like we may need CA's for each one of them.

Rahil, it would be very helpful if you could give us a bit more lead time next time around.  We want to do the best job possible for you!

Thanks,

Kay

Rahil needs this by tomorrow.  Are you in today?

Kathleen

Kathleen,

As discussed, here're the details surrounding our deal discussions with Blue Ridge Power Agency.  To date, we've had a preliminary meeting with them, in which they expressed interest in Enron serving their Members' load on an "All Requirements" basis (similar to our potential deal with CVEC).  Blue Ridge Members are:

Cities of Bedford, Bristol, Danville, Martinsville, Radford, Salem
Towns of Richlands, Virginia Tech
Central Virginia Co-Op (CVEC) & Craig-Botetourt Electric Co-Op

Following our meeting with Blue Ridge, they have sent us some load data and have chatted with us re. the types of deal-structures they would prefer.  We are expected to provide them with an indicative feedback on potential structures and prices by tomorrow (10/23/01).

Ideally, I'd like for the information we provide them (and hence to their consultants and their members) to be protected by the CA.  As and when a deal comes to fruition, we will probably be signing contracts with each one of the members individually.

Thanks again for your help.  Feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions.

For what it is worth, this is from Blue Ridge Power Agency website:  http://www.brpa.org/

About BRPA:
Blue Ridge Power Agency ("Blue Ridge") is a non-profit corporation established in 1988 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia and falls under Section 501(c)(12) of the Internal Revenue Code. It is a "joint action" agency that operates as directed by the Board of Directors. Each member appoints one Director and one Alternate from its organization to the Board.
The ultimate goal of the organization, through the power of numbers and economies of scale of cooperative, "joint" action, is to pursue those activities which will insure the most reliable and lowest cost wholesale electric power supplies possible for its members today and in the future.
There are currently nine members of the agency as listed below, consisting of seven municipalities, one state institution and one electric cooperative. Blue Ridge represents its members' best interest in several forums by direct staff involvement and/or coordination of the efforts of its attorney(s) and consultant(s). In each of these areas, wholesale and/or retail power supply and service issues are involved: energy and transmission contract negotiation; contract administration; consolidated billing; state and federal regulatory proceedings and litigation; state and federal legislation which includes education and lobbying efforts; joint purchasing; industry information dissemination; training; and "as assigned."
The current efforts of Blue Ridge and its staff are focused mostly in two areas: (1) administering its current power supply contract with Cinergy and the associated transmission contract with American Electric Power; (2) representing BRPA members' interest where wholesale power supply and transmission issues are involved, particularly in regard to the electric industry's transition to a restructured, "customer choice" structure. Generation was deregulated at the Federal level in 1992. Efforts now concentrate on the restructuring of the regulatory provisions for continued monopoly service at the transmission, distribution and customer service levels of the industry. It is especially crucial that the laws and regulatory structures that develop over the next few years are fair, non-discriminatory and promote real competition.

It is unclear to me that the coop has the authority to bind the members.  What do we know about that?

ckm

I appreciate your concern about the lack of timing, but this one went from 0-60 in 5 secs flat as their board meeting is this Wednesday and they have it only once a month.  I will def. be more sensitive to allowing some more lead time going forward.

Blue Ridge is a Coop which consists of the members listed below.  I believe we can sign one CA which binds Blue Ridge and all its affiliates, but when it comes to signing final deal documents, we'd have to do it via individual towns.

Regards,

I'm in, but with lots going on.

What is the Blue Ridge Power Agency, as in what type of legal entity is it?  It sounds like it isn't one, if we would be signing CA's with each member.  Sounds like we may need CA's for each one of them.

Rahil, it would be very helpful if you could give us a bit more lead time next time around.  We want to do the best job possible for you!

Thanks,

Kay

Rahil needs this by tomorrow.  Are you in today?

Kathleen

Kathleen,

As discussed, here're the details surrounding our deal discussions with Blue Ridge Power Agency.  To date, we've had a preliminary meeting with them, in which they expressed interest in Enron serving their Members' load on an "All Requirements" basis (similar to our potential deal with CVEC).  Blue Ridge Members are:

Cities of Bedford, Bristol, Danville, Martinsville, Radford, Salem
Towns of Richlands, Virginia Tech
Central Virginia Co-Op (CVEC) & Craig-Botetourt Electric Co-Op

Following our meeting with Blue Ridge, they have sent us some load data and have chatted with us re. the types of deal-structures they would prefer.  We are expected to provide them with an indicative feedback on potential structures and prices by tomorrow (10/23/01).

Ideally, I'd like for the information we provide them (and hence to their consultants and their members) to be protected by the CA.  As and when a deal comes to fruition, we will probably be signing contracts with each one of the members individually.

Thanks again for your help.  Feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions.

Regards,
Rahil

My brother just called, and my dad has just been admitted to the hospital for a heart problem.  There is a good chance that they will operate tomorrow or the next day.  If they do, then I will need to go to Ft. Worth for a couple of days.

I'll keep you posted.

Kay

Rahil,

Have we given them anything in writing yet, and are you willing to mark everything?

Kay

Kay,  Here are Central Virginia's comments regarding the CA.  As you can see, they want all information marked "confidential".  I spoke to Butch Solomon this afternoon with Suzette and tried to explain to him that it was not our normal policy to mark all confidential information "confidential", but I guess I did not persuade him.

Please advise.

Kathleen

Suzette,

    Pursuant to our conversation of earlier this afternoon, I am attaching a revised version of your proposed confidentiality agreement. The revised version is in Word format and my suggested changes are highlighted as you requested in your 10/19/01 email transmitting the proposed agreement.
    My first change is at the end of paragraph 2. It addresses my concern that any documents you give us that you consider confidential information will be so marked on every page, while taking our conversation into account and allowing other nonwritten confidential information provided to be covered as well.
    The next two changes are the typo we discussed in paragraph 3 and an additional sentence at the end of that paragraph. The sentence is added simply to recognize the need for timely provision of a Public Disclosure Copy in a regulatory or court proceeding.
    Finally, I have added the phrase found at the end of the first sentence of paragraph 7 to the end of the third sentence of that paragraph. I believe this addition is consistent with Enron's intent, but makes it more explicit.
    I plan to be in the office until about 7:00 pm EDT this evening and until about 2:30 pm tomorrow, and I will be happy to discuss my proposed changes with you and your attorneys at any time during that period.

Best Regards,
Butch

We can add a statement that written information provided at the meeting of x date (or however you want to describe it) is covered, and that in the future written stuff will be designated as confidential.

Then I'm just fine with it.

Kay,

I just checked our first presentation to them, and it didn't have the "confidential stamp on them.  Ideally, we'd like to have that covered, but don't think it is critical if the information there is not.

Going forward, I believe our revised proposal already has the stamp on every page.  If not, we will ensure that it is marked.

Are you guys okay with everything else?

Thanks. Your kind thoughts are appreciated.

Have a blackberry and cell phone.

Ok, I've changed your expenses account and am into your calendar, etc.  
 
Do you just use your cell phone now.  You don't have a pager any more right?  Blackberry?  Just updating my information.  Still married to Neil????  Just kidding~~~~~

Thanks, Suz. As you know, this stinks. Friends help.

Thank you for your call. I'm very sad, a bit angry with the doctors, and tired. Your voice cheered me up. Love, Kay

Hi Alice. I don't know that I will be back Monday. I need to help my mom get organized on some things. 

Thank you. Kay

We are all doing reasonably well, I think.

Can you handle? Thanks.

Kay,

I have reviewed the proposed change with our management, and we may be able
to close this out.  For clarification purposes, please review the attached
document, in which I have incorporated your changes as proposed on 10/9/01.
The changes were made to the version you sent back to Siemens Westinghouse
on 10/01/01.  If we both agree that this version is accurate, please advise
and we will begin the execution process on our end.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Ann

Hi Ann,

Thank you for your response. I wanted to propose some different language
for your consideration:

WHEREAS, the Gleason Project sustained damage to its exhaust stacks and
alleged that Siemens Westinghouse was responsible for such damage
because (i) of its failure to, among other things, provide drawings with
adequate directions for the welding of those stacks and (ii) excessive
vibrations at the Gleason Plant were a contributing factor to such
damage.  As a result, Enron presented a breach of warranty claim to
Siemens Westinghouse, in May of 2001, under the Contract in the amount
of Four Hundred Nine Thousand, Six Hundred Sixty-Six Dollars
($409,666.00) for repair work performed on two of the stacks ("Warranty
Issue").

I hope this gets us there.  

Thanks,

Kay

Kay:

We are in receipt of Enron's proposed changes to the Settlement
Agreement
and Release on the Gleason Project.  Unfortunately, it appears that the
intent of the Settlement Agreement has strayed away from initial
discussions
between our respective business representatives.   In past discussions
with
Enron regarding its claim for costs associated with reconstruction of
the
Gleason CT exhaust stacks, Enron tied its local low frequency noise
concerns
to the stack reconstruction issue.  Although the causes for
reconstruction
of the stacks were beyond SWPC responsibilities, SWPC agreed that in the
interest of continued customer relations, we would be willing to make a
business policy concession to Enron on the reconstruction costs in
exchange
for indemnification on future stack and noise issues. 

The latest revisions to the Settlement Agreement deletes any references
to
the noise issues in the warranty definition, thereby eliminating any
coverage for indemnification for future claims which may arise on that
issue
from the Settlement Agreement.  This elimination substantially erodes
the
value of Enron's indemnification, and the settlement overall.  As
modified,
the deal is no longer palatable to SWPC, and it is in our best interest
not
to enter into the Agreement as proposed by Enron.  Should Enron be
willing
to re-insert the language struck from the third WHEREAS paragraph, SWPC
would be willing to sign on to the deal.

Please contact me directly if you wish to discuss this further.  SWPC
would
like to resolve all outstanding issues with Enron, but we will not make
payment on a claim for an issue which we believe we bear no
responsibility
unless such payment is part of a more global settlement.

Hi Alice. I have a favor to ask. Please see if you can find an 800 number for Lincoln Life Central for filing a life insurance claim. Thanks. Kay

I just sent Alice an emai asking for help finding a number for Dads life insurance co. If she isn't in for some reason, all ask for your help.

Thanks for the plant. That was so sweet.

Kay

How about a call today at 2? 

Hi.
I'm planning to drive back today, and will take tomorrow off. I!ll need to come back soon, but I think it is time for me to go.

Thanks for all your support. It has made a big difference.

Kay

I will have to check to see who handles the paralegal hiring.

What is up with ENE? I!m still in FW.

Kay

Ok. I have 30 minutes then.

Marisa sent the invoices.

Today has been hard for me. I don't have the distraction of taking care of Mimi. I am going to gob to work tomorrow, but I dread it. You are welcome in Palacios this weekend, of course.

If we purchased the switch from an outside party and then leased it to USTeleNet under a capital lease, the asset would still be booked on UST's books at its FMV.  There would be no associated gain as the asset was never theirs (the third party would get the gain on sale).  Bullets 3 and 4 would be basically the same, except for the cash going to a third party.

Cell - 713-560-6493

What if we purchase the switch from a 3rd party, i.e. CES?  How would that affect your 1st 2 bullets?

Just to follow-up on our discussion yesterday regarding the accounting treatment assuming that USTeleNet owns the switch and that we purchase the switch and lease it back to them under a "capital" lease, the following would occur:

The asset would stay on their books (however it would be "marked-up" to FMV as evidenced by the purchase price)
They would defer the gain, if any, over the asset's life.
They would record a payable on their balance sheet and recognize interest expense in their P&L as payments are made
We would record the payment of cash to them and book a receivable and deferred interest income (to be recognized over the lease term)

Essentially we are lending them money equal to the FMV of their asset and receiving interest payments in return (i.e. direct financing lease)

I would be happy to go into more detail at your request.  Please let me know as issues develop and I will assist as necessary.

I have Lotus Notes emails which I can't forward since we've migrated to Outlook.

Hi Eric,

I'm back in the office, and am working on this deal again.  Seems like there are a couple of items which need to be obtained so we can go forward expeditiously. Specifically, we need copies of the following documents:

	Lease agreement between CES and UST.

	Nortel RTU terms.

	Bankruptcy order allowing the sale of the switch from TCP to CES. 

I can speak with US Telenet's attorney regarding these requests, if you can get his/her name and number or email address.

I know there are some other issues, but getting these documents will really help.

Thanks,

Kay

If I'm remembering correctly, it could be Connecticut.  That narrows it down quite a bit.

The Nortel RTU info is supposed to be here by Wednesday. 

Sherry, please make the few changes to the draft equipment lease Tammy previously prepared to incorporate the new terms.  To the extent necessary, just bracket any questions you have, especially commercial questions.  We won't tackle the security agreement or the license agreement yet. Just send the revised lease to me (not Eric yet).

Please see if you can find the bankruptcy proceeding.  If the docs aren't available on line, please get back to me before incurring any additional expense.  I don't want to spend a lot of money on this until things become a bit more clear.

I called her office and they told me.  What time Friday?  What's his name?

Do you have a handle on what she was working on?  I wouldn't want to bother her about anything.

Thanks Kay.  I've call off the dogs.   I guess you know that Tammy had
her baby on Friday - 5lbs. 14oz!

I received word that the switch deal is off. Thanks anyway.

I'm sure she had things put together well.

Kay,

I think it was around 3p.m. on Saturday.  His name is Charles (Charlie).
His middle name is something like Coudair (sp?).  Tammy has been working
on making lists and folders of all of her outstanding matters, so
hopefully we are ready to make the transition.

I predict that we will not prevail in an objection to consolidation. Judges love to consolidate unless there is a compelling reason not to do so. A one month delay will not be enough to persuade the AJL to not consolidate if you consider the advantages to the judges, so we would need a better reason.  Do we have anything else to go on?  (I don't think the Margate issue is enough, either.)

I doubt we will have the settlement buttoned up by the second week of December, which could leave us in the position of needing to continue the hearing until January anyway.

Kay

    Kay, Steve, Ben, and Debbie --  
        I spoke with Martha Nebelsiek today and she indicated that DEP is
intending to file a motion for consolidation of the two air proceedings into
a single proceeding.  To that end,  Martha believes that the proceedings
should be heard sometime in January 2002, depending upon which of the cases
is consolidated into the other.  Martha believes that consolidation is
appropriate now because the permit conditions recommended by DEP are
consistent and that, for evaluation purposes, the DEP considered the sites
as one.   Martha will be filing a motion for consolidation and wanted our
position on the proposed consolidation.  I told her that we would likely
oppose such a motion but that I would check with you before finalizing our
position.  
        Consolidation has its advantages and disadvantages.    The cases, if
consolidated, may be less expensive to try.  Yet, the hearing in December
may be at risk if consolidation occurs.    In addition, the parties are not
exactly the same in each proceeding  (Margate is not a participant in the
Deerfield proceeding).  I need to get back to Martha as soon as possible
with Enron's position on the proposed consolidation.   If she does not hear
back from me soon, then Martha will likely file the motion and indicate that
Enron objects to the consolidation.    
         Ryan and I also need to get approval to submit Enron's response to
DEP's Change of Position on the Pompano Beach air permit.   I promised not
to file any response last week, given the pending settlement negotiations
but we need to respond to the Change in the next few days. 
         Please advise me of your thoughts on the consolidation.

The document below contains the guts of the tasking letter, I believe.  The GSA was in the other email.

That must be it then.  I'll be glad to route the CAF, is the below the final document?
Thanks again,

Adriana  
I'm happy to look at another format.  This was the one Michelle gave me.

Kay

Kay,
I have everything I need with the exception of the wbs. coding, contact name, physical address and tax ID #.   I believe Allan is getting all that info for us.
We will be using this format from now on? 
Best regards,

Adriana

I forgot to include the draft copy (it's been one of those days)

 << File: Interim Agreement for Jode Corp.doc >> 

The GSA, without name and address.

Could you forward me the tasking letter once you are done so that I can understand how the pieces fit together?

Thanks,

Kay
It appeared to me that a GSA would be most appropriate for this work.  In speaking with some other EBS lawyers, I was told that Adriana could craft the work order/addendum to go with the GSA.  Please let me know if this is incorrect.

Kay

 

I forgot to include the draft copy (it's been one of those days)

 << File: Interim Agreement for Jode Corp.doc >> 

ok with me.

   Kay,
       Steve has asked that I inquire if you are available tomorrow at 12 :
30 pm (central) for a conference call to discuss the proposed consolidation.
I do not think that the call will require much time.     
         Thanks !  Kerri   

I predict that we will not prevail in an objection to consolidation.
Judges love to consolidate unless there is a compelling reason not to do
so. A one month delay will not be enough to persuade the AJL to not
consolidate if you consider the advantages to the judges, so we would
need a better reason.  Do we have anything else to go on?  (I don't
think the Margate issue is enough, either.)

I doubt we will have the settlement buttoned up by the second week of
December, which could leave us in the position of needing to continue
the hearing until January anyway.

Kay

    Kay, Steve, Ben, and Debbie --  
        I spoke with Martha Nebelsiek today and she indicated that DEP
is
intending to file a motion for consolidation of the two air proceedings
into
a single proceeding.  To that end,  Martha believes that the proceedings
should be heard sometime in January 2002, depending upon which of the
cases
is consolidated into the other.  Martha believes that consolidation is
appropriate now because the permit conditions recommended by DEP are
consistent and that, for evaluation purposes, the DEP considered the
sites
as one.   Martha will be filing a motion for consolidation and wanted
our
position on the proposed consolidation.  I told her that we would likely
oppose such a motion but that I would check with you before finalizing
our
position.  
        Consolidation has its advantages and disadvantages.    The
cases, if
consolidated, may be less expensive to try.  Yet, the hearing in
December
may be at risk if consolidation occurs.    In addition, the parties are
not
exactly the same in each proceeding  (Margate is not a participant in
the
Deerfield proceeding).  I need to get back to Martha as soon as possible
with Enron's position on the proposed consolidation.   If she does not
hear
back from me soon, then Martha will likely file the motion and indicate
that
Enron objects to the consolidation.

Kay,
 
We need to incorporate the following components into the Genuity Solutions Inc. Master Agreement:

We need a parent guarantee from Genuity Inc. ($10MM) and are willing to reciprocate (Enron Corp. $10MM).  We need to insert Events of Default with respect to guarantor. (Credit Support Annex section 4 and 5 from our MSA) 
We need to insert netting (MSA section 6.4) and close-out setoff (MSA section 5.7). 
We need to insert the ability to request financial statements from the Guarantor if they are not publicly available (MSA section 8). 
The assignment language needs to be re-amended.  Both parties can only assign to an affiliate that is at least as creditworthy as the existing - i.e. we need to maintain the parent guarantee. (MSA section 10.4). The current amendment is unclear whether or not Genuity is the only party allowed to assign to an affiliate. 
We need a bilateral bankruptcy event of default. (MSA section 5.1(iv)). 
There is no clause regarding disputes of invoices.  We can use our standard language from the MSA.(Section 6.3). 
Do we need to state that we are a forward contract merchant?

Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
Thanks,

Sounds fine.  I have a copy of what I believe to be the current master, and the confirm states that  a revised master is anticipated, and if signed, may govern the transaction. 
 
Kay

Kay, since you have been involved with Genuity, will you please followup on the proposals below.  Thank you.  Lance. 

W. Lance Schuler 
Arshak - We will approve this transaction with Genuity Solutions Inc. 

Please note - before any additional transactions with Genuity Solutions or Genuity Telecom occur we must amend the Master Agreement.  CRM does not approve of the form for the Master Agreement with Genuity Solutions, Inc.  There are no events of default with respect to EBS, we need to incorporate set-off language between the two affiliates and we need to push for a parent guarantee.

Molly - please attach these comments to the confirmation for the file. 

Lance - Can we get somebody in legal assigned to help amend this agreement?

Kay

Kay,

I just received a call from GE (Jeff Darst and Steve Swift) in which they said that NorthWestern was asking for GE to sign documents that would enable NorthWestern to buy out Enron remaining interest in the LLC.  I am unaware of any discussions with NorthWestern with regards to this.  Please give me a call, and be advised that Jeff and Steve are going to call you.

Thanks,

Chris

ok with me.

Now that things have calmed down a little around here, I would like to get both of you together to discuss this matter.  How about 3 p.m. on Monday afternoon?

Getting warmer.  Could you send me an email with a brief description of how you see us marketing their energy.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

- R

Getting warmer.  Could you send me an email with a brief description of how you see us marketing their energy.

I think I get this everyday now. Can you help get this cleared up? Thanks.

I think in this case specific is better.  Also, please check with K Young to see what is in place. We don't want to look bad to Dyn.

Hi there.

We need to get to closure on how to respond to motion to consolidate, and how to deal with the 36 vs 42 issue on Deerfield. Shall we try again for a conference call later today? Karri is available up until 4:30pm, (Central).

I'm disappointed that GE didn't call.  Must not have wanted to take the Enron credit risk.

I think we will also need to report it to the merger legal team, which I will take care of once we know what is up.

Kay

Mike Young from NW called to advise me that they received GE's consent. NW plans to send us notice of this tomorrow. I believe this will trigger our obligation to pay NW the balance of payments we hold, discounted at 7.5 % p.a. I believe this means that we will need to pay NW $5.1 million of the $5.2 million we have been prepaid.

Let's talk about this in the AM.

I checked the docs.  Closing is supposed to be 5 business days after notice, subject to regulatory approval.  I believe they will need to make a Hart Scott Rodino filing.  It should not take very long for to get it.  Seems Delta got it in a matter of days.

Kay

Hi Carolyn,

Could you resend the docs?  Our computer system deleted everything more than 30 days old.

Ok

I gave the IP Transit deal a quick look, and it appears to me that what we need to do is prepare an amended confirm, with the capacity and price varying, depending on the month.  May want to revisit the starting dates based on our letter agreement.  Please take a look at the confirm and see if there is anything else you think we need to change.

I suggest that we make a capacity/price schedule and attach it, amending the confirm to refer to the new schedule.

What do you think?

I think fmv is probably less than fifty. Thanks.

It would be terrific if I could see the tasking letter before I give final approval to the GSA (since this is really a one-off deal), and I will need to approve and initial both the GSA and the tasking letter.
 
Thanks,
 
Kay

Please provide final GSA so that I can forward to Jode.  Tasking Letter is not processed until GSA is executed and language has been agreed upon.  I will process once I received the executed GSA from Jode.  
Kay, I have a note that you would like to see if before I added to the approval process.
 
Thanks and best regards,

Her stuff is still here, but I don't know where she is.

should be here

Everyone,

We are trying to plan a going away luncheon for Alice on Tuesday, November 27th and it would be helpful if each of you could tell me whether or not you would be able to attend.  As soon as I get a head count I will let you know the time and place.

Thanks,

Kinda wish Kortney would have talked to me and cc'd me on this.  Does this happen much?  Don't know that I have a big problem with it, but it just seems like it isn't purely a Credit issue.

What do you think?

Kay

FYI - from Kortney in credit.

Kayne,  with regards to Kortney's question about the interruptability of power, please let me know when you're free tomorrow AM, so we can discuss this with her.

Kay, what're the next steps from your end?

Thanks again,
Rahil
3-3206 

Pursuant to the Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC transaction described in this email and your later draft term sheet, credit has determined that an EEI does not need to be in place with the counterparty and that we would be able to transact under the long-confirm form.

To provide a little bit of explanation for you:

A Master EEI is preferable when the counterparty is planning on doing long-term, large volume transactions.  Therefore, we have very specific terms and conditions that do not have as much ambiguity as within the GTCs.    

In terms of unit contingent or interruptible power - credit would like to get a clear definition of whether the cp is sleeving "unit contingent" power versus "interruptible" power, since there are varying degrees of risk inherent in the two separate transactions and we would like to gain an understanding of the term and type of power this will be.  

Thanks Rahil.

Kortney

Kay,

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

- R

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility?

Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

Getting warmer.  Could you send me an email with a brief description of how you see us marketing their energy.

And me?

Ben,

I will coordinate the $5,112,535 payment to NorthWestern with Theresa.

Ben,

I need to get you to resign from the Montana Megawatts BOD.  Will you be in this week?  If not, we can handle it with fax/fed ex.

Kay

Kathleen, 

Please prepare a letter of resignation for Ben, leaving the date of the letter as November ___.  Thanks.

I will have to find a form.  If you think the deal will extend more than a couple of months, or could develop into something bigger, I really suggest an EEI.

Once I find a form we can determine if we need a separate services agreement, or we can bake it into the GTC's/long confirm document.

Kay

FYI - from Kortney in credit.

Kayne,  with regards to Kortney's question about the interruptability of power, please let me know when you're free tomorrow AM, so we can discuss this with her.

Kay, what're the next steps from your end?

Thanks again,
Rahil

Pursuant to the Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC transaction described in this email and your later draft term sheet, credit has determined that an EEI does not need to be in place with the counterparty and that we would be able to transact under the long-confirm form.

To provide a little bit of explanation for you:

A Master EEI is preferable when the counterparty is planning on doing long-term, large volume transactions.  Therefore, we have very specific terms and conditions that do not have as much ambiguity as within the GTCs.    

In terms of unit contingent or interruptible power - credit would like to get a clear definition of whether the cp is sleeving "unit contingent" power versus "interruptible" power, since there are varying degrees of risk inherent in the two separate transactions and we would like to gain an understanding of the term and type of power this will be.  

Thanks Rahil.

Kortney

Kay,

Below are some answers to your questions re. Cogentrix.  Please let me know if you have any more.

- R

Power could be sold on a Day-Ahead or an Hourly basis.
They will give us a flat bogie and we will use that in our decision making.
Kenansville is a coal-fired, 30MW, plant.
We will be selling power at their bus point.  Any transmission cost, if/when incurred, will be treated on a pass-through basis.
The Min-Max decision on the number of MW's is their operational decision, and we will let them decide once we send them a draft of the revised contract.

Day ahead only?

How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 

Is this a gas only facility? 

How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?

Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?

Thanks,

Kay

 << File: Blue Dog Remaining GE Payments.xls >> 

They've changed the Cogentrix deal.  In fact, it is even a different Cogentrix counterparty.  I couldn't find the long form/GTC in the Power Forms.  Can you help?

Guess you would like the name of the counterparty.  I'll send it to you.

Thanks as always!

The closing docs are on top of my cabinet, near my name plate.  Help yourself.  

Thanks,

Ok.  One question...I have a draft of the "Written Consent of Manager of Montana Megawatts I, LLC" prepared by Marisa.  One of the resolutions was the election of officers (not directors) of the company.  Is the document making Ben a director in the closing documents?

Anyway, I'll prepare his resignation, I was just wondering if he was an officer too.

Kathleen, 

Please prepare a letter of resignation for Ben, leaving the date of the letter as November ___.  Thanks.

Kay & Rahil:  Just to make my position clear, if legal determines that an EEI is still necessary with this counterparty then we should go forward with pursuing an EEI agreement.

The credit position is that if the deal needs to get done soon, then let's just use the GTCs and we can follow up later with an EEI (if deemed necessary by legal).  If we can wait a couple of weeks, then let's go forward with negotiating an EEI now.

Hopefully this clarifies our position.  Sorry for the confusion.  If the later is the case, then Rahil, I will need to get financial statements from the counterparty and review.

Thank you.

Cogentrix Eastern Carolina, LLC 

Ruth,

Could you print theirs and ours for me since I may not make it to my desk before I come over? Thanks.

Kayne and Rahil,

Please give this term sheet a look and advise of any changes you think might be necessary.  For instance, it gives the delivery point as the CPL/Cogentrix border, and not the bb of the facility as Kayne suggested.  I am drafting off of the term sheet, so your input is very important.

I need the name of the generation facility and approximate number of megawatts we will be marketing for them.  Also, are we still planning on dealing with some PPA's they have?  If so, what will our involvement be and how many more megawatts are involved?

Are we only going to pay Cogentrix after we have received payment from the third party?  If they fail to remit other costs (transmission, for instance), I presume we will want to deduct that from what we owe them.  What other costs might we need to be reimbursed for?  What are Resource Costs?

How often will we email or fax them a sales summary? Will we be reporting to whom each delivery of power was sold?

Kortney, please confirm that Credit will not be requiring any particular language, etc in this deal since we aren't using an EEI.

Thanks for your help,

Kay

 

Where are you?  I'm on 6.

November 14, 2001

TO:     INTERESTED POWER SUPPLIERS AND MARKETERS

RE:     REQUEST FOR RETAIL PROPOSALS - MAINE STANDARD OFFER SERVICE

        The Maine Public Utilities Commission is soliciting proposals from
interested power suppliers and marketers to supply retail standard offer
service to commercial and industrial customers of Maine's two largest
electric utilities, Central Maine Power Company and Bangor Hydro-Electric
Company.  The total annual electricity sales to these customers is about 6.8
million MWh, of which 30% currently receives standard offer service. 

        The standard offer suppliers will provide service beginning March 1,
2002.  At your option, bids may be submitted for one, two or three year
terms.  Service will be provided directly by suppliers to customers at
retail, although the utility will handle billing and collection on the
standard offer supplier's behalf. 

        Concurrent with the Commission's solicitation for retail standard
offer service, Central Maine Power Company and Bangor Hydro-Electric Company
will be seeking proposals for wholesale standard offer supply.  The
concurrent solicitations will allow the Commission to evaluate all options
simultaneously and sufficiently in advance of March 1. You may participate
in both the retail and wholesale processes.  Initial bids for all of these
solicitations will be due on December 4, 2001.

The RFPs for the retail solicitation are available at www.state.me.us/mpuc.
Please note that there are separate RFPs for each utility.  The RFPs contain
detailed information about Maine's standard offer and instructions on how to
participate.  To obtain the RFPs by mail or email, please contact Tammy
French (at 207-287-6075 or tammy.french@state.me.us
< <mailto:tammy.french@state.me.us>> )   For additional information,  please
contact Faith Huntington (at faith.huntington@state.me.us
< <mailto:faith.huntington@state.me.us>> or 207-287-1373) or Mitch Tannenbaum
(at 207-287-1391 or mitchell.tannenbaum@state.me.us
< <mailto:mitchell.tannenbaum@state.me.us>>).

                                       

So how come no one will buy for $5b?

I was reading something on how we will be the biggest bankruptcy ever and have a great degree of comfort about our reorg.  Apparently, our debt is only in the neighborhood of $16 billion and as of September, our books had our assets valued at nearly $61 billion !  

      I hope that you had a wonderful Thanksgiving ! 
      FYI-- Judge Stampelos issued an Order consolidating the pending
Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach air permit challenges into a single
proceeding, which is scheduled to be heard on Tuesday, January 29th, 2002,
through February 1st, 2002.   Under the Order, the pre-hearing stipulation
is required to be filed by January 24th.   I will be sending a copy of the
Order by facsimile.   
       Please keep me apprised of the status of the settlement negotiations
as they progress.   I will send you a copy of the proposed permit language
for the Pompano Beach proceeding upon receipt from Martha Nebelsiek of DEP.

       If you have any questions or comments on the foregoing, please
contact me.

Hi Jerry,
 
Steve told me that he had asked whoever he spoke to at NorthWestern to take steps to extinguish the letter agreement that Enron and GE regarding the transaction.  I have prepared a letter to that effect and sent it to Steve for his review.  Basically it just says that Enron doesn't have any continuing obligations to GE under the previous letter.
 
Before we release the funds we would like to get an executed, revised letter from NorthWestern concerning the revised set off amounts and final total to be wired.  My fax number is 713 646 3491.
 
I did not have the certificate signed, but will dig it out and see what I can do.  Quite frankly I just overlooked it.
 
Kay

Kay, please advise me via e-mail of the results of your discussion with Steve Swift.  
 
Also, please confirm to me via e-mail that you will send to me via facsimile, simultaneously with the the payment of the "Remaining Purchase Amount Refund Amount", copies of the certificate evidencing Enron's 20% interest in Montana Megawatts I, LLC along with the Membership Interest Power, executed by Enron.  In addition, I ask that you forward originals of such documents to me via overnight courier for next day delivery.
 
Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.
 
Thanks.

The additional income for Northwestern will be booked by the end of this week. - This isn't supposed to be split with Calger is it?

Kay - all legal invoices for Delta should be split 30% Ben Jacoby cc#107319   70% Chris Calger  cc#150273.  

Theresa:

I wanted to follow up on a couple minor items.

Have you booked the $102,010 discount associated with the Northwestern deal as income?

On the Delta Power LM 6000 deal, I believe the legal invoices should be split according to the income allocation. I think the split was $4 million to Calger, and $2 million to me. 

Thanks,

Ben

I only have 4 in my box, and none were the ones I gave you.  Thanks!

Kay, do you or Alice have any invoices in your IBuyIt Inbox?  If so, why don't you forward them to me, and I'll do them for you.   
 
I don't want to send in these invoices you gave me today until I find out if they are in either of the inboxes.  I'd hate to duplicate payments.
 
Thanks!!!!!

have you faxed the docs yet?
Kay,  as you know, today is the "Call Closing"  pursuant to which Enron is required to (i) deliver to NorthWestern the Membership Certificate evidencing Enron's 20%  interest in Montana Megawatts I, LLC ("MMI") along with an executed membership interest power (collectively, the "Certificate") and (ii) pay to MMI $5,065,607 (the "Payment").  As of 4:00 pm EST, NorthWestern/MMI has not recieved the Certificate or the Payment.  
 
Please let me know when NorthWestern/MMI should expect to receive of the Certificate and the Payment. 
 
Thanks.

I see they've halted the sending of replies.  I will see if you should prepare them anyway to send tomorrow.

Here's the list of what we have so far.  I'll give you the letters and Debra is in charge of the files. It may be we don't have to look at every contract to get this done.

 

Kay

I'm  talking about the member interest power in particular.  
 
We don't have to have to send them the Darst stuff today.  I have another piece of paper that Dave needs to sign as well.  

yep.  I asked Jeff Darst to sign and fax back to us.

have you faxed the docs yet?

Yes, but since we signed the power it seemed that someone else would actually execute the certificate. By the way, it was certificate #2, so I changed the language in the power to reflect that.

Thanks Kay.  I will check in again with Liz Evans at NorthWestern on the status of the Payment.  Were you able to locate the Certificate?

4. Letter regarding setoff (need to have WDD sign)

1 and 2 should go to NorthWestern today by fax and fed ex.  3 and 4 can go tomorrow.

Need to notify corp sec also?

Thanks!!!

I have made spa appointments at Urban Retreat West for Friday afternoon, beginning at 330.

In the interest of moving things forward, it would help if you could provide the following info:

1. Hand-marked copy of the portions of the current contract which need to be changed.

2. A brief description of the new deal, especially the index language.

I know VEPCO may be preparing a first draft, but I think it would be good to get some focus ahead of time.

Kay

And that's what it's all about...

 
 

Good.  Gives us something productive to do!

Absolutely!  Almost all of the original contract will go away, but Rahil and I will go through it first thing in the morning and mark it up for you.  I know Rahil has language regarding the index from one of the traders that we will forward as well.

We are considering submitting a bid to provide standard offer service to commercial and industrial end users.  Can you tell me if EPMI is licensed to provide retail service in Maine?  If you aren't the right person, who should I ask?

Thanks bunches,

Kay

We should also have forms they previously approved, since we have negotiated a couple of CA's with them in the past.

I have PEC exec's waiting for this doc for review this evening...

Any luck?

Laura

R u going to call?

Jerry DeBerry called, and asked that Chris call Liz Evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer.  Once it is agreed, please send me an email with the revised number.

We were working off of different receipt dates.  I received the fax on Monday, and they believe it was delivered here the Friday before.  That is the reason for the different expectation on the closing date.

Dave Duran would like to be advised before the transfer is made.  I presume that Chris or Ben will take care of talking to Dave so that the transfer can be made tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kay

you might check with the bank.  My paycheck should have hit by now.

this is good stuff

New program.  The only termination notices we are responding to are those with termination payment calculations.

Some of the letters were something other than termination/suspension notices, so you might want to check to see if you think we need to reply for other reasons.

Kay

   Good op ed piece.

This will make you mad again.

I'm still sorting through all of the WSJ articles, but if you read this one, I think it's clear that Lay, Skilling, Fastow, Arthur Andersen and others will have criminal prosecutions and disgourgements.  It is very rare that the WSJ with its conservative bent and with a Republican President writes this type of Op-Ed.  Nevertheless, the article already sets the predicate of Lay's defense that he did not fully comprehend what was going on and, thus, lacked the mens rea for the crimes that Skilling and Fastow will be charged with.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Investigating Enron

11/30/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

You can cut the Schadenfreude with a machete these days as Enron careens toward failure. Like any fast-rising, innovative business, the energy trader made enemies, some with a fair grievance and some not. We hope the inevitable (and necessary) investigations keep in mind the difference. 
Enron was a forthright advocate of competition, as every obituary of the past few days has noted. Some see the firm's collapse as discrediting the market economics it championed, though the opposite is closer to the truth.
It strikes us that Enron was partly a victim of its own success. Its revenues quadrupled in a year, thanks to the fillip that California's troubles provided to the wholesale power market. But profits were up much less -- i.e., Enron was earning thinner margins in the energy-trading business it pioneered. The new industry quickly became too competitive and transparent to afford any windfalls, just as deregulation admirers would have predicted. 
Enron does not own U.S. power plants and generally did not seem to make outsized profits on power for resale in, say, California. But that didn't stop California's eccentric attorney general, Bill Lockyer, from blaming Enron CEO Ken Lay for that state's electricity mismanagement. Last summer he told a Wall Street Journal reporter that, "I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8x10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, `Hi my name is Spike, honey.'" Consider that an unfair grievance. 
Accounting matters are more troubling. The struggle for a century has been to make sure corporate managers don't pursue their own agendas at the expense of owners. The emergence of special partnerships, controlled and owned by Enron's own senior officers, with which the company did some of its murkiest deals, would cause even libertarians to wonder what's been going on. Clearly Mr. Lay didn't fully understand what former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling was up to, and shareholders weren't told either. 
At the same time, Enron officers had a large amount of personal wealth tied up in Enron stock, which has fallen from $90 to 61 cents. So the mere existence of these partnership deals does not automatically indicate corrupt intent. Only a detailed investigation can resolve whether these deals were honestly motivated, and whether Enron's (and Arthur Andersen's) interpretation of accounting rules was defensible. In any case, trial lawyers will descend to squeeze every penny out of Enron's troubles for themselves (and for shareholders or employees who held Enron stock in their 401(k)s). 
As for the investigations, we hope they won't be influenced one way or another by long connections between Mr. Lay and President Bush. Even the hint of special treatment would be a political disaster, especially for an Administration that promised to clean up after Bill Clinton. 
While tradition has been not to make criminal matters out of accounting scandals, exceptions have arisen recently. Federal prosecutors in New York have gone after Walter Forbes, who sold his company to Cendant, giving rise to what before Enron was the nation's most costly stock meltdown due to bad accounting. San Francisco prosecutors recently extracted guilty pleas from executives of Aurora Foods over their treatment of trade promotion expenses for their portfolio of "orphan" brands as capital expenditures. 
Enron is an opportunity for the Bush team to show it can police similar financial chicanery, if some is found. Sorting the capitalists from the crooks is one way of protecting capitalism.

There will be no holds barred with the Times and the Wash Post weigh in on this one.

Remember that's the WSJ  -- with that op-ed, every other paper NYT etc. will pile on even harder.

   Good op ed piece.

This will make you mad again.

Yes

Yes.

Unbelieveable. Call me tonight 7139736325

Could you send me the notice of default and our response?  Thanks!

I have asked for something from GE indicating that Jeff D. had the authority to sign the consent.  I would think that this shouldn't take very long.

Jerry DeBerry called, and asked that Chris call Liz Evans to get a handle on the correct number for the wire transfer.  Once it is agreed, please send me an email with the revised number.

I'll be there with bells on and cards in hand.

Ciao,

Kay

Is Enron in default under the Sandhill agreements?  How about any other deals you know about, including the Mexico stuff?  Have you inherited Peoples (enovate) yet?  I suspect there may be a default there.  

I'm helping gather some of this info, and your help would be appreciated.

Thought I would ask a more specific question.  Do you know of any transactions which Enron may be in default due to recent circumstances?  I'm excluding trading deals.  Maybe some of the asset management deals?  Joint venture companies (enovate?)?

Thanks,

Kay

I think I still need the data sheet for this corp.  Thanks

can you help me?
I sent it to Ed with latest changes.

I think I still need the data sheet for this corp.  Thanks

Travis,

The draft opinion is going to Davis Polk as we speak.  Eric is going to try to find out if they will comment tonight.  Kate Cole had some comments on the Certificate of Secretary, and I passed the comment along through Eric.

We are putting together diligence folders in connection with the opinions (what the heck).  We'll tee up the next round of companies once we get the list.  Cheryl was going to talk to someone at WGM to confirm which ones are going in next.

I'm still here.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do to help.

Hi Robin,

Can you locate the EBS Inc bylaws for me?  I wasn't able to get on Spotlight this am.

Thanks,

Kay

John,

There is a $739 charge from CT Corp. on invoice #186444 (re Blue Dog). Can you send me an email with a brief explanation?  I want to get this in the queue.

Ciao,

Kay

no word yet.

What about Oz, Heather and Mark?

Would you mind calling Diagnostic Clinic and canceling my appt with dr roman tomorrow?  I think work may be a bit complicated.  (I'm on the phone)

Thanks!!!!

Hmmm.

FYI

Could we have a copy of the list with Kay added? if there wil be a reallocation of assignments, then we should hold tight on work on these project until we know what is what.

Ben,

As Fred pointed out, he thinks the "gas" agreement you are referring to is the Amended and Restated Gas Sales Agreement, which is Exhibit "A" to the Cash Flow Interest Agreement.

John and/or Bart:  I have a copy of the Cash Flow Interest Agreement.  Who wants it?

Kathleen

Folks:

Attached please find Rev 5 of the site list. I've added the Onondaga Gas
Transport Agreement to the list, and Kay's name to certain development
projects given her extensive history with these projects.

Please use this as a source document to replace the prior version. Fred,
please provide a copy of the transport agreement to Kathleen, and let me
know which Enron entity is the counterparty to OCLP.

Regards,

Ben

Will work for food.

I am - thanks for more of it!

Are you riding herd over this happy stuff?

I am forwarding you a copy of Akamai's termination of the IP Transit
Agreement which has also been sent via Facsimile and Federal Express.

Please feel free to contact Jonathan Stefansky or Jim Flanigon if you wish
to discuss this matter further.

Janet, 

Do you know if we have any deals in Texas or Penn which might be impacted by a license suspension?  I know that's a tough question.

Kay

Kay:

As requested, this draft memo summarizes disclosures that EPMI must make to maintain its retail licenses.  Please let me know if you need more information.

Will you modify the opinions you have to include this language?

Thanks,

Kay
Kay,

This is the language generally offered by Mr. Derrick with respect to the '40 Act.  Please call if you have any questions.

Enron is not an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

Clem

Works for me.

I am going to email you the changes I have in the subsidiary form. There are some nits included which should be fixed in JD's.

Kay

The Portland General Security and Pledge Agreement is not a "Loan Document'.

Does that look right?  Lorie says it is a WBS code number (Greek to me).

Well I hope he puts in a good word for me.

I talked to Carlos, and he didn't say anything about the call you referenced.  Are you sure your leg wasn't being pulled?

FYI

Who do you report to?  Don wants to know so that he can make sure that you stay around.  He really likes you.

Interesting stuff

We now have a structure in place dealing with Enron Americas estate and ensuring that we best maximize all of our contractual and asset positions.  This team will be headed by Don Miller going forward please help him and the team as this is our highest priority.

Some areas of this organization remain blank and will be completed by Don and the head of the appropriate business unit.  There are some areas which will also be dual tasking for a period.

Louise

thanks.

Do you need anything else from me at this time?

Kay

Could you send me whatever you think is appropriate so I can get it in front of the lenders?

Thanks,

Kay

Kay,

The revised JVD opinion has him opining as to non-contravention issues with respect to The Portland General Pledge Agreement.  He shouldn't be giving this opinion.  His opinion was originally limited to due authorization only.  This is problematic.

Clem    

thanks.

Do you need anything else from me at this time?

Kay

Elizabeth has scheduled a meeting at 4 o'clock concerning non-terminated trading contracts. It will be in the conference room with all the contracts (don't remember the room number).  You are cordially invited (requested) to attend.

Kay

I'm gone

Michael has his holiday performance.  Thanks for asking.

Hi Peter,

Still here.  Let me give you my home email, just in case: Kay.mann@worldnet.att.net.

My main objective currently is to maintain a positive attitude.  

Hope you and yours enjoy the holidays.

Kay

	I hope this e-mail gets through to you.  Just wanted to let you
know that I'm thinking of you.  I hope you come out of this mess ok.
Please contact me after the dust settles to let me know how you're
doing.  Happy Holidays!

Very cute.  All the kids were cute.

fine with me

Folks:

Can we get together at 3 PM in ECS to talk about the D5A. Please let me know.

Thanks,

Ben

Hi Ben,

It would be great if you could expedite the invoices.

Thanks,

Kay

I coded the King and Spalding invoices in IPAYIT yesterday. Before coding, I had to forward the invoices to Ben for his approval. So, they should be processed and paid soon through IPAYIT. 

Thanks-

Tonya

Good morning,

I forwarded to you over the last three weeks approximately 8 to 12 invoices for coding.......Kay Mann wants to resolve these invoices today.     Will you please code the invoices as the following or return them to me.    My last day at Enron is tomorrow (3 p.m.), so if you don't get them to me, please process them and inform Kay Mann of the status.

Coral Energy - Cost Center 107319

Project Blue Dog - Split 50/50 between Cost Centers 107319 and 150273

Midway Energy - WBS C.008071.

Carol,

This file represents in and out collateral, cash, LC, sureties and securities. The Onicas are still trying to reconcile the cash position with acctng and is subject to correction.
I've sent you a margin report via interoffice mail....the downloaded file is pretty messy.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks
	

Debbie and/or Tanya:
Could you please send me an updated list of LC's that we have posted and that have been posted to us.  Also, could you please send me a margin report that sets forth margin posted to and from our trading counterparties?  We will be beginning the process of responding to termination letters and this information will be helpful to us.  Thanks.

Susan and Stephanie:
For the global chart please set up a column for margin as we need to track margin that we have posted and margin that has been posted to us.

Still not resolved.

For now, Kay and I both will be working on this. I learned this am that the desk has a power deal with City of Austin that is in default ( not involving the LCRA hedge), so it may be beneficial to think about some kind of global workout with the City involving the $$ owed, the 8% interest held by Sandhill and the obligations under the power deal. When I have some time to read the project documents, and you get your info, all three of us should meet to formulate a response to the City's letter.

Stuart:

Here is my shot at your memo.

I will have the accounting spreadsheet from Theresa Vox today.

At the risk of asking a stupid question, are we in breach under the project agreement?  I didn't comb it, but I also didn't see anything that screamed breach to me.  If we have a paid up call on 100 MW, that is probably something we would want to preserve.

More to consider!

They are talking termination, which may not be justified for the asset management deal. Don't know whether that would be a good thing or not.

I'm in a meeting but will check when I get back to my office.

Hi Kathleen,

Would you mind printing this letter on letterhead for Ben to sign?  I'll be over in just a bit.

Thanks,

Kay

The only change would be the date.

I am familiar with the Mancini option, but I don't know who this person might be.  Any ideas?

Paul Jankowsky just called and wanted to talk to the attorney in charge of the Deerfield project.  He sounded a tad irate.

I may have sent this to you before.

Do you have the Haywood file that was in Carlos' office?  I need it or a copy of it.  

Thanks,

Kay

Ben has given this to Raimund to deal with.

The landowner is "Gilda Mancini, individually, and Gilda Mancini, Lisa M. Jankowski and David A. Mancini, as Co-Trustees of the Richard Mancini Revocable Living Trust dagted April 24, 1973".

Paul Jankowski is obviously related to Lisa.  Stuart, didn't you deal alot with Paul Jankowski as sort of the family spokesman?

I am familiar with the Mancini option, but I don't know who this person might be.  Any ideas?

Paul Jankowsky just called and wanted to talk to the attorney in charge of the Deerfield project.  He sounded a tad irate.

I think it would be a good idea to have the files copied.  

Kay

I have my files (that I borrowed from Carlos' office the other day) here with me.  For what it is worth, I review Ben's letter and changed it to comport with the requirements of the agreement.  Would it be easier for me to send you copies or do you need both binders?

Do you have the Haywood file that was in Carlos' office?  I need it or a copy of it.

Are the right one to ask for this?

Thanks,

Kay,

In going through the contracts assigned to us, I have determined that we do not have all contracts necessary to evaluate our exposure/potential work out of the various transaction.  To summarize:

1.Oglethorpe Power Corp.:  The Interchange Agreement supplied is expired.  Is there an amendment or extension?

2.Ameren Services Company:  The contract is sell only (Ameren sells to EPMI), but we have positions in our books whereby Ameren has the obligation to purchase from EPMI.  There must be a MPPSA or another contract that allows for purchases as well.  Ameren has the obligation to purchase 300-400 MW on-peak for next summer.  This one should be a relatively easy sell/assignment to a third party.

3.Connecticut Light & Power:  Termination is subject to conditions outlined in the Mid-Connecticut Project Termination, Assignment and Assumption Agreement (I think this is the bigger CRRA agreement).  Jim Grace and Sheila Tweed are the responsible parties for the CRRA workout.  As this contract is inextricably linked, shouldn't they take over this contract as well?

4.GPU:  I believe there are additional contracts out there  governing transactions between EPMI and the various GPU subsidiaries.  Will you have a search run on the follow company names?

GPU Services
GPU Energy
Jersey Central Power & Light Company
Metropolitan Edison Company
Pennsylvania Electric Company

Thanks!

Heather

Hi there,

I've been told that the waiver needs to contain a statement that GT won't bring suit against any of the officers, directors or employees of Enron.  If you can make that change and fax me a new waiver, we will get it done as quickly as possible.

Thanks,

Kay

Could you mark up the llc opinion and fax it to Suzanne Adams at 7136463491?  Thanks.

Looks good to me.

Good suggestions.  Take a look at this proposal.  I have talked with Julie Smith this morning and they are still interested in transacting with ENA despite the negative press.

Thanks,
Ruth

We can try.  The guy who managed this deal for the desk left the Company but I thought he handed it off to Rick Hill in the estate.  I will talk to the rest of the guys on the desk and find out what we have on it and call you.  My basic understanding of this deal is that we provided services only and are agent for the plant.  I believe Rick Hill is the commercial contact on the deal so he should be able to provide more insight to the whole deal.  I will get back to you.

Hey Tom,
Rita Wynne just called and let me know that we need to make a payment to TXU on behalf of Tenaska.  Since TXU has terminated agreements with us, the Cash Management Committee will not make payments to TXU unless they understand the deal that is in place with Tenaska and we show that Tenaska has already paid us their part.  Could you please help Chip Schneider, of Enron Underwriting, and myself get up to speed on this as quickly as possible.  TXU is threatening to take action on Tenaska.  Thanks for your help.

Bryan,

Yes, I would like to talk to you.  I think it will make sense to have an analyst in some capacity.  I didn't realize that you would making this decision so soon.  Maybe we can talk after bidweek (early next week).  If that timing does not work let me know.  I am still not sure if or when Lavorato is going to give me a Trading Track analyst/associate.  But I still would like to talk to you before you make a decision.

Tom

Tom,

I wanted to let you know that I have started interviewing for my next rotation.  Last week I had interviews (and offers) from two groups in Power. I would prefer to stay in Natural Gas.  I wanted to know  whether or not you have decided to hire an analyst or not. I am very interested in the possibility of working on the Texas Desk.

Thanks,

Jeanie,

I have enclosed Sherrie Trigg's resume.  She is interested in a Recruiter position, job # 00001088305, Traci Warner supervisor.  She is also interested in a Specialist/Sr. Specialist position in HR, job #0000108135, Laurie Miller supervisor.

Her experience has been in marketing, human resources and recruiting.  If you can do anything to help I sure would appreciate it.

Thanks,

Tom

 

I received a call back on the HPL on EOL subject from Ed and it appears that AEP intends to replicate what we have done on EOL via ICE.

Tom

Fine with me.
Brian,

Tom and I have talked about what Enron would like to do to keep EOL going on HPL.  I do not know what AEP's plans are for trading on their system ICE.  Tom suggested I talk with Bill about the options, what do you think?  Is this OK with you?

Tommy,

I agree.  The traders need access only to the physcal trading systems.  They are only trading next day physical gas for the remainder of May, so they do not need access to any other systems.

Thanks,

Tom

Attached is a file that list the employees going over to AEP and what data access they currently have within our systems.  At close all of these individuals will be cut back to having only access to AEP/HPL.  Currently some of these individuals have access to more than just HPL or Texas.  I'd like to cut them back to have only access to HPL and Texas ASAP.  Please review and let me know if you'd like to make any exceptions.  The spreadsheet has tabs for Sitara, Unify and Global.  Thanks!  -  Tommy

 << File: HPL AEP Transfers Data Access1.xls >> 

John,

I will need 1 senior analyst and possibly could fill some of my cash trading needs with an additional associate.  I have talked to Bryan Hull (third year analyst) about a one year rotation at our desk.  He spent his first rotation in the Texas Risk Group and did a great job.  His second rotation has been in the EOL Marketing Group.  He is interested in trading and is a sharp guy.  I would like to see some of the other folks coming in just to compare against him and to see if using an associate is a viable option for my cash trading needs.

Tom

We have been assigned 24 new Associates, 26 new Anaysts, 8 summer Associates and 8 summer Analysts from the incoming class.

Please let me know your needs with respect to numbers.   Louise and I will then decide if we agree and then we will create a process to pick from the ones we have assigned to us.  I'm assuming that Calgary, Toronto and Portland have done their own thing and don't need any of these people (let me know if this is incorrect).  

If you received this and you report to someone else on this list (ie. you don't report to the office of the chair) please cooridinate your needs with your supervisor.

Please respond prompty,

John

Yes, Dave's reporting relationship and cost center has not changed; his is just physically moving down here since we have the space.

Tom

Just wanted to let you know that Dave is scheduled to move over here on Friday.  Also, I just wanted to be sure that you told me that Dave will keep his current cost center?  

Laura

John,

My suggestion is to have the offsite to be social in nature.  I am sure that many of these people do not know each other and an environment where the group can mingle and enjoy some fun activities would be a great way to become more familiar with each other.  If we must have meetings/presentations, have them done by outside speakers so the group does not have to prepare presentations.  As far as where to go: Austin, San Antonio or Galveston are nice and will be reasonable for a group this size.  If you are ok with spending more the golfing, fishing and Spa activities in Florida (Miami, Key West, Tampa/St. Pete) are great.  Also golfing, rafting and Spa's in Colorado would be good too.

I don't have a strong preference for where we go but I do believe that people would appreciate a focus on fun and getting to know each other.

Tom  

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John

Jim,

Noon brunch would probably work better for me considering Matthew's nap time and that Monday is a school day.  I will handling the kids solo since Lyne will be at MD Anderson with Elaine that day, so I hope everyone is patient with Matthew as sometimes he can be a little rowdy at restaurants (he has been known to inflict fear in waiters, waitresses and owners alike).  Remeber those days........

Tom

What do we want to  do on Mother's Day?  Mom & Dad have A D Players that day (with me,  Henrietta, Ken, and Mary Ann) from 2 PM to 4:30 PM (or 5 PM ??).  Do we  want to do a noon brunch in the Kirby/Galleria area, or dinner in the same  area after A D Players?
 
I gave mom a  heads-up a month ago about this overlap of events and she chose not to re-schedule A D  Players.

Please forward the information to Eddie Leschber and Laynie East.  I know the origination was classified as Gas Assets but their transaction count was included in our budget since all of their pricing is structured in our group.  If those transactions are not included in our count then our middle marketing transaction targets for the 1st and 2nd quarters need to move to Gas Assets.  Ask Eddie and Laynie how they want to handle it.

Thanks,

Tom

Tom, Lamphier and Wallis had orig during the 1st Qtr but was classified as Gas Assets and not Middle Mkt Texas.  These two have been classified as Gas Assets for quite a while now (back to Jan 2000).  Danny and Elsa did not have any orig during the 1st Qtr.

Maybe we should meet.  I am not sure what Dave has told you but my intent i=
s for at least the near term that his responsiblities not change.  My objec=
tive in moving him on the desk is to provide an opportunity for him to have=
 a better perspective in what we do.  I told him that as he has time I coul=
d utilize him for analysis or other projects but not at the expense of his =
current job.  The bottom line is that Dave is very good at his current role=
 and he has expressed interest in trading.  I viewed this move as an opport=
unity to evaluate his trading potential while he is given the opportunity t=
o see what trading is really like;  but I have no immediate plans to move D=
ave into trading.  If the time ever comes that I would like bring him into =
trading I will certainly coordinate the transition with you.  I was under t=
he impression that Dave cleared all this with you before he moved.  It appe=
ars that he may have made this physical move more meaningful than it is and=
 certainly more than I intend at this time.  How do you want to handle this=
?

Hello everyone!
Just wanted to send a quick note to let those of you who don't know already that I will be moving into a new position within the next week or so and will no longer be the Reporting Contact for the Natural Gas Teams.  I am moving over to manage the Reporting Groups for the Back Office and Group Teams.  Please welcome Laynie East as my replacement.  She can be reached at X3-3131 and you may begin calling her with any Natural Gas Team related needs immediately.
I will certainly be assisting in the transition process and will assist her with any of your requests on an as needed basis for a while.  Please forward this note to anyone in your groups who may need this information.

It has been a pleasure working with each of you over the last several months.

Thanks,
Edie

Brian,

Don't worry about comprimising our trading position because I think AEP via the HPL employees already have a general idea of what we have been doing with storage; plus they will need to know as of close anyway.

Tom

Thanks Jim S.

I suggest that we notify AEP of this amount during our meeting with them this week.  We also need to develop a process of how we are going to update them of the impending volumes at the end of May without compromising our trading position.

Tom M. please discuss with Jim and we can cover at the meeting on the June bid week deal approval process that Lillian is arranging.

Brian

As of today May 9, 2001 Bammel has working gas of approximately 20.3 TBTU.  Economics are favorable to keep injecting.  I estimate that injections will average around 1TBTU per week through May 31, 2001 which would result in another 3+ TBTU beibng injected.  At the current pricing level this means that AEP would owe Enron somewhere around $98 million.  Is this something Accounting should be working into the AEP settlement to pay Enron on June 1, 2001?  Should AEP be notified of the volume and approximate value.  Is there anything that needs to be done contractually other than the original agrrement to facilitate this transaction?  I just wanted to make sure everyone is aware!  Please let me know your thoughts.
   

Barbara Gray has informed me that you have been inquiring about modifying the Texas EOL physical products to ENA as the counterparty for June.  The products you have to be concerned about are Waha and Exxon Katy Tailgate.  The other physical products are HPL related and will no longer be used.  There is a slight possibility that the Agua Dulce product may continue but I will contact you if it needs to be changed to ENA.  Our need for these ENA products will be approximately May 16th, when we want to roll out our June products.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Tom

It is my understanding that five AEP employees will in Enron's offices starting May 15th or 16th to get a better understanding of how to do the HPL trading and to direct the HPL bidweek activities for June (assuming close occurs for June).  To protect Enron's proprietary trading information for May and June I would like the AEP employees not to be allowed in the offices until after 10:30 AM for the duration of their stay.  From 7:30 - 10:30 AM is when the May business occurs and it is also when the communication occurs with HPL employees.

Another issue is what happens if we believe that close is going to occur June 1 and then late in bidweek it gets delayed until July;  who wears the risk positions?  My suggestion is that if AEP is going to set up HPL activities for June then they should wear the risk positions.  The way to accomplish this is to do the following:

	1.  The initial core term index physical position plus all thirty day index deals will be swapped out at gas daily index at the nearest relevant gas daily index 	     point (ie. HSC or Waha) after considering any volumes to be targeted for storage injections.

	2.  Volumes targeted for storage injections up to 400,000/d purchased on IFGMR HSC index related pricing will be sold to AEP in the ground at June index 	     + actual storage costs.  Volumes targeted for storage are those volumes that can phyically get to Bammel storage.

Examples

Case 1
Core term index position    100,000/d long  (50,000/d Waha, 50,000/d Texoma)
Thirty day index position    200,000/d long  (volumes at Thompsonville and Katy)
Total Index Position           300,000/d long

Vols. targeted for storage   200,000/d

Enron sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.  Any additional volumes would be sold to AEP at July index.  Enron sells 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR Waha and 50,000/d gas daily swap at IFGMR HSC.

Case 2
Core term index position     200,000 short (50,000/d Waha, 150,000/d HSC)
Thirty day index position     400,000 long   (50,000/d Waha, 100,000/d Agua Dulce, 100,000/d Thompsonville, 150,000/d Katy)
Total Index Position            200,000 long

Vols. targeted for storage    200,000/d

Enron sells AEP 200,000/d in storage at June IFGMR HSC index plus storage costs.

I reviewed Article 4 and the disclosure schedules to the Purchase and Sale Agreement and see no changes necessary related to the areas of my responsibility.

Tom

Attached are the  disclosure schedules to the Purchase and Sale Agreement with AEP.  I have also attached the portion of the PSA that contains the reps and warranties to which the schedules relate.

Fine with me.

it would be easier if you waited till the 18th and changed everything of nothing.

Barbara has said legal would give us the green light on Friday the 18 th the proceed with making
changes to all the systems that need to occur for bid week.  

Please let me know what you think,

thanks

Bob, 
Just wanted to pass the information I am getting below on to you. Didn't you think we would not know until the 18th?
See below, Tom Martin is wanting products changed on the 16th. Do you have any news I don't have yet.
Thanks for your help.

Please note "HLP" change below.  Thanks.
Barbara Gray has informed me that you have been inquiring about modifying the Texas EOL physical products to ENA as the counterparty for June.  The products you have to be concerned about are Waha and Exxon Katy Tailgate.  The other physical products are HPL related and will no longer be used.  There is a slight possibility that the Agua Dulce product may continue but I will contact you if it needs to be changed to ENA.  Our need for these ENA products will be approximately May 16th, when we want to roll out our June products.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Ok.

I would like to take a day of vacation on Wednesday, May 23rd.  Daniel will be covering for me.  Please let me know if this will be a problem, since I know that it's right before Bid Week.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

I will probably have my needs met by August.  My interest has been in Analyst/Associates coming off rotations that are available in June.  I have been working with Neil Davies to get this done.  I will let you know if I have further needs.

Any chance she can start sooner?  Can we leave her assigned to me until the end of June?  I am not trying to turn away help because I definitely need it;  I am struggling with her starting in August.

I will therefore re-assign the below.

From my perspective the Waha, Exxon Katy Tailgate and the new Carthage Tailgate product should be converted to ENA on the 18th if we find out that the close will occur June 1st.  Since the bidweek procedures we are proposing include AEP directing HPL activities for June during bidweek if we determine that close will occur June 1st, then it seems only logical that we should start operating as ENA at the same time.

Thanks,

Tom  

Barbara and Tom -

Please advise as to the latest status of the HPL products being offered on EnronOnline.  Barbara, please advise as to whether the transition from HPL to ENA is effective on June 1 and whether the Waha and Exxon Katy Tailgate locations should be offered as ENA prior to June 1.

Thanks

An issue has come up that I did not consider in my prior discussions of how bidweek for June should be managed prior to knowing if we close or not.  Physical deals for June have started to happen already.  If close does occur and all the deals prior to May 18th are done as HPL then ENA will miss out on a lot of potential business for June.  So I believe a fair solution is to have all deals in locations that are most relevant to HPL (ie. Agua Dulce, Thompsonville, Oasis Katy, Lonestar Katy, Texoma) be done as HPL; deals in a location such as Katy Tailgate that is relevant to HPL and ENA will be split evenly HPL and ENA and written up as two separate purchases.  Waha is not considered here since AEP already has a Waha trader who is active in the market.

Thanks,

Tom

You have sent an E-mail to Thomas Martin not Martin Thomas.

Just a quick update. I have spent some time this morning with Martin Thomas on this.

There now appears to be a slight technical problem with the numbers at present. Martin is speaking to Telecoms regarding this now. We will let you know as soon as we have an update.

Sorry to be a pain.

With the FacSys users that you set up for me, would it be possible for them to be allocated an Oxford number rather that a London one? I believe that we have enough licences available.

Fantastic!  I am happy that it ultimately worked out.  Welcome aboard.

Tom

Mr. Martin, 

As you can see from the e-mail address, I am now an Enron employee.  After we had last spoke, in November, I was contacted by the Analyst program and I asked them to keep my name in the database, just in case an opportunity were to arrive.  In April I got a call out of the blue asking if I was still interested.  I did have to think about the decision a little bit, but I figure that the opportunities for me here greatly out numbered those at Coral.  I accepted and as of April, 30, I am here in the East Power Fundamentals group on the 31st floor. 

I just wanted to give you an update, and I thank you again for helping me get into the Analyst program!

Sincerely,

Jason Kaniss

Should Jim Schwieger be included as he has been in prior PRC meetings.  He knows all the gas traders and middle marketers and has been valuable to this process in the past.

Tom

Please mark your calendars.  

The ENA Commercial PRC meeting will be held on JULY 9.  This meeting is by invitation only.   Substitutions or Additions will not be permited without the permission of John Lavorato.  Further information will follow.

Seems like HPL/AEP needs to get a transportation agreement on Oasis.  As part of the June transition ENA will not be doing any bidweek business at points other than Waha, Katy Tailgate and Carthage.  Therefore even if we wanted to cover this deal (which we don't), we can't.  Let me know if there is a problem with them getting there own transportation agreement.

Tom

just a quick reminder that we need to cover the Entex delivery off of Oasis.

currently ENA has a transport agreement on Oasis.  This agreement will not be assigned.

Not use AEP has an agreement on Oasis.  Just to make sure, I would recommend we
sale the gas to AEP/HPL at the point for the month of June just to make sure the delivery
is made.

Let me know what you think.

thanks

bob

Any thoughts?

Tom

The attached memo is being forwarded to you at the instruction of Jeff Hodge.

Tom,

Here is an answer for you vis a vis load growth.

Hope it helps,

Doug
Please find attached spreadsheet that compares hot days from May 2000 and May 2001.  There are two tabs, one tab contains the days May 16-18, 2000 and the other tab contains the days May 14-18, 2001.  Each tab contains both the load data and temp data particular to the days in question.  The days most directly comparable are May 17, 2001 (Thursday) and May 18, 2000 (Thursday), although the two days preceding May 18, 2000 were slightly warmer than the two days preceding May 17, 2001.  The peak on 5/17/2001, 44,923 MW, is 2.78% higher than the peak on 5/18/2000, 43,709 MW.  With similarly warm days before 5/17/2001 as there were before 5/18/2000, the peak would obviously have been even higher.  This would put the year-over-year growth in excess of 3%.  I believe this falls right in line with the growth rate year-over-year from an earlier analysis, somewhere in the range of 3.5% to 4%.  

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

 

This is very hard to read with all of the cutting and pasting.  I made one change to the definition of the 400,000/d of injection capacitiy.  Also I do not see anything that addresses how AEP deals with their June volumes in Bammel (assuming we never close).  We talked about them having to withdraw their volumes rateably starting on September 1 and concluding October 31.  Transportation rates would need to negotiated.

Tom

For review and comment, prior to sending to AEP.

BNG

Has there been a date set for the next Trading Track interviews?

Tom

 All,

We will be scheduling the next recruitment day for the ENA Trading Track in May (exact date to be confirmed).     If you would like to nominate any current Analyst/Associate or external candidates please forward to me their names.

Any questions please let me know.

Karen,

Chance Rabon is an Analyst in the Texas Risk Group who is interested in interviewing for the Trading Track Program.  He joined the company in February 2001 from Coastal where he worked in their natural gas risk group.  He seems to be sharp, aggressive and willing to work hard.  Can he still be considered or will he need to wait for the next round?

Tom

That should be fine.

Tom

Deskheads:

I would like to have a 2 hour team building session for the assistants, receptionists, and clerks on Friday 5/25/01.  The only thing that will be charged to your cost center is the cost of a lunch brought in for the administrative staff.  

I know that the assistants usually are out of here between 12:30 to 1:30 being that this is a Friday before a holiday.   I would like to have the session start at 12:30 so that they can still be out of here by 2:30 that day.  This would require the phones being on solo pilot starting at 12:30.

Please respond with your approval, questions and/or comments as soon as time permits so I can set everything up this week.

Many thanks,
Ina Rangel

If this truly cleans out the closet then it is worth it.  The potential upside of the Entex Audit is more like $2 - $3 million but our ability to recover that much is questionable given the weak contract language for resolving non-performance.  In the past ENA and Entex resolved volume shortfalls under the term contract by extending the term.  Obviously we will not have that remedy.  Do not let AEP separate other issues away from this and try to pick us to death.

Tom  

Confidential - Attorney Client Privlege

Please give me your thoughts on the attached proposal to resolve the "dangling chads" with AEP.  I have attached the proposal and a "value analysis" of the proposal, both of which I propose to send to AEP.  The key benefits of the proposal from Enron's perspective are the following:

1.	Removes us from the vagueness and uncapped exposure of the Ducote deal with Entex for additional costs.  AEP can capture the economics of future gas deliveres to Entex associated with this capital expenditure.

2.	Captures the leverage that AEP will have in the Entex audit.  I think for ENA to pursue Entex would be difficult/time consuming and may lead to a tortious interference suit from AEP.

3.	Gives up the interest payment we think AEP owes us.  This is true value we are giving up, but do we really want to fight with AEP in court over this (to the extent they are not bluffing)?

4.	Removes us from having to process imbalances - saving manpower costs and further removing us from hassles with AEP.  AEP is better able to capture value from these imbalances then we are, since they have the pipe.

5.	Gets us out of the Coastline law suit.  I'm pretty sure Coastline is at least owed the $1.4MM that we would contribute.  AEP has a chance to minimize any further costs, which are capped by the value of the claim at a further $2.2MM.

Please do not circulate this.

Thanks,
Brian

What ages? Are there organized activities for them as well?  If not I think they will get bored after an hour or two.  I have not generally done it because I did not have time to keep up with them for such a long period of time.  Maybe someone can bring them up before lunch for a while.

Hi, Tom.  Assuming my children are not SICK!! ... what's the norm about the "Bring Your Child to Work Day" on the Trading Floor?  It's June 29th, and I just thought that I would inquire about it.  I had heard that it's just not done on the trading floor (??).  

My husband works on the Broadband Trading Floor, and we had thought that maybe we could bring both children (one stay with me and the other stay with him), and then switch at lunch time so that they can see where the both of us work.  It's not a big deal though ... the kids won't be terribly hurt because they would be missing out on swimming day at the daycare if they come to work with us on that day.  :o)

I left a voice mail for Robert and I certainly do not mind handling.  I'm sorry we haven't gotten resolution as of yet. If you would like to call or send an email to Robert, he is Robert W. Jones in the system.  I will let you know what I hear back from Robert as well.

Jeanie,

I know I am probably becoming a pain in the butt about this ESOP clerical error issue but I would like to get this wrapped up before we go to UBS.  I do not believe that I will get any attention after I am no longer an Enron employee.  Should I contact Robert Jones directly?

Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate in an Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to those who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past few years.  These informal, interactive forums will be approximately 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.  

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although attendance is not mandatory, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do "reality checks", create a "rallying point" and ensure Enron's executive management is on the "same page" about where Enron is going---and why.

We realize that individuals based outside the United States will not want to make a special trip to attend the meeting, but may be able to attend one of the sessions while they are in Houston on other business.  We also hope to schedule a similar session in London later this year.

We currently have a session planned for:

Wednesday, June 20, 2001 from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Houston, EB50M

The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work:
?	Each session will have approximately 25 participants.
?	The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
?	This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations.
?	This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions.
?	You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum.
?	Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: the
direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same.  We also ask that you refrain from canceling your attendance once enrolled so that we will not have to cancel the forum.  The Office of the Chairman is very willing to take valuable time from their busy schedules to hold these forums.  Enrollments will be on a first come first served basis and we hope you would be able to honor your commitment to attend.  For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Monday, June 11, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586.

We will confirm your registration with you, in writing and forward a list of enrollees to the Office of the Chairman.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson via e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806.  

Thank you.

I have executed this and returned to Anne.

If Ina says she has coverage then fine by me.  You also may want to get in the habit of checking with Brian as a courtesy.  Have fun.

Tom

Tom, Ina has told me that I can have the days below off for the holidays (as far as coverage) ... I just want to run it by you, as well.  Let me know if you see a problem with these dates.

Thanks,
Laura

I would like to go ahead and request some days off for the upcoming holidays, if it is still possible.

Wed, October 31st
Wed, November 21st
Fri, December 21st
Wed, December 26th

I realized how much vacation I have remaining, and I might as well see if I can get off these days if there's coverage.  I guess just let me know how it all turns out.

Laura

Robert,

Jeanie Slone has been in contact with you on my behalf about a clerical error that occurred when I tried to roll my remaining ESOP shares into the 401 K plan back in the August to September time frame.  She indicated that there may be reason to believe that I will be reimbursed for this error but you were waiting for further information on the matter.  Given that I will be going with the sale of the trading business to UBS in early to mid February, I wanted to get this situation cleaned up by then if at all possible.  What steps do we need to go through to get closure on this matter?  Is there anything I can do to help (ie. explain in person what happened)?

Any explanation that you can give as to how and when this error gets fixed will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Tom

Irma,

I respect the fact that a mistake was made, my problem is that the mistake causes me to have to wait until November 20th to get it fixed.  It seems that you could have called me if you had a question about the form since it was turned in at least six weeks ago.  So what are my options other than waiting until November 20th?

Tom

Mr. Martin,

I wanted to take a moment this morning to provide you an update on your recent ESOP change request.  I have received confirmation from Corporate Benefits that your form has been received.  Unfortunately due to current switch over of our Savings vendor, which was also the vendor for our ESOP program, we are still experimenting the blackout period on any savings plan activity through November 20th.  

Also, I wanted to point out my error with the processing of your form.  Since this was a very old stock program form, I accidentally confused it for an enrollment form to our direct service program, which is the program that allows employees to purchase stock through payroll deduction twice a month.  In a nutshell, I accidentally forwarded your form to the incorrect resource and then had to re-route it to the correct group which is our corporate contact for the 401(K) savings plan.  

I apologize for the delay in providing you with this update and am extremely sorry for my mistake.   Please let me know if there is anything that I can do asides from following up with Corporate benefits after the blackout period to check on the status of your request and then I will provide your asst, Laura with an update. 

Thanks.

Hi, Ben.  When you receive the information regarding Tom Martin's ESOP changes, and whether or not the appropriate people have received the information, would you please send me some kind of notification?  Please also let me know if Tom is the person who needs to call and inquire about it, as you suggested may be the case since it is handled outside of Enron.

Thanks for your help,
Laura Vuittonet

Thanks

Tom

FYI

Hey,

	I looked in SAP & that particular item was paid on Oct 5th for the full amount of $95,130.  It was wired Chase Manhatten Bank N.A., acct # 9102771343.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,
Kyle

Can you get me anything "official" showing that we paid Centana for July?

Sorry, the last two trades were Cal 02; I don't think I said what term they were in the last E-Mail.

Tom

We did the following trades this morning:

You Buy

At 8:45         100 Jan NYMEX @ $3.395

At 8:50          50 Nov NYMEX @ $3.075

At 9:11          5,000/d NYMEX @ $3.335

At 9:17          5,000/d NYMEX @ $3.355

MY backoffice will put them in.

Tom

If you don't know, you should know by now that you never have to apologize to me.

Tom

Where do I begin?  I guess I could start with several excuses or reasons to justify my behavior on Friday, but the truth is there aren't any.  I only am left with total humiliation and embarrassment for my actions, words, and behavior.  Please accept my sincere apology.

Sandra

Thanks for the update.  Allison, I hope you start feeling better soon.  Matthew, thank you for looking after your sister.

Daddy 

Hi Daddy.  It's Allison.  I stayed home today.  My arm still feels about the same today.  It hurts when I get up and feels better when I lay still.  I am taking my medicine.  I will go back to school tomorrow.  I love you.    Allison
 
 
Hi Dad.  It's Matthew.  I'm doing good today.  I am taking care of Allison today.  See you later.   Matthew  

Whatever you think, maybe eat at 5:30 to 6:00.  I will grill if you want me to.

Tom

Tom,  What time do you think we should have her come over?  Allison has to be up early on Sunday, so we should probably try to make it early.   Lyne
 
Saturday is great at whatever time you say. I'm not a
real late night owl anymore with my early rising
schedule but it's not a work nite, so that's fine.
Work is going pretty well--VERY busy but I'm feeling
more comfortable.
See ya Sat. What should I bring?

Any questions or further thoughts on what we talked about last week.

Tom

It looks like Joe has an expense report I need to review.  Let's discuss tomorrow.  Also Louise mentioned in the staff meeting that we are going to be more directly accountable and able to control our allocated costs such as IT and logistics costs next year.  Please ask Laynie to give a detail of our budgeted allocated costs such as IT, logistics, etc for next so that we can review it.

Tom

Hi, Tom.  I'm up here working on the 33rd floor for Louise Kitchen again.  They've asked me if I can stay and help out for the entire day, and Ina said that it's fine with her (coverage-wise).  I'm actually working on Mark Knippa's and Gary Bryan's expense reports, and simply helping with phones and occasionally some minor things for Louise.  Let me know if you need me to do anything, or if you'd just rather me stay down there cuz ya miss me!!

You can also call me at extension 34220 ... that's the number where I'm sitting.

Laura

Fine with me.  As I told you last night I am having dinner with our future Enron gas and power traders in the "Trading Track" program at Nino's at 6:00 PM.  Just to be safe, I probably won't be home until after the kids bedtime.

Tom

Tom-  Is it OK with you this Saturday?   Lyne
 
Sorry I've been so absent. My weekends have pretty
much just been catching up on my chores. I'd love to
have dinner with you either Sat.10/20 or 10/27.
I'm house sitting at Barb & Rick's this week
(281/482-8069) and then at Michael's next week
(713/868-9776). I'll be at Ken & Mary Ann's on the
Saturdays.
Also I would like to do Halloween with ya'll, if
you're gonna do your usual trick or treating. Maybe
I'll catch up with Tom downtown and take the HOV home
with him that day.
See ya soon!
Love,
Mary

Thank you I will call her.

 << File: Vac Time thru 093001.xls >> 
Tom, I've attached a report that I downloaded from SAP, and that shows (in hours) how many hours of vacation you've taken, and how many hours you have remaining.  It's only thru the end of September, so the vacation that you took the other weekend is not included.

Just thought you might like to look at it.
Laura

Laura,

Can you put me down for vacation November 5th.  If schedules conflict with others on the desk I need to be out the afternoon for sure (Allison's school function).

Tom

Don,

We have not heard of this guy.  It looks like his most recent experience has been managing Coastal's refinery gas supply activities.  Unfortunately the people who have the most history with industrial and refinery gas buyers went with the HPL sale.

Tom

Please take a quick look at this guy and see if you know him or about him.  Ask around the desk as well.  I am a little nervous about anyone looking for a job change this close to year-end, but I need someone for my Texas markets.  Thanks for your help.

Don,

I forwarding the resume of David Horacefield.  I was wondering if you were interested in talking to this candidate as a potential replacement for Roger Reynolds.  He has good Texas Natural Gas knowledge.

Let me know.

Regards,
Todd Peikert

 << File: David S. Horacefield-pw.doc >> 

The 29th is OK for me other than it is NX1 for Natural Gas.  Starting at 3:00 makes it possible but 4:00 would be better or even the 30th at 3:00 would be better.  I am assuming that a lot of thought has gone in to picking this day and other conflicts exist.  The other gas traders are going to have the same issue with this time so if it is the only time that works for everybody then I'll be there at 3:00.

Tom

All,

Please mark you calendars, you  have been selected to participate in the  ENA Trading Track recruiting event Monday, October 29th , 3 pm - 7 pm.     If you are unable to interview on this date please advise.

A selection of you will telephone screen 18 external candidates, and decide whether or not they should proceed to the final round on the above date.    A separate e:mail will be sent in relation to this.

Any questions let me know.

Maybe the next step is to dig into the allocation methodology that Daniel uses to see if it assumes the correct number of people.  Then convert the monthly allocation amount to a cost per person and do the same for your other analysis so we can compare apples to apples.  When you combine origination and trading we are likely to exceed 15 people.  My guess is that we are being allocated costs based on too many people (Pre HPL Sale).

Tom

 << File: Lunch Estimate.xls >> 
Tom, I probably should have explained what my problems are, and why it took me so long to get this to you.  Daniel is the person in charge of the lunches, and he has not had an opportunity to prepare the monthly spreadsheets for August and September, which show the total amounts per day, and how much each cost center is charged.  He's come up with a percentage, according to how many total people he orders for, then according to how many people are in each group, and he charges each cost center accordingly.  I've attached the 2 worksheets that he's provided me, which are for June and July, however there were fewer people in our group because since then he has added Brian Redmond and his group to our budget.  Daniel is working on preparing the spreadsheets for August and September.  I've told Ina that I'm needing them for a project for you, so I'm sure that they will be ready soon.  

I thought that I could just look at what's been charged to our cost center each month, but it was too difficult to figure out which invoices were from which lunch because they don't always hit the cost center the month during or after they were invoiced.  They are also sometimes charged on a credit card and then billed in a huge lump sum.  

I've simply made a spreadsheet showing selected restaurants and the average price of what we've been charged for June and July, and then I've shown what it will cost for 15 people to eat if we order it separately.  I've included tips and delivery charges, since we're billed for those as well.  

Let's talk about it tomorrow.
Laura

At this point I do not plan to attend.  I have not had an opportunity to take Lavo's pulse to see if this is a must attend.

Tom

As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Regards,
Ken Lay

If he is coming into the office why don't you set up a schedule like you did for Morris including myself and Jim.

Tom

Thanks for the information Bill - hopefully Devon will let you go with a nice package.

Tom, I know you will be on vacation, but can you give Bill a call and arrange a time to meet with him either before you leave or after you get back.

Thanks,
Brian

Brian:
I met with Devon last week and it looks like the deal will close November
15th or Dec 1st. If we are able to agree on a position at Enron, the
earliest I could be available would be December 1st, if the deal closed on
schedule, the latest would be January 4th taking in consideration of the
Christmas Holidays. Brian at your convenience I would like to visit your
office and see your operations and meet Tom.  I will be available Thursday
and Friday of this week or the week of October 15th.

Thank you,

Bill

I know nothing.

I'm going to go start breaking some knee caps

Jeanie,

I know I am probably becoming a pain in the butt about this ESOP clerical error issue but I would like to get this wrapped up before we go to UBS.  I do not believe that I will get any attention after I am no longer an Enron employee.  Should I contact Robert Jones directly?

Tom

Lucky you.

Tom

I will be attending a Fire Warden Class this Thursday, October 4th, from 2:00 - 4:00 in 2 Allen Center.

Sincerely,
Laura

Fine with me as long as you have someone to cover.  How is your lunch analysis going?

Tom

Tom, would it be all right with you if I left early tomorrow?  My husband is leaving early (3:30) for his dentist appointment tomorrow afternoon in Pearland, and it would just make things easier for me to go home with him because my sister-in-law is having her baby tomorrow as well (she's being induced).  I figure I can swing by and pick up the kids while my husband is at the dentist, then pick up my husband, then be on our way to the hospital to see our new niece/cousin.  

Yeah, I know it's complicated and probably more detailed than you needed to know.  I just wasn't sure how to tell you why I'd like to leave early tomorrow!  

Laura

The only change I see needing to be made is you said letter "dated August 27, 2002" instead of "August 27, 2001" , but we knew what you meant.  Everything else looked great.

Tom

I don't think we are interested in Hockey but Texans may be of interest.  Send an E-mail to Redmond for us to discuss.  Maybe we can share with another desk.

Tom

Tom, read below and let me know what you think!  

Also, would you like for me to look into getting season tickets for the Houston Texans?  I know that Jessica, Barry Tycholiz's assistant, purchased some earlier this year.

Laura

Mark Frevert has purchased 4 tickets for the Houston Aeros 2001-02 season, for use by all business units, the same way as the Astros tickets.  This is the Aeros first year in the American Hockey League.  Their first game is on October 12th, go to http://www.aeros.com/schedule/ to see the full schedule.

Our seats are located in Section 108, Row R, Seats 1-4.

If your group in interested in using these tickets, please give me a call (x33497).  

In addition, I have 3 invitations (each admit 2 people) to the "Meet the Team Party" on Tuesday, 2nd October.  If you would like to attend, please let me know.  The party will be held at the Compaq Center from 6pm to 8pm.

Can you send me Jim's evaluation form so I can write his midyear review?  John was out today so I did not get to ask about feedback on Jim.

Tom

Hello from Inside FERC,

Tomorrow (Friday) is the last business day of September, and it's the final
deadline for Inside FERC's Gas Market Report's October 2001 bidweek
spot-price survey.

Attached is an Excel workbook (IFMONTH2.XLS) to report your price data in.

Please take a moment to review the instructions at the top of the file. They
specify what kinds of deals to report and -- more importantly -- what deals
NOT to report.

Please note that a significant portion of our survey respondents are
reporting counterparties with their deals.  We want you to too. Please list
counterparties in the "comments" column. Counterparty information is held in
confidence and not shared with third parties.

Reported deals with counterparty information are treated as more reliable
than trades without.

Please make sure to add the name of a contact person for your company and a
telephone number to reach them with at the top of your price file.

When you are done, e-mail the price workbooks back to both
kelley_doolan@platts.com and MHENERGY@YAHOO.COM by 1:00 PM (Central), on
Friday, Sept. 28.

October monthly prices will be published on Monday, Oct. 1.

As always, thanks for your help, and if you have any questions, please feel
free to call or e-mail me at the number/address below.

Best regards, and I hope you and yours are safe,

Kelley Doolan, chief editor
202-383-2145 kelley_doolan@platts.com

IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE TAKEN OFF THIS REMINDER LIST please either call me
or send an e-mail, and I will take you off right away -- KD

 - ifmonth2.xls 

That is fine.

Tom

I guess the first available weekend you would have is the weekend after I get back.  Let me know and I will respond to this.
Lyne
 
Howdy,
It's time to schedule another 1-2 days at Mom/Dad's to
try and 'straighten up' the library and kitchen table.
The holidays are fast approaching, so I don't want to
wait too long 'cause our schedules will REALLY get
crazy then.
Please send me 2 dates that you are available to
assist with these tasks asap. Thanks.
It seems that Jocelyn is working out at Mom/Dad's. She
cleans the bathrooms, washes and cooks. Keep your
fingers crossed that this continues.
Have a grand weekend!
Love,
Mary

Lyne,

Mom called me today to ask if we would be available to join them Sunday morning December 16th as Dad is receiving an award at Church from the "Dominican Family".  She pointed out that day is the day that you and the girls are joining Mom for the Christmas function at Jones Hall.  Let's talk tonight.

Tom

I talked to Brian and he and I agreed to the concept but we want it to more simple (ie. less expensive).  We are thinking about just getting together and have some beers at Cabo's while signing Christmas cards.  No catering, just a few drinks and maybe some appetizers off the menu.  The traders probably don't have many if any customers that are not already covered by Brian's group but check with Eric, Joe, Charlie, Daren and Dave.

Tom

Tom,

Michael Salinas is planning the Christmas Card Signing Party.  It looks like it's going to be at Cabo's THIS MONDAY, December 3rd at 5:00.  

I assume that we will be splitting the cost, but I guess I really shouldn't assume because of everything the company is going through right now.  Michael estimates the total cost to be $1000, making your half $500.  Let me know what you think.

Also, are there any customers (for the trading side) that we need to be sure are included to receive Christmas cards?  

Thanks,
Laura

Thanks for the info.  Call me today when you get some time I need you to look something up on the computer.

Tom

 
 
Sounds like a doable plan.  Yes, I can take Mom to the symphony.  Yes, I will leave the tickets (4) for your group including Krista.  The symphony time is 2:30, I check the tickets last night.
 
Thanks,
Margaret 
Margaret,
 
Tom is planning to go on Sunday morning the 16th.  He said he will plan to leave in time for us to leave out here for the symphony.  He told your Mom if it runs a long time, he might have to leave before they serve lunch.  He said he may have to pick your parents up that morning to give them a ride.  I  can pick up Krista when we leave for the symphony.  Would it be easiest if we just meet you and your Mom at the symphony?  You could leave our tickets with Krista so we would have them when we pick her up.  Is the time 2:30 or 3:00?

Ok, I will try to take a look at it this afternoon or tonight.

I talked to Lisa this morning.  She said it does not matter to them if we use the travel agent or just do it ourselves.  She does not mind calling the travel agent if we want to do that.  She is real busy right now trying to get W-2's and 1099's out before the end of the month on top of other things.  She has been working late alot.  I guess we could check to see what we can find and then let them know.
 
Lyne

I left you a voicemail as well.  I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the ESOP rollover into Savings Plan ocurred as we discussed last week.  I got into the Savings Plan on Friday 11/23 and moved the Enron shares to Stable Assets also as we discussed.  It appears that the price used was Monday's close of $4.01 instead of Friday's close of $4.71.

So where do we go from here?  I am assuming per our previous meeting that whether $4.01 or $4.71 is used; that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in September (probably September 30th) when the ESOP shares should have been put into the Savings Plan.

Please call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this.

Thanks,

Tom  

I am sorry I forgot to update you.  Right now I am planning to be out the 12th, 13th, 14th and 17th.  The 17th is for sure the rest is tenative.  My plan is to take 3 to 5 days sometime the first two weeks of December.

Tom
Are you planning on being out that week on vacation (December 3-7)?  Last I heard, it was only tentative.

I talked to Brian and he and I agreed to the concept but we want it to more simple (ie. less expensive).  We are thinking about just getting together and have some beers at Cabo's while signing Christmas cards.  No catering, just a few drinks and maybe some appetizers off the menu.  The traders probably don't have many if any customers that are not already covered by Brian's group but check with Eric, Joe, Charlie, Daren and Dave.

Tom

Tom,

Michael Salinas is planning the Christmas Card Signing Party.  It looks like it's going to be at Cabo's THIS MONDAY, December 3rd at 5:00.  

I assume that we will be splitting the cost, but I guess I really shouldn't assume because of everything the company is going through right now.  Michael estimates the total cost to be $1000, making your half $500.  Let me know what you think.

Also, are there any customers (for the trading side) that we need to be sure are included to receive Christmas cards?  

Thanks,
Laura

I was not aware that the market closed at 1:00 on Friday 11/23.  Funny we did not discuss this when we talked on the phone on Wednesday.  How does this impact the bigger issue that needs to be resolved?  Let me know when you get the answer on the rest of the matter.  Thank you for getting back to me so quickly.

Tom

Tom,

Got your voicemail and e-mail.  Below is the explanation I received from Corp Benefits on the price for your recent activity through Hewitt.  Will get back with you on final resolution to this problem before the end of the week. Hopefully will have an answer for you by  Thursday, no later than Friday. 

Thanks again for your patience.

Response:
Irma,

I've just verified the following information from Hewitt:

On Tuesday, 11/20/01, Mr. Martin spoke with a rep at Hewitt to roll over his ESOP balance into the Savings Plan.  He made this request at 4:28 p.m.  Since this was after the market close (which was 3:00 p.m.), his transaction did not occur until the 11/21/01 update.  He rolled 1,522.00 shares over to the Savings Plan, at a total value of $7,625.22, which is $5.01 per share.  That value was posted to the Enron Corp. stock fund in the Savings Plan the evening of 11/21/01.  They were in his Savings Plan account as of the morning of 11/22/01 (which was Thanksgiving Day).  
On 11/23/01, Mr. Martin transferred his holdings in the Enron Corp. Stock Fund to the Stable Asset fund.  He did this transfer at 2:22 p.m., via the web site.  However, on 11/23/01, the stock exchange closed at 1:00 p.m., instead of the usual 3:00 p.m.  Consequently, the transfer was not effective on Friday, 11/23/01, but occurred on the next business day, which was 11/26/01.  At the time of the transfer, the value in the Stock Fund was $6,113.26, which was equal to $4.01 per share.

Thanks again for your patience and cooperation.

Kelley,

Given our financial situation we did not do any fixed price physical transa=

ur situation we be resolved soon so that we can be a part of the process in=
 the near future.  For whatever it is worth, it that there are some unusual=
 things happening in the "Fixed Float" markets in Texas particularily at HS=
C.  The NYMEX is down 10 cents today yet the HSC fixed float market went fr=
om plus 2 cents or $2.336 to $2.345 yesterday to now $2.36 with the Henry H=
ub also appearing to be inflated by maintaining a fixed float value of $2.3=
1 again in a falling market.  We feel like we are defenseless because we ha=
ve no trades to report and yet have basis and Gas Daily positions and some =
trade players know it so they are inflating the prices to hurt us more fina=

 in determining the validity of the transactions that are being submitted f=

Thank you,

Please take a moment to review the instructions at the top of the file. The=
y

NOT to report.

Please note that a significant portion of our survey respondents are
reporting counterparties with their deals.  We want you to too. Please list
counterparties in the "comments" column. Counterparty information is held i=
n
confidence and not shared with third parties.

Reported deals with counterparty information are treated as more reliable

Brent,

Per our phone conversation Enron agrees to buy back 21,417/d at Carthage for December at IFGMR HSC index - .08.  I have also talked to EPrime who is our supplier and they are buying back this 21,417/d from Enron at IFGMR HSC - .08.  They will subsequently sell the gas to Woodward directly at IFGMR HSC - .08.  Both EPrime and Woodward agree that HSC - .08 is a fair market value for Carthage volumes during bidweek for December.  The purpose of this transaction is to mitigate the risk of physical non-performance by Enron given our current financial condition without impacting the contractual pricing of the deals previously done with Eprime and Woodward respectively.

Regards,

Tom Martin

Laura,

Did you get the time for my interview of the meteorologist tomorrow?  Also I plan to attend the Gas Fundamentals presentation tomorrow afternoon from 2-4 if you can send me a reminder.

 Good article on the state of corporate America that caused an 'Enron-like" situation

I am not familiar with this system but it seems philosophically we should protest even though we don't currently do any business on this pipeline.
What do you guys think?

Tom

Tom, does your group have any dealings with Acacia Natural Gas?  It's a Texas intrastate owned by Mitchell.  They have made a filing for approval of Section 311 rates for interruptible service and they have set up their Operating Conditions so their affiliate will get higher priority over other parties who are paying the same rate (priority within the same rate will be based on whoever has the earliest transportation agreement).

Would appreciate hearing from you in the next day or so.  Comments are due on the filing by Nov. 7th, and if we want to protest, we'll have to get our facts together.

Thanks.

Becky.

That is a sensitive question as I have asked you before about us giving up Reuters and getting one Bloomberg monitor.  We have heard nothing since that lady came by took Reuters away and said she would get us Bloomberg. 

Tom, does anyone in our group have a Bloomberg account?  I am going to send in a request for a list of all of the applications that each person in our group has, including Market Data applications.  I think that this is information that I should have.  Until then ... should I forward a copy of this email to everyone in the group?

Laura

All,

To ensure a smooth transfer to Enron Center South we must notify Bloomberg of all Bloomberg accounts moving over this weekend. Market Data needs to know who is currently using Bloomberg in your group. 

Please reply with the names of the people in your group currently using Bloomberg. Please reply if there is no one in your group is using Bloomberg.

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

Tom, 
 
Do you like these colors better?
 
Lyne

thank you.  Looks like another year where everybody is going to try to get vacation in at the last minute.

Tom, here's a short version of the vacation hours that everyone has REMAINING.  Just FYI, I went ahead and included everyone on the desk.  I've also included a spreadsheet that I downloaded from SAP, which shows more detail.  It is shown in hours, as well.  Let me know if you need anything else!  

Laura

Eric Bass  -  88 hrs vacation remaining
Dave Baumbach  -  80 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
Gary Bryan  -  160 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
JD Buss  -  120 hrs vac remaining
Daren Farmer  -  68 hrs vac remaining
Bryan Hull  -  128 hrs vac remaining
Mark Knippa  -  152 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
Tom Martin  -  104 hrs vac remaining
Mike Olsen  -  96 hrs vac remaining
Joe Parks  -  96 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet
Jim Schwieger  -  0 hrs vac remaining
Jay Smith  -  30 hrs vac remaining
Laura Vuittonet  -  71 hrs vac remaining
Charlie Weldon  -  60 hrs vac remaining, Discretionary Holiday not taken yet

One more thing ... the report does not include vacation taken between the dates of November 1st thru November 15th.  The November 15th pay period is when I enter that information, so SAP does not have it yet.  I corrected the email for those who have taken vacation during this pay period (so far), which were Charlie, Joe, Eric, Mark, and you.  

Also, Dave's vacation is not appearing in SAP, so the report shows NONE of his vacation time.  He and I talked about this, and he has 8 days remaining.  I am going to correct his vacation time in SAP.

Laura

 << File: Vacation Report - 111201.xls >> 

Could you send me an updated list of the traders remaining vacation days for 2001.  I am hearing a lot of members of the desk wanting to get their vacation by the end of the year.  I want to know what I am dealing with.  Try to include Daren and Dave as well.

Thanks,

Tom

I am having Daren, Bryan, Dave and Charlie coordinate their vacation days for the rest of the year.  I am having Eric and Joe do the same.  Clearly the calendar does not reflect what these guys will probably want to do by the end of the year.

Lyne,

I have 108 hours of vacation left and wanted your input as to how to use some of it.  I will carry over 40 hours to next year.  We are off Christmas Eve.  I was thinking of taking 11/19 off since I have that doctor appointment.  Otherwise maybe 3 to 5 days the first two weeks of December will work.  I may be able to take a half day or two at other times if there is something special you want me to do.

Correction 104 hours of vacation.

Upon closer examination, more people looking dirty.

Tom

Sure sounds to me that Ken is in the same shoes as the rest of us regarding the downfall of ENE.  
What do you think????????????????????????
Wouldn't you think the honorable thing would be to refuse any compensation knowing your terrible performance? 
I'm sorry! I forgot honorable is not an Enron admirable trait!

The wording of "If he terminates his employment within 60 days of a change of control" sure sounds to me like someone knew what was going on to me?
I guess we should have kept in mind the 2nd definition of LAY in the dictionary is "To put to rest" 

 DJ Enron CEO -2: Also To Get Reimbursed For Tax Penalties --

  WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp. (ENE) Chief Executive Kenneth Lay could
receive a lump sum payment as much as $80 million as a result of Dynegy Inc.'s
(DYN) plan to acquire Enron, according to a regulatory filing released Tuesday
by the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  Under Lay's employment agreement, which originally extended through Dec. 31,
2003, Lay was entitled to a lump sum payment equal to the number of full
calendar years remaining under his contract multiplied by $20.2 million if he
terminated his employment within 60 days of a change of control. 
  In August, Lay, chairman of Enron, resumed his position as CEO following the
resignation of Jeffrey K. Skilling, Enron's then-president and CEO. At that
time, his contract was extended to Dec. 31, 2005. 
  In addition to the lump sum payment, Lay is entitled to an amount for any
related tax penalties if the payment were held to constitute an "excess
parachute payment," according to the filing. 
  Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap valued around $10.12 billion. 
  The deal is expected to close sometime next year, in which case Lay is
entitled to $60.6 million under his contract if he terminates his employment
within the 60 days.

John,

A dangerous environment is brewing on the trading floor.  We have very large positions and people are becoming more frustrated with the work environment, uncertain about future employment and now with new information about Lay's "golden parachute", I am concerned that not everyone may act in the best interest of the Company (hero or zero attitude) or at a minimum may not be in the best frame of mind to trade.  I hate to suggest it but do you need to reduce the people allowed to take risk for the Company? (similar to what was done when we sold HPL).  The general feeling is that everyone at the top is taking care of themselves and the "little" people that have been making the money for the Company are left out in the cold.  I also suggest that you move quickly to ensure appropriate compensation for key traders into next year.

I know the first move I suggested would have the effect of reducing morale further but this group has a lot of risk on for people that may not be 100% commited to Enron.  This may be too drastic action at this point but I think it should watched closely.

I went over to talk to Laura a little wihile ago and she was crying.  What is wrong?  Is there something I can help with?

Tom

Thanks.  I asked her and I couldn't get anything out of her without her getting more emotional, so I decided to back off.

Tom

I just returned from lunch and was trying to figure the same thing out....I am about to talk with her and I will get back to you.

I am sorry that you are having problems with Shanna.  I am proud that you are doing the right thing and welcoming a new person at school.  It can be very dificult to be the new kid at a new school.  It sounds like Shanna feels threaten by you and others being friendly to this new girl.  I know it is hard but some how you need to reassure Shanna that you being nice to the new girl does not mean she (Shanna) is less of your friend.  Maybe the best approach is to ask Shanna how she would feel if she had to move to a new school and was treated badly by some of the new girls she met.  You and Shanna have been friends for a long time and you don't want to lose that, but she needs to know that you will continue to welcome new kids that come school and it does not impact your friendship with her.

To answer your question, things are OK.  There is still a lot of uncertainty with the Dynegy and Enron merger and it is not going to be fixed any time soon.  All I can do is try to do the best job I can and let everything else work itself out.

I am going to an NWAL meeting tonight at 7:30 so I will see you probably about bed time.

Thanks for writing to me.

Love,

Dad

Enron plans asset sell-off to slash debt 

'We made some very bad investments,' Lay admits 

By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 

Enron Corp. officials admitted they made serious investment errors in recent years and will step up the pace of selling off those investments, including its broadband services group and some international operations.

Those business units, which are worth as much as $8 billion, could be sold off or spun out over the next year, the company said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. That would bring in more cash to pay down debt and trim away money-losing operations. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay surprised many with a blunt assessment of the company's poor judgment in recent years that led to the rapid implosion of the energy trading giant's reputation and value in the past month. 

"In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses," Lay said. "The negative impact of these investments has been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet. We fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence." 

To help make the cuts, the company is breaking its businesses into three groups: those that are the most profitable and part of its core business, such as energy and gas trading; those that are unprofitable and nonessential, such as overseas power plants; and those that have good profit potential in the near future that are under review, such as its steel, pulp and paper-trading operations. 

The noncore operations will be sold or closed down in an orderly fashion in the next year, said President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley. Those operations under review will be studied to see if they can contribute to the company's bottom line any time soon 

"These are businesses that have strong prospects and that we feel have good potential, but we'll need to look at each carefully," he said. 

The company's central businesses of energy and gas trading are not expected to be cut back significantly, Whalley said, and should remain intact until the merger. Despite reports that many employees are leaving those business groups, company officials have said repeatedly that is not the case and that top employees are being retained. A stipulation of the Dynegy-Enron merger agreement prevents Dynegy from recruiting or hiring Enron staff for a certain period, in case the purchase is not completed. 

The $8 billion in business units that could be sold in the coming year do not include Portland General Electric, the Oregon power company that was already under contract to sell for $2.9 billion next year. Nor do they include about $800 million in asset sales that are expected to close by year's end, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said. That includes about $250 million for a Brazilian gas distribution business, $266 million for a power plant in Puerto Rico and $332 million for certain offshore energy properties in India. 

The company did not file a final version of its third-quarter financial statement Wednesday as previously expected but rather said it would be five days late with the document. Enron did, however, share some more details about some of its financing partnerships, including the Marlin and Osprey investment vehicles. 

Marlin is a vehicle created to acquire Azurix, an Enron unit that owns British water utility Wessex. It has over $900 million of debt that's due in July 2003. McMahon said that if the value of Wessex is 25 percent below its current book value of $2.6 billion when Marlin's debt falls due, this would result in a charge of $650 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Osprey was created to acquire energy assets and other assets, and has $2.4 billion of debt that falls due in January 2003. McMahon said that if the Osprey assets were valued at less than 25 percent of their current book value when the debt falls due it would result in a charge of $600 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Analysts asked repeatedly if executives were confident that no other surprise liabilities were hiding in the books, referring to the $1 billion in equity write-downs the company reported last quarter due to several off-balance-sheet financing deals, and a restatement of 4 1/2 years of financial statements to include an additional $600 million in losses. 

McMahon said the company has gone through the books carefully, but he noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a special committee of the Enron board of directors were still conducting their own investigations. 

"Everything we know, you now know," Lay told the analysts. 

Lay said the fourth-quarter results are expected to be hampered by severance and restructuring costs, however, but couldn't provide more details. He said the company is also seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity investments.

Enron plans asset sell-off to slash debt 

'We made some very bad investments,' Lay admits 

By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 

Enron Corp. officials admitted they made serious investment errors in recent years and will step up the pace of selling off those investments, including its broadband services group and some international operations.

Those business units, which are worth as much as $8 billion, could be sold off or spun out over the next year, the company said in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday. That would bring in more cash to pay down debt and trim away money-losing operations. 

Enron Chief Executive Officer Ken Lay surprised many with a blunt assessment of the company's poor judgment in recent years that led to the rapid implosion of the energy trading giant's reputation and value in the past month. 

"In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in noncore businesses," Lay said. "The negative impact of these investments has been exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off the balance sheet. We fully understand and regret that the combination of these events has resulted in the complete loss of investor confidence." 

To help make the cuts, the company is breaking its businesses into three groups: those that are the most profitable and part of its core business, such as energy and gas trading; those that are unprofitable and nonessential, such as overseas power plants; and those that have good profit potential in the near future that are under review, such as its steel, pulp and paper-trading operations. 

The noncore operations will be sold or closed down in an orderly fashion in the next year, said President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley. Those operations under review will be studied to see if they can contribute to the company's bottom line any time soon 

"These are businesses that have strong prospects and that we feel have good potential, but we'll need to look at each carefully," he said. 

The company's central businesses of energy and gas trading are not expected to be cut back significantly, Whalley said, and should remain intact until the merger. Despite reports that many employees are leaving those business groups, company officials have said repeatedly that is not the case and that top employees are being retained. A stipulation of the Dynegy-Enron merger agreement prevents Dynegy from recruiting or hiring Enron staff for a certain period, in case the purchase is not completed. 

The $8 billion in business units that could be sold in the coming year do not include Portland General Electric, the Oregon power company that was already under contract to sell for $2.9 billion next year. Nor do they include about $800 million in asset sales that are expected to close by year's end, Chief Financial Officer Jeff McMahon said. That includes about $250 million for a Brazilian gas distribution business, $266 million for a power plant in Puerto Rico and $332 million for certain offshore energy properties in India. 

The company did not file a final version of its third-quarter financial statement Wednesday as previously expected but rather said it would be five days late with the document. Enron did, however, share some more details about some of its financing partnerships, including the Marlin and Osprey investment vehicles. 

Marlin is a vehicle created to acquire Azurix, an Enron unit that owns British water utility Wessex. It has over $900 million of debt that's due in July 2003. McMahon said that if the value of Wessex is 25 percent below its current book value of $2.6 billion when Marlin's debt falls due, this would result in a charge of $650 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Osprey was created to acquire energy assets and other assets, and has $2.4 billion of debt that falls due in January 2003. McMahon said that if the Osprey assets were valued at less than 25 percent of their current book value when the debt falls due it would result in a charge of $600 million against earnings and stockholders' equity for Enron. 

Analysts asked repeatedly if executives were confident that no other surprise liabilities were hiding in the books, referring to the $1 billion in equity write-downs the company reported last quarter due to several off-balance-sheet financing deals, and a restatement of 4 1/2 years of financial statements to include an additional $600 million in losses. 

McMahon said the company has gone through the books carefully, but he noted that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a special committee of the Enron board of directors were still conducting their own investigations. 

"Everything we know, you now know," Lay told the analysts. 

Lay said the fourth-quarter results are expected to be hampered by severance and restructuring costs, however, but couldn't provide more details. He said the company is also seeking an additional $500 million to $1 billion in private equity investments.

Dave,

I generally am pretty flexible regarding vacation as long as there is coverage.  I am not sure that after we become UBS if vacation carryover will happen; my guess is that you will receive vacation based only on your years of service with Enron.  Do you know the answer to that queston?  If not I will find out for you.  Given the size of our group now, it will be hard for you and Mike to take four weeks of vacation after we start up again.  I would encourage you guys to take some now before things get busy.  Let's talk.

Tom

A couple of items on vacation ...

1)  both me and Mike Olsen are rolling 1 week of vacation into the new year

2)  Please put on your calendars that I will be taking the afternoon off on Feb 19. 

Thanks.

Dave

Cindy,

Since the majority of the division wants Klein High School, I'll live with it.  Becky Miller had a good idea, how about if we see if we can also get their gym so we can have the teams set up in there.  It is not as conveniently located to the pool as Klein Oak's gym is but at least it keeps the teams out of the sun for the day.  What do you think?

Tom

P.S. you either respond to this address (work) or the other address you have for me.

I have received it.

Tom

Pls confirm that you have received your new WCom calling card.   Thank you.

It seems like we would have approximately the same cost for air at Klein Oak or Klein..  I guess the question is how much have the pool fees gone up from last year and does that make it too expensive to have air.  Who knows the prices?

Tom

Tom,

I like the air too.  Polling our board, they are spit on which pool but as
Jeff pointed out the kids can start from the starting blocks instead of the
bulkhead (which does affect their times).  That was an issue for several
teams when we were setting up a Klein Oak last year.  We should all talk
about whether to request the gym and the additional cost of doing so.  The
pool fees have increased since last year.  You can shoot an email to Jeff
and the other teams about the idea if you like.

Cindy

I talked to Ina and Eric said he will come in.  The time is apparently between 2:00 and 3:00.

Tom

Tom, Ina has sent an email (below), letting us know that some people can come in on Sunday to test their computers/applications.  Do you think it's a good idea for anyone to come in on Sunday, or should we leave it alone and have everyone come in early Monday morning? 

Laura

Assistants:

It was approved for some essential people to come in on Sunday to test applications and systems only. There will not be time for unpacking.  That will need to be done on Monday morning.
Please check to make sure if these people will be coming in on Sunday and if there needs to be any corrections, please let me know as soon as possible.  

yes

John:

I have spoken with the assistants and the following people are the ones who probably need to come in or would want to come in on Sunday:

EAST:				WEST:
Jon McKay			Mike Grigsby
Scott Neal			Keith Holst
Pete Keavey			Frank Ermis	
				Tori Kuykendall
CENTRAL:				
Geoff Storey			TEXAS:
Andy Lewis			Tom Martin
Hunter Shively			Eric Bass
Martin Cuilla			Joe Parks
				Jim Schwieger
FINANCIAL:			Daren Farmer (maybe)
John Arnold
Mike Maggi
Dutch Quigley
John Griffith
Larry May

If this is okay with you, I will forward it on to Tammy Shepperd.
GAS TRADING TEAM

Can you guys please prepare a coordinated list of no more than 35 people that can come in on Sunday between 2- 6:00 pm to test trading applications.  Due to the combination of the moves (over 900 people) the IT group wants to ensure that your applications are functioning properly before Monday morning.  

The list should be weighted heavier towards those folks who can identify system problems rather than unpacking boxes.  There will still be alot of the move team on the floor finishing installations etc.  

Please provide the list by end of business today (thursday).  

Thank you!
Tammy

These times have been agreed with the department heads and we will be flexible where necessary upto 6:00pm

Irma,

Did you get a chance to discuss my ESOP rollover situation with your superiors.  I received an e-mail stating that the new Savings Plan is available early and I would like to get this issue resolved as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Tom Martin
Ext. 3-3079

Mr. Martin,

I wanted to take a moment this morning to provide you an update on your recent ESOP change request.  I have received confirmation from Corporate Benefits that your form has been received.  Unfortunately due to current switch over of our Savings vendor, which was also the vendor for our ESOP program, we are still experimenting the blackout period on any savings plan activity through November 20th.  

Also, I wanted to point out my error with the processing of your form.  Since this was a very old stock program form, I accidentally confused it for an enrollment form to our direct service program, which is the program that allows employees to purchase stock through payroll deduction twice a month.  In a nutshell, I accidentally forwarded your form to the incorrect resource and then had to re-route it to the correct group which is our corporate contact for the 401(K) savings plan.  

I apologize for the delay in providing you with this update and am extremely sorry for my mistake.   Please let me know if there is anything that I can do asides from following up with Corporate benefits after the blackout period to check on the status of your request and then I will provide your asst, Laura with an update. 

Thanks.

Hi, Ben.  When you receive the information regarding Tom Martin's ESOP changes, and whether or not the appropriate people have received the information, would you please send me some kind of notification?  Please also let me know if Tom is the person who needs to call and inquire about it, as you suggested may be the case since it is handled outside of Enron.

Thanks for your help,
Laura Vuittonet

I think last year anyway the bulkhead issue only affected relays as we started all individual events from the blocks and move the timers for 25 and 50 yard swims.  No matter, I am over the "Kein Oak" deal and moving on to "Klein" just suggesting we look into the possibility of using their gym for the teams.  I will talk to Becky about the rates and pass it on when we get.  Have a great weekend!

Tom

Becky said they are going up in Jan.  She could probably find out the cost.
The other big issue is the bulk head starts for 10 and unders at Klein Oak.
I know that concerns some of my team's board members and Kleinwood's.  They
would rather be able to start all the races from the starting blocks at one
end of the pool.  We can do that at Klein but not at Klein Oak.

Cindy

I would like our group to continue to get lunches at their desk if possible.  If other trading desks are not doing this then just the EOL trades.  Talk to Ina and let me know.

Tom

Tom, want me to start ordering lunches just for our group?  I could even take specific orders for what each person likes, and have them bill us or put it on someone's credit card.  I can do that for just the EOL guys, too.  I found out that the deliveries are going to ECN, and the clerks are picking them up from there.  Well, at lunchtime, I could take a dollie with me to carry it all, and/or have Michael Salinas help me.  I don't know ... whatever you'd like.  That's just a suggestion that I have, if you would still like to pull away from the daily lunches for the whole floor.  I've noticed a lot of our guys don't like the lunches, and they sometimes go get food from the Energizer.  We still get billed for their food, even if they don't eat.  

Let me know if you'd still like to do this, because it's definitely possible.

Laura

P.S. - I just thought of another suggestion ... I could make Peanut Butter & Jelly sandwiches for us!!!!  YEAH!

Deskheads:

After this week I was going to discontinue lunches other than bidweek for everyone except EOL traders.  There are too many people going downstairs to get their lunch and your cost center is being charged daily whether people eat or not.  I have had a couple of you approach me that you still would like for your groups to be included in daily lunches.  Please email me by tommorrow and let me know if you would like to continue.   For those that do not, I will notify your groups that this Wednesday will be the last day for their groups to eat.

Thank you,
Ina Rangel
Administrative Coordinator

Stephanie,

Jim Schwieger and Daren Farmer have left the Company.  I also changes some of the Stack Manager and Web Access settings for some of the other guys.  Call me if you have any questions.

 

Thanks.  I got Jim's and Eric's right after lunch.  Jim was definitely not impressed but he said we would talk tomorrow.  Eric seemed disappointed but I think if we can bump his retention from $50,000 to $75,000 per six months, I think I can get him over the hump.  He is great value if we can get him for that.

Tom 

We will have employment contracts done soon and employment letters to those not getting employment contracts by tommorrow or Saturday.

John,

You or Greg need to address the various groups with whatever generic information you can as to where we are in the process, expected timeline, hurdles before start up again, starting VAR and general organizational structure.  People are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information.  I know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individual's situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure.

Tom

Rob,

Lavo has given me the idea that Brian Redmond may not be part of NETCO and it is possible that the Texas Gas Origination business may go away completely.  I would like to talk to you before you make a final decision.  I do not see it as a big money generator but similar to the East and Central it is a source of information for the trading business.  It is even more imperative to have a couple of people talking to producers and customers in Texas because pipeline flow data is not accessible as it is in the interstate market.  My opinion is if you had one person covering the producers and one covering the customers that would give us adequate coverage for information and make a little orig in the process.  Give me a call to discuss at 713-853-3079.

Regards,

Tom

Thanks for your help.

Tom

Tom, tks for the update. I'll get him some Unify training this week

Bob

Bob,

I talked to Chris about the change of plans.  I am sorry that it did not work out but Dave has more knowledge of the Texas grid and he runs our Waha physical trading activities.  He works well with Mike and he is willing to do whatever we need him to do.  He is spending the rest of the week to suck as much out of Daren as he can.  If there is any training for the logistics systems that he can go to, he should do that as well.  If you have any other recomendations to get him up to speed on the Logistics side I sure would appreciate it.

I am still alive and kicking for now.  We will know more in the next few days.

Tom

hope things are going well!   take care hero!

Ragan

I am losing my Logistics Manager/Transportation person, Daren Farmer to AEP.  I have talked to Chris Germany about this opportunity and he would like to do this job.  Does this create any problems for you?  Given the current uncertainty about NETCO headcount and considering any transition issues you may have with Chris leaving, I thought we should leave things the way they are for now but develop a transfer date to be in a week or two.  If you are OK with this move, I would like Chris to spend part of his time next week downloading from Daren as I have him through next Friday.

On another matter, I believe Daren has E-mailed you about an agency agreement that we have with Cleburne Plant that needs to be transitioned to the estate.  He knows the details as does Rick Hill (I believe he is in your group).  We should probably get someone else in your group plugged into this deal (Kathy Kelly?), to handle to the administration of this deal.  We should try to identify someone quickly so that he/she can download from Daren next week.

Tom

I just read an article on the Blomberg news service that says that there are now six bidders and it is expected to go on into the night.  Each bidder is in a separate conference rooms and the lawyers are going from room to room to get the latest bid and provide updates as to what the best bid amount and structure is.  Sounds wild.

Tom

I talked to Chris about the Texas opportunity and he seemed interested.  He still wanted to talk to Scott Neal about a potential cash trading role on the East desk.  In the same breath he said that he welcomed an opportunity that had some commercial aspects but did not require running a book (which the East desk job would probably require).  I believe he is hesitant to leave the East environment because he is so familiar with it.  He said he will let me know on Monday morning.

Tom

Just a heads up, I lost Daren Farmer as my Logistics Manager/Transportation person on Thursday.  I have asked Chris if he would be interested.  He said he would give me an answer on Monday.

Tom

Daren notified me today that he has accepted a job with AEP.  He is willing to stay for a week or so to help in our transition.  I wanted to know what your thoughts were about moving Chris Germany from the Estate to the Manager of Logistics/Transportation role for the Texas Desk.  If you agree I would like to have him spend time with Daren while he is still here.  Let me know your thoughts.

Tom

Try to go to this if you can.

Thanks.  They are the same products.

Tom

Almost no notice is needed as long as the Products you intend to use are ones which previously appeared on EnronOnline.

Please note that Jan. 21 is a holiday, so we are planning on the launch of NetcoOnline happening on Tuesday, Jan. 22.

Thanks for the info.

Dave

Sorry, I thought you already had that info.  Phase 1 is the day we turn on EOL (January 21st), Phase 2 is February.  This timing should be consistent with the other gas regions.  Basically financial products first and physical products second.  If there is any changes between products in phase 1 and phase 2, how much lead time do you need?

Tom

Tom,

Thanks for the info.

What dates are you associating with Phase 1 and Phase 2?

Dave

As a follow up to the Texas Business plan submitted on January 7th, please find more detail on our desired product rollout schedule during phase 1 and 2.  If you have any questions call me at ext. 33079.

 << Message: Request 11906 has been approved for 02/05/2002 >> Received an email today (also called and confirmed) that the move will take place TOMORROW during the day

Tom ... I've ordered boxes, and they should be here sometime this afternoon.  It would probably be a good idea to have everything packed before you leave today.  I talked with Delores Sustaita w/the Move Team, and she said that they typically start around 9:00 ... but that might not necessarily be the time that you are moved tomorrow.  She said that they cannot guarantee when which group will be moved, and suggested that the groups not come in since you more than likely won't be able to log in to our computers for most of the day.  What do you think?

Sorry, I thought you already had that info.  Phase 1 is the day we turn on EOL (January 21st), Phase 2 is February.  This timing should be consistent with the other gas regions.  Basically financial products first and physical products second.  If there is any changes between products in phase 1 and phase 2, how much lead time do you need?

Tom

Tom,

Thanks for the info.

What dates are you associating with Phase 1 and Phase 2?

Dave

As a follow up to the Texas Business plan submitted on January 7th, please find more detail on our desired product rollout schedule during phase 1 and 2.  If you have any questions call me at ext. 33079.

I looked over Daren's shoulder while he highlighted what needed to be deleted.  Disregard my phone call.

Tom

Hey Gang,

Attached are the physical curve mappings as provided by Russ Severson... Please take a peek and let us know if we need to change, add/delete, update any points/mappings going forward in a Netco environment... For instance, I would like to change Texoma to Carthage on the curve mappings... Also, I would like to delete all derived curves, leaving only Carthage, KatyTailgate, and Agua Dulce.
The other physical locations would be ShipChannel, Waha and Katy (non-tailgate)... Let me know your thoughts... O'Neal 3-9686

Sounds like a pretty good deal.  I am always in favor of "free".

Dear Mark,
 
Thank you so much for your e-mail.  I am forwarding it to our website coordinators, Wendy & Eric Lijewski.  They may be in contact with you if they have any questions.  I am going to ask them to look into the eteamz.  It sounds like just what we need. Thanks for the suggestions and helpful hints!

Lyne,
My name is Mark Bain and I'm the Web Site Adminstrator for the Mariners.  I
would be glad to help out in any way. Please pass this email and my phone
numbers (281-379-6896 hm. 281-518-3251 wk.) to your website person.  I put
alot of info in this email to help get started but if it is a little
overwhelming, just call.
A previous board member, Steve Burleigh, created our web site last year and
gave me alot of ideas. For this year, I found a web site called eTeamZ that
hosts web sites for sports groups.  Check out our new page:
http://www.eteamz.com/swimmariners/
eTeamsZ is really easy to use and does not require much web site knowledge.
They do the formatting and you supply the info.  If your web guru wants to
get creative, they can do some custome stuff as well.  The best part,
however, is that it is FREE.  Of course with free you have to put up with a
little advertising but since this site is tailor made for sports (meet
schedules, practice schedules calendars, news, maps, etc.) , I think it is
worth it.
If you don't decide to use eTeamZ, that's fine too.  I've created some other
web sites and should be able to answer some questions.  Sounds like you have
some experience so it should be no problem.  Good luck and let me know what
else you need.
eTeamZ TIPS:
Oh, here are some tips on getting started with eTeamZ.  (difficulties that I
had anyway):
Registration- http://www.eteamz.com/company/sites/register/
The toughest part was coming up with a nickname and a user name for the
websites.  Seems that most of the users are into baseball and Mariners was
taken.  I think I used Mariners Swim Team for nickname and goMariners for
the username because I kept hitting other name that were being used.
WebSite- When I got to the "build you web" page, I chose Team Web Site.
They also had options for Leagues and Orgs.
My best advice is to start populating things via the admin page and bring up
another windows to check the progress of what is actually displayed.
PLUS - They have a premium service called PLUS that you pay for but I didn't
see much use for it except you get rid of some of the advertising banners.
They also show that you can use this site for registration and other things
but we are keeping it pretty simple.

I have it in my briefcase, I just forgot to get it out.  Another slow day s=
o far.

I checked on the internet today about FannieMae and GinnieMae per Lisa's co=
mments the other day.  I learned that GinnieMae is a government owned compa=
ny that buys and sells mortgages for HUD and FHA loans.  They are basically=
 the financing vehicle for these low income housing loans.  FannieMae basic=
ally does the same thing but is a non-government owned company (used to be =
government owned in 1967).  Both entities have had a history of financing t=
he rebuilding of rundown urban areas in cities accross the country.  So Lis=
a's friend/relative used these entities in the correct way but who knows if=
 there is any truth to their future involvement in our area.  Based on some=
 of the stories I read they tend to focus on really bad areas.  My guess is=
 that on an individual house perspective these two entities provide a mecha=
nism to resale low income housing mortages in the secondary market.  So to =
the extent there are HUD or FHA loans in our neighborhood they are probably=
 involved in the ultimate financing of these loans but that is it.  I had n=

Jeff,

I could be in a tough situation at the desk with personnel.  Right now Daren Farmer is evaluating an opportunity with AEP.  If he stays and if we get pressure for another round of cuts; I may be in a situation that I have to do something with Dave.  If Daren leaves then Dave is really the only one remaining with Waha experience, that is why I decided to move him to the desk.  Bottom line to me is that based on discussions with you in the past and my experience, Dave is definitely a keeper for Risk and has gained some physical experience in the last six months that will help me out particularly if Daren leaves.  Needless to say there are a lot of variables to manage here but I thought you should be aware it, particularly if I end up in a situation where I have to make more cuts.

I am sure you are in a similar situation with some of your folks so you can probably relate to what I am going through.  I will catch up with you as this unfolds but if possible don't completely put Dave out of your plans at this point.  I have explained this situation to him and I think he understands given he is new to trading.

Any thoughts?

Tom

I did not know if you heard that Enron has agreed to settle the dispute over NNG and will fullfill the earlier agreement to deliver the pipeline to Dynegy.  Enron has the right to  buy it back by June 30th.  Enron will still proceed with the 10 billion wrongfull termination of merger suit and include NNG in that suit.  Bottom line for now NNG employees will become Dynegy employees until this other suit is resolved and/or unless Enron excercises its right to buy it back.  I wonder if this will impact Eric and Wendy?

Tom

P.S. Are you out of bed yet, ya bum?

						 

Attached is a listing of the top 200 customers on EOL ( as provided by Dave Forster's EOL Team). We have gone in and started to cross reference the customer overlay to determine who the PHASE 1 ( top 10 or 15 ) target customer identified as the most important for each business unit/region.

Can you please add your input for your region first thing on Friday A.M.   

Thanks and if there are any questions, please give either Frank Vickers or myself a call.

BT 

I'll be there.

New and improved budget to replace what I sent you yesterday.

 

EnronOnline/NetCoOnline status update:

- "NetCoOnline" will be distinct from EnronOnline, with much the same functionality and a refreshed look.

- We will carry data to support the same gas and power products as were on EnronOnline. Please contact us if you will need different products from what was on EnronOnline.

- We have prepared a list of top customers in CDN and US Gas and Power (copy attached), which we will be using as a guide in chasing signed Password Applications.

- To speed the registration process, top customers will be preloaded into the system for activation as soon as we receive their Password Application. 

- We are intending to use a simple, online GTC, which can be superceded by a negotiated Master Agreement, as with EnronOnline.

- Internal trader names have been circulated to each desk head for approval.

Dave

 

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Tom, 

How was holiday? It was nice spending time with the family for the holidays. The kids had a great time. When you get a minute, could you get Donnie's phone number at prebon, and Missy's number at APB, I would appreciate it.

Thanks

Joe

I have given this to O'Neal.

Tom

Can I get a list of the traders that will make up the new reporting list for the new company as we stand today?  We need to get new books set up, and also we need to get the V@R engine ready to go as well.

Thanks

Don,

I received this from Lockheed Martin.  We did not have anything with them.  I am guessing this is yours.  If not I will call the guy and find out what he is talking about.

Tom

Gentlemen,

Please nominate 65,000 MMbtu of gas into the TXU Lone Star Gas pipeline for
the account of Lockheed Martin Aeronautics in Fort Worth for the month of
January, 2002.

Enron has a master agreement with Lockheed Martin (Agreement CA 1135).  On
November 8, 2001, Enron executed a 12-month confirmation to deliver gas to
the Lone Star Pipeline for Lockheed Martin Aeronautics in Fort Worth.

The agreed upon date for the January 2002 nomination was five days prior to
the beginning of the month.  That date has passed, but Lone Star has
indicated that it will accept a nomination if received by Friday, January 4,
2002.

Please make the nomination.

Also, if you will, please call to let me know that it was made.

I appreciate your help in what must be a most frustrating time for you.

Thanks,

Ed Fore
Facilities Engineer

David,

I made a few adjustments to your expense estimates based on a more detail look at actuals in 2001 and my previous 2002 budget.  The total impact is to increase the budget by $68,000.  I also was not sure what your Rent, Technology and Transportation amounts were supposed to represent.  Based on our previous discussions I thought that rent and technology are covered elsewhere, but I used your numbers anyway.  I am interested in what that is supposed to be since it is not very much and those are potentially very large dollar categories if everything gets rolled in.

Call me if you have any questions.

I thought more about our phone conversation last night.  Based on what you said and assuming this document is ok, count me in.  Sorry my reaction was not as positive as you hoped but your comment about not being able to discuss who is on the team with anyone caught me off guard.  I don't believe I have any issues with financial terms that you said (again I want to see what it looks in writing).  I still don't fully understand your reasons for handling this the way that you are but at the end of the day you are correct when you say that even if 50% of the commercial people is all that we end up, this shop will still be better than any other on the street.  I guess get me this document to look at when ever you can.  

Thanks,

Tom

Thomas,

TBG Cogen Partners is disputing the rate invoiced by ENA for November 2001 gas. ENA invoiced a rate of $3.4367 for deal # 22957. The customer claims the rate should be as follows: first 4,000/d @ $2.25, remainder over 4,000 @ monthly index of delivery location + $.025. Please review and advise.

John and Louise,

I am planning to be on vacation from Thursday noon 12/20 and returning Monday 12/31.  I will be in Houston the whole time and available to come in if needed to help out on Due Dilegence or other matters.  I can be reached at home 281-580-6280, cell. 713-417-7994 or pager 800-503-3208.

I have made arrangements for the curves to be updated daily.  If you have any questions don't hesitate to call.

Happy Holidays!

Tom

I understand the control concern but it sure would allow us to be more efficient since Texas is small and clean (probably not a full time manager job).  He has not and will not be taking risk positions (at least not initially) he has been and will be trading our daily Waha phyical volumes.  If he evolved to a point where we wanted him to take risk positions we then could move him out of Risk.  What do you think?

If you don't think this will work let me know, but in that scenario I guess I would say don't count on Dave.  I guess I will have to move him into the Associate program or Logistics.  I we go down that road then I feel like I need to run this by Dave since he effectively will be cutting his ties to Risk and taking some career risk.  I am sure if it does not work out you or some other company would welcome Dave in a risk role.  Let me know what you think or just call me and we can get together.

Tom

Let me know when you would like to discuss this.  In talking to the parties involved in this possible transaction,  they are very controls wary.  I can not see anyway they will go for having someone in a controls role, trading.  Also,  I will have lost about 30% of my staff by the time all is said and done, and will need every person on a full time basis.  I do not mind losing Dave since I have not had him in months,  so if we want to put him in logistics or some other function that reports up through commercial,  I would not have any problem with that.  Let me know when you would like to talk.

Thanks

Jeff,

Let's talk because I think it may make more sense to flip the other way.  I was hoping to continue using Dave in the morning in the cash trading activities.  So maybe he can run the Texas Risk group while trading phyical similar to what Daren is doing on the Logistics side.

Tom

Tom -

I am currently planning on having Dave run the west risk desk,  and leaving O over Texas.  So I just want to make sure that we are still on the same page with Dave coming back down here.  If not,  I need to make some changes to the organization.

Ed,

Sorry, I have been out for a few days.  We have been marking the curves appropriately every day.  Eric Bass and Dave Baumbach have continued to get broker quotes twice daily for the duration of the book and to mark the curves correctly.  If you have any specific problems in Texas let me know.

Tom

Until further notice, please set (and/or have your traders set) all of the curves to market representative numbers each day.  I hope that you have been doing so all along, but I heard today that this may not be happening on all desks.  Thanks for your help.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Regards,
Ed

I am in ENA Gas Trading.  I believe I am getting e-mails for Martin Thomas.  If that is who you are trying to communicate with please check your name selection.  This is happening a lot.  If know others that may be trying to communicate with Martin Thomas please pass the word.

Thanks for the update.

The pipeline meeting with the UBS lawyers was moved to Friday at 3:00.  Power jumped ahead of us.

Pagers, Cell Phones, etc should be cancelled as of closing which I believe to be June 1st, I will let you know if there are any changes.  When I arrange for new traders I will need computers for them.  I have talked to Ed and Brian and they have agreed to give me 4 computers back prior to closing.  I anticipate needing 2 of them prior to the end of the month.  How much lead time do you need to have them brought down here?  Did you get the message out about customer entertainment?

Thanks,

Tom

Everything other than the LDC business has been done in the name of HPL even if not physically located on HPL.  I want to start intiating transactions that are not physically on HPL in the name of ENA so they would not have to transfer as part of the sale (ie. Waha, Katy Tailgate and Carthaqe Hub).  I understand Dave Baumbach has arranged a meeting with you and Jeff Hodge to discuss.

Thanks,

Tom

I have asked Dave to set up a meeting with you and Barbara on this subject.  I thought there were exclusions relative to EOL transactions and points that do not directly impact HPL.  The problem for me is that if I want to do terms deals in these locations now I want to be able to keep them as ENA and not transfer them with the HPL sale.  Let's talk as soon as possible so I can have clear understanding of the rules of engagement for ENA now and after the close.

Thanks,

Tom

Yes if they are for Las Vegas.  There was a team building trip approved by John at the beginning of the year.

Are you planning to put together the monthly EOL volume actuals versus performance targets as described in the 2001 Plan?

Thanks,

I am generally available in the afternoons after 3:00.  Have your assistant schedule some time either this week or next so we can talk about the Wellhead Book.

Thanks,

Hello Tom, I hope bid week is over, and you can breathe now?I met PACE Global Energy yesterday to talk about the EDF RFP, and I think it looks much better now:

1.- Term: They are planning on having 3 interconnections into 3 different pipelines (Tetco, PG&E and Coral Mexico Pipeline), so they think the banks can get comfortable with less than 25 years of supply, because the 3 interconnections lowers their risk of not getting fuel supply in the future. They are asking now to a proposal of minimum 5 years, and upto 12 if we can make it. So they will be taking the risk of not having a fuel supply that matches de 25 year Power Purchase Agreement.

2.- The Points of Sale will be in the U.S. Mexico Border, so we will not have to get an export permit of any sort.

3.- Swing: This is going to be a base load plant, that will be dispatched around 90% on a yearly average.  However CFE has the right to take zero power at their full discretion, so Edf does not wsant to take the risk of not being dispatched and not being able to swing down to zero during the 25 years of the gas supply.  However, the plant will most certainly displace other less efficient plants in the first 10 years, so that such risk is much lower. In our proposal we can include either zero swing or which ever we feel we are the most competitive. They will evaluate whether such risk could be taken by them. 

4.- Modifying Swing every 2 years.  They believe that in the long run (25 years), the dispatching rules or conditions of the plant could change. So they want to have the option to review the swing every 2 years. Can we price this optionality ? Is there a re-purchase of such optionality in the market ? 

5.- Resale formula. They need us to include a daily re-sale fomula for the gas not taken.

6.- Other Provisions: We need to review the other provisions in the RFP and tell them which ones can we comply with and which ones we don't. 

I am faxing you the entire RFP, together with the latest letter we received from them. Please give me a call whenevr you have a chance.   

Best regards. 

Thanks for the info.  I wanted to pick your brain about cars for Mom and Dad.  My initial research of Large Cars and Luxury Cars in Consumer Report did not yield a lot of obvious choices to me.

  I only considered CR "Recomended " cars.  There are a few options in the $20,000 to $25,000 range for example the Ford Crown Victoria/Mecury Grand Marquis; but I do not believe the cars in this price range will give them the same luxury and comfort that they are used to.  The only car in the $30,000 to $35,000 range is the Buick Park Avenue which I think will be a pretty close fit to what they are driving now but I'm not sure they want to spend this kind of money.  Of course the really nice luxury cars that will sure to satisfy them for example, the Lincoln Town Car and Cadillac Deville are in the $40,000 to $45,000 range.

Dad said he spent $23,000 for his Olds 98 in 1991 and would like to have something that rides as quite and comfortable as it but not spend big bucks.  My plan at this time is to focus on the Crown Victoria/Grand Marquis and the Park Avenue first and see if they come close to meeting Mom and Dad's needs.

Any Thoughts?

Love,

Tom

If you recall there was a physical term supply transaction done at Thompsonville with EEX during the time you were trying to get the letter of intent with AEP done.  I thought that there were some unique financing issues that required Enron to retain the transaction.  It appears that is not the case and since this supply is at a split connect location with HPL it should probably go with the sale.  I just want to make sure that the swap is done correctly to keep Enron whole.  Any thoughts?

Tom

The EEX deal is a pre-pay deal.  It is not a VPP deal.  It is a financial deal only, between an Enron company called Bob West Treasury and EEX.  It is a financial deal only - no physical vols.

In a completely separate financial hedge, EEX had hedged some gas vols with Fred Lagrasta [ENA].  Last December, EEX called wanting to EFP some of these vols.  This is completely between Fred/ENA and EEX.  It has nothing to do with our pre-pay.

David/Tom, I would say the decision if this deal stays with you or goes to AEP is up to Fred.  I just spoke with Fred and he said that they did just one EFP with EEX - some south Texas [Thompsonville] vols.  He is uncertain as to the term, but off the top of his head, he thought it was for 2 or 3 years.  He said it didn't matter to him if we kept this EFP or if it went to AEP, as long as we were paid - it is way in the money.  This EFP should be in Tom's book and if it is decided to go to AEP, then this needs to be reflected in the final purchase price to AEP, since it is in the money.  BOTTOM LINE:  it doesn't matter to Fred, as long as we are paid for this.

If you have any questions re this EFP, please discuss with Fred.
Joan 

Just to confirm ... the gas we are recieving at various fixed prices on deal N60753.3 is going to AEP.  This should constitute the EFP's, I believe.  Does either of you have any of the original minibooks for the VPP?

Dave

Are we going to restructure the EEX deal?  If not, I need to go ahead and add these volumes to the schedule going to AEP.

Dave

Fine.

Tom

Attached are the rates for April.  I know the King Ranch and Agua Dulce rates to HSC are a mute point with the work on the A/S Line.  Needless to say we will be a seller either during Bidweek and/or on a daily basis on A/S South.

Thanks,

I think Gary Bryan already sent you a list that had this info.  Let me know if you did not get it.

Tom,  Here are power's top trading counterparties.  Let me know if gas has others.  I want to make sure our marketing group gets all the master agreements in place that we need in Texas for gas and power as fast as possible.  - Mike

The storage has no forward value, it was included to take advantage of opportunities as they occur.  I want to be clear AGAIN about how the transportation transaction should be accrual upside and not booked as MTM as our view is that the spreads will compress over time and any spread value that exists from the curves today will likely go away or be significantly reduced over time .  I thought Lavorado was very clear that he did not want to book MTM value against these deals.  Am I missing something?

The deal is physically served at Oasis Waha or Oasis Katy and is priced at either HSC, Waha or Katytailgate GD at buyers option three days prior to NYMEX  close.

Gary,

I don't think that we will be using a weather hedge this season.  The hedges that we have used before have worked well because we have had very warm winters and have correlated very well with Entex takes.  I am not as confident in the correlation in a closer to normal temperature environment which is the forecast for this winter.

Brian,

As we discussed the other day, there are several key commercial, logistics, risk management and gas control personnel that we must have to run our business this winter.  I have heard that some of our people are being pursued by outside companies in light of the potential HPL sale.  The key people that we want to ensure stay around through the transition are:

Ed Gottlob
Elsa Villareal
James McKay
Gary Hanks
Darren Farmer
Stacey Neuweiler
Pat Clines
Dave Baumbach
O' Neal Winfree

Let me know what you think.

The following is the updated transportation and supply ideas per our meeting with Dave.

Thanks,
Tom

 

Jim and I will be on vacation from March 12th thru March 16th.  Jim took a lap top computer with him and is reachable by cell phone.  Kim has our pager and cell phone numbers.  I will be calling in to see how Eric is doing and to see if any of my folks have any questions about their employment contracts.  I asked Philip to keep an eye on Eric as well.  Eric sat in the morning meeting today and will fill for me next week.

Thanks,

Tom

You guys have the list right?  Can you send it to Mike?

Tom

Tom,  Here are power's top trading counterparties.  Let me know if gas has others.  I want to make sure our marketing group gets all the master agreements in place that we need in Texas for gas and power as fast as possible.  - Mike

David,  

Doug asked me to get you a list of our top counterparties in ERCOT.  Below is our list:

Calpine
Dynegy
Mirant
Aquila
Constellation
El Paso
TXU
Reliant
ANP Marketing
FP&L
BP Amoco
LCRA
Morgan Stanley

Call me if you have questions.

Thanks

I received notice today that Elsa Villareal , Gary Lamphier and Ed Gottlob have accepted jobs with AEP as part of the sale of HPL (not to leave until closing).    This means that my staffing needs after closing are as follows:

1 Lead Physical Trader
1 Physical Trader
1 Basis Trader (or at least an asst. trader)

1 Industrial/Utility Middle Marketer/Originator
1 Supply Middle Marketer/Originator

I met with Jeanie Slone and the internal recruiters today to start the external search process for an experienced physical trader and industrial marketer.
I am hoping the other positions can be filled internally with associates and/or internal commercial personnel.

I delivered employment contracts to Janet Wallis, Jim Schwieger, Stacy Neuweiller, Eric Bass and Daren Farmer.  They all wanted to review the documents and talk to me next week about it.  Janet did not give a good feeling that she would be willing to sign it.  I know that she has been contacted by companies other  than AEP about job opportunities and I know other Enron Units have talked to her as well.

Although we met Jim's numbers he is still hung up on the super vesting language for options; I'll keep working on him.

The others I did not get any read on, but I will talk to them next week.

Given the severe shortage of talent that my desk is going to experience from the HPL transaction I want you to consider realocating experienced talent from other trading and middle marketing desks to the Texas desk.

I will follow up with you when I return from vacation on Monday, March 19th.

Thanks,

Tom

Yes, this deal should go to AEP with the HPL transaction.  The reason there are no forward volumes booked is because they have a monthly election to nominate baseload gas daily priced gas or wait and nominate daily volumes priced at gas daily.  At any rate there is no way to know in forward months what they are going to take subject to contractual maximums.  If you have any further questions let me know.

Thanks,

Tom

Thanks for the invite but I have a family commitment on that day.

My basis trader is out Friday, so I need to cover his EOL stack until 3:30.  I can get together with you after 3:30.  Monday I am booked.
Any way that we can get together after 3:30 Friday?

Tom

Great. How is everyone's availability for this @ Friday 2 pm? Or this coming Monday (the 23rd) in the afternoon?

Michelle

Michelle,

I suggest you schedule a meeting with the above to discuss how Enron, AEP and HPL will interact with respect to responding to the bid docs.

Brian

Brian, Janet, Chris:

I spoke to Danny McWhirter of CPS this morning. He said he expects to have the RFP sent out first week of May. CPS has scheduled a May 10th meeting in Houston (probably at the Hyatt) for all invited bidders for Q&A meeting re: bids. He mentioned El Paso, Aquila and Duke. Danny is pushing for bids to be due on June 1.

I am trying to get him to play golf with me when he comes, so we'll see! If any of you are interested, let me know.

Michelle

Tuesday begins Bidweek.  I try to restrict time away from the desk to after 2:15.  Is that possible?

Tom

Jim is not available on Friday.  How about Tuesday morning, April 24, anytime. How about 9 am?

Sherrie,

I talked to Karen Buckley and she said that the HR analyst and associate program is currently full but may be looking to hire again in the summer.  She told me that there may HR needs and/or recruiting needs in specific divisions that she is not aware of.  Her recommendation is to look on the Enron Job Seeker website to see if there are any specific jobs that may be of interest to you.

Call me if you after you look at the website and let me know if there are any opportunities that make sense for you.

Tom

Hi Tom,

Thanks for talking to me last night about Enron and their different
associate opportunities. Below is the description I found about the HR
Associate/Analyst Program on Enron's web site
(http://www4.enron.com/corp/jobs/recruiting/program.html):

HR ASSOCIATE/ANALYST PROGRAM

Enron's Human Resources Associate & Analyst Program is designed to identify
and groom the best people to become future leaders in their chosen field.
Through their rotations, Associates and Analysts have the opportunity learn
our business, become acclimated to our corporate culture and contribute to
our growth.

Graduates
For the Associate program, Enron seeks individuals with an advanced degree;
at least 2 years' work experience (not necessarily HR); and an
entrepreneurial spirit. Associates are expected to assume active roles of
responsibility in development of the HR function, working independently or
on teams. Rotations are for 6 months each, with promotion to HR Manager
being purely merit based. Business Unit rotations will afford you an
opportunity to gain insight into the business and staffing needs of Enron.
HR rotations are designed to develop your generalist, consulting, and
leadership skills.

The contact person listed is Karen Buckley (713.345.4667).  My resume is
also attached. My HR experience was prior to graduate school. I worked at
Vinson & Elkins as their Interim Litigation Coordinator from 1994-1996 and
The University of Michigan, where I was a Department Manager from 1992-1994.

Thanks so much for helping me Tom; I really appreciate it. Also, if you
have any advice about my resume or need any additional information, you can
reach me at home (713.868.9464), my cell (832.444.2229) or this email. I'm
online most of the day.

Thanks again and I'll wait to hear back from you.

Sorry we have not talked again recently.  I have been trying to get a better handle on other personnel movement on the gas floor that has an impact on my needs.  I would like to talk further with you.  Maybe we can get together next week after work for a beer and talk about what your interests are and I can tell you more about my needs.  I am open Tuesday - Thursday.  Let me know if you can get away.  If not let's try to set up some time to talk in the afternoon.

Thanks,

Tom

Tom,

Just wanted to follow up with you Tom to make sure that you got my resume regarding the Gas Trading position on your desk.  If you would like to get together to discuss the opportunity please let me know.

Thanks,

Larry Jester 

Lauri,

Here are the rates for May.  Again the A/D long haul rates are irrelevant for most of the month.  Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Tom

 

Since I anticipate that we will be trying to inject and Katy is the only location that helps, I am trying to give us a little extra incentive to get gas in the ground.  I don't anticipate buying much Clear Lake gas other than the short that we have there (6,500/d I think).

Tom

Looks okay.  No chance of going $.01 wider on non-tailgate?  Also, I don't think we'll be able to take Clear Lake gas until Phase I is completed (sometime around 5/7 I'm hearing).

Lauri,

This is to inform you that we are rolling out changes to the Gas Daily option 
pricing model.  Currently the system is not properly pricing index puts and 
calls at locations with gas daily index premiums or discounts (puts and calls 
are priced at the same level no matter what the index).  The change will 
result in raising call values/lowering put values at locations with index 
premiums and the opposite at locations with index discounts.

In addition, index plus/minus option deals (for example index -1.00 puts) - 
which are currently incorrectly priced flat to the index option (the index 
-1.00 put is priced flat to the index put)- will be accurately priced to 
reflect the difference in strikes.

If  anyone has any questions please call me at  3-6731.

Thank You,

Larry May

I have  a dental appointment in the Post Oak area at 400pm.  I can meet until

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

OPEC LOG: SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 10TH

THE AGREEMENT

OPEC will complete deliberations on Monday but for all practical purposes
the deal is done. They have agreed to raise allocations by 800 MB/D on a
prorata basis beginning October 1st. The increase is until the next meeting
which will be November 12th in Vienna. This rather early data was chosen
because of the already scheduled Producer/Consumer Dialogue in Saudi Arabia
November 17-19 and the beginning of Ramadan religious observance beginning
November 27th and lasting for approximately one month. The price band and
OPEC output response mechanism (20 consecutive business days above $28/BBL
basket price, increase output 500 MB/D, 10 consecutive days below $22/BBL
basket, decrease 500 MB/D) will remain in effect with obviously a clean
slate to start the price tracking process.

Saudi Arabia pretty much got its way at the meeting, asking for a 1 MMB/D
increase and compromising on 800 MB/D. Of course the increase is prorata
which implies an increase in the Saudi allocation of 260 MB/D, bringing its
total allocation to about 8.5 MMB/D. Saudi crude output is estimated to have
been almost 8.8 MMB/D in August(including 140 MB/D Abu Safa output produced
on behalf of Bahrain). PIRA expects Saudi Arabia's crude output increase to
be on top of its current over-production bringing total output to nearly 9.1
MMB/D. Since with the exception of Saudi Arabia and the UAE, all the OPEC
members are essentially at capacity, the 800 MB/D OPEC allocation increase
should translate into a production increase of only around 400 MB/D. Saudi
Arabia and the UAE have allocations equal to 41.2% of the OPEC total(now
26.2 MMB/D excluding Iraq).  With August/September OPEC crude output at
around 29 MMB/D, fourth quarter crude output will be around 29.5 MMB/D
assuming Iraq at 3.0 MMB/D.

MARKET BACKGROUND

Commercial oil inventories remain quite low with the three major OECD
markets--U.S., Europe and Japan-- ending August with the lowest level in
over 10 years. PIRA would not be surprised to see inventories revised up
somewhat for Europe for the end of the second quarter, but this will not
materially change the likely end August position.

In addition to low inventories, the world is operating with very little
spare producing capacity. With OPEC crude output at 29.5 MMB/D in the fourth
quarter, there will only be some 0.5 to 1.0 MMB/D of instant spare producing
capacity remaining. This number will certainly increase in time, but for at
least the first half of the fourth quarter there is not much room for any
interruption in expected supply for any reason (hurricanes, Iraq saber
rattling, earthquakes, etc).

Also, the lead seasonal product distillate(gasoil/diesel) is in great shape
and with substantial refining margins there is plenty of headroom for crude.
Add to the mix very low PADD II crude stocks, positive technicals and
seasonals, at most only ten million barrels of current net speculative
length in the NYMEX crude contract and continued strong economic growth and
you have rather impressive positives for price.

SHORT TERM MARKET BALANCES & PRICES

With fourth quarter OPEC crude output at 29.5 MMB/D, world onshore oil
inventories should draw only 100-200 MB/D in the quarter. Thus assuming
normal early winter weather, stocks will remain very low but not, on
average, decline significantly. For the three major OECD markets, commercial
inventories should end the year 1-2% above the year earlier.

In these circumstances and given the very positive market factors noted
above, it is hard to see oil prices taking a big hit downward as a result of
the OPEC agreement. PIRA would expect the very initial market reaction to be
negative given that the agreed increase is somewhat more than anticipated.
The market will then probably consolidate given that there is a good deal of
confusion about the impact of the agreement. Given the current very strong
fundamentals an upward price bias is likely to quickly return. However, one
major wildcard negative for price first needs to be sorted out.

THE POTENTIAL U.S. SPR SWAP

If the United States is going to use the SPR to swap current barrels from
the strategic reserve to be replaced in the future, the market will find out
this week. With the U.S. Presidential election on November 7th, October
pipeline scheduling completion on September 25th and probably ten days to
carry out an auction, this is the last window of opportunity to have a
meaningful impact before the onset of winter and the election. With SPR
barrels being short haul, as opposed to 45 days away for any incremental
OPEC oil, its impact on oil prices would be far greater than OPEC's current
agreement. Moreover, if the decision is made to use the reserve in this
fashion, the Secretary of Energy is likely to decide to make sure it has the
desired impact of bringing prices down substantially by offering to swap
very substantial volumes. PIRA rates the odds of a swap at 55%.

To PIRA's Retainer Service Clients,
Attached are two strategic reports on the telecom industry that address the
burgeoning market for bandwidth and the implications for the energy
industry.
The first report, "BROADBAND OR DEADBAND: An Appraisal of the Fledgling
Bandwidth Commodity Market," focuses on trading in the wholesale broadband
market.  To assist readers in navigating this report (as well as the second
report) a short glossary of terms can be found in its Appendix.
The second report, "THE DASH FOR CASH: Lucrative Opportunities to Provide
High-Speed Internet Access," focuses on the means by which consumers will
access this communications capacity and some strategic opportunities for
energy companies.
We hope you find these reports useful and strategically provocative.  After
investing great effort in becoming conversant in this area, it is clear to

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp?lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp?lia  tells the story of a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric toymaker Dr. Copp?lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp?lia to the people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: "Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue."
Copp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in 	the workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

Good morning Larry!  I just spoke to Tom P. to thank him for the tickets to Rent.  I also want to let you know that I really appreciate you cashing in a favor for me!

Tahnks so much again,

Hi Dr. Leerburger,

Thanks for your feedback.  I know how busy you must be - I have three kids (7,5 and 2) so I realize how precious time off is.  I applyed to DIA, NSA and CIA about three weeks ago.  I got letters back stating my application had been recieved.  The DIA said I have been put into their applicant pool.  My company (Enron) has offered me a position in London managing a trading desk for crude oil and refined products.  They want me to move over in January or Febuary, so hopefully I'll know something before then.  If I'm not offered anything by then, I'll probably go and plan on applying to Georgetown in one to two years.  I really hope I'm offered a position now - London would be interesting - but with everything that is going on now, I'd rather start this new career now.

Thanks again for your feedback and I hope to speak with you when time permits.  If you are teaching the Threat Assesment course at AMU Spring 2002, I'll probably be in your class.

Sincerely,

Larry May

Hi Larry;

First, I find the work to be exceedingly rewarding, and addictive. I have been working in the
community for 17 years, and have found that I am listened to, allowed to speak and take
risks, and allowed to provide realtime assistance to the top policy makers in our country.
My frustrations are that at times, I would like to enact action quickly, and often have to wait
for others to add their pieces to the puzzle, or for a chain of command to look at my ideas (I
am a GS-14 in a GS-15/DISL job). For someone like me, that's hard!

I would think your background WOULD make you a viable candidate, and would recommend that
you apply to CIA, DIA, and NSA, among others. Yuo can apply directly through each of their
websites. ALL are hiring.

Georgetown's program is terrific. I went there. JMIC is okay, but I think Georgetown would
give you what you really need. Georgetown's National Security Studies Program is TOP.

I'd be more than happy to speak with you, but recommend waiting a bit. My time is not really
my own these days,and I am currently working 7 days a week, literally (my last day off was
9 September), often 12-16 hours a day. When I get home, I do my school work, and play with my kids.
That doesn't leave much time! Let's see if things calm down in a week or so?

Thanks Tara

Dan and Larry,

I wanted to let you know that we have found out what the problem was regarding these deals. Tonight we will create new products in order for these deals to bridge correctly tomorrow.   As a result, all straddle products should be captured correctly with two legs tomorrow.  I apologize fro the inconvenience.  Thanks TARA

Tara,

I have booked the deals correctly and reference the EOL ID's.  Additionally, deal confirms has done their thing and notified the c/p.  Please let me know if my trader, Larry May, or I need to do anything else to preempt this from happening in the future.  

Thanks for your quick response to this problem.

Dan

It will have to be someone from comformations.  We never interact with the customer.  Also, This fix will only affect deals on a go forward basis.  All the deals that have been booked incorrectly will need to be fixed by risk.  Myself, and Tagg IT are still working on the issue, and will be in contact with you as soon as it has bee fixed.  Thanks TARA

Thanks.

Can someone let the C/P know that the deals are good?  Do y'all interface with C/P?  If not deal confirmations could but they need the deal details.

Please let me know,

Thanks,

Dan

Dan,

I wanted to let you know that we are working on the problem that we are having with the straddle deals being booked into Tagg. I also wanted to bring to your attention that these deals tested correctly in Tagg Stage, so we are trying to sort out what is happening in Production.  I am working with Tagg IT to resolve the issue.  I will keep you posted.  Thanks TARA

Dear Dr. Leerburger,

Thank you for your response.  As I wrote in my earlier note, I am seeking a career change into intelligence analysis. My work the last eleven years probably has a similar skill set - I basically process a great deal of information each day in order to arrive at decisions positioning a large commodity portfolio for my company.  As you may see from my resume and cover letter, I also have several years of military experience in the Navy's aviation and intelligence communities

Given the serious nature of this career change, I wish to speak to someone currently working in this field (I read your biography on the AMU website ).  My questions include:

 - Do you find the work to be rewarding?  What are the attractions and frustrations of the work?
 - Does my current background make me an attractive candidate for a mid-level position in the intelligence community?
 - If my background is currently lacking in some respects, would a graduate level program (I'm applying to both the DIA JMIC      program and Georgetown's Security Studies MA program) be a good choice?  How do these programs rate within the intelligence community?

If convenient, I would like to speak with you concerning these questions.  I thank you for any assistance you may provide.

Dear Dr. Lockwood,

I had discussed with you an extension for RC502 and I would like to propose finishing the course in January of 2002.   I am currently enrolled in RC520 and will finish this course as per the regular schedule.  The reason for my extension request is due to an unexpected increase in workload from my current job, my desire to focus on the Analytic methods course and my decision to apply to the DIA JMIC Graduate training program (I wish to spend a good deal of time time on the application).  Please let me know if this meets with your approval.

Dear Dr. Leerburger,

I am a part-time student at American Military University in the MA program in Intelligence Studies.  Currently, I am enrolled in Dr. Lockwood's Analytic Methods course.  I have been planning to finish my MA (I have an MBA from the University of Washington as well) in three years and then begin a second career in intelligence analysis (I am currently an Energy commodities trader with Enron Corp in Houston, Texas).  However, with the events on Sept. 11, I wish to apply now for a position.  If it is convenient,  I would like to discuss career opportunities in government service with you.  Attached are the cover letter and resume I have already sent the DIA and NSA.  Given the events of the last few weeks,  I know you must be extremely busy and appreciate any time you may spare.

Sincerely,

Lawrence J. May

Dear Dr. Lucas,

I am a part-time student at American Military University in the MA program in Intelligence Studies.  Currently, I am enrolled in Dr. Lockwood's Analytic Methods course.  I have been planning to finish my MA (I have an MBA from the University of Washington as well) in three years and then begin a second career in intelligence analysis (I am currently an Energy commodities trader with Enron Corp in Houston, Texas).  However, with the events on Sept. 11, I wish to apply now for a position.  If it is convenient,  I would like to discuss career opportunities in government service with you.  Attached are the cover letter and resume I have already sent the DIA and NSA.  Given the events of the last two weeks,  I know you must be extremely busy and appreciate any time you may spare.

Sincerely,

Lawrence J. May

FROM ANTHONY LOYD IN GOLBAHAR =09
=09
KARIMULLAH is an Afghan who does not want to relate his war story. In a lan=
d where everyone is quick to tell their tale, his silence makes him unique.=
  He stood alone in the narrow midday shadows of the hospital courtyard whe=
n I saw him yesterday, a mix of glittering fury and blank despair. He had h=
obbled into the Red Crosss orthopaedic centre in Golbahar on Saturday.  Eve=
n among the other amputees, his injuries stood out. Mines can take off both=
 legs and both arms, or the limbs of one side, or, more often, just a singl=
e leg or foot. Karimullah's injuries, however, had a different cause. When,=
 reluctantly, he had finished accounting for the loss of his left foot and =
right hand there was nothing to do but leave the man to his blade-eyed star=
e.  The son of Tajik parents, now 26 years old, he fled Kabul when the Tale=
ban arrived in 1996. Moving north to a village in Northern Alliance territo=
ry with his wife and two children, he found work in a vineyard. But he lost=
 his job and home to a Taleban advance in 1998. He joined the Mujahidin.  A=
 shell hit his post on the Samali Plain in 1999. It killed four of his comr=
ades. Karimullah escaped to a Pashtun village whose inhabitants handed him =
over to the Taleban. Tried by a "military tribunal" in Kabul, after torture=
 he was sent to the city's Pulecharkhi jail for having served with the Alli=
ance.  "I had been there 12 weeks when three Talebs came into my cell," he =
said. "They called my name out and said I was to be released." Baffled but =
relieved, Karimullah was led to a Datsun pick-up.  "They began driving me t=
o the Ghazi stadium," Karimullah said. "I was silent at the beginning, but =
as we neared it I asked, 'What is this? What of my release?' They told me, =
'Wait you will be released'."  The Datsun drove into the centre of the stad=
ium. Karimullah recalls thousands of faces staring at him in silence from t=
he stands, and between 10 and 14 mullahs on chairs in a line in the middle =
of the field. He was pulled from the truck and told to lie spreadeagled on =
the grass.  "The mullahs didn't even ask my name or speak to the crowd. Sev=
en doctors approached me. They wore grey uniforms, surgical masks and glove=
s. I could see one was crying. They injected me. After five minutes my body=
 was numb though I was still conscious. Then they put clamps on my hand and=
 foot and began to cut them off with special saws. There was no pain but I =
could see what they were doing."  I asked him if he stared at the sky. He t=
old me he was transfixed by the sight of his foot being removed.  "There wa=
s a sigh and murmur from the crowd when they finished. It had taken about f=
ive minutes. Taleban guards threw me into the back of the pick-up. One was =
crying too. Nothing was said. Even now I am unaware why I was chosen for am=
putation".  He was taken to Kabul's Wazir Akbar Khan hospital. After a week=
 eight of his former prison guards visited him. They brought him apples and=
 600,000 afghanis (?10).  "They apologised. They told me they had not known=
 what would happen. I threw the money and apples back at them. I screamed t=
hat they had told me I would be released and instead had taken my foot and =
hand for nothing. They left."  On the tenth day he was discharged. A taxi t=
ook him to his parents' home. They had no idea what had happened to him.  K=
arimullah's eight-year-old sister, Razia, answered the taxi-driver's knock =
on the door. She burst into tears when she saw her brother sprawled in the =
back of the cab. Worse was to follow. "My mother had been ill for some time=
 so was very weak. When she saw me, she collapsed. She regained consciousne=
ss for a few hours, but then had a heart attack and died.  "I thought the w=

Pass this on to Brad as well,  I think you guys should take the swap and options classes.
 Take advantage of the following courses remaining for 2001.

 
Electric Business Understanding - November 27
The Electric Business Understanding Seminar will give a basic overview of the electric business for those with limited knowledge of this industry. This seminar is recommended for entry level to mid-level employees in either the gas or electric business or in businesses providing services to these industries. 
 
Understanding Swaps - November 8 & 9 and December 13 & 14
This course is appropriate for all employees wishing to obtain a practical understanding of the basic natural gas and power derivative structures that are traded and marketed today. An emphasis is placed on understanding how financial tools are added to physical structures to meet the risk management needs of clients.

Understanding Options - November 27 & 28 and December 18 & 19
This course builds on our Derivatives 1 program and is appropriate for all employees looking to extend their knowledge of basic derivatives. Swaps and options are revisited, but from a more sophisticated perspective. Option pricing concepts are approached pragmatically, both from the trading and structuring/marketing perspectives. The program does not involve complex mathematics.

Structuring Natural Gas Transactions - November 19 & 20
This course builds on the DI - Applied Energy Derivatives program, focusing on deal structuring opportunities particular to the Natural Gas markets.  Participants will develop insights into the economic inter-relationships between the physical operations (pipelines, storage, generation, etc.) and their synthetic financial counterparts (basis, time spread and multi-fuel derivatives).  Emphasis is directed at identifying marketing opportunities that follow from these concepts.  This is not an introduction to natural gas markets.

Dear Dr. Fidas,

I spoke with you a few days ago concerning my interest in the Sercurity Policy Studies program.  I am going to be visiting the GW campus the afternoon of Thursday Jan 24th and would like to know if you would be available for a few minutes.  Also, you had mentioned you may be able to pass on my resume so I am attaching a cover letter and resume (the cover letter better explains the relevance my business and military experience to an intelligence position).  Ljmay1.doc is the cover letter and ljmay2.doc is the resume.  Thank you for your consideration.

Hi Larry!
 
How are you?  A little time has passed since I was last on the trading floor of what was Enron.  Hope you're hanging in there okay.  =)  I'd just been enjoying the holidays and the time off up until last week when I started really hitting the job hunt.  I talked to you about a month ago at the Front Porch about a publishing contact you had in New York and was wondering if you would pass that information along?  And if you know of anyone who's looking for analyst help, I hope you will keep me in mind and pass my name along.
Thanks so much, Larry.  My best to you and your family for the New Year.

Yes, thanks

Larry,
Hope you have been taking it easy.  I know I have been.  I am writing to ask if you would like to have pipe options valued with vol skew (the change that we put on hold in oct) for Netco.

Brad

Brad:

In regard to the change in PortCalc to handle volatility skew for Larry's basis options, Larry requested to have the change put on hold.
Could you please check with him if he would like this change in production for NetCo?

Thanks,
Jeremy

Jennifer,
I have talked to Larry and he would like to wait a while before he puts the vol skew revision into production.  I will let you know when we are ready for it.

brad

Brad,

The new post-id is 1397232. Thanks.

Can you please copy post id # 1394485 and calc it with the volatility adjustments.

I will talk to larry today about these changes today.

Brad,

The database was rebounced during weekend. So you have to close your runm and reopen it. The post-id is in production.

Brad,

I used the new port_calc to run the full book, and the post-id is 1391379. Please take a look at it and let us know your feedback. If you need any further testing, please do not hesitate to call me. Thanks.

Jennifer

Can we please test - 1386963

Brad,

Jeremy has a new port_calc ready for test. This new version will apply vol skew on basis options correctly. 
I calculated a mini-book on deal 'YG8699.1'. The post-id is 1387936. Please take a look at it.

If you have any other post-ids you want to test with this new version, please let me know, so I can run this new port_calc for you.

Thanks,
Jennifer
x35248
Thank you very much, that is exactly what I wanted to know.
Yes if the IF vol curve exists, use IF-vol + NG skew, if IF vol curve does not exsist, use NG vol + NG skew

Brad, 

I did two post-ids. I used the current production port_calc (3.15) to calculate 1389454 and I used the old version(3.14) to calculate 1389464. I do see a P& L change on 1389454.

I debugged it and found a bunch of deals with changes in P& L value. Enclosed is a partial list of those deals. The reasons are: 

In old version(3.14), we calculate volatility of basis options like this

1) we calculate the NG volatility
2) If it's a basis option, we fetch the IF- volatility curve. If IF- volatility curve exists, we use IF-volatility curve.
3) If IF- volatility curve does not exist, we still use NG volatility.

In the current production version(3.15), we calculate volatility of basis options like this

1) we calculate the NG volatility + NG vol skew. (The NG vol skew is based on NG price - fixed price)
2) If it's a basis option, we fetch the IF-volatility curve. If IF-volatility curve exists, we use IF- volatility curve.
3) If IF-volatility curve does not exist, we still use NG volatility + NG vol skew which was calculated in step 1).

The bug in the currenct production portcalc is that in step 2), we didn't apply vol skew upon IF vol. In our new fix, this bug will be fixed.

However, the IF volatility curves of those enclosed deals do not exist. So the current production version (3.15) used the NG vol + NG vol skew for those deals. The old version (3.14) used the NG vol for those deals. Thus you see P&L change in these two versions.

Also we'd like to confirm with you that in the new fix, if the IF vol curve does not exist, you still want us to use NG vol + NG vol skew instead of erroring out. If the IF vol curve exists, we will use IF vol + NG vol skew.

Thanks,
Jennifer

Mark your calendar.  The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, Nov. 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things on the horizon.  Please join me at this year's conference to plan our strategy and success for the new year and beyond.  

Watch for an agenda and registration information in the next few weeks.  I look forward to a good meeting and to seeing you there.

Regards,
Ken Lay

Kent,
     If we do so, I would assume that the reasoning is based as much on pricing as it is on volumetrics.  What are Jo and Larry's views on the market at this point?

Dan

Stan and Dan,

We are currently looking at our October storage plan and are recommending that we purchase 0.5 Bcf of operational storage for October. We need to begin doing the deals beginning Monday to get the gas in place for the month.

Our projected operational storage balance at the end of September is approx. 11.8 Bcf.  The recommended levels for October that were discussed with the customers in the SLA proceeding was a low of 8 Bcf and a high of 12 Bcf.  We feel that it would be prudent to be at or slightly above the high side of the range.  Both Mary Kay and Dave agree that a 0.5 Bcf purchase would match the strategy that has been discussed with customers in the SLA proceedings.  I have spoken with Jerry Peters and he feels that we have the necessary RAC approval based on last months approval process.

Operationally, 0.5 Bcf fits well with our physical plan also.  This leaves some room for potential long gas in Oct/Nov that would not compromise the integrity of the fields.  

If you have any questions, please give me a call at x7417.

Thanks,  Kent

Rod,
    I'd love to queue up a discussion about CMS and/or WMB, so that the Board is thinking "large acquisition".  I just don't know if we'll be ready.  I've talked with Whalley, and he's let us come in at the last minute or call a special meeting if a big deal becomes evident.  Also, Greg wants us to be very sensitive about capital structure in addition to operating cash flow.  Therefore, I'd like to start getting Tim DeSpain involved.  Does that make sense?

Dan

Anything you think we might want to think about queueing up here?

This article demonstrates the difficulty Bingaman will have trying to change current law and roll over the Alaskans.

Pat Shortridge

Article from Today's CQ Monitor

Terrorist Attacks May Tilt Gas
Pipeline Route Toward Alaska

The debate over federal support for
a pipeline to transport natural gas
from the North Slope oil fields of
Alaska to the lower 48 is expected to
accelerate during the next few weeks
because of the terrorist attacks.
Alaska lawmakers, who already
were pushing for federal dollars to
subsidize a pipeline that stays within
their state for much of its route, now
are citing the threat to world energy
supplies as a new justification. Until
now, arguments over a route have
turned on economics, with the oil
companies that own the gas supply
arguing that the route sought by
Alaskans is simply not supportable.
They want no congressional dictates
on routing.
Even before the Sept. 11 attacks,
Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee Chairman Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M., described the development of
the natural gas pipeline as both an
"economic and national security
issue."
Now, ranking Republican Frank H.
Murkowski, R-Alaska, says the attacks
will bolster congressional support for
the project. "These attacks are evi-dence
to the American public that as
we increase our dependence on for-eign
sources, we abrogate our national
security responsibilities."
One possible route, commonly
referred to as the northern route,
would stretch 1,619 miles from
Prudhoe Bay under the Beaufort Sea,
come ashore in northern Canada and
extend up Mackenzie River valley to
Edmonton. The other route, com-monly
referred to as the southern or
highway route, would extend 1,982
miles from Prudhoe Bay south to
Fairbanks, Alaska, and then toward
Edmonton. This route would parallel
the Alaska Highway.
Northern route supporters, which
include the Canadian government, say
that it is the only economically viable
route. Alaska's Democratic governor
and all-Republican congressional dele-gation
support the southern route.
They say the pipeline's construction
would create jobs for Alaskan workers
and allow Alaskan communities to tap
into the gas supply.
Last week, Joe Handley, resources
minister for Canada's Northwest
Territories, told a business conference
in Yellowknife that Tuesday's attack
may have harmed prospects for the
northern route. "They may decide that
even though the Alaskan pipeline isn't
economically viable, they may decide
to go ahead with it anyway just to
maximize their self-sufficiency,"
Handley said, according to a Canadian
Broadcasting Company report.
Although Bingaman has vowed to
include language in his comprehen-sive
energy bill (S 597) that would
"streamline the regulatory approval
process" for construction of a natural
gas pipeline from Alaska, "he has
always been route-neutral,"
spokesman Bill Wicker said.
However, the chairman is a realist.
"If people put in provisions specifying
a route, so be it," Wicker said.

Rod,
   I'm a bit unclear as to the source of the information contained in the first two sentences of paragraph 2.  I think that they should more accurately be worded, "TW benefits from contractual commitments for its firm transportation contracts into California, contracts covering 86% of TW's capacity to California continue through 2005.  Long term risk is mitigated by contracts covering 40% of TW's capacity post 2005, and a settlement agreement with current firm customers."  This would reflect our position inclusive of Red Rock.
   I'm not sure where their numbers on expiring contracts came from, but I wouldn't have a problem documenting these. 

Dan

Please review and get back to me asap.

But isn't that exactly what "interactive" means??

I don't think we can call EOL an interactive open season, since once clicked it is sold-  

Drew, We need to be careful that we do not provide a marketing affiliate advanced information on capacity availability through EOL.  Joe

Steve, do you see a problem with using EOL as the IOS process for the operational capacity deals?  I don't propose that we get into this level of detail with Staff at this time, but if they like the overall proposal, at some point we'll need to let them know that what we mean by IOS is the EOL process.  (I don't see why we'd have to design a new IOS from scratch if EOL works fine)  Is anyone nervous that the idea of using EOL as part of our capacity posting and sales process will make it harder to sell a settlement to the Indicated Shippers?     

I am OK with this but with one note. The interactive open season (IOS) mentioned in 1.b. will most likely utilize Enron Online going forward. The current IOS process is no longer available because of system changes. Therefore, any new IOS system will cost us some investment($?).

Suggested revisions.

Do you want to continue this stuff?	

I forwarded this to Danny and left two phone messages but I have never heard back as to what he wanted done about this software.   cvb

I have created a report of people that have Prophetx installed on their machines. 
Please  let me know if you like to see any  details about this application.

Caroline Barnes has asked if you would scan the ETS systems to identify who has the PROPHETX software installed.  We're concerned about the name...it could be PROFITX.  However, Danny McCarty has it installed, so you could check the spelling there.

Would you please provide her with a report?  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 33270 or Caroline at 36375.

Thanks,

Guys,
     Several of our people have PROFITEX installed on their computers at a monthly rate of $135/mo S. Harris, K. Miller, S. Neville, R. Cabrera, R. Preston, R. Paladino, J. Prichard, L. Pavlou).  If it is not necessary for the performance of their jobs, have the service terminated for the respective user.  Thanks.

But that allows all parties to game the system rather than to bid the capacity at a value that is compatible with the individual party's economics.  Or does FERC not see that as a driver (values at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would transact).  This would always put a Seller at a disadvantage.

I agree it uses an interactive tool, ie  hottap, but I feel what FERC wants is interactive bidding on the posted capacity, so that all have a chance to see others bids and anti up their bid-  EOL doesn't allow that-  MK

But isn't that exactly what "interactive" means??

I don't think we can call EOL an interactive open season, since once clicked it is sold-  

Drew, We need to be careful that we do not provide a marketing affiliate advanced information on capacity availability through EOL.  Joe

Steve, do you see a problem with using EOL as the IOS process for the operational capacity deals?  I don't propose that we get into this level of detail with Staff at this time, but if they like the overall proposal, at some point we'll need to let them know that what we mean by IOS is the EOL process.  (I don't see why we'd have to design a new IOS from scratch if EOL works fine)  Is anyone nervous that the idea of using EOL as part of our capacity posting and sales process will make it harder to sell a settlement to the Indicated Shippers?     

I am OK with this but with one note. The interactive open season (IOS) mentioned in 1.b. will most likely utilize Enron Online going forward. The current IOS process is no longer available because of system changes. Therefore, any new IOS system will cost us some investment($?).

Suggested revisions.

Drew,
      The 2002 Transwestern fuel hedges were all done with ENA.  Currently those hedges are approximately $17.0m in the money.  Our ENA hedges would certainly be rejected by a Trustee in bankruptcy.  Since these were affiliate transactions, I would assume that these positions were all layed off to a non-Enron counterparty.  Is there a way that we can get assignment of the offsetting counterparty transactions?  If not, we could have a big hole for next year.

Dan

John,
     Just one suggestion. I think it's still unclear as to why we needed to file CH.11.  In the first paragraph, final sentence, could we change it to read "These actions were necessary to ensure that our loans would not be called by the banks due to the cross defaults, and to preserve the value in our core energy business".

Dan 

Gary Smith and I developed the attached, draft letter to employees.  Your review and comments would be appreciated.

     I talked with Kilmer about the negotiated rate proceeding, and he is fine with it being handled out of Omaha.  He would like assurances that he and Teb are in the loop during the review process.  This is not the deal that I had with Mary Kay, so I will need to confirm that she is willing to shepard this this through.  Please circle back with Rob and make sure that everyone is comfortable that nothing is falling through the cracks, and I will talk with Mary Kay.
     Also, I do want to be able, at any point, to severe all TW and NNG functions IFF I'm required to--meaning Kilmer has to be in the loop on all TW matters.

Stan,
      As of today, El Paso's offer stands at $550m., and our value (Rod's and Corps.) stands at $800m.  Rod has been told by El Paso that the deal (if any) is on hold.  Due to the value gap, we're skeptical that we'd reach terms that we could submit to a Trustee.  As for the PSA, Staci has only prepared an outline of the necessary terms and has been told to slow play this one due to the value gap and El Paso's signal that this is on hold for the time being.
      If you'd like us to turn up the fire on this, we can.  I am a bit unclear (especially based on McMahon's comments on Sunday as to what is core, how we might restructure, and that asset sales were not on the front burner) as to what our key priorities are besides running the going concerns and preservation of value.
      Let me know your thoughts on this one.

Dan
      

Richard,
       Thanks for checking in.  We are doing fine.  In fact, while Enron lost 4,000 of 7,000 people yesterday, I didn't lose any (gas has to flow, you know), but most of the people that I've brought up through the organization are gone.  I can't imagine that I'll need to layoff more than 6 or 7 people in the near future.  None of the pipes have filed Ch.11 and there are no plans to do so.
       Judy and the kids are doing fine.  We do see London alumni on a regular basis.  Are you going to be here over the holidays?  We'd love to see you guys. Let me know what your calendar looks like.

Dan  

Hey Danny,

Everyone here at ICC is praying for our Enron "alumni" back in Houston, and
I hope you and the family are ok.

I just wanted to check in on you and see how you are weathering this storm;
it's got to be indescribably gut wrenching.
fyi, we are coming back; me in January to work for Stan Babiuk in Major
Projects and the family will return early March.  Everyone is still in
denial, but it is best for me right now.  EP Europe is definitely not where
I need to be in the short term.

Drop me a note back if you get a spare minute.
take care

Danny:
Would you like to keep Prophet X?  Please advise.
Hi Julie.  I'm checking with all of the people who are current users on the Prophet X software (FIMI) to see if they still want to keep their access.  Danny was added as a user several months ago.

I will be removing a few users who have left the company, and I just thought I would check with you and see if Danny was still interested in maintaining his access to the Prophet X software.  FYI, the monthly charge to his RC is $135.31.

Please let me know what he would like to do as soon as possible, and I will take the appropriate action to either maintain his connection to the server or have it deleted if that's what he wants to do.

Thanks for your help!

    As you are aware, we've let 4,000 full time tenured employees go.  Our retention of any contractors will be scrutinized to the highest degree.  Please prepare an explanation for each of the contractors (from the list below) in your area that you wish to retain.  Upon completion, please forward it to me.

If not, I need to assist you in processing them out.  Please let me know your decision as soon as possible.  Please bear in mind that the presumption is that they are not critical -- there needs to be ample justification to retain.  This exercise is being done for all contractors throughout ETS.

Steve,
      This is landing at a bad time.  I'm going to be in Omaha going over the 2002 plan, and doing other business.  Unfortunately, I cannot reschedule this one so I'll have to miss the Wine fest.

Will you and Judy be attending?

Thank you for your hard work and your continued commitment to the March of Dimes. 

Enron's 2001 WalkAmerica campaign was the #14 Walk Team in Houston, contributing $72,563 to the March of Dimes. In addition, Danny McCarty was the #2 fundraiser in the city, raising $20,350, and Sophie Patel was the #5 fundraiser, raising $10,002.

In appreciation of all your efforts for WalkAmerica and the March of Dimes, you and a guest are invited to the 2001 March of Dimes' WineFest on Thursday, October 4 from 6:00 p.m. - 9:00 p.m. at the Crystal Ballroom of the Rice Hotel. It will be a great evening of food, wine, friends, and a silent auction.

Please let me know by Friday, September 28, if you will be able to attend WineFest 2001.

Thank you, again, and hope to see you there.

Stan,
       Negotiations with SoCal have gone nowhere.  Out of the $6.0m (past and future) in dispute, they have only offered about $600,000 in value.  We're taking one more shot at negotiating a deal whereby they would take more capacity going west and/or having them buy out of West Texas lateral space which TK and Lorraine would sell for incremental revenue.  If this doesn't prove fruitful, then I would intend to pursue the FERC decision.  Agreed?

Dan

Guys,
   We need to terminate this (unilaterally if possible, or if not, bilaterally) and move towards settlement now (it's better to move to settlement prior to a default which I believe will be on Monday).  Who is not being responsive? I'll track them down and get an answer if I have to. I think that we're too late for today, so let's do it in the morning.

Dan  

FYI

I have not heard back from wasaff. Unless rod feels otherwise, I would send the early termination. We are having major communication problems with wasaff and others.
I assume you haven't received an answer from RMTC?  Greg  

Danny:
Please note that Amelia will be honored and the Committee will thank you for sponsorship (see below).  Amelia asked if you were being a guest.  Did you check with Judy and the kids?

Julie, here is an email invitation, and I'll bring the hard copy tomorrow.  I have registered Danny on the website, so you'll get a confirmation (or he will) by email.  Here's the basic program:  There are only four private nominations from Houston on the torch relay.  The four companies asked to submit a nomination were Enron, Texas Instruments, Motorola, and a technology group from Rice University.  These four companies have one torchbearer each (me from Enron) who will be briefly honored at the reception.  Then the Lieutenant Governor of the State of Utah will thank Danny for Enron's nomination of a torchbearer (me), and three other companies will receive the same honor, and that's it, so it shouldn't be very time consuming for him.  They said the presentations would begin at 7:15 pm.

If he would care to participate in the torchbearing event itself, I will be running the torch from Washington @ Roy Street to Durham @ Rose, on Monday, December 10, at 2:30 PM.

Thanks for your help with this  (The RSVP link below gives you about the same info that you see here.)

    I just signed the confidentiality agreement and will track down the ENA contracts asap.  I'll let you know when I have them.

Dan 

Ken, 
    I realize that times are tough, but this is really twisting the knife that is already deeply embedded in the majority of employees.  Have you ever gone down to the Body Shop in the mornings or at noon to see how many employees use the facility for health and stress relief purposes?  We've done a lot of things during the past few weeks to kill morale, but this is a new low.  Are you going to do anything about it?  I think that a lot of people would like to know.

Dan

The Body Shop will close today (December 6, 2001) at 7:30 p.m. and will remain closed indefinitely due to the current business circumstance.  

Access to the Body Shop will be available from Friday, December 7 through Friday, December 14, during the hours of 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. for members to clean out their lockers.  

Thank you.  

Eric,
    Do you have any ballpark idea about where an offer might come in?

Dan

Tony + Kim,

Several of the rejoining partners of ANNGTC have contacted me asking if Enron is interested in selling its residual claims.  The answer is most definitely affirmative.  Please advise on the following-

What are the bankruptcy court's requirements to undertake a mandated auction?
Is it possible through the bankruptcy court to extinguish liability claims arising prior to NAGC's withdrawal from the ANNGTC partnership?  If so, how?

Here's how I would like to proceed-
Prepare an offering letter that identifies what we are selling and preferred terms + conditions
Distribute to each partner, possibly other interested parties (ANS producers)
Obtain bids and evaluate best offer

I would like to begin the sales process asap and would appreciate your feedback most urgently.

Cindy,
    Check and see if PROFITX software is on Stan's computer (the icon will be on his windows screen).  If so, find out if he uses it and let Julie know.  Julie is trying to get it removed from a number of systems as the support for the software is $135.00/mo., and it is not a critical tool for us.  Thanks.

    If you need to reach me the afternoon, you can get me from 3:30 on at 713-345-3271.

Dan

I just verified with Kinder Morgan that Northern Natural will receive appr. $144,000 for refunds related to an  excess deferred income tax refund issue .  It applies to a time where NNG did not have a tracker and thus can be retained by NNG and does NOT need to be refunded to our shippers.

This $144,000 reflects incremental cash and income for NNG for 2001 and will be received by wire transfer at the end of the month.

   FYI. I am still uncomfortable doing anything with NNG's swaps until someone can tell me who the swaps are with, who the confirms are with, what underlying contracts are being terminated, and what are the ramifications of the termination. Until we can answer these questions, we cannot terminate anything. How can we get these answers?

     I thought that there was $553,000 due from ENA for November capacity release.  Who are the original shippers on the other $348,000?  
  
Dan

FYI -  Elizabeth forwarded the letter attached below to the ENA contacts listed along with a courtesy copy to Citizens.  The amount of the reservation payments that are outstanding and will revert back to Citizens is $205,755.  Citizens recalled this capacity on 11/30/2001 and will pay TW directly for December business.

Rick,
     I guess that we are going to be s.o.l. as an unsecured creditor on the $129,000.  How do we get to the $226,350 where they acted as agent.  Can we go direct to the beneficiaries?  Whatever can be done needs to be done fast, because people, money and paperwork seem to be disappearing around ENA's shop.  

Dan

Below is an Excel spreadsheet that shows all outstanding November 2001 TW transportation invoices mailed to ENA on 12/03/01 in which they were designated as the payor.  Of the $569,434.56 invoiced, $213,603.58 was through our capacity release program as the acquiring shipper for two Citizens Communications Company contracts.  Another $226,350.00 was for ENA acting as agent for Eastern New Mexico Gas Association, Enervest San Juan Operating, LLC, and the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.  The remaining $129,480.98 is for their own contracts with TW.  Please see the attached schedule for the details.

Citizens is aware of their accountability for ultimate payment of the demand portion of the contracts in which they released capacity.

Bob,
      I've not kept up with Brian for the past several years.  I can say, that during the four years that Brian worked for me, he created value every year without having tasks and opportunities handed to him.  In fact, even in his worst year, he created $6.5m.  Brian really  started our currency arb's (US/Canadian) in 1992 when we worked on Sithe.  The concept of a "virtual power station" was co-created by Brian and Joe Gold (his associate) when they sold a virtual pump storage to National Power Ltd. after their failed attempt purchase an actual pump storage in the UK (trading peak against off-peak spreads seems to be no great feat today, but no one had ever done one in 1996).  A lot of what we've done the past few years stems back to many of the ground breaking things that Brian and Joe started ( including the way that we structured the tolling agreements surrounding our Sutton Bridge Plant in the UK). 
      As for enemies at Enron---I think that they are all gone (Ken, Amanda, Cliff, John Stokes and crew).  I think that Mark Frevert still thinks highly of Brian and understands that Brian was put in a bad situation (being put in the middle of the Ken and Amanda thing).
      I do know that Brian has turned around his life quite significantly--he's very Christian and has a lot less ego than he once had.  If I could hire him back, I would.  I'd just cut him loose, ask him to make me $6.0m/yr., and he'd deliver me $10.0m/yr.  I'd take as many of those kind of people that you could find for me.
      Let me know if I can help further.

Dan 

Brian called me last week and shared that you had suggested he call.  As you
know, he has some significant holes in his resume' and has a few enemies
within the Enron family.  I never worked with him so I don't know his
genuine abilities.  Could you shed some light on your experience with Mr.
Barrington.

Also, would you indicate what function each individual is responsible for

Guys,
      Fran Fagan will be sending you a worksheet for year end bonuses for 2001 and a worksheet for 2002 merit increases.  Several individuals may not show up on your bonus list since employees who previously received retention bonuses have been omitted, but these individuals will show up on your merit list.  Please work through these lists and forward your suggestions to Fran Fagan by December 28.  As guidelines:

       1. We MUST, in the aggregate, come in below the sum of the proposed bonus levels.
       2.  Individual bonuses which exceed last year's amounts will be strictly scrutinized at three levels (me, Stan, and the Comp. Committee), so the story had better be good.
       3.  I'd like to see extraordinary performance during the past few months, particularly in a leadership capacity, heavily weighted in your consideration.

Fran,
    If Julie's merit needs to be lump sum, just move it over to that column.  Also, send me Eric Gadd's sheets as well.  Thanks.
Dan

As discussed, attached are your sheets for bonus and merit.

Steve,
    It looks like you're going to need some help on your bonus numbers based on your team's performance.  I have an extra $24,500 that you can have now.  Use it if you need to.

Dan

Eric,
   I'd suggest:
    Janet Place--Legal
    Mary Kay Miller--regulatory
    Technical--???  talk with Phil
    MOU--You 
  Sound O.K.?

Hello,

I am in the process of establishing a Contact List for the Withdrawn
partners.  Would you please check the information I have on you and confirm
that it is correct and would you supply any information that is missing.

Also, would you indicate what function each individual is responsible for
eg. , MOU, Technical, Regulatory, Commercial or Legal.  I will update the
list once I have more information.  Thanks very much for your help.

Stan,
    I just glanced at your new org. chart and thought I'd make a comment (or really more of an observation).  Jesus had 12 direct reports and screwed up on one of them, so while I agree that a flat organisation is best, I think that you'd better be very careful or you get a godlike ego.

Dan

Brian,
     If that is the case, I think that I have $0 left.  There was a request earlier this week for  $750 from NNG.  I guess we'll have to put this on hold for now.  I'll get back with Steve Harris.

Dan

Dan:

	You started off 2001 with a $9,000 PAA pool.  To date, there have been nine awards totalling $8,250.  Thus, you have $750 remaining.

	I would suggest that in Audrey's case, we award either $500, but no more than $750, which is in-line with most of the other awards.

	For the rest of the year, you should know that there may be additional funds available if the other divisions are not close to exceeding their allotments.  

	After your decision, I'll have Fran oversee the processing.

Brian
Brian,
      Do we have the funds for this?  If so I'd like to proceed on this one.  What capacity do we have for PAA's for the rest of 2002?

Dan

I would like to recommend a Personal Achievement Award for Audrey Robertson in the amount of $1000. Audrey has done a tremendous job the last several months in helping support several other groups in addition to her normal job duties. She has put forth a significant effort in performing administrative duties for the ETS Business Development and Facility Planning departments. Audrey has gone out of her way to provide daily assistance to these groups and I have received several notes indicating her exemplary performance. In addition, she helped coordinate the move for several groups to our new floors as well as plan a major customer meeting which had to be cancelled but was done in a manner resulting in no financial cost to Transwestern (saving us thousands of dollars).   

If you are in agreement with this recommendation please forward this note to Brian Schaffer in HR with your approval. Thanks.

	Steve 

Since to bulk of these will be used for employees, I'd like to try and get 20-plus tickets through Deb---not hospitality ones.

Danny:

If we want individual tickets, we should make the request through Deb.  $60.00 and $70.00 range.

Otherwise, please see the Group Ticket packages.

Bronze $4000 = $200 per ticket
http://www.swbellcottonbowl.org/big12/tickets/Big%2012%20Group%20Ticket%20Order%20Form.pdf

Web site shows $60 & $40 tickets are sold out. 
http://www.swbellcottonbowl.org/big12/tickets/#

No tickets are available (at this time) on the Huskers web site.

Please advise.

Mary Kay,
        It seems that others have benefited handsomely from the volatility in Permian/SanJuan to Cal. border prices.  Interesting, isn't it?
Dan

FYI

While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates.
For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million

 

Pam,
     Forget the monitor and video cart, I had Julie order them off iBuyit today.  Who should we call to test the CATV cable that was installed, as it appears not to work, and who do we call to remove the 36" TV and entertainment center that was delivered to us last week?  Thanks.

Dan    

Cindy,
    No.  I'll give her mine and Eric's.  I fear that if she has Stan's, he'll get random calls that shouldn't rise to his level, and you'll lose control of your ability to screen his calls for priority.

Dan

Excellent, Dan!    Jane is asking for Stan's cellular....is it absolutely critical that she have his cell number?   I try not to give it out unless absolutely necessary.   And then she's looking for what "function" he will be responsible for.

Thanks for handling this!

Mary Kay,
       Just a bit of a heads up--It is looking like the Management Conference in November is being cancelled (probably to be rescheduled for after the first of the year).  We should hear something official in the next day or two.

Dan

SOOOO--Is it really too late to consider a disaster recovery site that would be safer than Ardmore in the event of flood, bio-terrorism, or other crazy attack, that would be marketable to other companies??  I think that this a question that one should ask one's self if one was just promoted to a lofty position of authority.

Dan 

I participate in the Southern Gas Association and am asked questions as related to IT topics.  If the early discussions you and I had regarding the provision of disaster recovery by ETS would have taken a different turn I could have provided an interesting answer to this one...

We are doing our annual review of disaster/recovery procedures and
expecting to make revisions in light of the Sept. 11 attack.  Our current
plans are based on the potential of a fire damaging the building or a
hurricane in the region.  We are interested in knowing what other options
companies are planning for:  the building being gone?  toxic chemicals in
the area causing a whole area to be evacuated?  other ideas?

We are also interested in any references on companies that have been a
resource for helping to decide what to plan for and how to manage the
risks.

I got it, pal. 

John,
     I've been holding Babiuk off.  But this is starting to sound like vintage Ballentine, and I have some doubt that he has any real deal in store.  Can we sell him an option for $50,000, to accept this deal by execution of our document and payment of the consideration by November 15, 2001?  It would show that he's, at least, serious.  Or we could break off discussions with him all together and start up with El Paso.  What do you think?

Dan

Hey Dan,

Ballentine tells me now that he is renegotiating some terms of his deal with his client.  Our Stock Sale agreement is acceptable to both parties but won't be signed now until John can work out his other deal.  We are postponing signing the agreement until Monday, November 12.

Any more word from Mr. Babiuk?

John

Julie - please reschedule my time with Danny to Friday 11/9.  Thanks.
John,
    Stan Babiuk of El Paso called again to express their interest in buying Sunniland.  How sure are you that this deal will happen?

Dan

 << File: PSA v7 10-17.doc >> 

Danny,

Julie has me on your schedule Monday 10/22 at 1:30pm to sign the attached agreement.  I will bring you two copies with legal sign off and with Ballentine's signature.  Here are the terms:

All shares of Enron Alligator Alley Pipeline Company will be sold to ID3Energy Company, which is Ballentine's company
Price is $1,000,000
ID3 puts up $50,000 earnest money 
ID3 takes assets as-is, where-is
ID3 will complete, at their expense, the environmental remediation work plan within twelve months
Enron has right to match any bona fide offer to construct liquid or gas pipelines in the right-of-way for a twelve month period
Enron will negotiate an operating agreement to provide ID3 with field services for no longer than six months
Close in 90 days

We would like to have this executed on Monday 10/22.  If you don't think that's possible, please advise and Julie can reschedule.

Thanks,
John

John,
    That is fine, but I'd also like to see current month to Plan as well, as this will be of particular interest next year.
Dan

Danny, in the past the pipes have chosen different comparisons when they have issued their individual margin comparisons each Friday onto the Website.   Some have chosen to compare the current month to the current month in the 3rd Current Estimate OR to the current month in the last QTR Forecast.  

Now that we are providing you a Summary page we need to be consistent on that Summary at least.  I would recommend that we compare the current month to the current month in the last QTR Forecast since that is the last published Forecast you and Stan have seen.  Any objections?

Mary Kay,
         I still haven't forgotten--I'm talking with Stan about the Lay/Frevert/Whalley meeting this afternoon, and I'll let you know.
Dan

Mary Kay,
       I still haven't forgotten about you--I'll be talking to Stan about the Lay/Frevert/Whalley meeting this afternoon.  I'll give you a call then.

Dan

Okay

I like the way you think!

Cindy,
    No.  I'll give her mine and Eric's.  I fear that if she has Stan's, he'll get random calls that shouldn't rise to his level, and you'll lose control of your ability to screen his calls for priority.

In preparation for your Wednesday meeting with Heath, here are some supporting documents.  Will be calling on Tuesday to answer any questions.

1. This is the main argument and rebuttal document  
2. This is the document Heath presented to his investment advisory board, incl. Lay and Whalley  
3. This is a presentation describing the current skills of the team and ensuing organizational structure of the deal  
4. Some backup numbers on valuation this is IdleAire's   and Xtransco's  note they are based on different business models.
5. Some backup documentation on fuel idling burn  (we are conducting tests with Grady Olson that are yielding the same results) and results from a prelim survey we conducted on truck drivers regarding their views and interest in value prop  (note these results are very rough--you should receive a better version before your meeting no Wednesday.)

I will be in Lake Tahoe starting Wednesday morning, but am reachable 24/7 on my mobile 713-269-1777.

Hamd Alkhayat

p.s. still have not been able to connect with Bill Fowler.

Eric,
      Bob will be reporting into the Asset Development Group (which is you), but as you well know--we tend to blur alot of lines around here.  It is important to TCPL and all of the others to know that Bob does have direct access to Stan and me.  This is consistent with what Bill had originally talked to Bob about.  Okay?

Dan

Danny,

It's ok by me if Bob reports to you on ANNGTC - - - I'm ready to step in any time if this reporting structure becomes burdensome and will stay in the info loop at any rate.

This afternoon I called Paul to let him know that I am getting involved with the A to B Alaskan activities on behalf of Enron, not Northern Border.  He was ok with my involvement and will let Tony Palmer and Dennis McConaghy know.  He asked if you were remaining involved and I said yes that I would report to you on this project.  He asked me to let you know that he has a call into you regarding getting the joint development agreement going on the B to C line.  Bob Hill

Are you there?

Message received. Thanks. 

Danny,

To keep you updated, we are reorganising our Merchant Energy function
globally, and John Hushon, CEO of Europe (my direct boss) is leaving end of
the year.  As a result, I have put activated my own return to the US and it
looks like I will be moving to Jay Holm/Stan Babiuk's group as Director of
Project Development in Major Projects.  It could be fun, depending on how
much running room they will let me have.  It will be nice to get back up to
speed on the US side as well.

I'll be back in Houston effective January 1, and the family is moving end of
February.  It should be official by the end of the week, as soon as I get
some HR items nailed down.  Anyway, you know before most El Paso people do,
so please don't mention anything just yet.

Also, I know it's tough times right now.  Just wanted to let you know that
I'm praying for you and my many other Enron friends right now.  Hang in
there man.

I'll be in touch.

Dan - We would like to invite you and your wife to our Christmas party December 7 at the Western Heritage Museum in Omaha.  This year, we are having a combined ETS & NBPL party with the social hour starting at 6:30, dinner at 7:30 followed by service awards program.  Bill Cordes is inviting Stan and if it works out that you could get a company plane, we would then ask Rod Hayslett, Shelley, and possibly Phil Lowry depending on seats available.

All of us would love to have you attend.  Let us know at your convenience.

Mike McGowan

Shelley,
      How are your people coming on the TW and NNG contracts?  Sorry about the short notice,  but as usual, it's good that it's in our hands and not someone else's.

Larry,
       At what point do we consider taking off the '02 hedges?  Is that a game we should play or not? What is your view of market for '01 and '02?

Eric,
     Here is the IT Backhaul proposal that went to Gonzales.  You'll note that it is for deliveries west of the Florida border.

Attached is a draft service proposal to facilitate discussions regarding interruptible backhaul transportation service from the proposed Calypso Pipeline receipt point.

Please call if questions or you wish to discuss.

 

Eric,
      I thought you had talked to Susan about covering for Julie on Friday afternoons.  She needs to know that "covering" means she needs to stay beyond 3:40 (at least until close of business), which is when she rushed out on Friday.  I had phones shifted over to Audrey after I got a call from Cindy looking to find Julie or me.  If you haven't talked with her, I will I'd you'd prefer.

Eric,
     Considering the number of fires we have at Enron right now this is about the last thing on Stan's mind.  Hill and Hartsoe are appropriate to be attending this meeting.  Again--I think that this is a bit more of Dennis' overkill.  Do you think he goes dove hunting with grenades?
 
Dan

Danny,
 
I recommend that Bob Hill and Joe Hartzoe represent Enron in DC on 15 Nov with the Senators.  Dennis probably prefers that either you or Stan appear.  Please advise.
Gentleman, 

The two attached email items from Van Ness describe draft legislation which Senator Murkowski is considering introducing and the likely timing of such action. 

As the note describes, Murkowski would: 

ban OTT; and 
introduce a "trigger date concept", presently Jan. 1, 2003, for ANGTS would have filed with the Secretary of Energy a proposal which the Secretary certifies to be the substantial equivalent of a complete Section 7 application for public convenience and necessity; in the event the trigger date is not met, allow the "producer enabling" legislation, which would provide ANGTA-type expedition for any NGA Section 7 application to build a pipeline in Alaska, to come into effect. 

Currently, our best sense is that Murkowski could unveil this alternative as early as next week, either as part of a Republican energy bill or an amendment to pending legislation. 

Concurrently, the Democratic side , via the staffs of both Daschle and Bingaman, are preparing a comprehensive energy bill which will contain an Alaskan gas pipeline title.  At present, we do not yet have a sense of what that title would contain, and we been assured the current "placeholder" in the draft does not indicate that Daschle and Bingaman have 
decided to support producer legislation. 

While it is not certain that Murkowski could force this issue alone, it is in our collective best interests to forestall any producer legislation by demonstrating real progress as soon as possible. This is particularly true because the current political situation could make it easier for Murkowski or others to bypass the usual process and proceed with an amendment to non-energy legislation from the floor. 

Based on the advice from our advisors in Washington, we believe that we should execute and publicly announce the MOU no later than November 15, and earlier if feasible.  We also believe  that the signatories to MOU should be available in Washington on the 15th to meet face to face with Murkowski, Binagman and Daschle to convey: 

progress on the re-enlistment as represented by the MOU; 
our commitment to the development of a commercial proposal for ANGTS that results in serious face-to-face negotiations in the first quarter of 2002; and 
our continued position that any legislative action by Congress at this time is premature because 

we have resolved, in principle, a key obstacle identified by the producers; 
with all parties coalescing around an Alaskan Highway project, ANGTS remains the best vehicle for expediting the actual construction of the pipeline; 
because we need the Producers as shippers, there is no possibility that we could exert undue commercial pressure on them; and 
establishing a deadline would provide the producers with the incentive to simply run out the clock. 

Although circumstances politically might suggest our being in Washington ahead of the 15th, I recognize that the 15th better conforms to the reality of commercial progress.  I plan to speak to this on the Wednesday commercial meeting in Calgary. I would hope that at the Wednesday meeting your representatives would be able to confirm your participation for meetings on the 15th with the three Senators. 

Obviously, it is our view, at Foothills/ANNGTC, that we want to deflect the Congress from enacting any legislation at this time, and particularly anti-ANGTS legislation like that Murkowski is considering.  We need the help of Murkowksi and others to cause the Producers to match the serious steps and compromises we have made, not to enact a statutory scheme that encourages and rewards their unwillingness to develop a comprehensive pipeline package. 
  
  

Dennis McConaghy  403-920-2011 
  
  

John,
     Have Craig give me a call--we have alot of new work being done with PG&E and TW, so he could be quite helpful.
Dan

Stan,
    I have it on good authority that Dynegy is making a run at Bob Hayes. My guess is that Bob will call you or me to discuss his status sometime today.

Dan

John,
      I want a report that doesn't change formats every time you or anyone else decides to chat about it.  All I want is a apples to apples comparison from week to week.  Whether that comparison is to Current Estimate, Forecast or both, I don't care.  Just produce a report and then be consistent--starting tomorrow.

Dan  

I talked with Rod and Bob Hayes and they say the discussion with Stan at his meetings tends to compare the current month to that month in the last Current Estimate because (which I didn't know) the Current Estimate is the last number that Corporate has seen.  The QTRly Forecasts are not published upstairs.

In an effort to produce a document on the Web that all the VPs could use, would you consider publishing the Weekly Net Commercial Contribution Summary that compares to Current Estimate instead of the QTRly Forecast or try to squeeze a comparison to Current Estimate also?

Whaddya think?

Stan,
      Last week we coordinated with Steve Kean, Rick Shapiro, Joe Hartsoe and the Washington office, so that they would make sure that our objections (as outlined in Dennis's communication below ) to certain portions of Bingaman's proposed legislation would be heard. They've all been working on the issue this week and will continue through the Bingaman hearings. Williams, El Paso and Duke have all done the same.

Dan   

Please advise as to what you want to do.
Stan, this has the attachment I refer to in the prior email.

Tom, as you probably are aware Senator Bingaman is holding hearings on the Alaskan pipeline situation next Tuesday in Washington. As Foothills and ANNGTC, 
Mike Stewart and I are going to be appearing before that committee. Other notables will be the producers and state of Alaska. We will be finalizing our prepared 
remarks on Monday and I will undertake to email a copy prior to our appearence. The basic messages will continue to be: 
  
  
          a view that no legislative action is required at this time. In fact, any unsettling of the legislative status quo may actually slow down the overall commercial         process pariticularly if two conflicting statutues were to be put in place.
          genuine commercial activity is progressing, both in terms of dealing with the liabilities issue within ANNGTC and a commerical proposal to the      producers     from a reconstituted partnership
          ANGTS continues to remain a viable and expeditious means of bringing this resource to market within decade, particularly from the broadest      stakeholder   perspective

We have been advised by our Washington counsel that it would be extremely helpful if the Withdrawn Partners ,or "to be" re-enlisted Partners, would provide the 
Chairman will some communication on thier view of the need for any legislative initiative at this time. 
I understand Williams is intending to communciate to the Chairman in this manner. 
I offer you the following attachment drafted by our Washington counsel for your consideration as a basic framework if you see merit for Enron in providing a 
contribution to Senator Bingaman. 
However you wish to proceed, I dutifully provide you with a copy of our prepared remarks prior to our appearence.
 - VANDOC_109208_1.doc << File: VANDOC_109208_1.doc >> 

I was very disappointed to not have any advance warning about the announcement that construction on 41 has been put on hold for financial reasons.

The Gas Logistics team was "relocated" off the 41st floor on October 5.  Prior to the move, we had a very efficient, open configuration that let us work together as a unified team.  

After the move, we are located on 3 different floors.   Besides the general impact on team unity, this move also means that our evening staff work alone on separate floors, rather than in a group.  It means fewer individuals to cover customer calls.  It means having more equipment to cover the day to day business.   I have worked hard to calm the team that this arrangement is just temporary and that we will eventually be put back together as a team.

Prior to our move I constantly questioned whether our move was necessary.  I asked about smaller, more practical changes to fit more people on the floor.  And, I specifically asked about whether Enron issues might impact the groups desire to continue to spend $7-$10 million -- even as I reluctantly packed up my boxes.

I hope you can appreciate that the current seating arrangement is a serious issue for my team and one that generates constant questions as my staff meetings.  Finding out  that we moved off of 41 for no reason at an all-employee floor meeting undermines my team's faith in my leadership.

Not yet.

Any news?

I just got off of fifty and there is no news yet.  Last we heard, Chevron's CEO had one more call to make with someone from Texaco, and that their response was eminent.

Dan

Any news?

We'll have $1.5 B. for about 15 minutes.

Danny - What are you going to do with $1.5 billion?  Want to buy some steel?

Fran,
    I've already talked with Bob about the specifics of this, so go ahead and forward it to him (he's expecting it).

Rod,
     I had approved an offsite Happy Hour for our Market Services Group following our string of emergencies (about a $2500-$3000 expenditure).  Considering everything that has happened, we're reviewing all costs, whether previously approved or not, and cutting where we can.  This is one that I don't think I should pull unless you feel strongly that I should.  Let me know your thoughts.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Julie,
      All I really wanted to ensure is that we were striving to get as many tickets as we could, since the employees would take as many as we could get.  I was concerned that with all of the cost cutting, someone would just assume that we could get by without the tickets.  I thought that Deb could get eight (8), I'd buy them personally, and I'd use four (Hayes and me), and would give the other four to employees.  If Mary Kay wants four (4), that's fine.  Let Deb know, however, that employees using them for personal use (which I'm sure will be all of them), will be expected to pay for them themselves.  

Dan

Julie,
Deb refers to "bowl tickets".  I assume that she means "playoff tickets", since the bowl tickets won't be allocated until teams are selected for the BCS Bowls (which is after the playoffs in Dallas).

Dan
Deb:
Originally, Danny requested 20-25 and your last notice was for 8 tickets.  I did not realize that Mary Kay's request was part of Danny's request. I will discuss with him in the morning.  Was the 8 ticket notice for Danny, Mary Kay and Mike ?  

Dan, Mary Kay would like to have 4 bowl tickets.  In my original request to the University for tickets, her request was in the mix.  Mary Kay called me today to see if she was going to get any tickets.  

My question is: how do you want me to allocate the tickets I have so far? 

Cindy, 
    No.  This are working meetings which kick off the due diligence review for each of the withdrawn partners. So, everyone will be sending their worker bees only.

Dan  

Danny:   Does Stan need to attend these?

Mary Kay,
      At what point can we expect the CPUC and IS's to take their lumps and get on with picking at some other issues?  Hasn't Kern River done something that they can spend their time fighting about?  How do you think this one will go from here?

Dan

For your info, we have received a protest and or reguest for Tech Conference or hearing from the CPUC regarding the USGT transaction starting Nov 1, 2001.  they raise the market power issue, the pricing, the volume, the policy of market based rates.  We expect a similar protest from IS, and also the issue regarding the alternate point use.  The volume on this transaction is for 400,000 per day with the negotiated rate provision only relating to the alternate path to Calif.   More to come.  

FYI---I guess it ain't over 'till it's over.

Cindy,
     For what it's worth, I am quite opposed to going forward with the Enron Christmas Party as planned.  With as much negative press as we've gotten, we are assured that the local TV stations and the Chronicle will cover it, and will put the "lavish" affair in the worst light possible.  Can't we stop it now??

Dan

FYI

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =

ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=
le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Bob,
    Would you copy me when you send the first draft, I'd like to get a better feel for it.  Thanks.

Dan

Byron and Paul, Eric Gadd has turned the ball over to me on the B to C joint project sponsored by El Paso, Enron and TCPL.  To get things moving, I could take the development agreement that El Paso and Northern Border negotiated 3 years ago on the Illinois-Wisconsin Pipeline Project and make a few wording adjustments and then offer it to each of you as a first draft of the B-C project development agreement. Let me know how that sounds.  Bob Hill. 402-398-7888. 

Unfortunately, my travel plans have changed and I will now be in transit at
the time of the call this afternoon.  Please send me any results and let me
know if I have any specific assigments.

Phil,
       Due to the increasing demands on Stan, I'd like to offer our help in meeting and communicating with the field (Hayes, Harris, Neubauer, Miller, Kilmer, and myself).  Stan's already taken, and I'm sure that you have taken, more than your share of unwarranted heat and criticism, so we'll help tow the line.  Would there be an opportunity for field visits in the near future?  Let me know.

Dan

Stan,
     Eric Thode's comment reported by Dow Jones yesterday that "most of Enron's critical employees are under contract" is not sitting well with my people--particularly Mary Kay, Rob and Steve.  He also made a comment that bonuses were "scheduled to be paid in mid-February" (a statement on a delicate subject that did not need to be made).  I know that some of this stuff can't be avoided, but I don't think we're even being careful about what is, or is not, said in the media.  I want a fair shot to deliver a solid company with good morale and a high self-esteem to Dynegy.  And mistakes like this don't help morale or the group's cohesiveness. Could you raise the concern at you 11:00 meeting if possible?

Dan

Cindy,
    This was the official response on whether the Enron Field Christmas Party would be cancelled.  Let Stan know as well.

Dan

Danny I recommended on monday we cancel it ....ken agreed yesterday.  

Stan,
       In response to your questions today:

            1. Research Group--while we do use them for options modeling and sanity checks, we employ two of their quant-jocks directly on NNG payroll (Sean Bolks being the lead).  As long as we keep these two, we could get by without them all together.

            2. Government Affairs--we only use one individual out of the Corporate Staff (Pat Shortridge).  Other than that, they provide no value.
      
            3. Aviation--will be used be my staff only is cost justified versus commercial (coach) flights.

            4. Strategic Sourcing--TAP does provide a cost effective service.  We could do without it, but I doubt we'd save money doing it ourselves.

Dan

Joel,
      I truly wish that I had something in my shop for you, but I don't.  Try Geoff Roberts at Entergy (281)-297-3120, Rich Kinder at Kinder Morgan (713)369-9000, or you could try Anadarko in the Woodlands.  I know that Duke is still hiring, too.  The other alternative is to look outside the industry, which is probably a good idea at this point.  You could also contact Joe Sutton and see if you could get some leads from him.  In any event, let me know if there is something that I can do.  I wish you the best of luck in your search--we'll keep you in our prayers until we've heard that you're fine, so let us know.

     Take care.

Dan

Ever really want someone to wake you up from a bad dream...

The good news is Enron Freight is no longer one of the non-core business entities on the fence. The bad news is we fell on the wrong side of the fence. The word is, basically, sell yourselves to someone or liquidate.

Any suggestions on where I should start looking?

Our house hasn't sold in Indy yet, but the job market there is pretty slim. Think we'll go ahead and plan to stay here in Houston.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

Joel

Mike and Dave,
       As you probably guessed, Stan and I will not be coming to the Christmas Party after all.  I will try to get to Omaha prior to the Party for a couple of days though.

Dan

Dan - We would like to invite you and your wife to our Christmas party December 7 at the Western Heritage Museum in Omaha.  This year, we are having a combined ETS & NBPL party with the social hour starting at 6:30, dinner at 7:30 followed by service awards program.  Bill Cordes is inviting Stan and if it works out that you could get a company plane, we would then ask Rod Hayslett, Shelley, and possibly Phil Lowry depending on seats available.

All of us would love to have you attend.  Let us know at your convenience.

Mike McGowan

Kent,
     I understand your concern, but at this point, I may have to tell you who the "right" person is for the time being.  I am working the situation from this end and will advise you what needs to be done, why and when.   Whatever is done, I can assure you that your "right" choice to fill any position will be from within our group, and will make sense from an overall ETS Commercial perspective.

Dan

Danny,

Listed below are some statistics that we keep track of relative to our IDD business.  The growth of this business is attributable to the great mix and number of people that we have in the Storage group under Sue's direction.  We feel that a big reason for our success is the great team that we have built and we have gone to great lengths to insure that we have the right mix of people in the group.  This is why were so excited to see that Morgan was interested in coming back to the group.  Not only does this get our staffing back to the level that it needs to be, but Morgan has proven that he is highly effective in the group.  If the situation with Morgan doesn't work out then I feel the need to continue looking for the "right" person to replace Theresa.

This approach is also the approach for the Pricing and Structuring group under Jo's leadership (i.e. insuring the right mix and number of people).  We have been looking to replace Jeff Nielsen with the right person and feel that the security of our business requires another person on the Pricing Desk.

I wanted to bring both of these jobs to your attention given the staffing questions that we had today.

STORAGE STATISTICS:
		Transactions (Bcf)		Annual Revenue ($millions)
1997			  49				$  5.5
1998			  39				$  6.7		
1999			  40				$  6.7
2000			  85				$10.7
2001			119				$21.2

FYI--this should wind Kent up just a bit.

Pam,
     I don't see why the clearing of 41 is a prerequisite.  Let's just get it moved from 4th to where ever so people can see it.  I've got a whole floor of people apprehensive about the move and wasting time talking about what the working enviornment might be like when we finally move back. We've got enough to worry about, this isn't worth the noise.  If people just see it, they will understand that this is not going to be a minimum footprint sardine pack, and any noise will stop. 
     When can we expect it to be available for viewing.  Do you want me to have Julie arrange it with Claudia?
     Also, What has happened to our move?  We were supposed to move yesterday, we're all packed up in boxes, and nobody seems to know what happened or when we are moving now.

Dan    

fyi, see note below... Rod, with your approval, I will pursue this for Danny's group after we get 41 cleared. 

Pam...
You are correct...the mock-up room has been disassembled.  We have one station of the new product set up on our floor, but as you noted, it is in the middle of our work area, and it would be disturbing to have people walking through all day.  What is the objective to walking people through?  Is it just for informative purposes?  If so, we might be able to arrange a group presentation at a later date.
Thanks!
Deborah

Is this possible right now? I'm not sure if/when you will have the furniture built-out and ready for viewing. Do you still have "the room" set up, or will you have a viewing area available, so people could look without having to go into someone's actual work space?  

As for Julie's proposed schedule for viewing... at the moment, Joan Lipuscek and I have more than we can handle just trying to get all the churn requests done for the next two weeks, so we really cannot commit to manning the room for the hour to show the furniture as suggested below. Do you have any suggestions as to the best way to handle? I defer to your judgement. Thanks for whatever you can do to help!

Pam:

Danny requested that we set up one day next week for the ETS employees to view the new furniture. A memo would be sent out to all ETS employees inviting them to come by and view the new furniture. 

Please advise the exact location of the room that showcases the furniture and Danny suggested that the assistants being on hand in the room (which I understand is now located on the 4th floor).  Danny suggested that we have a schedule with you, Joan and the assistants each covering one hour.  A hour coverage will not impact anyone's schedule and allow everyone an opportunity to view the furniture.  

I propose Tuesday, September 19th and the following schedule.  The assistants will be notified of the schedule once we confirm the date.

8:00 - 9:00	Joan Lipuscek
9:00 - 10:00	Audrey Robertson
10:00 - 11:00	Susan Wadle
11:00 - 12:00	Linda Wehring	
12:00 - 1:00	Julie Armstrong
1:00 - 2:00	Ricki Winters
2:00 - 3:00	Pilar Ramirez
3:00 - 4:00	Kathy Campos
4:00 - 5:00	 Pam Daily
	
Please contact me at x33597 if you have any questions.  Thank you.

Stan,
     Take a quick glance at this.

Energy Insight News for Thursday, September 20, 2001:

Expectations fall for Canada's natural gas 'frontier'

Canada's arctic north may not be North America's next big natural
gas-producing basin after all.=20

In what one geologist said was a "major, major" reduction in estimated
natural gas potential, the Canadian Gas Potential Committee-a volunteer
group of 50 geologists and other professionals who assess Canada's
undiscovered gas potential-last week reported that Canada's frontier basins=
,
which include the arctic and Mackenzie Delta regions, may hold no more than
60 to 65 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas that ultimately could make it to
market.=20

The new estimate falls short of previous estimates that 300 to 400 tcf of
gas could be found in the Beaufort Basin, the arctic islands and Mackenzie
corridor. It was those estimates that helped encourage geologists, producer=
s
and a number of U.S.-based power plant developers to consider the north as
almost a second Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). Gas from that
historically prolific yet now declining basin makes up around 15% of U.S.
imports.=20

"We thought the gas was greener," said Rob Woronuk, a senior analyst with
the Canadian Gas Potential Committee.=20

Still more potentially bad news came from the committee's report.=20

In what Woronuk said was an "embarrassment," the committee has now decided
that Canadian coalbed methane may have less of a role to play than was
previously thought.=20

The committee reversed the findings of its 1997 report that estimated
coalbed methane could account for up to 270 tcf of Canada's overall 570 tcf
natural gas resource.=20

Stan,
     The initial numbers from El Paso (as a Seller of their interest) would have equated to a 14 to 15x  EBITDA  with a valuation more in the range of $180m.  While we knew that they wouldn't be a buyer at that price, we expect that they would come in at $80-$90m.  They have yet to respond.  In the mean time, we are sitting on Deb's lowball (by her own admission) offer for two to three more days.

Dan

At 7 to 8 times EBITDA I think the valuations should be in the range of $85 to $100 million.  Both EOTT and NBP's have bought assets in this valuation range.

Attached are the EBITDA numbers for Trailblazer you requested this morning.

Eric,
    Julie has asked to take vacation on Friday, so we'll need Susan to cover phones, faxes, and general office business on Friday until 6:00 Eastern/ 5:00 Central.  Based on our efforts in Washington this week, Friday could be a very busy day.

Dan

Dan, Ken Rice suggested that I contact you directly after a conversation we
had. I will be leaving Texaco at the end of this month as a result of the
Chevron/Texaco merger and will be in the marketplace looking for
opportunities. I was talking to Ken about the idea of initiating a
consultative sales approach with NNG's customer base and selling Enron's
extensive portfolio of capabilities. In addition to that I have a business
opportunity that  provides a real time, web-based measurement technology
that may enhance operating capabilities and allow additional services. In
discussions with people at NNG that was an area of unexplored opportunity..
but I haven't gotten any resolution. I would appreciate a phone
conversation, if any of this sparks your interest. I talked to Julie and she
said you had received my resume from Ken and it was forwarded to Dave in
Omaha.  Thank you for your consideration. Fred M. 402-493-1113 (office)

Pat,
   Thanks.  I appreciate the input. Let me know if anything pertaining to the specific routing of the line begins to bubble up.

Dan

Danny -

Yesterday Senator Bingaman held a hearing in the Senate Energy Committee on the Alaska Natural Gas Pipeline.  The main items to come out of it were, (1) willingness of Bingaman and the committee to speed regulatory approval and (2) willingness to provide financial incentives for companies developing the pipeline.  They discussed routes but that's all they did.

I have press accounts and a copy of Pat Wood's testimony from yesterday if any of that is of interest to you.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Best,

Pat Shortridge

Greg,
    I have no interest for ETS.

As you know, we have an application in ENW called DealBench.  This application allows deal rooms, data rooms and auctions.  
 
ENW has done a complete review of this application and determined the following:
 
(1)  It is very difficult to build a successful, externally facing business based on the above lines of service in an ASP format.  Outside marketing to external clients for a fee was stopped in July 2001.
 
(2)  A change in the eCommerce landscape combined with Auctioning technology becoming a commodity makes it very difficult to sell the application and associated intellectual property.  ENW has approached 22 separate companies about a purchase of the software since April with no outright bids.
 
(3)  However, the auction and deal room functionality was used by many internal business units for a variety of reasons.  According to expected budgets and expected costs prior to events vs. actual results after auctions and deal rooms occurred, Enron business units realized approximately $8 million in value.  In the past, ENA has done 13 data rooms, EES did 2 live auctions, EBS did 3 live auctions, Corp. did 4 live auctions, tax did a deal room and NBPL did 2 auctions in addition to the small amount of business that was done by non-Enron clients.
 
Therefore, the question going forward is if several business units in Enron will take the application on an allocated or commitment to services basis for 2002.  The total estimated expense for the application (depreciation, ongoing technical and commercial support, etc.) is $2 million for 2002.  
 
If a representative of each business unit would get back to me with an answer soon, that would be great.  The application works well and has provided real value to Enron.  If there is not enough interest in it, I will discuss with Whalley what we do about potentially shutting it down.
 
Thanks.

Per your request, attached is the 2002 "Worry list for NNG Commercial.

 

- Fuel prices stay below Plan numbers and we can not hedge at a price even close to what is in the Plan as a base amount much less meet stretch.

-Basis spreads between East and West stay depressed causing the Mavrix and remaining Red Rock space to be valued at margins of $.00 to $.05 going West (also, the demand stays low out West because of weather).

-We can not renegotiate the ROFR contracts prior to expiration and we end up getting the capacity handed back to us in a depressed market.

Kim and John,
     I agree with Kim's second point.  I don't know how Ballentine's language works--there doesn't seem to be an offer and acceptance of anything specific.  I'd like to at least have a contract that has either been negotiated with the third party of the ability to negotiate it myself.  Can we clean this language up a little?

Dan

Thanks John.  For your convenience in reviewing the language, I have attached a redline copy that shows the changes that John made to our original language.  Regarding his changes:

1.	A big omission in his new section is the covenant  not to construct or cause to be constructed a natural gas pipeline within the right of way.  I thought that was a covenant we wanted.  If that is not the business deal, then the change is fine.
2.	I think a 10 business days is fine.  That being said, you usually don't indicate an acceptance of a right to match with the payment of the purchase offer.  We could submit a binding acceptance but I don't think we want to agree to pay the purchase price when all that Ballentine may put in front of us is a term sheet with the specifics of the deal to be negotiated.  I also don't think we want to go to the trouble of escrowing the money.  Maybe we could do an earnest money deposit but then we need to add language as to when we get it back.  (If you and Danny want to keep the submission of the purchase price, we need to include the language as to when we get the money back as well.)  The easiest fix for this deal is just saying we will submit a binding acceptance to their offer.

Let me know your thoughts.  Kim

 << File: right to match ballentine red.doc >> 

Here's John's response to the Right-to-Match language.  His client's main interest is in participating in the construction of new assets, which is the purpose of the last sentence.  This seems reasonable to me.  Dan suggested ten days response time, which John is agreeable to.  Please advise if we can work with this.

Kim, I believe I have the schedules, which I will fax to you for scanning.

Thanks,

John- try this on for size...I haven't vetted it on my end yet, but see how
you feel about it:

Section 4.06  Right to Match.
Buyer agrees that within one year of the Date of this Agreement if it
receives a bona fide offer (the "Purchase Offer") to acquire the right to
construct or to place into service natural gas and/or liquid pipelines
within the Company's right-of-way, Buyer will first, by written notice to
Seller, offer to Seller the right to construct or to place into service
natural gas and/or liquid pipelines within the Company's right-of-way on the
same terms and conditions as the Purchase Offer (the "ROFR Offer").  The
written notice provided by Buyer shall state (i) that Buyer has received the
Purchase Offer and intends to accept such Purchase Offer and (ii) the terms
and conditions of the Purchase Offer.  Seller shall have five (5) business
days from receipt of the ROFR Offer to indicate its willingness to match the
Purchase Offer by submitting by wire transfer to Buyer's designated bank
account the Purchase Offer in immediately available funds..  If Seller does
not indicate its willingness to match the Purchase Offer or does not respond
within five (5) days, then Buyer may consummate the transaction with the
counterparty, provided that the transaction consummated with counterparty is
on the same terms and conditions set forth in the ROFR Offer.  If the
transaction with counterparty is modified in any respect from that set forth
in the ROFR Offer, the modified terms and conditions shall be deemed to
constitute a new Purchase Offer and Seller shall be entitled to a new right
to match the Purchase Offer as set forth above in this Section 4.06.  In the
event that Seller matches the Purchase Offer by submitting funds to Buyers
designated bank account, Seller shall assume all other terms and conditions
of the Purchase Offer, including, but not limited to, any limitations,
restrictions or preferences of the selection of the construction company or
any other contractors normally associated with the construction, operation
and maintenance of gas and liquid pipelines.

ok

Dan,  I had drafted language which included both non-compete and right-to-match requirements for John's review.  John rejected the non-compete but accepted the right-to-match, which is ok with me.  I think the non-compete would be too much of an encumbrance and possibly a deal killer if we pushed for it.

Stan,
     The teleconference today (with TCPL) held nothing really new.  We did agree not to bring in any other third parties, such as El Paso, at this time.  TCPL noted that they would be interested in a roles as the developer (and perhaps as the operator or some or all of the new line), and would also expect to be responsible for all Canadian legal and regulatory matters.  They acknowledged that we have more expertise in the areas of US rates and regulatory and legal, finance, commercial and marketing activities and would expect that we take the lead there.  We are working toward a first cut on a JV structure over the next two weeks.

Dan

Danny,

I met with Phil Lowry, Jerry Martin, John Keller, and Kevin Hyatt to discuss the revised cost estimates for Sun Devil.  My blood pressure has eased somewhat.  I'm hopeful that the estimate will be revised downward to a level more consistent with the original by the end of the week.  The engineers want to make this project work and have taken some actions away to further squeeze the cost bundle.
  
Here's a quick recap-

$580 MM was the Total Project Excl. Int., O/H, etc. used for the open season.
$667 MM was the Total Project Incl. Int., O/H, etc used for the open season.
$912 MM is the latest Total Project Incl. Int, O/H, etc

The difference between $912 MM and $667 MM is $245 MM.  

Of this, $218 MM relates to-

-$65 MM for the Panda lateral (not in original scope)
-[$44] MM for 36" pipe vs 30" pipe (not in original scope).  This amount to be confirmed by the engineers.
-$48 MM for escalation (not broken out per se in the original scope)
-$33.2 MM additional cost for Navajo land acquisition
-$13.2 MM additional cost for Navajo labor on Navajo lands (not included in original estimate)
-$14.5 MM additional cost for gross receipts tax (not accounted for in the original scope)

We can reduce the estimate by $109 MM just by returning to the original project scope.  Panda will have to pay for the lateral to their plant.  We won't overbuild with 36" pipe to provide hourly swing capability unless shippers pay a higher rate (or we are content to hold excess capacity for future shippers). Some additional savings will accrue as a result of reducing the amount of compression (California shippers have shown no interest in paying anything close to full rate).  Finally, the engineers haven't given up on finding other potential savings.

The remaining $109 MM comes under the category of "identified risks".  Estimates are provided in current dollars and the "escalation" component highlights the risk of inflation.  The reality is that ETS has had very little recent experience pricing pipelines in the southwest.  The additional costs for Navajo land and labor can only be bottomed out through bilateral discussions with the Navajos.  I'm still checking the gross receipts tax cost - - - seems that it was not included in the original estimate, which is a bust.

No interest.

Please advise if you are interested or should I forward to Steve Hotte for consideration?

Danny,
CTN, a subsidiary of the SGA, is  seeking a corporate sponsor for the special security broadcast described  below.  We hope Enron will join other industry leaders as  a sponsor.  We would also welcome someone from you organization  on the program, should you wish.  Sponsors will enable us to make the  program available to companies as a web cast and to include more agency and  government presenters by using studios in D.C. 
Major sponsorships are available for this  broadcast at $15,000 and $25,000.  Host sponsorships are $2500.   Your sponsorship will enable you to receive the program down linked at  your office and be invited to the dinner with participating executives on  October 31.  
Please let me know who else I should  present this opportunity to at Enron.  We plan to send the initial news  release this Friday.  I will have additional content information after the  committee meets later this week.  
I attached the brochure from our Special  broadcast in October so you can see the type of publicity we will be  sending.  Our standard viewer reach is 100,000 employees.   Because of the nature of this broadcast, we expect the numbers to be much  higher.  Vicky Bailey or Joe Kelleher, Asst. Secretary, DOE have agreed to  be on the program, pending no significant changes in world  events.  FERC Commissioner Brownell and Andrew Lundquist from V.P.  Cheney's office have also expressed an  interest.

Shelley,
       I haven't seen any invitation list for Friday's Plan Review with Stan yet, but we are up at 10:00 and will go until 1:00.  I'd like you to be in through the whole thing if possible.  After that, do you think that you and I should walk through the whole plan with the key people in your group (and maybe Steve's)?  Give me a call if you haven't received the Plan handouts by tomorrow.  Thanks.

Shelley,
       I was thinking just revenue, but we can just as easily do O&M, too.  Which would you prefer? 
Dan  

I'll be at the meeting Friday.  Caroline tells me that it is strictly a revenue review - no O&M.   Do you want to go over just revenue with my team or both revenue/O&M?

A development out of Washington today was Daschle's instruction to
Bingaman to take energy legislation directly to the floor of the Senate
and bypass the mark-up process in the Committee. Although this doubtless

primarily driven by ANWR dynamics, we do not know whether any Alaskan
gas line legislation is to be part of a Bingaman bill or not. It does
underscore the need to make a vigorous representation to the Senators
from our re-enlistment group. I'd appreciate that you can provide a
response to my email from yesterday containing a draft letter from
ANNGTC/Foothills on behalf of the re-enlisting partners. I'll be in my
office throughout the day . So look forward to your help.

Danny,

I am sending you our latest presentation.  I am very disturbed by yesterday's events, I knew many traders that worked between WTC and WFC--yet I realize that our work has to continue.  I don't know if you will be flying with Mark this week, at any case you now have the latest version of our business concept.

We wouldn't.  I'll talk with Kim.

Why would we be buying this as TW?

Attached is a NON BINDING letter of interest to Questar for their Southern Trail Pipeline - west leg.  This is their crude pipeline that was purchased with the intention of converting it to a natural gas line but apparently, their interests have changed.  The west leg runs from near the California border to Long Beach.

The importance of this non binding bid is to get us into the data room so that we can really take a close look and gather information to see how interested we really are in this pipe.

Please let me know if you have any comments.  This letter has gone through legal and will be faxed to Questar today.

Mr. D. McCarty
Managing Director and Chief Commercial Officer
Enron Corp.

Dear Mr. McCarty,

I am writing on behalf of the Mackenzie Delta Explorers Group who are a
group of seven E&P companies with current and proposed exploration
activities in the Mackenzie Delta area. The member companies include
Anadarko Canada Corporation, Alberta Energy Company, Anderson
Exploration/Devon, Burlington Resources Canada Energy Ltd, BP Canada Energy
Company, Chevron Canada Resources and Petro-Canada Oil and Gas.

We are assessing alternatives to transport natural gas from the Delta to
southern markets and will soon be engaging in a feasibility engineering
design study to assess routing,  construction techniques, optimum sizing,
pressure requirements, capital and operating costs, liquids handling,
gathering systems, environmental considerations and other relevant design
parameters.

We are contacting potential strategic alliance partners in the pipeline
arena to determine the level of interest of  participating in the study
and/or contributing information to the Feasibility exercise.

If you require more information and wish to discuss this in more detail,
please fell free to contact me (403-296-4824) or Rod Maier (Chevron Canada
Resources 403-234-5433).

Thanks for your consideration.

Eric,
      FYI, I had my Assistant look back through call logs for the past ten weeks--John never called once.  I called him yesterday and left him a lengthy message and received no return call.  I called again today and received no return call.  You may have a good relationship with these guys, but I think that John may be a bit flaky and would question his veracity.  I'll try one more time, then I'll call it quits.

Dan

Rod,
      This would be preferable, but I don't understand what rules could be =
changed to alter the existing accounting treatment.  Also, Kent's numbers d=
o not decline over the suggested ten year life of the project, and I'd bet =
that the injection and withdrawal rates decline just like they did after th=
e project was initially developed.  The other thing to keep in mind is that=
 there will be no long term contracts securing the anticipated cash flow.  =
We will be relying on our storage desk to secure margins in the short term =
market (which is the only way to do high injection/high withdrawal storage =
to capture short term market anomalies).  Are you okay with that?  I am.

Dan

Maybe there is a way to skin this cat.     The service fee can have any num=
ber of scheduled payments, and have any life we need (or can get the other =
party to agree to) and that way we maybe able to pay them up front (non-fin=
anced) and amortize the amount to be paid over the life of the deal.     Do=
n't take my word as gospel since accounting rules are changing as we speak,=
 we need to get Jim to give us the parameters we would need in order to pas=
s the audit.=20

I have not been included in discussions of this transaction. FYI, to me, a =
prepayment for a service contract would generally be amortized over the lif=
e of the contract.

I do see that Bob was referenced in Dave's response.=20
Bob - comments?

I would appear to me that there may be some misconceptions here.     Why do=
 we assume that by entering into a financing deal we will be any better off=
?  I would tell you that to the extent there was any risk in the deal, that=
 we should probably charge someone else about 25-30% as well.     Think abo=
ut it, 25% is only 15% after tax.   Has some one enumerated the risks and v=
alued them on this deal?   I haven't seen any of that work, if it has been =
done.        =20

I think I understand the concept proposed and I understand the proposed goa=
l line, return with little or no expense up front.     I would assume that =
we would be willing to enter into a fixed price service agreement for a num=
ber of years?     Is Halliburton willing to take any risks whatsoever?

Alternatively, why don't we go through GSS (Global Strategic Sourcing) to l=
ook for a better deal?=09

Jim:   Have you looked at this for ideas on the accounting side?    Why can=
't I do a prepayment of a service contract fee and recognize the expense ov=
er the life of the deal?

Rod,

Below is some background on the Redfield Deliverability Project.

Halliburton initiated the contact with NNG to provide work over on selected=
 wells based on software modeling in order to return deliverability to thei=
r original levels.  The work overs are planned over a 2-3 year period and a=
re expected to have a lasting effect of at least 10 years.  The cost to mod=
el and rework these wells is estimated to be $5.73MM.  A test program would=
 be conducted in the first year to determine the feasibility of continuing =
the program at a cost of $768,000.  If the test program did not prove out t=
he project would be terminated at this point.  The original proposal was to=
 treat the costs of the program as expense as the costs were incurred. Bob =
Chandler confirmed this accounting treatment.  This would result as Kent ha=
s indicated negative EBIT for the first 2-3 years.=20

As an alternative it was proposed to Halliburton that NNG would enter into =
a 10 year service agreement with Halliburton to model and rework the wells =
and provide guidance on proposed well work overs for the Redfield storage f=
ield.  Halliburton would agree to perform the test program and if test resu=
lts indicate that further work overs would be economically feasible would s=
pend an additional $4.96MM on a total of 60 well workovers in the first 3 y=
ears of the contract.  NNG currently budgets $300,000 per year for Redfield=
 well maintenance with minimal increase in deliverability. Operations has c=
ommitted $300,000 per year in well maintenance over the next 5 years to thi=
s project for a total of $1.5MM.

Halliburton has not formalized their counter offer, but has indicated that =
they would require a 25% to 30% return for assuming the financing.  Hallibu=
rton indicated that this is a non-standard deal for them and that is the re=
ason for high return requirement. =20

The objective is to structure the deal as a service agreement either with a=
n Enron Entity who would then contract with Halliburton or some other third=
 party at a more reasonable rate.  Even at an estimated 30% return, prelimi=
nary incremental EBIT estimates for the Halliburton service agreement are b=
etween $400,000 to $500,000 the first 5 years and  $250,00 to $275,000 for =
the out years. =20

Couple of quick comments.    Prepaying as an expense would require coming u=
p with some income to offset, and generally doesn't make economic sense.   =
An Enron company can't help because it consolidates, and therefore ends up =
with the same accounting results as we do.       What accountants have revi=
ewed the proposal?

Rod,

We looking for your help on some ideas on how to implement a good long term=
 project that has negative short term cash flow.

We have been working with Halliburton to identify deliverability improvemen=
ts at Redfield through the use of  improved technology related to identifyi=
ng poor performing wells and implementing down hole remediation.  This proj=
ect has costs and revenues as shown below that are great from a long term s=
tandpoint.  Steve Thomas and Maurice Gilbert have done an excellent job of =
identifying the benefits to NNG and the upsides in revenue that are expecte=
d.  Dave Waymire has also been very helpful in analyzing alternative and ec=
onomics and have shown that the project has a great return (in excess of 30=
%).  Our problem is that the cost for the workovers at Redfield are all O&M=
 expenses and not capital and we have a negative IBIT for the first 2 - 3 y=
ears of the project.  We have proposed that Halliburton structure the expen=
ses such that they come in over a 5 - 10 year period so we don't have this =
negative IBIT flow in the first years, however, Halliburton has not been in=
terested and has proposed a 30% finance charge for this structure.

What would be the appetite for possibly pre-paying a majority of these cost=
s in '01 to avoid the negative '02 and '03 earnings impact or is there an E=
nron company that would finance/extend the expense payments.  This is a gre=
at project that we should do, however, it is difficult given the negative e=
arnings impacts in the first couple of years.  Got any ideas to handle this=
 financial hurdle??????

Martha,
      Would you drop me a quick note and update me on your progress?  Is there anything that you need to be doing at this point?  Also give me your general feel for the market's receptiveness to date, the caliber of Luminent's staff, and how the relationship is going so far.  
       If you have some available time next week, call Julie and get on my calendar.  Thanks.

Dan

Janet,
       I'd like you to talk with Rafael if you have time.  He's at Columbia on an Enron loan through the Associate Pool.  He worked for Eric Gonzales in Spain and for me in EES Europe.  He's a very bright guy and would add a lot of value where ever he lands.

Dan

Hello Danny-

I wanted to contact you as I am finishing the recruiting process out of
Columbia.  As you know, I am very interested in returning to Enron after
graduation (this May) and am in the process of getting back up to speed
on the different business units. Therefore, I am planning on making a
visit to Houston in November (tentatively 7th-9th).

I would be very interested in gaining your insight on which areas might
be a good fit and would appreciate any time you may have to discuss.
Please let me know if you would be available to meet with me sometime
during these days.  Thanks.

Best regards,

Rafael Rizo-Patron

Janet,
      Yes, he will be returning as an Associate.  I don't think that Billy is coordinating this trip, but I'll check.

Is he returning as an Associate? Is Billy Lemmons coordinating his trip?

design study to assess routing,  construction techniques, optimum sizing,
pressure requirements, capital and operating costs, liquids handling,
gathering systems, environmental considerations and other relevant design
parameters.

We are contacting potential strategic alliance partners in the pipeline
arena to determine the level of interest of  participating in the study
and/or contributing information to the Feasibility exercise.

If you require more information and wish to discuss this in more detail,
please fell free to contact me (403-296-4824) or Rod Maier (Chevron Canada
Resources 403-234-5433).

Thanks for your consideration.

Mark your calendar.  The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, Nov. 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things on the horizon.  Please join me at this year's conference to plan our strategy and success for the new year and beyond.  

Watch for an agenda and registration information in the next few weeks.  I look forward to a good meeting and to seeing you there.

Regards,
Ken Lay

Mark, 
     I hate losing Steve, but the most important thing is keeping him here.  As you know, he was an EDS employee assigned to Enron until about 1999.  As such, he didn't receive all of the equity upsides that his counterparts did.  I know a lot of people  have, and will continue to, make runs at Steve.  So do what you can to keep him a happy Enron employee.  Thanks.

Steve,
      I'd like to get one of the blackberry wireless handhelds.  How can I get one?
Dan

Eric,
    Should I call Dennis, will he call me, or is he satisfied that he can't always pull the string and get a prize?

Dan

Danny,

Here's a quick summary of the bullets I discussed with Dennis.  He was not happy about the last one, in particular.

Liability issues are overwhelming - - - GP role is just not feasible until residual claims go away.
We are prepared to exchange our residual claims for AFUDC + interest accruals for the right to become a 9.4% GP at some later date, say commencement of construction or time of certificate.
We want the partnership to make an all out effort to recover historic capital contributions either in rates or as an amortizable asset; likewise, we recognize that AFUDC and interest accruals are sunk.
If we don't rejoin as a GP, we will walk away from AFUDC and interest accruals but want to be reimbursed historic capital contribution.
Not comfortable with making any collective response to Sen. Murkowski.  We will make our own.

Eric,
     I thought we were moving towards limiting the reference to the Withdrawn Partners solely to the attempt to reconstitute the old Partnership, by a simple modification to Paragraph 1.  I think it's still pretty fuzzy, don't you?  What was wrong with Duke's proposed changes?

Dan

Mary Kay,
       The decision couldn't have been better if we had written it ourselves---another BIG success to add to your 2001 list.

Dan

Drew and Steve,
      Since our negotiated rates came out so well, is that an indication that the SoCal dispute is probably a slam dunk as well??
Dan
      

John,
    Stan Babiuk of El Paso called again to express their interest in buying Sunniland.  How sure are you that this deal will happen?

What about our move????

Pam,
     I don't see why the clearing of 41 is a prerequisite.  Let's just get it moved from 4th to where ever so people can see it.  I've got a whole floor of people apprehensive about the move and wasting time talking about what the working enviornment might be like when we finally move back. We've got enough to worry about, this isn't worth the noise.  If people just see it, they will understand that this is not going to be a minimum footprint sardine pack, and any noise will stop. 
     When can we expect it to be available for viewing.  Do you want me to have Julie arrange it with Claudia?
     Also, What has happened to our move?  We were supposed to move yesterday, we're all packed up in boxes, and nobody seems to know what happened or when we are moving now.

Dan    

fyi, see note below... Rod, with your approval, I will pursue this for Danny's group after we get 41 cleared. 

Pam...
You are correct...the mock-up room has been disassembled.  We have one station of the new product set up on our floor, but as you noted, it is in the middle of our work area, and it would be disturbing to have people walking through all day.  What is the objective to walking people through?  Is it just for informative purposes?  If so, we might be able to arrange a group presentation at a later date.
Thanks!
Deborah

Is this possible right now? I'm not sure if/when you will have the furniture built-out and ready for viewing. Do you still have "the room" set up, or will you have a viewing area available, so people could look without having to go into someone's actual work space?  

As for Julie's proposed schedule for viewing... at the moment, Joan Lipuscek and I have more than we can handle just trying to get all the churn requests done for the next two weeks, so we really cannot commit to manning the room for the hour to show the furniture as suggested below. Do you have any suggestions as to the best way to handle? I defer to your judgement. Thanks for whatever you can do to help!

Pam:

Danny requested that we set up one day next week for the ETS employees to view the new furniture. A memo would be sent out to all ETS employees inviting them to come by and view the new furniture. 

Please advise the exact location of the room that showcases the furniture and Danny suggested that the assistants being on hand in the room (which I understand is now located on the 4th floor).  Danny suggested that we have a schedule with you, Joan and the assistants each covering one hour.  A hour coverage will not impact anyone's schedule and allow everyone an opportunity to view the furniture.  

I propose Tuesday, September 19th and the following schedule.  The assistants will be notified of the schedule once we confirm the date.

8:00 - 9:00	Joan Lipuscek
9:00 - 10:00	Audrey Robertson
10:00 - 11:00	Susan Wadle
11:00 - 12:00	Linda Wehring	
12:00 - 1:00	Julie Armstrong

I would like to recommend a Personal Achievement Award for Audrey Robertson in the amount of $1000. Audrey has done a tremendous job the last several months in helping support several other groups in addition to her normal job duties. She has put forth a significant effort in performing administrative duties for the ETS Business Development and Facility Planning departments. Audrey has gone out of her way to provide daily assistance to these groups and I have received several notes indicating her exemplary performance. In addition, she helped coordinate the move for several groups to our new floors as well as plan a major customer meeting which had to be cancelled but was done in a manner resulting in no financial cost to Transwestern (saving us thousands of dollars).   

If you are in agreement with this recommendation please forward this note to Brian Schaffer in HR with your approval. Thanks.

With the last two incidents being so close occurring within one week our Market Services Group has been worked to the limit.

Guys,

Attached is a resume for a guy I know via technology and a very old parental 
friendship.  He is a very aggressive guy and marketer type.  He has the 
personality to be an originator or mid-marketer.  He would pound the phones.

Follow up if you want to talk with him.

I am going to forward on to technology guys too but wanted to give you first 
crack.

Mike
Hello Mike,

It has been a while since my last communication with you. I hope all is well.

I want you to know that I greatly appreciated you helping me get in touch 
with Ken Rice and all of the other folks at EBS last year. We made great 
strides and came very close to doing a deal between our organizations. 
However, Comdisco recently has come under some financial duress and is most 
likely going to be sold off in pieces.

I have been talking with some of the folks within EBS about the possibility 
of an origination position with their group. However, I am of the opinion 
that EBS is slightly ahead of the market, and therefore the timing may not be 
right for me to consider an origination position with EBS.

With that being said, I would be very interested in exploring what 
opportunities might exist within your Global Markets group from an 
origination standpoint. As you know, I am professionally aggressive, mentally 
tough and fearless of contacting potential clients. I have solid experience 
in professional selling, possess excellent communication and entrepreneurial 
skills.

Mike please consider the attached resume below. I would welcome the 
opportunity to meet with you or the appropriate person within your 
organization at any time.

Thanks again, and I hope to hear from you.

additions,comments and corrections and return it via a word document on 
email.  Once i receive comments from all the individual business heads then 
I'll ciculate again for final review and commentary.

Mike

Ken,

Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the 
Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for 
an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within 
EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we 
expect about 500 people.  

We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of 
these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have 
come in a few months.  

I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had 
a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they 
made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone 
we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.

If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way 
in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now 
core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.

Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information 
or assistance.

Mike 

I'm in.  We'll get started in a couple of months.  Hopefully no sooner!  
Thanks,
mike

I'm in.

Mike, 
In the interest of time, I'd like to call Eric Gonzales directly.  Please, 
would you make an introduction.  My company description is below.  We've 
covered the LNG industry for over ten years and have some ideas that fit with 
Enron's trading strategy.
Thanks,

Mike, 
Know you're extremely busy -- Suzanne tells me positions at rarified heights 
are driven by the need for crisis intervention. Members of your LNG team tell 
me that Eric Gonzales is coming to Houston to lead Western Hemispheric 
activities.  Maybe the three of us could meet for breakfast somewhere close 
to your offices.
Let me know a convenient time and date.

Mike: 
Understand LNG continues to be an enigma cloaked in a mystery for Enron.  We 
are continuing to expand our coverage and knowledge base of this marketplace, 
especially in the Western Hemisphere and would like to meet with you to 
discuss our observations and learn more about Enron's desires in this arena.  
Also, we have a meeting planned in D.C. in late June, entitled "LNG's Role in 
North American & Caribbean Gas Supply."  With the U.S. hunger for gas and El 
Paso, AEC and other's announcements of new projects, the meeting should be 
constructive, especially with DOE and FERC involvement.  See summary below.
Let me know when you might be available to discuss the LNG marketplace.

*********************************** 
TITLE:  LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean Gas Supply 
DATE/LOCATION:  Washington D.C., June 27-29 
SUMMARY:  The winter of 2000/2001 confirmed the shift in the United States 
from a buyer's to a seller's market. Gas supplies for North America ran short 
as demand rose from colder weather, higher electricity demand and shortages 
in storage from the previous year.  More and more supply is shifting from the 
U.S. Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of 
Mexico has proven disappointing.  U.S. demand for power generation is 
expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of 2001, siphoning off 
gas that would have been destined for storage.  
Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the 1980s, drilling rigs and 
experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred.  The 
current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near 
full capacity at just over 600 rigs, so the industry is constrained on how 
quickly it can recover.  
The U.S. has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the 
1970s and early 1980s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas 
in 10 years.  Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from 
North Africa (Algeria).  These terminals are capable of supplying up to 5% of 
total U.S. gas consumption (about one trillion cubic feet per year).  Plans 
are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of 2002; 
however, more are needed.  
Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United 
States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived 
to be unsightly or dangerous.  Now, El Paso (a company that was burned by 
Congress in the 1980s by the ruling that take-or-pay LNG contracts with 
Algeria were invalid) is challenging conventional wisdom. They have announced 
plans for six new terminals to be built in North America: three in the United 
States and three in Mexico.    New LNG plants in Venezuela, Algeria and 
Northern Australia might supply these terminals. 
Other companies, such as Enron and AEC, have announced plans to build 
terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production 
(IPP) plants ranging from 400 to 1000 megawatts.  Moreover, LNG facilities on 
Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via 
undersea pipeline and cable.  Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer 
a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and 
community concern.  
The June 27-29 conference, entitled "LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean 
Gas Supply," will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas 
supply shortages, how long they are expected to last, and what source of 
natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand.  The 
conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG, including the capacities 
and timing of current terminals, the prospects for new mainland and offshore 
terminals, and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the 
Caribbean, including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to 
the United States.

Virginia,

Thanks for the emails.  No interest in the above or the miro.  I am actively 
looking for a Pierre Bonnard lithograph, in color and signed.  Also looking 
for Lautrec but probably after Bonnard.  I will want to see numerous examples 
before I choose the Lautrec that we want.

If you have any Bonnards,  please let me know and send a copy of the image.

Mike

Per, I need a copy of the signature pages for all the signed dashes.  I want 
them for my files.
Thanks,
m

Louise,

You're very welcome.  It is always a pleasure to celebrate this blessed 
event.  This  is a truly special time in your life and I hope you and Marcus 
can relax and enjoy it.  This event will change your life and bring you true 
joy.  I remember the birth of our children like it was yesterday.  Simply 
writing this makes me feel great and my thoughts and prayers will be with you 
during this wonderful time.

Remember work will always be waiting for you;  this is what is truly 
important.

Sincerely,
Mike

Ron, I met with him today and steered him in a couple of directions.  He is a 
very sharp guy and he should be able to find a commercial home somewhere in 
the near future.   I'll let you know after he talks about opportunities with 
various groups around EGM.
Thanks,
m

Bob, 

He is now in town (he arrived on Monday).  Please call and leave him a 
voicemail.  We will meet with you.

Doug, other than the worst greens of all time, i was very impressed with the 
course.  The layout of the front nine was outstanding.  10,11,13 were long 
and hard.  We shot 6 under and had a great time.  I bought a new odyssey 
putter and love it.

You guys did a nice job on the course.

mike

   
	
	

I understand from Battaglia you played Memorial Park the other day. Other 
than the terrible greens, did you enjoy it? 

Mike McConnell has been out of the office traveling on business and he asked 
me to respond to your message on his behalf.  Mike asked me to pass along his 
sincere thanks for your message and for the invitation, however, he moved out 
of Enron Net Works and the technology area of Enron effective last August and 
is no longer involved in that area of the business.  

Please note that by way of this message, I am sending a copy to Philippe 
Bibi, CEO, Enron Net Works.  You may contact Philippe if you are interested 
in obtaining a speaker from the technology area of Enron.  

Thank you again.

Cathy Phillips for
Mike McConnell

Mr. McConnell,

I am a Management Information Systems professor at the University of
Oklahoma.  I heard you speak about EnronOnline approximately a year ago
during one of your visits to the University of Oklahoma.  I was captivated
by your talk and continue to be impressed with EnronOnline's success in the
world of e-business.

With this email I am inviting you to serve on a panel that I am assembling
for the International Conference on Information Systems (ICIS) in New
Orleans, Louisiana on December 16-19, 2001.   ICIS is the premiere
conference for IS academicians and is described at
http://isds.bus.lsu.edu/icis2001/ Approximately 1200 IS researchers and
professors from around the world, as well as IS practitioners, are expected
to attend this year's conference. Thus, this conference has a very broad
reach within the IS academic community. The panel would be a wonderful venue
to share with the IS research and teaching community the e-business inroads
that EnronOnline is making.  

The topic of the panel would be to explore your projections and that of the
other panelists about how electronic exchanges may morph over the next five
years.  You would also be asked to describe the business model used by
EnronOnline, and talk about factors promoting its success and issues
warranting attention for its future growth. 

The other three panelists would be myself, Arun Rai (Professor at the
eCommerce Institute at Georgia State University), and Marshall McGraw
(Business Services Manager for Information & Technology Services at Phillips
Petroleum).  The panel would last approximately 11/2 hours, but I would not
know the specific day (i.e., Dec 17th, 18th or the morning of Dec 19th)
until early Fall.

I would like to call you and talk with you about your interest in serving on
the panel.  I will call you on Monday (after you have had some time to
recover from your latest trip to Norman).

Sincerely,

Carol Saunders

Mr. Steimer -

Mike McConnell has been on several trips over the last few weeks and he has 
asked me to contact you on his behalf.  He asked me to pass along his 
sincerest apologies for not getting back to you on your invitation sooner.  
Due to his heavy travel schedule, he is unavailable to attend the Shell 
Houston Open.

However, Mike asked that I pass along to you my phone and e-mail information 
so that you may contact me to schedule the meeting to discuss LNG projects.  
My e-mail address is cathy.phillips@enron.com and my phone number is 
713-853-6898.  Please feel free to contact me at your convenience.

Thank you.

Dear Mr. McConnell,

Bob Lewis and I would like to met with you to discuss Enron's developing
LNG projects, and how CB&I can assist with your efforts.

Bob is Senior VP Sales, and is CB&I's corporate sponsor for Enron.  I am
directly responsible for working with Enron on LNG projects.

As you may know, CB&I recently purchased the assets of PDM Engineered
Construction, who designed and constructed          the EcoElectrica LNG
Import Facility.  CB&I is currently constructing the AES regas terminal, in
the Dominican Republic, among other ongoing LNG projects.

CB&I is very interested in working with Enron on such projects, in
particular the Jose, Venezuela, and Bahamas projects, as well as others you
are considering.

Are you available to meet with us over lunch on Monday April 9?  Alternates
dates for us are Tuesday April 10 and Friday April 13.  Hopefully we can
get together with you on one of those dates.

Please advise your availability.

Thanks and regards,

Jeff Steimer
Vice President, LNG Sales
CB&I

Im fine with it.

Jeff and Mike,

Some of our employees in NY have asked whether we would be offering the same 
Health Club reimbursement as what Enron Metals offers in NY.

Ultimately, it is a business cost, not an HR decision.  Metals reimburses up 
to $500/year which seems very reasonable.

I think it would be good to offer this to even the playing field with Houston 
based employees.

Thanks,
Shanna

Ted, 

Howdy from Houston.  I didn't see the article but please fax me a copy of the 
piece if you have one.  Fax# is 713 853 1922.

I will make myself available after class to meet with whoever you want me to 
meet with.  Sorry I cant stay for the meeting, i really wanted to.

I will need a student to take me to the airport on Friday morning but don't 
need one on Thursday.

Do you want me to have breakfast or meet with the new dean?

Thanks and see you soon.

fyi--per our discussion about Lotus Notes and how to use the Out of Office 
feature when you are traveling.

Click on the Actions icon at the top of the page and a list will appear. 
Scroll down to Mail Tools which will bring up another list. Then scroll down 
to the last item which is Out of Office. This will lead you to a page which 
will allow you to put in your departure and return dates and any message you 
wish to send to anyone that emails you during your absence. When you return 
you simply go to the Out of Office page and disable the message. For 
subsequent use you just plug in your new travel dates. 

I am interested in the online version.  My login id is:  mmccon1

Mike,  it is going to take a long time for the frustration to subside from 
this one.  It would be one thing to lose fair and square.  It was quite 
another to simply be "mugged"  (the word used by Jonathan Sumption).  Even 
worse, Pollack (your old friend) was overheard to say that it was a joke the 
way Enron got "stitched up".  Makes you feel a bit like you are in a kangaroo 
court.  One read of the opnion will bring tears to your eyes when they talk 
about "what the parties really intended" instead of what the contract says.  
The only route of appeal is to the Court of Human Rights (which right this 
minute I am feeling that mine have been violated) so it's a tough one.  
Anyway onward and upward to the broadband world (nothing's easy these days).  
Thank you for your words of comfort.  I must confess that in reality I am 
actually struggling to come to terms with this one (because we are right, of 
course), but in the end I must remember, this too shall pass.  Ciao.

   
	
	

Mary Nell,

I can't tell you how disturbed I was over this.  I can't imagine how you are 
feeling.  As I said in the voicemail it certainly is not a reflection on the 
teams efforts.  It speaks volumes about the UK and our independence!

No way to take this to the EU?

mike

Have it sent to me and I'll make sure it gets looked at.
cheers,

Shanna,

Please make this happen ASAP.  I thought he was done.

Also, I would like to see a list of all of our key people and their conctract 
expiration dates.  I believe you have that but I've not seen a copy.

Thanks,

Hi Mike.  The tournament was great to watch on tv, so it must have been
terrific to be there.  I feel badly for Duval.  He played his heart out and
Tiger gave him an opening, but he just couldn't convert.  I will definitely
let you know when I am next in Houston; it would be fun to hit the links
again together.  Similarly, if you are in New York and have some extra time,
please let me know.

Our email address at home is poling@optonline.net.   Jennifer told me that
she tried to email Chris a couple of days ago; I have given her your home
email again to make sure that she has the right address.
Doug,

The Masters was great and of course you were right, the course was
magnificent.  This is my 4th trip down and I'm going to try and not ever
miss the tournament (but of course I haven't played it!).  The azaleas were
not at max bloom, i think they were about a week away due to the cooler
weather.  What a great tournament.

Please give me a call next time you are in Houston and I'll set up a game
at Champions.  I am looking forward to the tour championship later this
year.

Give my best to Jennifer and Chris says hello.

Chris would like to email Jennifer, would you please send back your home
email address via return email?  Ours is mmccontex@aol.com.

Mike

The cat needs something.  
I had fun on the trip.  Jim is a good guy and I'll send you a copy of the 
pictures for him when i get them back.

Mike: 
Understand LNG continues to be an enigma cloaked in a mystery for Enron.  We 
are continuing to expand our coverage and knowledge base of this marketplace, 
especially in the Western Hemisphere and would like to meet with you to 
discuss our observations and learn more about Enron's desires in this arena.  
Also, we have a meeting planned in D.C. in late June, entitled "LNG's Role in 
North American & Caribbean Gas Supply."  With the U.S. hunger for gas and El 
Paso, AEC and other's announcements of new projects, the meeting should be 
constructive, especially with DOE and FERC involvement.  See summary below.
Let me know when you might be available to discuss the LNG marketplace.  
We've just completed a white paper, entitled "Atlantic-Basin LNG: A Whirling 
Supply/Demand Balance."  You may find our conclusions of interest.

*********************************** 
TITLE:  LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean Gas Supply 
DATE/LOCATION:  Washington D.C., June 27-29 
SUMMARY:  The winter of 2000/2001 confirmed the shift in the United States 
from a buyer's to a seller's market. Gas supplies for North America ran short 
as demand rose from colder weather, higher electricity demand and shortages 
in storage from the previous year.  More and more supply is shifting from the 
U.S. Gulf Coast to Western Canada as offshore exploration in the Gulf of 
Mexico has proven disappointing.  U.S. demand for power generation is 
expected to keep gas demand high through the summer of 2001, siphoning off 
gas that would have been destined for storage.  
Meanwhile during the long gas bubble of the 1980s, drilling rigs and 
experienced field personnel dwindled from thousands to several hundred.  The 
current rig count for North American gas exploration and production is near 
full capacity at just over 600 rigs, so the industry is constrained on how 
quickly it can recover.  
The U.S. has not experienced shortages of natural gas like this since the 
1970s and early 1980s when it was feared that the nation would run out of gas 
in 10 years.  Four LNG import terminals were built to supply natural gas from 
North Africa (Algeria).  These terminals are capable of supplying up to 5% of 
total U.S. gas consumption (about one trillion cubic feet per year).  Plans 
are underway to have all four terminals fully operational by the end of 2002; 
however, more are needed.  
Conventional wisdom is that no new terminals would be built in the United 
States due to EPA laws and local citizen protests to any facility perceived 
to be unsightly or dangerous.  Now, El Paso (a company that was burned by 
Congress in the 1980s by the ruling that take-or-pay LNG contracts with 
Algeria were invalid) is challenging conventional wisdom. They have announced 
plans for six new terminals to be built in North America: three in the United 
States and three in Mexico.    New LNG plants in Venezuela, Algeria and 
Northern Australia might supply these terminals. 
Other companies, such as Enron and AEC, have announced plans to build 
terminals in the Caribbean to supply gas to independent power production 
(IPP) plants ranging from 400 to 1000 megawatts.  Moreover, LNG facilities on 
Caribbean Islands close to Florida might export gas or electricity via 
undersea pipeline and cable.  Floating offshore LNG terminals may also offer 
a means to bring LNG into the United States with less environmental and 
community concern.  
The June 27-29 conference, entitled "LNG's Role in North American & Caribbean 
Gas Supply," will cover the dynamics that are leading to North American gas 
supply shortages, how long they are expected to last, and what source of 
natural gas are available from conventional sources to meet demand.  The 
conference will then focus on opportunities for LNG, including the capacities 
and timing of current terminals, the prospects for new mainland and offshore 
terminals, and the opportunity for broader terminal networks in the 
Caribbean, including those facilities that might supply gas or electricity to 
the United States.

Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS 
litigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties 
approximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final 
figure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the 
principal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take 
as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the part 
of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  The 
opinion seeks to conclude "what rational businessmen could have intended" 
rather than applying the provisions of the contract.  

For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear that 
the  "retrospective consequences" of discovering a latent defect after 
payments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are 
unacceptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow 
J-Block gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and 
therefore not entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says 
that the Commencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature 
of a declaration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.

As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines that 
the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  The 
contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that it 
is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the 
Transportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price 
reduction for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This 
statement is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the 
opinion that upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties 
have an absolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.

Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected our 
submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the 
restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue upon 
which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the point 
at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs should have 
been a given. 

Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, our 
other counsel have assessed the opinion as "appalling" and "pathetic," and 
describe the situation as one where Enron has been "stitched up".  
Unfortunately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country 
(except of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for 
recourse.

In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted or 
expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support from 
each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coaster 
ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence in 
fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it right. 

Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if 
you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207 
783 6582.  Many thanks.

Dorie,

Thanks for everything on the Masters trip.  I thought it went very well.

I enjoyed our shirt and sweater gift but i have a question.  I got a large 
sweater and need a medium.  Do you have a medium left?  I brought in the 
large to exchange.

Thanks,
Mike

Mary Nell,

feeling.  As I said in the voicemail it certainly is not a reflection on the

mike

Ron, 

I hope you had a good week.  I've thought a lot about your family and you've 
been in my prayers.  

I apologize for the delay in this email but i decided not to bother you with 
this while you were away.  As a follow-up to our conversation, the authors 
that have had the biggest influence on me and along the lines we discussed 
are:

Dr. Denis Waitley (The Psychology of Winning, How to Build your child's 
self-esteem, many others but I can't remember the titles)
Dr. Norman Vincent Peale (The Power of Positive Thinking)
Og Mandino (The Choice, The mission)
Dr. Wayne Dyer (many)
Anthony Robbins (Unlimited Power, Personal Power, many others)

Attached are a couple of the outlines I did.  To my extremee frustration I 
can't find some of the others that i did many years ago.  I got a lot out of 
all of these, usually a little from each and when you least expect it.  I am 
a great believer in the old saying, "When the student is ready the teacher 
will come".

As we discussed, the results of all of the hundreds of books and tapes have 
had a profound effect on me and my family.  A few direct tangible results 
include:  my extensive long and short term goal setting, affirmation 
collection (over 100 pages and growing), my family journal (80 pages and 
growing) .....

When you get a chance and things settle down, please give me a call or I can 
definitely find time for lunch.

Mike

Louise,
I thought you would want to see this since you were there during all of those 
times.

Hi Mike!

Any interest in teaching one class, April 16 or 18, 10:30-12noon at Wharton 
(Philadelphia)?  Please see details below.

Thanks!

--Christie.
Christie,

no problem.  The course is a MBA course on privatization.  We currently talk 
about project finance, and the idea was for Bill Gathman to talk about 
Enron's Dabhol project.  However, this could be substituted with a discussion 
of Enron's project finance activities in general, or with another project.  
There are 55 students in the course (48 MBAs in their first and second years, 
4 law school students in their 2nd year, and Ph.D. students in various 
years).  Dates are either 16 or 18 April, the class starts at 10:30 am and 
runs to noon.

Let me know if you need any additional information.  Thank you.  Felix

Hi Felix!

Sorry I have not yet had any luck.  However, I will give it one more try.
Would you please again give me the following:
course description, date, # and year of students?  Sorry for your
inconvenience...I'm really strapped for time, and this will be easier for
me than trying to relocate the information you've provided before.

Thanks!

--Christie.
Hi Christie,

I was wondering if you had any luck with finding a speaker for the
privatization course.

Thanks for your help with this.

Sent by: General Announcement@ENRON
Our vision to become The World's Leading Company positions our company for 
great success this year and beyond.  Our success is dependent on execution.  
With that in mind, we are making Enron's 2001 corporate and business unit 
goals available to employees.  

Please take a few minutes to review our 2001 goals on Enron's intranet at 
http://172.28.92.190/bowne/    We believe they will help you gain a better 
understanding of our vision for the company and will inspire you to identify 
innovative ways to help your organization and Enron achieve our objectives.  
We have a lot to accomplish this year, and with your hard work and 
dedication, we can realize another year of stellar performance.

All,

Attached is a presentation that I have put together to review EGM's 
activities.  The purpose is to provide an information package on our 
businesses for Senior mgt and Investor relations.  This will not be 
distributed externally but will education people on our businesses and some 
of our goals.

Please take a few minutes to briefly  review and make any comments and/or 
changes and fax  or provide a hard copy back to me.  You can send me copies 
of just the pages that have updates.  Also please focus on the map and insure 
that there are not mistakes ( i found some recently).  There is also a 
shorter version presentation that is more external and once I've updated 
both, i will send everyone a copy via email for your reference and use.

Thanks,

Attached for your review is a resume for Trevor Woods.  He worked for me in 2 
areas,  including directly for me in Technology.  He is outstanding and left 
enron to join his brother in law in a start up out in San Francisco.  He was 
an associate at the time.  He is interested in coming back and is talking 
with many areas of enron for positions.  His girlfriend, Julie Ferrara, is in 
Net Works and may becoming to London as an assignment.  If she does, he would 
really like to come as well - if it is possible.  I didn't know if you have a 
need but he is great and would make an excellent Jr. commercial guy in an 
origination type of role.  

I wanted you to have shot at him as well.

Mike and Eric,

Informally I was told today that the new President of PDVSA Gas will be 
Nelson Nava, this is very good news for us since he has been a very strong 
supporter of the project for a long time. We have a solid relationship with 
Nelson, so I believe he could be a good sponsor for our project. More 
importantly, we will not have to educate Nelson about the project. Just in 
case you don't remember, we all met him when we visisted PDVSA-Gas earlier 
this years. The meeting in PDVSA-Gas was in his office.

Once it is official, it would be a very good idea for you Mike to call him to 
congratulate him. I will let you two know next week.

All,

Attached is a resume for Trevor Woods.  Trevor worked with me at HPL and 
directly for me in Technology.  He is outstanding and left to do the dot com 
thing with his brother-in-law who was CEO of this company.  He is interested 
to come back to Enron and is talking to various people around Enron.  He has 
offer opportunities at EBS and EES and has been talking with Billy Lemmons 
about ag.  Trevor is great and would be excellent in a Jr. commercial roll in 
an origination type of function.  

He is interested in moving pretty quickly and if you have an interest please 
contact him in the near future.  

Shanna can coordinate the times but i recommend him highly and he would be an 
asset to EGM.

I will be in Houston on 4th and 5th of April.  Matthew Scrimshaw suggested I 
look you up.
It would be great if you could spare me some time to discuss what we are 
trying to do at ETOL and how I might be able to link with what you do.
I have a pretty flexible programme on the 4th  with my return flight to the 
UK at 15:00 on 5th.
If you could suggest a time and your office locations I'd be most grateful.
Best regards
Neil

Thanks.  It was a great trip and one that will help lead to a lot of future 
benefits.  Thanks again for the ticket as well.

Do you have a brochure so that i can decide when I can take off and go on to 
other offices?
m

Doug,

Thanks for the email.  I am glad that you had a good meeting.  These guys are 
good and we are committed to this business.

I'll be at the Masters Wed - Fri.  Are you going to be there during those 
days?

Mike

Hi Mike.  As you may know, George brought his full team to our office today
to review certain operational issues in connection with our deal, and to
introduce key members of the team going forward.  It was very helpful to
meet the team members, and to understand a bit better how your coal group is
gearing up to be in a position to fulfill Enron's end of the deal once we
get the synfuel facility relocated and up and running.  There are a lot of
administrative and operational issues that AIG-FP, Enron and Aquila,
collectively, are going to have to work through between now and the
production start date to ensure that this deal gets off to as smooth a start
as possible, but this meeting was a good first step, and appreciated on our
end.

All,

I just talked with Andy Fastow and Brian Redmon.  We need to pass on him, 
they really didn't recommend him as I was led to believe.
Sorry,
Mike

I met w/ him a couple weeks ago.  Good guy w/ good overall experience but 
lacks any specific industry experience in crude/products/pet-chems.  I'm the 
one who referred him to you and Larry.

   
	
	

All,

Attached is some information on a guy that I just met with and is in 
re-deployment within Enron.  He is a finance guy by training, and has closed 
deals as an originator for EE&CC.  (He is not an EE&CC guy but was asked to 
go over there to help as an assignment)  Andy Fastow recommended that I see 
him.  I thought of your groups as a possible fit. 

He is out of redeployment on Friday and if you have an interest to talk to 
him I would lob in a quick call.

Virginia,

We didn't have any interest in the piece.   I am interested in the following 
lithos.  1. a signed Bonnard (no black and whites) and 2. a Toulouse LeTrec 
(awful spelling).  Let me know if you locate some choices on those two.

difficult to leave something without it being finished.  

I am happy for us.

Mike,

There are a number of opportunities that are presenting themselves in Japan 
that to prove successful will need some close cooperation between our group 
(also including metals) and global markets.  I am not implying that the 
relationship is not working, but as I will describe to you these 
opportunities are very large and I believe that we will need to ensure that a 
concerted effort is put forward.  I have briefly alluded to some of these 
with Jeff and with Gary (as he was in Japan last week) and they both seem 
interested.

Do you have a timeslot tomorrow where I can discuss these with you further?

John Ambler@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

Emilio,

In David's absence, Habiba has been in touch with Greg Grissom of the sports 
marketing group.  Greg has confirmed that the Astros have tentatively planned 
for President Chavez to throw out the first pitch on May 18.  We are 
exploring the possibility of a reception or other opportunity in cooperation 
with the Astros.  As you suggested, we'll also look into other potential 
contacts.  

I will be back in Houston on Thursday and Keith Miceli will be next Monday.  
Since it will likely take several weeks to flesh out the opportunities, I'd 
like to suggest that we limit e-mails to a work group of Habiba, Keith, Greg, 
you and me until we have more details to review with Mike and Eric.  If you 
are going to be in Houston during the next two weeks, I'd recommend that we 
meet.  In the interim, we will keep you apprised of further developments.     

John

Emilio Vicens
03/15/2001 02:30 PM
John and the rest of the team,
Here are some additional data points:
1. In a meeting between Jeff Skilling and President Chavez in late-2000 (I 
was in the meeting), Jeff invited Chavez to Enron Field as our guess. 
Obviously, Chavez was only visiting the city for a just hours and I believe 
the season started just a few days later. In any case, we have already done 
some previous lobby to get President Chavez to the Stadium. This may help 
whoever is managing the contant with the Astros (probably David T.).
I will probably not get much additional input from Caracas. Nevertheless, I 
strongly suggest that we position Enron as close as we can to this 
opportunity (we will later see if President Chavez actually make it to 
Houston);
2. In addition, in previous trips to Houston and in several ocassions, I 
believe Chavez has always met with George Bush senior and Mr. Mosbacher. I 
would not be surprised if he do it again. Probably your team can also target 
these efforts and keep the action at all fronts;
Please keep me informed. I would like to be involved as much as possible to 
move this ahead.
Emilio

John Ambler
03/14/2001 01:56 PM
Emilio,  

We would be very pleased to pursue this.  By copy of this message I am asking 
David Tagliarino, who heads the sports marketing group to get more 
information and opportunities through our contacts with the Astros and Enron 
Field.  I am in India and Keith Miceli, who covers South America for 
international public relations, is in Brazil.  While we are out of pocket, 
I'm asking Habiba Bayi, who directs PR support for EGM, to coordinate our 
involvement.  (Although international PR will manage meetings, functions, and 
general support/strategy for this, I also am copying Dennis Vegas since 
sports marketing reports into him.  As soon as they have information on the 
potential opportunities, we will get back to you with that information and a 
suggested program.  If your contacts in Venezuela yield additional details, 
please let us know.  Otherwise we will pursue it from this end and keep you 
apprised and involved in the decision making process.

John  

Emilio Vicens
03/13/2001 03:58 PM
Mike and Eric,

It was in the newspaper in Caracas today that Chavez is invited by the Astros 
(Drayton McLane) to be the guess of honor for the opening night. The Astros 
played some exhibition games in Venezuela last weekend.  This is obviously a 
wonderful opportunity for us to get closer to Chavez. Can we do something to 
be part of this activity with the Astros?, I copied John Ambler to see how we 
can coordinate the efforts from today. We should not miss this opportunity if 
it really happen!!

Emilio

Jonathan,

Thanks for the update.  Great to have you on board.  This job is going to be 
great.   I am looking forward to working with you again.

Mike

Jonathan Whitehead @ ENRON   03/15/2001 02:59 AM

Just thought I'd update the two of you with my plans. I am leaving Tokyo on 
the 21st March, and going to London for probably 10 days to get my US Visa 
done (Unfortunately cannot be done in the US). I will be working out of the 
London office from the end of next week 100% concentrated on LNG matters, as 
I have now wrapped up all of my Enron Japan handover.

Look forward to seeing the two of you in Houston in early April.

Jonathan

Steve Dumas <SDumas@westfield.com> on 03/19/2001 10:04:51 AM
Chris 
Here is a synopsis of what Mike and I talked about;
I will come up with 3 schemes and create 1/16th site/floor plans and a 3
dimensional rendering showing the form and massing. This conceptual phase
will take approximately 1 month and cost up to $1500 per scheme. After you
review them and have picked and chosen what you like from each, I will
develop ?" floor plans, sections and fa?ade elevations. This schematic
design phase will take approx. 6 weeks. I'll charge you $150 per hour and
depending on the scheme it will run from$3000 to $4500. After that point a
local architect can do the design development phase (which is a more
detailed look at the exterior and interior of the house and will probably
take 6-10 weeks) and the construction document phase (which will probably
take 3 months). I have several architects in mind and can contact them if
you'd like. The architect should also do construction supervision. I'm not
sure what architects charge there but it should run from 3 to 6 percent of
construction cost.
During this time I can look at any special rooms or cabinetry in more detail
and I'll charge you an hourly rate.
On large projects architects often work in this way, one designing and one
doing the working drawings. I recently worked on a house here for Craig and
Walter where I designed it and the working dwgs. were done in Chicago. I
hope this explains things.
PS Sorry this took so long but I started designing and already have one
scheme figured out.
Talk to you soon,
Steve

Hello Dr. Jacobs -

Mike asked me to follow up with you to pass along his schedule for his visit 
to OU in April.  Due to Mike's heavy schedule, he said that he plans to be 
there on Thursday for the lecture and he will be happy to join the group at 
The Mont following the lecture, but unfortunately he will need to return to 
Houston on Friday morning.  He asked me to pass along his regrets for being 
unable to attend the banquet on Friday evening and the Board meeting on 
Saturday.

I have contacted the Montford Inn to reserve a cottage for Mike, but they 
said they are booked.  They also said that they are holding 6 rooms for the 
OU Special Events group for April 19th.  If one of the six rooms is not being 
held for Mike, can you please suggest another hotel or inn.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  Thank you.

Cathy'/Mike.

Thanks for the prompt response and the quotes. I will certainly use one of
them and will use the picture we currently have of Mike on file in the
Penney's Leadership Program.

Mike, I think there might be several of the Board of Advisor members
attending your class on April 19th. Was wondering if you might consider
joining some of them for a beer at The Mont afterwards, since it appears you
will not be able to attend the Board of Advisors meeting on Saturday, April
21st. I know they would like to have the opportunity to meet and visit with
you.

Again, thanks for the promptness in getting back to me.

Hi -

Mike asked me to send you this message with the quotes that follow below.
Mike wanted me to pass along that he graduated from OU with a BBA in 1982.
His major was Petroleum Land Management with an emphasis on Law.  I have
attached the most recent copy of his bio for any additional information you
may need.

(See attached file: MSM BIO CEO EGM.doc)

Quotes:

"The Energy Management Program is the reason Enron began recruiting at OU.
The Program's course study reflects the changing energy business and gets
students prepared for tomorrow."

"The changes that have occurred in the creation of the Energy Management
Program is the primary reason Enron is recruiting at OU."

"The innovative Energy Management Program reflects the changes that are
occurring throughout the energy industry."

I hope this will help.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Darrell,

I attempted to call you a few minutes ago (late night your time - but there 
was no voicemail).  I didn't want to wait several more days before I contact 
you.  I'm out all weekend.

Eric shared with me some of your concerns about resources for a Korea LNG 
opportunity.  I certainly understand your view but wanted to share some of my 
thoughts.  Rick and/or Clay know the Asian LNG industry better than anyone 
else in the company.  They are very good and I have a lot of faith in them 
and their ability to assess opportunities and develop projects.  They are 
lacking wholesale type of transaction experience that a few of the guys that 
have recently come into the group have.  That is why we have brought them 
in.   We have a very strong team and i like the mix a lot.  

Eric is the person we chose to run the group for many reasons but it wasn't' 
done as a lack of faith in Rick or his original team.  The biggest 
opportunities and the viewpoint we must take in this business is running it 
like a wholesale unit and running it as a portfolio of transactions and 
books.  That certainly doesn't  mean that 20 years of experience doesn't have 
enormous value especially in the non-Atlantic markets.  Rick is in the 
process of coming back to Houston after the shut down of our middle east 
projects and strategy.  Rick is also in the process of assessing what exactly 
he would like to do in the time of transition.  My very sincere hope is that 
he will stay in the LNG group and perform a very important role especially in 
this type of development or deal making role.  Especially  in a big deal in 
Japan, Korea or something in the Asian area.  We will discuss this next week 
when he comes to town.  

I need Eric to be in Houston right now due to our Elba Island, Venezuela and 
Bahamas immediate activity.  He will certainly be engaged in everything but 
he can not be focuses as much as you need in Korea or Joe needs in Japan.

Please give me a call next week and we can discuss this in more detail.

Thanks,
mike

PS - Frevert also likes this role for Rick.  Also the Eric specific head role 
has not been officially announced yet.

Who is getting the e-mail messages for Cathy Phillips?

Bob, 

 I just tried to contact you but rolled to your voicemail which told me that 
your mailbox was full and it wouldn't let me leave a message.  The operator 
then sent me into a Nuevo message that stated that the office was closed.  
Sorry for my late return call but I've been running at full speed since 6:45 
am.  

Please call when you get a chance.  Also let me know via voicemail if this is 
urgent.

Mike

David,

Howdy.  Thanks for the email.  I agree he is a very sharp guy and does a 
great job.

I will be attending the Masters again this year.  I will be on our 2nd trip 
which is Wed - Friday.  We do normally have a very full agenda but if you'll 
leave me your information, I'll try to stop and say hello.

Thanks,
Mike

John,

I'm sorry I missed you before you went off to Dhabi.  I had difficult 
mornings while in town.  I'll call you next week to discuss the weather 
organization structure and the best way to move forward.

Have a good holiday.  I think you'll like the UAE. 

Mike

Peter,

Thanks for your voicemail and email.  Your resume is impressive and I have 2 
thoughts.  Most of our efforts in EGM are not asset related but I would 
suggest you contact 2 people:  Eric Gonzales for LNG activities and possible 
construction projects and Rick Bergseiker, Middle East and also co-heads LNG.

Thanks and good luck.

Mike

Dan, FYI. m
Good afternoon Mike,

My name is Chad Tipton.  I am currently a Development Support Manager with 
EES in the Integrated Asset Management (IAM).   Recently, I  had the good 
fortune to meet, Ron Hosmer.  He represents a company called IdleAire 
Technologies, Inc..  IdleAire is a startup company started in 1999.   
IdleAire has developed a system to eliminate truckdrivers from having to idle 
their trucks while on long haul overnight stops.  Their plan is to electrify 
truckstops and install remote HVAC units to eliminate truck idling.  Also, 
these units provide cable TV and internet services.  They have already 
piloted the technology in several truckstops in the Knoxville, TN area.

IdleAire's  goal is to: 

"........evolve the nation's truck stops and travel centers into the largest 
truck stop electrification network in the world. We are taking truck stop 
electrification to the next level. Our travel center conversions provide 
heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) at every parking space. We 
also provide drivers in-cab telephone, Internet and television."

Idle Air has caught the attention of many interest groups in Washington, 
D.C.  Ron tells me that they have already gained support from Tennessee 
congressmen, including Jimmy Duncan and  Van Hilleary.   Also, former House 
Speaker, Newt Gingrich is on the board of directors of IdleAire 
Technologies.  These individuals support this technology because it reduces 
emissions and helps state quality for CMAQ funds.  

I had mentioned to Ron, that I worked for Enron and informed him about what 
we do.  He and I both felt that Enron may be interested in developing a 
strategic partnership to take their technology to market.   Ron said that 
they are looking for a strategic partner with energy related experience and 
the capital to invest in this project.  

Enron would benefit in several ways:

1.  Greater than average returns.

2.  Increased publicity and recognition in Enron's environmental role.  (EPA 
Energy Star Label, EPA Climate Protection Award, etc....)
 
3.  Increase markets for electricity and possibly gas.

4.  Maintain Enron's title of innovation leader.

5.  Open a whole new market the energy services group. (EES)

I believe this opportunity is very synergistic with Enron's business model.  
If you would be interested in talking with Ron, I would be happy to introduce 
him to you.  They have a  very comprehensive business plan that lays out 
their business in detail.   I have arranged for him to provide us with an 
executive summary of the business.  You can also find out more about the 
company by visiting their website at:

www.idleaire.com

Thanks for your time.

Gentlemen, 

 Attached is a preliminary itinerary for our upcoming visit to Black Mountain 
Resources, Cline Resources, and The American Coal Company.

 We plan to leave George Bush Intercontinental Airport early on Wenesday, 
March 7 and return Thursday evening, March 8.  During the course of the 
visit, we will tour two underground coal mines, a preparation plant, and a 
new mine opening construction site.  You will also have the opportunity to 
meet the principals, Richard Gilliam of Black Mountain, Chris Cline of Cline 
Resources, and Bob Murray of the American Coal Company.

 Please review the attached, and let me know as soon as convenient the 
following information:

Coverall Size ( or suit jacket size)
Boot Size
Belt Size

 Plan to wear casual clothes (blue jeans) for the mine visits.  We are 
planning to have dinner with Chris Cline on March 7.  If you have any 
questions on the trip, let me know.

 Bill

George, what is that status of this?  Kinder hasn't called on this but 
probably will.  Let's discuss or leave me an email.
thanks,
m

   
	
	

I left you a voice mail regarding Sempra and Kinder Morgan.  Details as 
follows:

We will make a revised settlement offer to Sempra by the end of this week.  I 
doubt that Sempra will accept our offer.  If they fail to accept, we will 
head into a litigation track - which means no synfuel will be produced at 
Pier IX until the court decides on who wins the case.  We expect the case to 
go to court in the fourth quarter of this year.

As I previously advised, Kinder Morgan has been very patient with us during 
this process.  At some point in time we will have to address their claims, 
which by definition will have to go through us in order to reach Sempra.

Let me know if I can provide any additional information.

George

Eric,

A couple of high priority activities we need to address very quickly.
Run down of Nigeria deal (100/400 mmbtu/d)
Bahamas - Skilling update, acceleration of Corp effort, approvals
Elba - supply and managing t-o-p
Ven - Lay call, timing of Ven decision and game plan
R Bergseiker future and other EI people
Asia strategy and clarification
Current view of Long/Short via category of segment (shipping, physical, 
facilities)

I know you are on top of all of these items but Jeff and I want to run them 
down and get an update.

Thanks,
m

Cheryl,

Thanks for the update.  I like the progress.

I realize that we can not cover us 100% for the future contract but at least 
it will help.  What I think we need is some way to protect us incase he gives 
us a very high bid price to build the house  because we are captive.  What do 
you suggest as a possible remedy?  Some sort of checks on allowing others to 
bid?   Some sort of out on re-purchasing the lot at a set price?  Without a 
cost plus methodology we could be very vulnerable here.  What do you think?

A few of the other issues you addressed in the earlier fax.

2. Earnest money:  I like putting it in title company vs. Flair.  
3. Title policy:  Lets go ahead and take the additional coverage, I think it 
is prudent especially with the new subdivision. How much does an additional 
15% cost?  I don't have any idea.
4.  have provided
5.  not sure i understand this
6.  yes, delete 
7. definitely change and check b1 and hire an inspector
8. add in clarifying statement
9. agree to add builder obligation.  I am fine with a quick closing date and 
needs specificity.  Does he have an estimated time of completion?
10. Rollback taxes:  I agree, clarify as to the exemption, we need to be 
protected here.
11. add this to contract.  Flare may want the money but we should try it.

I hope this helps.  After you review and discuss these issues, let's get 
together via phone and discuss outstanding issues.  Please call Cathy 
Phillips with a time to talk.  She can be reached at 713 853-6898

Thanks,
m

Dear Mike:

On Friday, February 23, 2001 we received by fax a copy of the Residential
Construction Contract Mr. Kent intends on using in connection with the
construction of your home.  Upon receipt we noticed that it was not a Cost
Plus Contract.  Therefore, we spoke with him about this matter.  He
indicated that although he believes he will be doing the home on a cost plus
basis, no final agreement regarding this matter had yet been made.

The Residential Construction Contract form he uses is a Greater Houston
Builders Association form which is, for the most part, a good one although
it is written primarily to protect the builder.  Therefore, we may ask that
a number of minor changes be made to the Contract as it relates to notice
requirements to you regarding problems in construction and some changes in
the indemnity language.  In addition, there may be some other changes we
request.  Under any circumstance, we can dictate a letter to Mr. Kent at the
appropriate time.

Mr. Kent also indicated that he will make sure we receive a copy of the Deed
Restrictions as soon as possible.

We assume that you will acquire financing for the construction of the home
itself.  When you close, Flair Construction Co., Inc. will also have to
provide to you a Disclosure Statement which spells out some of your rights
and responsibilities under Texas law and a Contractors List of
Subcontractors and Suppliers which tells you the names and addresses of the
Subcontractors Flair intends on using.  We are sure that the construction
lender will require that these documents be provided at the appropriate
time.

Should you have any questions or comments, please call us.

Let me know what you think.  Please make changes to make more accurate and

John,

I have just had some additional discussions on our Global weather business 
and have come to a decision on how we need to run the weather business.   I 
believe that we do  need 100% full time dedication from each and any employee 
that is dedicated to the weather business including in the overall 
development and execution of or global strategy and positions.   I have a 
great deal of confidence and am holding Mark Tawney responsible and 
accountable for extensive growth and profitability in the business.

We need to hire additional people to add to grow the business in Japan and 
Australia.  Joe and Paul are on board with this strategy and Mark will work 
with them to accomplish the hiring of people and needed resources.  This will 
not be talk but we will get these people in place by specific deadlines.  We 
will pay all of those people's expenses and they will be on board with the 
hiring and will be expected to be a valuable team player and resource to 
their group.

On the Norway front, we need to implement the same organization structure.  
We have talked a lot about Thor and better communication, but we need to make 
a change.  We will have weekly calls with him and the weather group to make 
sure that we are all on the same page and he is up to speed with where we are 
going.  Jeff did have a video call with Thor to talk about his email and it 
went well.  Upon my return I learned that Thor and the London group put out a 
press release about putting out pricing on 1,000 cities and even changing the 
index.  Neither Mark or Jeff were even aware of this event nor was it even 
brought up in the call as something that was going to happen.  Also the 
hiring of xxxxxx as a weather  originator, without any discussion, also 
illustrates the lack of communication or desire to work together.  I am not 
saying that Mark or Thor are totally to blame, they both deserve credit for 
not working together, but  we are going to change the future and make sure

Don,

Thanks for the email and quick response.  I'll address in more detail later, 
I'm gong out of town again this morning, but I did call Alan Kent and you 
will have a copy of his standard construction agreement and a copy of the 
deed restrictions e-mailed today.

Also please call Alan directly with any questions on the contract.  Larry is 
his real estate agent for selling homes in this subdivision and i believe he 
is just helping him.  Alan should be able to answer most of your questions 
for clarifications quickly.  I don't need to be an intermediary.  In case you 
don't have his numbers, he can be reached at his office at 281 376-1500 or 
cell 281 960-3749.

We can discuss the other issues you addressed later when i get a chance to 
review them more carefully.  We are comfortable with Alan as the builder and 
want him to build the house, we just want to have a remedy if things don't go 
well.

Thanks,
mike

RE: Proposed Unimproved Property Contract by and between Flair Construction
Co., Inc., as Seller, and Mike and Chris McConnell, as Buyer

Dear Mike:

We have read and reviewed the above referenced Contract and your letter to
us regarding same dated February 20, 2001.  We want to respond to the
questions and issues raised in your letter as well as make some suggestions
and comments about the proposed Contract itself.

First, the Contract being used is the standard type of Contract used for the
proposed transaction.  The Contract is promulgated by the Texas Real Estate
Commission and is to be used by all licensed Real Estate Brokers and Agents.
We are interested in knowing, however, if the Contract was filled out by Mr.
Larry Williams of Prudential Gary Greene Realtors.  If so, does Mr. Williams
represent you or Flair Construction Co., Inc.?  Please advise us
accordingly.

As we discussed, we think it is most important that you have the opportunity
to read and review the Construction Agreement that Flair Construction Co.,
Inc. intends on using for the construction of your home.  The fact that
Flair is both the Developer, as well as the potential Builder, raises some
issues.  Usually, Builders have agreements with the Developer regarding the
purchase of lots and building on same.  Often, lots are reserved to certain
Builders and if you purchase those lots you are required to use the
designated Builders.  However, often lots are free to be purchased by
potential homeowners who then can choose the Builder they want.  We are
interested in knowing if the lots you are purchasing are actually reserved
to Flair Construction Co. Inc., or is Flair just requiring you to use them
to build your home since they are selling you the lots in question?  As you
point out in your letter, if you sign the Contract as it now reads, you are
captive to the Builder and are not free to negotiate with other Builders.

It appears to us that you will be one of the first homeowners in this new
subdivision.  We think it is critically important that you get a copy of the
Deed Restrictions even before you sign the Contract to make sure that there
are restrictions in place regarding the size of homes to be built, size of
lots, etc.  We want to make sure that your home is not horribly atypical for
the neighborhood.

We do not know if The Lakes of Sterling Gate Estates is in the City of
Houston or within its extraterritorial jurisdiction.  This is something you
may want to find out as soon as possible.  If it is outside the city limits,
is there already a MUD district in place to provide water and sewer
services?  Since this is a brand new subdivision your concern regarding its
future development and tax rate is very legitimate.  Usually, until the
subdivision is fairly well built out, the Developer controls the Community
Association as well as the Architectural Control Committee.  Therefore, if
this subdivision does not take off you will be under the control of the
Developer.

We recommend in the strongest terms possible that you talk with recent
customers of Flair Construction Co. Inc., to make sure that they were happy
with the construction of their homes, as well as warranty work.  Some
Builders are far better than others as it relates to follow-up warranty work
after their customers move into their homes.  We normally recommend that
homeowners do not move into their homes until all punch list items are
completed to the satisfaction of the homeowner.

The foregoing was our general comments regarding the proposed Contract.  We
will now make more specific comments and suggestions in chronological order
regarding the Contract:

1. Paragraph 2. PROPERTY.  As we previously stated, we think it is important
that you acquire copies of the Restrictive Covenants and Deed Restrictions
as soon as possible.  You will be responsible to pay assessments to the
Property Owners Association.  Since Flair is both the Builder and Developer,
you may want to ask Mr. Kent for an estimate of what your Community
Association Fees will be.

2. Paragraph 5. EARNEST MONEY.  We suggest that the earnest money be paid to
the Title Company and not to Flair Construction Co. Inc.

3. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY.  (6)  The standard printed
exception as to discrepancies, conflicts, shortages in area or boundary
lines, encroachments or protrusions or overlapping improvements is in your
Owners Policy.  In other words, the title policy does not cover these types
of discrepancies or conflicts.  However, if a survey is completed and an
additional fifteen percent (15%) of the policy premium is paid, the title
company will probably delete this exception.  This is something you may want
to consider.  However, this cost would be yours to incur.  If, however, it
is subsequently discovered that there are such discrepancies and conflicts
or shortages, then you will have title insurance coverage accordingly.

4. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY, last paragraph.  Make sure you are
provided a copy of the Commitment for Title Insurance as soon as possible.

5. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY B (3).  It appears to us that the
only survey you will be provided with by the Seller is one for the new
recorded plat of the subdivision.  Therefore, the Seller is not providing
you a survey of your actual lots.  If you were to have the standard printed
exception as to discrepancies and conflicts deleted, we believe you would
need a survey of your lots.  You will have seven (7) days after you receive
the Commitment and/or the survey to object in writing to any matters
disclosed or you will be deemed to waive such objections accordingly.
Therefore, please make sure that we have the opportunity to review the
survey and commitment as soon as possible after you receive same.

6. Paragraph 6. TITLE POLICY AND SURVEY (6).  We agree that this paragraph
relating to the Sellers right to continue to show the property for sale
should be deleted.

7. Paragraph 7. PROPERTY CONDITION: B (1).  We suggest that this paragraph
be checked and utilized rather than paragraph 7B (2) which states that you
will be accepting the property in its present condition.  Paragraph 7B (1)
states that you will pay a fee, usually very small, like $100.00, for the
unrestricted right to terminate the contract in the event the property is
not suitable for the purposes for which you intend on using it.  In other
words, you can have whatever inspectors you deem necessary to look at the
property to make sure that it is satisfactory for your home construction.
We often suggest that an independent inspector be hired by the homeowner to
inspect and review the construction of the home as it progresses.  In
addition, there may be some environmental issues or soil condition questions
that an inspector might raise if given the opportunity.  As the Contract now
reads, you are simply accepting the property as is and have no right to send
an inspector out to the property accordingly.

8. Paragraph 8. BROKERS' FEES.  You may want an affirmative statement that
you as the Buyer will not be responsible for or pay any Brokers' fees.

9. Paragraph 11. SPECIAL PROVISIONS.  It is written in that the closing on
these lots will be as soon as roads are in place or on March 1, 2001,
whichever is later.  However, we do not know what roads are being addressed
and think that this sentence needs far more specificity.  The second
sentence regarding your obligation to use Flair Homes has already been
addressed earlier.  The third sentence regarding when construction must
start should be revised to give you more time as you make reference in your
letter.  However, we also suggest that the Builder be put under an
obligation to start construction within thirty (30) days after the date you
notify him that you are ready for construction to begin.

10. Paragraph 13. ROLLBACK TAXES.  If there was ever an agricultural or
timber exemption on this property, you need to know.  Otherwise, you will be
obligated to pay rollback taxes on the property which may go back five (5)
years.

11. Paragraph 18. ESCROW.  As we indicated earlier, we believe your earnest
money should be paid to the title company.  In light of the fact that the
earnest money is in excess of $50,000.00 and the closing date on the lots is
somewhat uncertain, we suggest that you ask the title company to deposit the
earnest money in an interest bearing account and that you receive a credit
accordingly.

Please call us after you read and review this letter.

       Very truly yours,

       Donald S. Stirman

Thanks, no interest.

Emilo,

Thanks for the information.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

I know that Neal Gerstandt just joined the company last week and will be 
working with you on project Jose.  You will find him to be a great guy and a 
person with excellent judgment and overall experience in the energy 
industry.  I have known and worked with Neal for over 10 years.  I think he 
will make a great addition to the team and help bring this deal home.... the 
largest deal at Enron.

This issue has been going back and forth so Eric asked me to send you an 
email to see if we can resolve this issue.  I have been told by Eric that 
ProCaribe is in EGM and Mariella continues to say that it is EGA.  I can find 
reasons for this to fit in either place yet I think it is important to settle 
this ASAP.  I currently report into both groups so it is in my interest to 
resolve any misunderstandings as soon as they arise.  I hope all is well.

I also just found this in my in-box as returned as un-delivered (I put only=

=20

Below are a few comments that i believe you addressed and wanted some=20
additional feedback from our coal activities and changes in the coal=20
industry.  I wanted to get this out to you quickly so please forgive this=
=20
lack of formality or writing creativity.

Enron activity (EOL)
Enron's online activity has been very successful especially as compared wit=
h=20
our early estimations of acceptance by the industry.  I believe that there =
is=20
only one other active coal trading system (Dynegy direct) that simply isn't=
=20
posting prices as a bulletin board and waiting for a response with telephon=
e=20
follow-up.  I also believe that we have done a very significant amount of o=
r=20
maybe all the coal transactions on Dynegy direct to date.  We do a lot of o=
ur=20
business online and the numbers YTD are that approx. 45% of our trades are=
=20
executed online.  That number has been higher, as much as 90% for certain=
=20
months or when we are trying something new or moving a particular product. =
=20
Also, as Bid/Ask spreads tighten, which we would expect, that bodes well fo=
r=20
EOL and our (and the markets) ability to transact even more quickly. =20
Transactions that took days to put together now can be done in 1 second. =
=20
Between the speed and the cost savings of having a fully integrated system,=
=20
we believe that our transaction numbers and percentages of online business=
=20
will significantly increase.

Changes in the industry
We discussed changes that we believe are coming in the industry.  We see=20
several things on the horizon.  We expect the acceptance of the online=20
transactions to further increase; especially with the volatile price=20
movements what we have seen in the last 6 months.  We are currently=20
developing several new products for EOL that I believe will become very=20
popular and will create new markets in coal and related sectors.  I don't=
=20
want to discuss them right now but we are close to releasing them and I thi=
nk=20
they will raise some eyebrows.    The development of the Global Coal exchan=
ge=20
will also help.  I frankly don=01,t believe it will be very successful beca=
use=20
of several things but primarily because of the difficulty in closing the=20
transaction. One thing has been very firmly demonstrated.  Every time a new=
=20
big system has been introduced EOL volumes go up.  It simply accelerates th=
e=20
acceptance of online business and it gets down to the best prices and=20
liquidity to see who will ultimately win the day.  Another big change in th=
e=20
industry is the growing acceptance of the OTC market.  The significant pric=
e=20
changes that have occurred have "forced" many traditional players to the OT=
C=20
market.  This also includes forcing them to agree to standard OTC terms and=
=20
conditions and getting them comfortable with the market.  This is very good=
=20
for Enron especially when you consider that we are the major player on the=
=20
OTC market.  We don't release specific percentages of what we are doing on=
=20
the OTC.  Also having more natural and traditional players signing these=20
types of standard agreements helps us on the EOL side because standard=20
contracts are important for developing a more liquid commodity market.

Enron coal volumes
A couple of numbers that we are willing to release.  Year to date, we have=
=20
made markets and transacted approx. 30 million tons in the forward market. =
=20
On the physical side of our transactions, about 25% go physical vs.=20
financial.  Last year Enron was the largest US market maker (not producer)=
=20
with 142 million tons transacted.   Internationally we moved approx. 47=20
million tons and overall the total was slightly less than 190 million tons.=
 =20
We have high expectations for 2001.  I believe that we should be up approx=
=20
65% and we are on track with that.   I think the industry would be surprise=
d=20
that we did almost 2,800 transactions in 2000.   This doesn=01,t include an=
y of=20
our shipping business.

I hope this helps and please let me know if you have any other questions.

Shanna,

What a deal.  When Jonathan and I talked, he did ask if this deal with Net 
Works was a problem.  I told him that I wouldn't imagine it would be an issue 
but to work it out with Eric and i gave him yours and Cindy's name rather 
than Robert.  Is this out of line with others at his level and responsiblity?

I have some real concerns over this contract Louise put together for 
Jonathan.  Shanna, can you check this out with Robert Jones.  I'd like to 
restructure this contract.

I have had some discussions with Jonathan and recommended he takes the LNG 
job offered.  Assuming he does, we have already set out the terms for him 
coming over (fully negotiated) so there is nothing to do on the HR side 
provided you are happy with the numbers.

Let me know what you think.  Please make changes to make more accurate and 
effective.  I will send this to him and follow up with a discussion.  It 
needs some work.

John,

I have just had some additional discussions on our Global weather business 
and have come to a decision on how we need to run the weather business.   I 
believe that we do  need 100% full time dedication from each and any employee 
that is dedicated to the weather business including in the overall 
development and execution of or global strategy and positions.   I have a 
great deal of confidence and am holding Mark Tawney responsible and 
accountable for extensive growth and profitability in the business.

We need to hire additional people to add to grow the business in Japan and 
Australia.  Joe and Paul are on board with this strategy and Mark will work 
with them to accomplish the hiring of people and needed resources.  This will 
not be talk but we will get these people in place by specific deadlines.  We 
will pay all of those people's expenses and they will be on board with the 
hiring and will be expected to be a valuable team player and resource to 
their group.

On the Norway front, we need to implement the same organization structure.  
We have talked a lot about Thor and better communication, but we need to make 
a change.  We will have weekly calls with him and the weather group to make 
sure that we are all on the same page and he is up to speed with where we are 
going.  Jeff did have a video call with Thor to talk about his email and it 
went well.  Upon my return I learned that Thor and the London group put out a 
press release about putting out pricing on 1,000 cities and even changing the 
index.  Neither Mark or Jeff were even aware of this event nor was it even 
brought up in the call as something that was going to happen.  Also the 
hiring of xxxxxx as a weather  originator, without any discussion, also 
illustrates the lack of communication or desire to work together.  I am not 
saying that Mark or Thor are totally to blame, they both deserve credit for 
not working together, but  we are going to change the future and make sure 
that it will work better.  I know that all of Thor's group is very loyal to 
Thor and may not want to transition into EGM and if that is the case, we can 
make it work via London.  I think the key is our approach to Thor and that 
this isn't meant as a reflection on him but is a consistent change with how 
we are running all of our businesses around the world.  The weather piece of 
his business is very small and isn't going to effect his P&L significantly 
(he'll actually be net positive!)

Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new 
structure and the best way to communicate it to those involved to make this 
the most effective.

This email is going just to you and Jeff and won't be shared with anyone else.

FYI, this morning I confirmed with Jody Crook (currently an analysist in 
Texas Risk Management) that he would be joining the LNG group as an analyst 
beginning March 1.  Jody is clearly a very energetic guy, willing to learn, 
and I believe he will be a great addition to the team.

Thanks

Sweet-um,
Howdy.  Does your AOL work after I go into the work VPN?
m
Your Windows98 home machine now boots up directly to the desktop icons.
The new IPAQ cradle is now connected and the camera card has been removed.

As soon as Microsoft Outlook replaces Lotus Notes for your mail client, we
can set up the IPAQ to synchronize with your mail.  Also, once migrated to
Outlook for email you can remotely access messages via Internet Explorer at:
http://nahou-msowa01p.corp.enron.com/exchange 

Without having you give us your Lotus Notes password, we could not be 100%
sure that AOL will now load after exiting email ... but Steve and myself 
cleared up two problems that likely caused that problem.  I'll get in touch
with Cathy tomorrow after the 4 Seasons conference in case any other issues
still remain after our trip.

FYI, there is no official meeting with Chavez.
m
Mike and Eric -- I have checked with the DC office (as well as Steve Kean and 
Rick Shapiro), and we're unable to confirm that a meeting will take place 
between Bush and Chavez.   As  you can see from the note below, Tom Briggs 
suspects that the confusion stems from Bush's scheduled participation in the 
upcoming Trade Summit.   Also, Bush is scheduled to meet with Fox later this 
week.   

I will work with Tom and others in the DC office to ensure that our Venezuela 
project -- and other LNG projects -- get the appropriate attention and 
support from the Administration.    In that regard, we will provide talking 
points to the relevant administration officials travelling with the President 
to the FTAA meeting.   I will work with the commercial LNG counterparts to 
get the necessary background details.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss.

My contacts have not been able to confirm that a meeting will take place 
between Bush and Chavez.  They suspect the confusion stems from Bush's 
scheduled participation in the Summitt of the Americas to be held April 20-22 
in Quebec.  The Summit may address the FTAA (Free Trade Agreement of the 
Americas) and will provide an excellent opportunity  to raise LNG issues. 

Enron is putting together a hit list of issues that we should raise at this 
meeting and we should add LNG, especially given th eimposrtance of LNG to the 
US gas supply position.

As I wander the halls of Congress talking about energy, it would be very 
useful to have talking points on our LNG projects and the overall prospects 
for LNG imports.  I do not want confidential information, but it would be 
great if I cann state that LNG imposrts would be less than current spot 
prices.  Can you put together some talking points for me please?

All,

 At our offsite in Miami next week, each of you are on the agenda to present 
your business and goals.  This will be very short, only 20 minutes (an agenda 
will soon follow but we will have a business meeting from 8am - 11:30am on 
Saturday).  Please prepare a few of pages on power point and submit to Cathy 
Phillips so that she can have all the presentations ready for that Saturday 
morning.  

Attached below is a copy of the abbreviated goals that I submitted to 
Frevert, summarizing EGM's 2001 goals.  Please do not hesitate to change the 
list and add to it, it is only a guide and was used as a quick reference of 
EGM for the Enron board.  After this meeting, I will take each of your 
presentations and make a more comprehensive goals and objectives list for EGM 
as a business unit.  Also please add some of your other specific goals that 
illustrate where you want to be by year end regarding your competitive 
position and/or market share.  For example, to be the largest marketer of 
coal in the US, to be the largest options player in crude and products, or 
what ever is appropriate.

Also attached, for your information, is a recent  presentation from the coal 
group.  We thought that this was an excellent format and review.  In the 
upcoming weeks, we would like to see an update on each of your businesses as 
well.  I will let you know more in the next few weeks about the timing and 
format.

Thanks,
Mike

would be honored if you would join us.  The meeting will be held in the 
Ballroom of the Four Seasons Hotel.  Registration begins at 7:00 a.m. and 
breakfast will be served at 7:15 a.m.  The speech and meeting should conclude 
by 8:30 a.m.  Please let me know by Wednesday whether you are able to join us.

Thanks,

Virginia, we did get the package but can't address right now.  thanks,
m

John, 

This just got sent and it appears you were left of the cc list.  We will be 
discussing with your guys this week to determine the best way forward.  
Everyone is under earnings pressure and it is asking too much for someone to 
dedicate 10-20% of their time on a product.  The intent of this email is not 
to take people but to add people to the offices, if necessary, to make sure 
they live, eat and drink weather.

We can discuss when I'm in later this week.

Mike
As Mike and I look across all of our business units, we continue to look for 
optimal organizational structures that will enable each business unit to 
achieve it's targets for  2001 and beyond.  In our weather business, there 
appears to be a lack of seamlessness.  Reporting relationships, P&L, and 
vision for this business are not best aligned as this business exists today.  

Mike and I would like to address this as follows:    we need 100% full time 
dedication from each and any employee that is dedicated to the weather 
business.  All identified employees in the weather business will now become 
full time employees of EGM and report to Mark Tawney. Accordingly Mark and I 
will be looking at, with each of you, the employees that may be affected by 
this transition and the need to hire additional employees.  It is important 
that both business units work together to determine which individuals will be 
in Weather, or  will be in EEL.  Once done, Mark will begin adding to the 
weather team in each of your regions.   It is obvious that the organizations 
and product lines can lever each other and the synergy's will provide 
powerful results in our regional gas and power businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.  

Please give me a call and we will discuss the issues surrounding this new 
structure.

John, attached below is my first draft.  It isn't pretty and i would like you 
comments and changes.  Please make changes directly on the word doucment and 
send back asap.  

thanks,
m

Ken,

I'm back.  Sorry for the delay.  It's been crazy here and I'm very backed up 
on emails especially the fun ones like this.

My brief moment in print (very brief) certainly hasn't gone to my head 
especially as an Enron  "B" teamer.  In response to your worker bee comment, 
I can certainly say "buzz" but not someone who can sell that many shares of 
stock!  You are the king.

Your last email was good and I'm not sure I can respond adequately but at 
least I didn't get help!

You win......but you still owe me lunch.

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone 
again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we 
have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday 
night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty 
good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I 
have to cancel.

PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two

Ken,

You might point out to McConnell that there is a strong correlation between
OU's football success and the price of a barrel of oil.  Talk about the best
team money can buy!

Also, if Mike has any friends coming from the East Coast to visit him in
Oklahoma tell him to send them these directions:

1)  Head West until you smell sh_t--you have made it to Texas,

2)  Head North until you step in it--you are now in Oklahoma!

Dave "There's only one Big Red" Noble

OK.  But at least we have upside.   The ability to count past 7 exceeds the
limit  of most OU students, alums, football players and coaches thereby
either
capping the number of national championships you can talk about at 7.
Alternatively, OU would have to increase academic standards to enable them
to
count beyond the 7 national championships.  Unfortunately, we already know
that
actually winning a national championship with athletes possesing an IQ above
plant life only occurs at Nebraska, so you are in a horrible Catch 22.  (I'm
sorry, for OU grads like yourself a you wouldn't understand the term "Catch
22".
Just take it from me,  you can't  win).

Oh.... you may note that I have decided to involve the big guns in this
debate!

Dear Mr. McConnell,

After reading this mornings Wall Street Journal article with interest, I
thought it appropriate to write you, introducing our firm to you and our LNG
facilities.

Coincidently, we had talked to our friends at Vinson and Elkins a few weeks
ago about an introduction to the right person in Enron to discuss our LNG
projects with.

I am sending by courier hard copies of the items attached to this e-mail.

We look forward to meeting you, and discussing the LNG opportunities in
greater detail.

Yours faithfully,

Steve Meheen

Hi -- I'm the writer in Corporate Public Relations who writes the annual

bullet-point overview.

Please read it and forward any comments to me. I can be reached at ext.

George,

I just talked to Rich.  I told him about the timing of the settlement 
proposal and that we should hear back late next week.  I also suggested that 
if we get a negative response, that you and i would give him a call and 
update.   He is being patient but I have a feeling that it has its limits.  
His response is logical to this point because as he stated, there should be a 
lot of money in this for both parties and thus a commercial settlement.

Mike

   
	
	

I left you a voice mail regarding Sempra and Kinder Morgan.  Details as 
follows:

We will make a revised settlement offer to Sempra by the end of this week.  I 
doubt that Sempra will accept our offer.  If they fail to accept, we will 
head into a litigation track - which means no synfuel will be produced at 
Pier IX until the court decides on who wins the case.  We expect the case to 
go to court in the fourth quarter of this year.

As I previously advised, Kinder Morgan has been very patient with us during 
this process.  At some point in time we will have to address their claims, 
which by definition will have to go through us in order to reach Sempra.

Let me know if I can provide any additional information.

George

Randy, I would be happy to sign it with legal approval and Tim Detriming's 
group must also see it to make sure that we are not obligating ourselves to 
anything else that is going on around the corporation.  Maffet knows the 
drill.

mike

Jeff,
I called Joe this morning and left him a pre-email voicemail on this.  I 
referenced the power of 100% focus and the accountability for someone driving 
the earnings and his pressure to make earnings in trading and electricity. 

I like your email and tone.  I would like to recommend you add a statement 
about Morten being very strong and that we aren't attempting to "own" him vs. 
having a 100%  dedicated weather guy.  I would also add that you want to talk 
him about this and how we could move quickly to complete our global vision 
with tawney.

in the weather business.  It is obvious that the organizations and product 
lines can lever each other and the synergies will provide powerful results in 
our regional gas and power businesses in particular.  

If you look at coal, lng, equities, etc, we have employees based in each of 
your regions who report back into the appropriate business unit within EGM.  
This restructure will similarly align weather.  

Jeff, here is Gary's review.  It is still on the wrong template and I'll 
correct today.  Please review carefully and make changes and return.

Jeff, 
My brother had this guy call him and he forwarded his resume.  Do you know 
him?  Any interest?
If you do, please forward on.
Thanks,

Mike attached is Mark Evans' resume.  He worked at Duke and I believe he 
managed their NE gas book.

No special consideration needed.  I just promised him that I would get it to 
someone in your group.

Thanks,

Lea, 

You called yesterday.  I am swamped and unavailable.  On Jeff Koons, I am 
sure that Jeff talked with you last week and he shared his insight from other 
dealers at your dinner and his comments.  It sounds like we should let him go 
and not pursue.  I was going to talk with Skilling that day and elected to 
drop it after that.  See you on Monday.

Mike

Jeff, I couldn't open the attachment and there was no name reference.  Who is 
this?
m

All, 

After filling out and gathering all the feedback forms in the last couple of 
weeks, Jeff and I just realized that we forgot to ask everyone for an 
accomplishment list from each of you.  We have had a very successful 2001 so 
far and we need to be able to discuss each group and your personal mid-year 
in detail.  Please send us an email with your accomplishments so that we have 
all the facts during the PRC process.  

This doesn't need to be formal but simply put together and email to both of 
us for the appropriate time.

Thanks,
Mike and Jeff

Renee,
Wow!  I was so happy to get your email.  Congrats.  You guys make a cute 
couple.  I'll try to attend, it is on the calendar.
mike

Any interest? - Maybe for Randy or Doug?

Hi Mike,

Amanda Martin asked that I forward my resume to you for your consideration.  
I am interested in a position in origination, risk management or structuring 
within Enron.  I graduated from Rice University and Stanford University in 
engineering and have advanced into a commercial role at Azurix.  I am hoping 
to build on my commercial skills at Enron Global Markets.

I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss my plans with you.  I am 
available to meet at your convenience.  You may reach me at 713-646-7902.  
Amanda will also follow up with a telephone call to you next week.

Thank you for your help.

Regards,

I just wanted to make sure you guys know everything I do.  Actually this is 
somewhat bullish considering past legislative attempts.
Jeffrey Keeler
05/24/2001 12:52 PM
Today, Senators Bob Smith (R-NH) and Harry Reid (D-NV) will introduce an MTBE 
bill. which is expected to be slightly different than we've seen in previous 
Congresses.  

We expect it to include:  

1) a 4-year date certain to eliminate MTBE, with EPA determining the phaseout 
schedule
2)  a lifting of the 2% oxygenate standard upon perfunctory petition by State 
governors within 90 days from date of enactment
3)  and environmental "anti-backsliding" provision focused only on air-toxics 
and using a 2000 baseline with a 27.5% percent standard (the way I understand 
it right now, RFG must perform 27.5% better than 2000 baseline for 
conventional gasoline)
4) provisions for MTBE producer "transition assistance"

Brief analysis:  

We'll have more details shortly, but the bill looks a little better than 
previous efforts.  A number of bills have been introduced this Congress, but 
this will probably be the leading effort.  

As you know, Enron has led efforts to include the "transition assistance" 
piece -- which is still largely undefined in the legislation -- but we are 
pleased with the inclusion of a "placeholder" while the Senate decides on the 
best approach.  We will continue to lead the development of such incentives 
(which will likely take the form of EPA/DOE funding for MTBE producers who 
convert plants to produce iso-octane or alkylate).

An MTBE ban is of course not good, but a "date certain" gives producers more 
flexibility to determine their options rather than reduce production under 
several steps of a phase out.   Allowing states to get a waiver of the oxy 
standard is probably a given in any legislation, but will face some 
opposition from the ethanol community -- who just want a simple MTBE ban.

The anti-backsliding provision is still being refined, but looks fairly 
lame.  We need more details to make an accurate assessment, but its likely 
that environmental groups will want a bit more.

One political factor -- with Sen. Jim Jeffords leaving the Republican party, 
Democrats will be given control of the Senate Environment Committee, which 
will consider this bill.  They will likely allow Jeffords to chair the 
committee.  The significance is that Sen. Bob Smith (R-NH) is the current 
chair, and has been able to use that position to drive his past bills on MTBE 
-- in losing the chairmanship, his legislation may face a longer road through 
Committee.

I will keep you posted as the legislation evolves.

Greg,

I received request for our goals on a voicemail while coming back from 
Venezuela.  I didn't know exactly what you  were looking for or the audience 
but i have listed a few initial goals and thoughts for each business unit.  
We are in the process of creating more specific goals for each group for 
2001.  Each already has their own but they are not in a final and consistent  
format.  We have an off-site meeting later this month in which we will 
address this as a group.  In addition, George and the coal group completed 
theirs late last week and Mark Tawney is returning tomorrow with re-defined 
goals as part of the process.

Also, I have attached some new global formats that I received as I was 
leaving the country on some specific items that we need to insure a 
successful year.  Most of this information has never been put together 
before.  I have projected out a 50% growth factor as a starting point and 
will break this down to specific groups and goals to insure that we will meet 
these goals.  As you know a lot of this was started when I put together the 
EGM presentation and gathered information for the analyst meeting.  

Let me know if you need something else or if this is not what you are looking 
for.

Mike

Jeff attached are the first drafts of the following reviews.  Please review 
and make changes on the document itself.  This is not in any final form and 
will have numerous errors.  Please make corrections as you go along as well.  
There is no spell check on this form.

Gary and George are tomorrow morning.

Mike

DH,

Here is my first draft for Rick's review.  It is not complete and was done on 
an airplane.  It needs work but I didn't want to hold it up.  Please make any 
changes and additions on the attached word document and send it back.

Thanks,
mike

Emilo,
A few things that I want to make sure that we have in our briefing package.
A map of the region and facility
Assessment of country risk
address concern that a lot of "old" money (big Landowners) are taking their 
money out of the country - something we shouldn't ignore
Update on other Ven. activities for ENE

Other 
How is this going to work with translators?
Earlier meetings with Ministers?
We want to have a dinner the night before with key people

We are now flying out after the meeting on Friday on the company plane.

Mike

Shanna,

I certainly believe that Jennifer is better than Kim.  Jeff is certainly the 
appropriate judge but she is very young and has a lot yet to learn.  This 
comment is not meant as a cut down at all.   John's questionable judgement 
shouldn't just be trumped however.

My thoughts,
m

Shanna Funkhouser@ENRON

Mike and Jeff,

I wanted to let you know that Kim Hillis is being promoted from Sr. Admin to 
Executive Assistant.  

Cathy Phillips, Nicki Daw and Kay Chapman are also Executive Assistants.

Please let me know if we need to re-visit a promotion for Jennifer and 
whether it should be considered now, mid year or at a later time.

Thanks,
Shanna

Shanna,
I'm supportive of the raise to $150k.  I think he is doing a good job and has 
a lot of value.  He didn't fair well during the ranking due to lack of big $ 
or closure but maybe this will send him a good message.

Thanks,
m

Jeff, 
Interesting.  Do you like this guy?  What about Crude and products 
origination working for Randy?  On the LNG front we should look at him if you 
like him but i don't think it is a no brainer.  Neal will be coming on in 2 
weeks, do we need him?  Maybe we do.

Thanks,

Mike and Sally:

I have been in contact with Ted Jacobs and have volunteered $1500 in 
scholarship funds to be awarded by Enron this spring.  By volunteering this 
money, we are now able to attend scholarship interviews on Tuesday, March 6 
on campus.  This will provide us with the opportunity to target candidates 
for next fall and lay the groundwork for a more competitive future.

After we have identified our scholarship recipients, we are invited to 
present our awards at the Scholarship Awards Banquet on Friday, April 20.  

Ted will (if he has not already) approach you, Mike, to see if you are 
interested in playing a role at this event.   If you are available to attend, 
please let me know.  I plan to have at least 2 Enron representatives at the 
event.

I just wanted to give each of you these details to keep you fully informed of 
our efforts on campus.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please let 
me know.

Thank you,

Jeff and John,

Attached is the most recent draft of the reorg announcement.  Cathy will have 
this ready to go out tomorrow, close of business.  Please review again and 
mark up any changes that you believe are required.  Please read the Per and 
Randy section carefully for errors and wording.  JN, Please change wording 
for Randy's most recent assignment, i put something down as a marker.  Also 
come up with a 1 sentence lead for Randy on the expected growth and 
opportunities around his efforts.

Please read carefully for better wording and errors.  Return to Cathy by 2 pm 
and we will make final changes and send it out at 6pm.

Thanks,
Mike

I thought he might fit somewhere in your organization because of his sales,=

Marty,

I can't attend and sent it on to Jeff Shankman.  I really like the concept 
and would like to see the end product and the presentations.  Are you taping 
it?  

Its a great idea and format.  Thanks for inviting me.

Mike

FYI, I think this is interesting.  I won't be able to attend but do you have 
any time to see some of this.  The morning looks interesting.  What do you 
think?

Mike:

On Tuesday, January 30, 2001, selected business units within EES will be 
sharing their business and marketing plans for 2001. These plans incorporate 
the lessons learned from last's year activities. The Bear Trap program was 
initiated two years ago to help our Origination teams filter down the 
universe of prospects to those offering the best probability of closing 
deals. 

This year we will have the most comprehensive Bear Trap session ever.  We 
want you to be part of this exciting process and to broaden the relationship 
we have with you and your teams.  Come and join me on Tuesday, January 30th, 
at the Aerial Theater in Bayou Place, downtown Houston, starting at 7:00 AM 
with breakfast and continuing until 5:30 PM.  If you have not RSVP'd yet, 
please have your office call Julie Davidson at x- 36882 to confirm your 
attendance.

See you there.

Marty Sunde

I would really like that.  I don't have any specific suggestions.
mike

   
	
	

Gentlemen:

We would be pleased to offer you a summary of the key reports and events of 
the week that are driving prices in crude, products, NGLS and petchems.
We are currently developing such a report for general dissemination. We would 
appreciate any comments or suggestions you might have regarding such reports. 

Thanks

John,

This is a follow-up to our earlier discussion.  I would like to have you lay 
out our physical crude needs to become a player a long with some action steps 
to accomplish the goal.  I don't want to forget about this because I believe 
it may be something we need to assign someone or a mid-market or originator 
or team to accomplish.  I would like to see foreign and domestic.  
I see this as one of our possible competitive advantages or at least to solve 
the problem of not being in the know and getting second hand info or 
pricing.  

Thanks,
mike

Robert,

Thanks,  I've talked with EES - Tom White and I will forward on his resume 
for consideration.  I will also talk with Stan Horton.

Mike

Paul,
I am in the early stages of planning my next run to Singapore and Sydney.  I 
was thinking about bringing my wife and staying over a couple of days (or a 
week).  What is the weather like in July and are you going to be there?
Thanks,
Mike

Ken,

I had to respond.  

Speaking of bitch....all of the Cornhusker fans are bitching about Stoops 
not  taking the head coach position at the Cleveland Browns or any other job 
that will get him out of their backyard.  By the way, Stoops just started 
working on his book "OU's 7th Football National Championship"; Chapter 3, Who 
are the Huskers?

I see that we are scheduled to have lunch today.   I may have to postpone 
again, I'll let you know later this morning.  I am out all weekend and we 
have to have the final comments on the Analyst Presentation in by sunday 
night so I may be working over lunch.  Actually, I think we are in pretty 
good shape so I will probably be doing lunch but just don't be too mad if I 
have to cancel.

Ken

PS  Your brother told me he went to 3 bowl games (when I found out that two 
of them were the galleryfurniture.com bowl and that one in Shreveport (I 
can't remember the name of it)) I realized he is a very, very sick college 
football fan.

Paul,

FYI, you were invited to our off-site because we felt that our businesses 
were so linked together and that we could all get on the same page with 
regard to updates, vision and relationship building.  We also invited Joe and 
Thor as the only other non-EGM people.  If you can make it would be great but 
we do know how difficult it is to make it over.  I did hear your California 
request and it could happen.  We haven't found the right place yet.  
California is experiencing serious blackouts and it could be difficult.  
We'll be in touch.

Cheers,
mike

Thor,

I am sorry that you can't make it but please don't worry about it.  We wanted 
to invite you as an important business leader and give you an update on our 
businesses and also have you share your vision and accomplishments of your 
great work in Norway.  We intended to only invite 3 non-EGM officers, Joe 
Hirl, Paul Quilkey and you.  

I hope you have a great holiday.

Virginia,

Hello.  I was originally inquiring about purchasing a Cross or Signac 
impressionist lithograph.  I found them and purchased both from a gallery in 
London, William Weston.  They should be delivered this week.  They are 
beautiful and will add a lot to our collection.  By the way the Lichtenstein 
is up and hanging in our formal living room and it is magnificent.  I have 
also purchased an Appel in the last month.

I am interested in several artists.  Actually, a lot.  I will be looking for 
one or more of the following.  My concept is that overtime I would like to 
own one of all the following artists and they are all depending when I find 
something that we really like.  I listed all of our (sometimes mine vs. my 
wife's favorites and priorities).  They are kind of in rank order but as I 
stated if I find the piece that I like we will purchase it.  I want signed 
and numbered.  I realize that some were not signed by the artist but it is an 
important fact in my buying decision.  I also realize that some may not have 
done any works on paper or they are outrageously expensive.  For example, I 
would like to know if Rothko or Kline did any work on paper.  

At least that is what I am thinking now.

Bonnard (colorful only)
Lautrec
Suerat (any works on paper? - I don't know that he did any)
Other impressionist or post impressionist lithos
Braque
Moore
Arp
Rouault
Modrian
Rothko
Kline
Motherwell

By the way, I am interested in re-looking at a Picasso (although we have 2) 
that your gallery had a couple of years ago.  It was a cubist piece from the 
1920s and I believe you called the technique a "push wa" (pronunciation Vs an 
attempt at the proper spelling).  It was for sale in a couple of galleries in 
SF and was about $20,000.  Is there 1 available?  Also I am still thinking 
about the Matisse we discussed before but as you can see, I have a lot of 
other artists I am interested in and it may remain on the back burner because 
we already have one.  

Thanks,
mike

John,

Here is a brief email on a possible resolution for the European/Oslo  weather 
situation.  Mark sent this draft to me last weekend but i haven't had time to 
review it this week.  Personally, I think that this is the wrong answer from 
a Corporate perspective but this issue keeps hanging around and isn't worth 
any more of our time.  For what it is worth, I think our communication 
strategy did make a big difference but didn't get us exactly where we needed 
to be.  These groups will be expected (and held accountable) for good and 
consistent communication on an ongoing basis as well.   For a P&L that is 
this small (and negative) we are all spending too much time on this.  There 
is more to this story but I think we should just drop it and move on to 
bigger and better things.

I am certainly not wedded to any of this but would rather focus on all the 
other issues and problems on my plate.  Let's discuss upon your return on our 
weekly call.

Thanks and I hope your vacation was relaxing.

Mike 

ps-this hasn't been shared outside the group on the email.
   
I propose to structure Weather Risk Management in Europe as follows:
 
I have responsibility and authority for all weather related activities 
including: trading (incl. EOL), structuring, origination, research, etc... 
for all of Europe with the exception of Finland, Norway and Sweeden.  I will 
run Europe out of the London office with people reporting directly to me.  
Accordingly, I will allocate V@R and delegate trading authority to personnel 
in the London office. 

I anticipate having Paul Murray run our activities in London. Janine Juggins 
in the London Tax department is establishing the necessary entities and 
addressing the relevant tax issues.  Simon Thurbin in London who reports to 
Todd Hall is identifying a book administrator for our group.  Cindy Horn 
again in London is securing space for an initial 8 to 10 individuals.  We 
have hired an assistant who is multilingual to assist in the setting up of 
our activities.  We are working with Stuart Reed in Houston IT and Brian 
Hudson in London IT (coordinating with Oslo) to ensure that we have the 
infrastructure necessary to trade weather.

In addition to Paul Murray, Ross McIntyre, and the assistant, Catherine 
Woolgar will return to London.  We have also identified an individual in 
London to provide research support. For sturcturing, we will send one 
individual for the Houston group and hire one new employee already identified.

Paul Murray will focus on the management of the office, relationships within 
Europe and the execution of large structured trades.  All other individuals 
in the London office will have dual reporting with a dotted line to Paul and 
a direct line to the group leaders in Houston to ensure continuity and 
accountability.

With respect to Scandinavia, I propse that those activities be treated as 
completely separate with their own V@R and trading authority.  Their 
activities should be limited only to Scandinavia.  The Houston group will 
share infomation and knowledge in the same way that we would with other desks 
within Enron.  Should any of the groups reporting to me wish to take on a 
Scandinavian position, they will have to do so through the Oslo weather 
group.  Likewise, should the Oslo weather group wish to take any weather 
positions outside of Scandanavian, they will need to do so through me.

Paul Murray and I will develop a new budget for Europe taking into 
consideration the time needed to establish our activities.  Oslo will retain 
responsibility for the European budget as originally proposed by Thor Lien.

Thanks for the note.   Sooners rule.  We'll find time when things settle down.

Hi. Happy New Year and hope you had a good holiday.

I got married in December and am now looking to leave India. I would like to 
work in Houston because Jaya, my wife, has applied to US MBA schools for 2001 
fall and this will mean that we can be in the same continent if not time zone.

I am coming to Houston next week and was hoping that I could speak with you 
before then about opportunities in Global Markets and if possible set up a 
meeting with you in Houston.

This history of coaching changes at OU is fascinating.

"12" OU facts.....

Legendary head coach Bud Wilkinson was 145-29-4 with 3 National
Championships at OU.

In 1985, heading into the Orange Bowl, Barry Switzer's record was
144-29-4, with 2 National Championships. A win by Switzer would
mean the two men would be dead even. He won.

Bud Wilkinson was replaced by his defensive coordinator, Gomer Jones,
who had a difficult time replacing a legend, and was replaced by Jim
Mackenzie. Mackenzie played college ball at Kentucky under Bear Bryant,
Mackenzie would only be OU's coach for one year. He was replaced by
an NFL assistant named Chuck Fairbanks, who would be replaced by Barry
Switzer.

Switzer was replaced by his defensive coordinator, Gary Gibbs, who had
a hard time following a legend. Gibbs was replaced by Howard
Schnellenberger, who played his college ball at Kentucky under Bear
Bryant. Howard was OU's coach for only one year. He was replaced by an
NFL assistant named John Blake, who would be replaced by Bob Stoops.

Killer B's -- Bud, Barry & Bob

OU plays in the Big 12. Until this year, OU had never won 12 games.

There are 12 letters in: Bud Wilkinson, Barry Switzer, Robert Stoops.

There are 12 letters in Boomer Sooner.

Stoops was 12 years old when Barry Switzer was hired as head coach.

OSU has beaten OU only 14 times -- the 12th time they beat them, the
score was 12-0.

John Blake won 12 games, in 3 years.

There are 12 letters in Florida State and Miami Florida.

And the BIGGIE... Up until 2 January 2001, OU has won 11 of 15 Orange
Bowls.

Now it's 12. How about those Sooner players and Coaches!!!!!!!!!!!!

Rick,  thanks.  I will listen in occasionally as well.

FYI, Clay and I are regular participants in these calls.  I will update both 
of you from time to time by voicemail as important events occur
	enron india
	

We will continue to have a daily Dabhol Task Force Call primarily aimed to 
update the working group team with participation by senior management as they 
deem appropriate. All of you are invited to participate. You may find that 
until major events occur, participating everyday is not useful. Thus, when 
major updates occur, we will send a separate e-mail requesting that all be on 
the phone call. However, all team members working directly on this project 
are expected to attend everyday.

On Wednesday, January 10, we will be discussing outcome of lender meetings in 
New York. 

To assist the India team with finishing our daily meetings and returning back 
to the office or perhaps even allowing time for people to get home before the 
call begins, I am changing the time of the ongoing calls, starting Wednesday, 
January 10, to 8:30pm India, 9:00am Houston.

If there are others to be added to the distribution list for this call, 
please communicate directly with Mrudula Gadade via e-mail.

The dial-in details remain the same:

As requested...

Kathie,

Thank you for your email.  I've been out and all over the world.  I 
appreciate your help on this article.  Attached is a copy of a presentation 
that will fill you in on some of the businesses that we are working on.  This 
should give you some ideas and clarifications on the first draft.

Here are a few other points of emphasis.

EGM was created to provide sharpened focus on very large global markets and 
commodities to enable them to grow quickly 
These markets are huge and we will become a big player rather than being 
active in them
EGM provideds true network for market making opportunities related to 
commodities that are highly liquid in physical and financial terms and are 
enormous in market size
EGM leverages the value of Enron's existing network and international asset 
positions
EGM's operation will coordinate with leveraging all of our wholesale 
businesses
EGM has very aggressive growth targets in transactions and earnings
EGM has contributed almost $200 million in gross margin in its first  2 
quarters in existence
Go big or go home philosophy
EGM will represent a clear transfer of  Enron wholesale market making model 
into other commodities this year
GROWTH is the key!!!

Thanks for your help.

Mike

Good Morning Mike!

The next issue of our newsletter is in the works, with a planned distribution 
set for late June. Mark Frevert has requested that the Executive Letter be 
rotated among the presidents of EWS. This is the inside cover message and 
should be 300+ words. I hope that you will be able to squeeze this into your 
busy schedule.

Here is a suggested outline.  If you want to fill in the outline with 
information, I will be happy to turn it into a letter for you.

 I.  An overview of EWS/EGM as we move forward.

 II. A short-term retrospective about EGM activities and successes

           III. Future plans/initiatives for EGM
     (strategic vision of the group, opportunities, expectations, etc.) 

Please feel free to modify as you see fit.  I have attached Greg Whalley's 
letter from our last issue to give you an idea of the format. Let me know if 
there is anything I can do to help you.  I need your letter by June 15, if 
possible.

 
Hope to hear from you soon.

various officers of EA, EGM and EIM in the newsmagazine.  As the Editor of

Christie, a couple of comments on the 3rd paragraph on page 11.  It is up to 
you to decide if it is worth correcting.  I didn't know if you had a chance 
to make the writing better or simply correct mistakes.

1.  Page 11:  I was president of Houston Pipe Line and Louisiana Resources 
Company.    The term, "Enron pipeline subsidiary" isn't real or correct.  You 
could also restate with, head of Enron's non-regulated pipelines, head of two 
pipelines, head of an Enron pipeline subsidiary ; something like that.
2.  Page 11:  On the 5th sentence, it is mixing a couple of thoughts.  I 
would like to add something like, (after officer,) and establishing a unified 
vision,
3.  Page 11:  typo.  There needs to be an "an" in the last sentence before 
the word extension.

Thanks,
mike

Friends,

Attached is the "Final" draft of the Harvard Business School case study 
prepared by Harvard Professor Chris Bartlett and his research assistant Meg 
Wozny. [please scroll down to the end of the next message for the attachment] 
.  The content was developed from interviews with most of you.

Please review the case and let me know of any desired 
edits/corrections/comments as soon as possible. [One obvious correction is 
the spelling of Cindy Olson's last name].

We'd like to "sign off" on this within the next 2 or 3 days. Harvard 
professors are excited about teaching this case this coming semester.  In 
fact, Professor Don Sull will be focusing largely on this Enron Case this 
semester, culminating in "Enron Day" at Harvard Business School April 26th, 
featuring Jeff Skilling. Also, Chris and Meg will be in Houston this 
Thursday, Jan. 11th, 'capping off' their work with video interviews with Ken, 
Jeff and Louise, which will help "bring the case to life" for the students 
studying it.

Please forward any edits/corrections/comments to me via E-Mail or via hard 
copy (please deliver to EB 4710, or call me [3-6117] and we'll have it picked 
up).

Thanks  to everyone for all your contributions to this exciting work!

--Christie.

Meg Wozny <mwozny@hbs.edu> on 01/08/2001 09:31:00 AM
Christie:
Congratulations!  I don't know how you manage to work full-time at Enron
and study for a PhD at the same time.  Sounds superhuman to me!

The FedEx was marked for Saturday delivery, but in case you haven't
received it yet, I'm enclosing the draft as an attachment.
It would be great if we could get Enron's approval during our visit.  (I
know professors at HBS are interested in teaching that case as soon as it's
available.)

Thanks for all your help, and let me know if you have any questions,
comments, etc.
Best,
Meg

Mike,

Thank you for your suggestion.  I was hoping that you could either forward 
this
message to Mr. Philippe Bibi or email me his contact information and I will 
get
in touch with him.  We are very interested in having someone represent Enron 
in
our Premier 100 IT Leaders list.

Thank you in advance.

Mike.McConnell@enron.com on 01/05/2001 02:55:56 PM

Allison,

Thank you very much for the email and request.  As much as i an very proud
of our accomplishments while being responsible for Global Technology, I am
still of the opinion that Philippe Bibi is the best and most qualified
candidate from Enron.   Enron has changed its culture and business around
technology and EnronOnline alone changed the way our business operates.
EOL ended the year over with over $330 billion in transactions.  EOL was
only 1 part of our transformation however.

Thanks again and good luck with your award.

Sincerely,
Mike McConnell

Hello again, Premier 100 nominee,

As you may recall,  you were recently recommended  by a colleague for
Computerworld's Premier 100 IT Leaders awards program. This annual list
identifies and honors the most innovative executives and professionals who
are
using technology to transform their business operations today.

We are now reviewing the finalists, but still hoping to hear from you in
time to
include you among those being considered for this prestigious award. All we
need
is a small chunk of your time to complete the attached survey, then return
it by
e-mail to premier100@computerworld.com or fax it to (508) 875-8931 by
Tuesday,
January 9th.

Thank you very much for your time, and we hope to hear from you. If you
have
questions, or if I can help in any way, please don't hesitate to call me
directly.

Sincerely yours,

Cool.  Tape is on the way via Fed ex.  See you in a couple of months and we 
are on for the tour championship.
m

Still taking in the big win.  Seems more incredible in retrospect that it
did at the time.  Stoops could name his price!

I still would like the video.  I know that J.R. would be disappointed if you
paid him for the tickets.  He gave them to me to use as I please.  Let's go
to the Tour Championship and call it even.

Jonny,

Wow what a week.  I still can't believe it.  I will have the video in mail
overnight on Monday.  Sorry for the delay.  Let me know if you got another
copy and don't need it.

Thanks again for the tickets and for driving.  It was fun being with Trey.
I hope B is feeling better and that you had a great time celebrating
Madeline's birthday.  I can't believe you have a teenager.  We are getting
old.

I was showing my ticket off this morning to everyone and someone mentioned
the price of the ticket.  $175!  I didn't realize that when you gave it to
me.  I really don't want your dad picking that up for the two of us.  I
didn't mind his hospitality at $50 bucks but i simply didn't realize they
were that much -  I 've never been to the big dance before.  If your dad
wasn't comped the tickets from OU, Mark and I would like to reimburse him.

Please let me know the situation.

Cheers and Boomer Sooner,
mike

Dear Mr. McConnell, my name is Rudy Hirschheim, and I'm the past Director
of the Information Systems Research Center at the University of Houston.
Enron is a member of our group and I was friends with Alberto Gude, Enron's
former IT Director. I have a request that I wondered if you could help with.

Perez Companc - a big oil and gas company in Argentina - is trying to
understand how some of the big US companies are dealing with IT. Basically
interested in issues such as sourcing arrangements, structure
(centralized/decentralized/distributed), customer relationships, use of
packaged software, 'e' issues, and such like. They want me to try to set up
meetings with some key US companies here in Houston. Among the companies
which I suggested they talk to is yours. Do you think someone/some group
would be willing to talk to a contingent of Perez Companc folks? Would
Enron be willing to share things which weren't considered
competitive secrets with them?? They were hoping to come up either the
first or second week in March. My role is to try to put together visits to
the Shell/Texaco JV, Shell, Texaco, Exxon-Mobil, Conoco, BHP, Enron,
Chevron. Do you think it is possible? Again, nothing of a competitive
nature has to be offered, they just are trying to determine what they ought
to be doing with respect to IT.

Thanks in advance.

Mike,

My apologies for bothering you on your holiday.  Dr. Irani has had the
opportunity to visit with HRH, the Foreign Minister on a couple of occasions
in the past week.  We have been given a few insights that I would like to
share with you.  The most significant is the suggestion that we request
permission from the Negotiating Team to begin discussions with the other
short-listed companies about possible consortium arrangements.  We want to
make sure that Enron is comfortable with that at this stage.  Our intent
would be to have very high-level contacts to guage interest but not to make
any commitments at this point.

Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards and I hope you had a great holiday,

Casey Olson

Cindy, I have addressed this previously with Jeff and Louise Kitchen.  We 
have no interest.  Please co-ordinate with Robert and make sure that someone 
sends him a nice rejection letter.
Thanks,

Hi Mike, 

I just wanted to follow up on the below email.? Hope all is well.

www.petrochem.net 

Dear Mike, 

My name is Joseph Mathew and I used to work with Enron from 1996-1999, where 
I was last a commercial Director as of 1998.? I have worked very successfully 
with Greg Whalley, Jeff Shankman, Fred Lagrasta, John Arnold, Duane Hart, 
Amanda Martin, Harold Buchanan, among others in the past.? I had also 
authored a financial products paper with Louise Kitchens that was published 
by two European trade magazines in the spring of 1997.

I am currently a Vice President and Senior Officer of Chematch.com, a 
Houston-based online bulk petrochemical, polymer and fuel products trading 
exchange.? We founded the firm over one year ago, and things have been going 
quite well.

However, the landscape for our business model, industry market penetration, 
as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue 
success of this company, and I wish to return to Enron, but staying within 
the dynamic, challenging high-tech areas, such as Enron Global Markets.

My responsibilities here at Chematch.com have been multiple-fold.? I have 
been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan (and 
its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that 
permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed 
industry participants, venture capital raising process for three series of 
funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work.

I currently head up all of the Chematch.com content, information and 
analytics efforts, for both cash and paper markets.? I also head up 
Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com.

Prior to joining Enron, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a 
Master of Business Administration in Analytic Finance and Accounting.? Prior 
to b-school, I worked on Wall Street for 3 1/2 years in investment banking 
and capital markets.

Attached is a copy of my resume.? My goal is to procure a challenging 
leadership position within your group in the capacity of Business 
Developement, Corporate Finance, Mergers & Acquisition, or Venture Capital.? 
I would be open to other suggestions.

Please review my resume when you get a chance.? I appreciate that you are 
very busy, but I would very much appreciate hearing back from you if you see 
a fit between what I can offer and what your group is doing.

Tom,
I am fine with this but our effective date is a call of fairness that depends 
on your view of the middle east adjustment.  I don't want to be hard on this 
and get back a bigger number on middle east by default.  Its up to you and 
your judgement on what you think is appropriate and or a trade with Europe.  
I am fine with your ultimate decision.
Mike

Mike,

Attached is the proposed plan transfer to EGM for Enron Japan.  These amounts 
have been reviewed and approved by Joe Hirl.  We are still working with Enron 
Europe to gain agreement on the effective date (April 1 or July 1)  - will 
let you know as soon as this is settled.

Here's a summary of the Plan Amounts;

			 Split after 2Q 
			
			 EGM 
Margin*	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,750,000 
	4Q		      3,750,000 
	2001		      7,500,000 
			
			
Expense	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		      3,366,377 
	4Q		      3,366,377 
	2001		      6,732,754 
			
			
EBIT	1Q		                 -   
	2Q		                 -   
	3Q		         383,623 
	4Q		         383,623 
	2001		         767,246 

If we end up with an April 1 transfer, EGM will be kept whole on plan (will 
be approx $3.4 MM expense, zero margin).

Please advise if you have any questions or wish to discuss this in further 
detail.

John,

Here is a brief email on a possible resolution for the European/Oslo  weather 
situation.  Mark sent this draft to me last weekend but i haven't had time to 
review it this week.  Personally, I think that this is the wrong answer from 
a Corporate perspective but this issue keeps hanging around and isn't worth 
any more of our time.  For what it is worth, I think our communication 
strategy did make a big difference but didn't get us exactly where we needed 
to be.  These groups will be expected (and held accountable) for good and 
consistent communication on an ongoing basis as well.   For a P&L that is 
this small (and negative) we are all spending too much time on this.  There 
is more to this story but I think we should just drop it and move on to 
bigger and better things.

I am certainly not wedded to any of this but would rather focus on all the 
other issues and problems on my plate.  Let's discuss upon your return on our 
weekly call.

Thanks and I hope your vacation was relaxing.

Mike 

ps-this hasn't been shared outside the group on the email.
   
I propose to structure Weather Risk Management in Europe as follows:
 
I have responsibility and authority for all weather related activities 
including: trading (incl. EOL), structuring, origination, research, etc... 
for all of Europe with the exception of Finland, Norway and Sweeden.  I will 
run Europe out of the London office with people reporting directly to me.  
Accordingly, I will allocate V@R and delegate trading authority to personnel 
in the London office. 

I anticipate having Paul Murray run our activities in London. Janine Juggins 
in the London Tax department is establishing the necessary entities and 
addressing the relevant tax issues.  Simon Thurbin in London who reports to 
Todd Hall is identifying a book administrator for our group.  Cindy Horn 
again in London is securing space for an initial 8 to 10 individuals.  We 
have hired an assistant who is multilingual to assist in the setting up of 
our activities.  We are working with Stuart Reed in Houston IT and Brian 
Hudson in London IT (coordinating with Oslo) to ensure that we have the 
infrastructure necessary to trade weather.

In addition to Paul Murray, Ross McIntyre, and the assistant, Catherine 
Woolgar will return to London.  We have also identified an individual in 
London to provide research support. For sturcturing, we will send one 
individual for the Houston group and hire one new employee already identified.

Paul Murray will focus on the management of the office, relationships within 
Europe and the execution of large structured trades.  All other individuals 
in the London office will have dual reporting with a dotted line to Paul and 
a direct line to the group leaders in Houston to ensure continuity and 
accountability.

With respect to Scandinavia, I propse that those activities be treated as 
completely separate with their own V@R and trading authority.  Their 
activities should be limited only to Scandinavia.  The Houston group will 
share infomation and knowledge in the same way that we would with other desks 
within Enron.  Should any of the groups reporting to me wish to take on a 
Scandinavian position, they will have to do so through the Oslo weather 
group.  Likewise, should the Oslo weather group wish to take any weather 
positions outside of Scandanavian, they will need to do so through me.

Paul Murray and I will develop a new budget for Europe taking into 
consideration the time needed to establish our activities.  Oslo will retain 
responsibility for the European budget as originally proposed by Thor Lien.

Thanks for your hospitality.  We had a great time.  
Sooners rule!  It was unbelievable being at the game.
mike

Yes, even better then that!

Greg, 

Mark and I would like to thank you again for your efforts to get us on at

host and please pass on another thank you for us.

Mike and Mark-

I wanted to confirm with you that you have a 2 PM tee time on Wednesday, 
January 3rd at the Doral Resort and Spa's Blue Course (The Blue Monster).  My

Allison,

Thank you very much for the email and request.  As much as i an very proud of 
our accomplishments while being responsible for Global Technology, I am still 
of the opinion that Philippe Bibi is the best and most qualified candidate 
from Enron.   Enron has changed its culture and business around technology 
and EnronOnline alone changed the way our business operates.  EOL ended the 
year over with over $330 billion in transactions.  EOL was only 1 part of our 
transformation however.  

Thanks again and good luck with your award.

Sincerely,
Mike McConnell

Mary,

I would be happy to talk with anyone about this.  The story did have some 
mistakes.  Tom was correct in his statements.  By the way, I never saw the 
draft before it ran.  I think I would have caught the errors.   If I saw it 
before the printing, I must have simply said ok without reading it but 
neither Cathy nor i remember an email on it.

Mike, see the employee feedback below on the JDF story in Vol. 6 of Enron 
Business.  It might be a good idea to talk with MaryAnn Roman de Meza 
(Wellness) about how we might communicate information about diabetes 
detection and treatment to employees.  What do you think?

Hi,
I'd like to suggest you publish something on diabetes to correct what I think 
are misconceptions or inaccuracies in the article "Enron employees set new 
record with walk to knock out diabetes" that appeared in the recent copy of 
Enron Business.  I am not an expert, so you should not publish any of my 
comments, but should contact an expert in the treatment of diabetes.

You quoted Mike McConnell as stating that weight gain is a normal symptom of 
untreated diabetes.  My experience is that weight gain is often a CAUSE of 
diabetes, whereas weight loss is often a SYMPTOM.  It would be useful to 
clarify this, as some people with undiagnosed diabetes could delay seeking 
help on the basis of the quotation made.

The quote "...insulin is not a cure nor does it prevent the development of 
complications.  It is merely life support."  is totally at odds with the 
experience of the diabetics I have known, and could be quite alarming to 
someone recently diagnosed.  Most people on insulin need make only very small 
changes to their lifestyle and diet.  Properly managed diabetes eliminates 
almost all complications - the body effectively functions normally with the 
addition of insulin.  damage caused prior to diagnosis can not be reversed of 
course.  The suggestion that insulin is merely life support is alarming - 
insulin is life support, but not "merely" life support.  Life can be lived 
fully, and while there are probably some activities that can not be 
participated in, I have not met a diabetic who has experienced this.  No 
complex equipment is needed, the treatment is very quick, portable, 
inconspicuous, etc.  It can not be compared to dialysis for renal failure, 
for example, which is much closer to "merely life support".  Even so, many 
people on dialysis still live good lives.

I think it would be very useful for you folks to publish something that helps 
people diagnose both types of diabetes, how they can avoid the adult onset 
type, and the effect on lifestyle of diabetes.  Perhaps you could find some 
nice statistics such as the most common method of diagnosis is when the 
patient goes into a comma due to high blood sugar (at least in some 
countries), diabetes is the leading cause of non-accidental amputations, 
adult blindness, renal failure, etc, and that the materials for a blood test 
cost about $1.

yours

Tom Halliburton

Jonny,

Wow what a week.  I still can't believe it.  I will have the video in mail 
overnight on Monday.  Sorry for the delay.  Let me know if you got another 
copy and don't need it.

Thanks again for the tickets and for driving.  It was fun being with Trey.  I 
hope B is feeling better and that you had a great time celebrating Madeline's 
birthday.  I can't believe you have a teenager.  We are getting old.

I was showing my ticket off this morning to everyone and someone mentioned 
the price of the ticket.  $175!  I didn't realize that when you gave it to 
me.  I really don't want your dad picking that up for the two of us.  I 
didn't mind his hospitality at $50 bucks but i simply didn't realize they 
were that much -  I 've never been to the big dance before.  If your dad 
wasn't comped the tickets from OU, Mark and I would like to reimburse him.

Please let me know the situation.

Cheers and Boomer Sooner,
mike

Thanks for the email.  The game was great and my throat still hurts.  I've 
never been to a better event or had as much fun.  I'll be calling Roberts.

Mike,

Congrats to the Sooners! With that impressive victory (what a defense) OU now 
has seven national championship in football, which surpasses Wichita State's 
six national championships in bowling. Wanted to put it in perspective. Only 
downside to last night is that soon you will be getting an alumni bill to pay 
for Bob Stoops new contract. I sure hope you use this opportunity to call 
Roberts and give him hell about his whining Canes. Did you see their mascot 
get in trouble?

I'm due to meet with you next week on Wednesday, January 10 at 2:00pm. See 
you there.

Happy New Year,
Doug

All,

I came back from the big dance last night.  It was a real privilege to be 
there.  I've been to 15 OU/TX games and the energy, excitement and overall 
electricity in the orange bowl beat them all put together.  It was wild and a 
moment that I will never forget.  
Bob Stoops for president!  He is the king.  

The best was at the end of the game (and everyone stayed around celebrating 
until about 1:30 am) when they said, "there was the Wilkenson era, there was 
the Switzer era and welcome to the Stoops era.  Oklahoma is back".

Boomer Sooner,

Mike

Hi Charlene -

Is this a different reception from the one we have on Mike McConnell's 
calendar for January 16th?  Unfortunately, Mike will be at an off-site 
meeting on the 11th and I do not know if he can make it back in time for a 
4:30 reception.

Thanks.

I just got the tickets the day I left for Telluride.  Why don't we just pick
you guys up for the game.  We aren't arriving until 3:00 on game day.  We're
staying at the Breakwater Hotel on South Beach (305) 532-1220.  I will have
my mobile phone (512) 426-1033.  What Hyatt are you staying at.

Your Spring Break schedule is great.

Pup,

Hope your holiday is going great.  Talked with your office and got your
Telluride number but you guys must be out playing.  OU game is coming
quickly.  Chris is not going down, Mark and I only, and we are arriving to
Miami on Tuesday afternoon and staying at the Hyatt.  We are out on
Thursday afternoon.  Golf on Wednesday afternoon at Doral.  It should make
for a fun trip.

When are you guys going down and where are you staying?  We need to set up
a time to get together and to get the tickets.  Have you heard anything on
Hieple (bad spelling) arm?  If he is healthy I would take the points!

We have made reservations for Continental for spring break but need to make
sure that the timing is fine before we confirm.  We plan to fly out on
Tuesday and return on Saturday.  I have a scheduling problem to get there
any earlier.

Give me a call if it is convenient, (713) 853-1450.  I've got a very light
schedule on Friday, or you can email, whichever is easier.

See you in a couple of days!

Love to all,
Mike

Go ENE stock, we back to 85!

FYI
We just finished the meeting  with Dale Laurance and Casey Olson. Here's a 
recap.

Oxy wanted to meet with Mike for two reasons:

 1) Make sure Enron and Oxy had a project team in place asap and the 
resources are committed to do a world class job on the January 29 submission 
and subsequent presentations. As Mike noted- we are in sudden death overtime 
and the 29th could be the end of the tournament.
 2) Revisit the "street talk" about Enron redeploying capital.

Mike walked through the EGM organization, talked about our stock multiple  
and how an announcement that we were putting huge dollars in Saudi  would 
hurt our stock price.

Dale talked about their low multiple (between 4 and 5), noted that the market 
viewed Oxy as a company that could do deals, buy and sell assets, but really 
wasn't a growth company. They now have a stable cash flow, but need a  new 
beach head in the Middle East to demonstrate they are growing. The point of 
this conversation was to tell us that debt reduction is also a top priority 
so they were also not interested in a big announcement about money being 
dumped into Saudi Arabia

They characterized the Saudi perspective as being one where they are looking 
for strategic partners who will be there for a long time and invest capital. 
They agree on a division of labor: Oxy can do E&P, processing and 
petrochemicals and look to us for pipelines and power plants although Oxy can 
do those too. They realize that only Enron has the marketing, structuring  
and regulatory expertise. 

Casey did revisit his conversation with you about in the end Enron ends up as 
some type of "merchant banker." That's OK in the end- Dale even said they 
would take over our part of any project-- but we can't project that role 
initially. We need to be on the same side of the table as Oxy.

The point here is that we have to be in step with a consistent approach to 
the projects. They expect our competitors to say they'll finance things on 
balance sheet and we need initially to say the same thing although later we 
will open discussions on other ways to finance. Mike and I agree that this is 
probably the biggest sticking point in the discussion today. Oxy believes 
that such an initial statement will never be public and we aren't really 
locked in an on-balance sheet approach. Maybe  we can do this, maybe we can't.

They see this as a year long process with PDA's stretching well into next 
year, and 2002 when the real money would be spent. The short term crisis is  
January 29 and we need a submission with lots of pages: we were criticized 
that although our proposal was well thought through and technically superb, 
it didn't have enough pages- reams of paper to impress  the technocrats.  We 
will also need to prepare a smaller 15 page digest to be used for our 
official February presentation and a three page walk around summary. Casey 
thinks the production center has to be in the US.

We also all agreed that the Jan 29  questions allow us to lay out all of our 
downstream concerns and establish a placeholder for issues that must be 
resolved during the PDA discussions before we would do a project. I have had 
the greatest success around the world when we don't try to force immediately 
on a country  a perfect gas or electric market but adapt to "local 
conditions" and implement the most important first couple of steps with the 
rest to follow later. In this respect,  our projects can include suggested 
regulatory concepts that if successful can be used elsewhere in the Kingdom.

Over and over we came back to the project team which they want on the ground 
in Saudi.  Casey will be 100% Saudi for the foreseeable future and can make 
all decisions. Who will be our lead person with the same authority? They 
don't want to deal with someone who later says Houston changed it's mind ( a 
little arrogant). When can we identify bodies and assignments and location? 
They want full time dedicated people. Either Dale or Casey noted that the old 
Enron would have parachuted a team in by now (Like South America where we 
landed in a swamp and spent the next five years beating alligators over the 
head with a stick). This is a very complicated political and technical 
effort,. The leader has to be good at both. Casey was excited that Rob would 
be assigned to the project (I guess you discussed this with him).

They both were quick to say that the working relationship to date has been 
excellent and that they appreciate the effort we have put into this.

Mike committed that we would go balls to the wall for the 29th deadline, I 
committed that I would designate a project team by the first week in January 
(we had our first conference call yesterday), but Mike said he wanted to 
think about the decision point person and process ( we aren't about to 
sacrifice a deliberative strategic/consensus  thought process because they 
are in a hurry).

We spent a lot of time talking about the process. We agree that the Saudi's 
will eliminate one or two participants, that each project will have subparts 
with different combinations and leads of companies with a master JV on top.   

They minimized the capital investment although they are prepared to spent 
$200-300 million over the next 3-5 years. They see core project 2 costing 
$600 million, 60% Oxy/Enron assuming one other partner and Enron half of 
that. We aren't talking billions (spoken like a true major).

They are sure Exxon /Mobil will be our Red Sea partner if only to earn face  
with possibly Marathon as the other. Exxon is more interested in the chemical 
focus which Oxy will concede to them. Mike noted was that our worst nightmare 
was a partner (Exxon) who would throw away money just to have a presence).  
We were assured that Oxy's only goal was to make money and if he projects 
didn't, they would walk away.

The real danger in the upstream is the risk money for exploration. Oxy hopes 
to hedge this risk with downstream investments (pipelines and plants) and 
hopes that if the exploration is successful and reserves are added it will 
lead to a whole new series of projects.

They are very proud of Oxy's role in this, claim that they were instrumental 
in getting Petry Parkman and Morgan selected as advisors, that Irani is the 
most respected American Arab business man and has  great access in the 
Kingdom, and that they already know what investments partners are acceptable 
to the Saudi's.

We  all left great friends in good Christmas spirit.

From our perspective:

 Saudi is the largest economy in the Middle east and the driver in 
international oil and liquids markets

 Enron needs to get inside and establish relationships with the key Saudi 
people. We need a foot print in the Kingdom with which to earn their 
respect.  Can we do it with minimal capital investment?

 Saudi is about to embark of a complete electric and gas restructuring, 
regulatory included. They want the repatriation of petro dollars and dollars 
held offshore by Saudi nationals.  The country can be a tremendous source of 
capital.

 It looks like 2001 can be managed with a minimum burn rate with the most 
intense period of activity being in January. We  need to set up the team for 
the January effort. I'll have this done by Jan 1. There is the question of 
sorting out conflicts with other ME priorities.

 Although it may be too soon to answer (we don't know yet what is possible 
but we can shape that outcome), what is the end game, what do we want out of 
Saudi Arabia? 

 We seem to have a clear division of labor and strategy with Oxy although we 
need to sort out what we say about on balance sheet financing. We also need 
to keep in mind that our other yet to be met partners will have a lot to say.

 Oxy wants to take the lead on the Core Venture 2 (Red Sea). I agree- this is 
a perfect laboratory to address all of the market structure issues that will 
make the Kingdom a great place to do business.

  Mike- I'm sure you can add more. Rick -it's up to you if you want to send 
this around to the Saudi team.  Merry Christmas.

My January is very bad, how about early Feb?
Mike

Emilio Vicens@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
12/19/2000 01:39 PM
Mike, Jeff and Eric,

With the recent change of the President of PDVSA and the already announced 
departure of the Minister of Energy and Mines in January, there has been a 
significant amount of noise in Venezuela with respect to export projects in 
general.  I believe it is critical for very senior Enron people to make a 
direct pitch to the President of the country as soon as we can arrange one.  
We need to let the President know directly the benefits of the project and 
the strong commitment of Enron to the development of the project.  We have 
alreday done this several times, but it is time to do it again.

I recommend a visit in early January of maybe Frevert or you Mike (maybe 
both). We can also use this visit to have meetings with the new President of 
PDVSA and, hopefully, if there is an official Minister appointed with the new 
Minister.  It is not easy to fit in the President's agenda, so please advise 
the course of action and tentative dates.

Thanks,

Emilio

First Gas is a liquid fuel supply deal executed in May, 1997 that is linked 
to a power plant in the Phillipines.  Volumes were booked at 31,000 barrels 
per day with delivery starting June, 1999 through Dec., 2002.  Fuel 
deliveries did not begin until April, 2000 and have averaged between 
10,000-12,000 barrels per day, well below the volumetric level that was 
booked.   This deficiency is due to delayed plant start-up and reduced 
consumption and has resulted in approximately $1 million per month in accrual 
losses to the Global Products group since April, 2000.  To make matters 
worse, the power purchaser from First Gas has recently announced that they 
are going to minimally dispatch the power plant to which this transaction is 
linked through the end of 2001.

To properly reflect the current volumetric levels associated with First Gas, 
we need to take volumes from the 31,000 barrels per day level that was 
originally booked to approximately 6,000 barrels per day for the remainder of 
the deal.

In addition, freight charges related to this deal have doubled since April, 
2000 increasing from the $.70 originally booked to the current $1.45.  Per 
conversations with John Chismar he expects freight to remain at this level 
for the foreseeable future.

To properly reflect the current costs of this deal, we need to increase the 
Dubai spread to which this deal was booked from $2.91 to approximately 
$3.65.  Initial estimates of the loss resulting from both the volumetric and 
cost proposed write-down of First Gas is $30 million.  We are continuing to 
refine this number and will update you when we get a final amount.

On a final note, Arthur Andersen has repeatedly reviewed First Gas throughout 
2000 and to this point we have been able to spin enough of an argument to 
justify delaying a writedown.  Given the current market conditions discussed 
above (which are publicly known), the size of the writedown and the fact that 
their next review will be for year-end earnings, I believe Arthur Andersen is 
going to require us to write down at least a substantial portion of First Gas 
before they will sign-off on earnings.  Obviously, I have not recently 
discussed this with AA&Co. but I do anticipate this being an earnings issue.

Please call me if you wish to discuss further.  I appreciate any help you can 
give us in this matter.

Dianne,
Thanks for the kind words.  Yes toastmaster has been a big influence in my 
life.  I talk about it often and attribute a great deal of my success to 
that.  I do large speeches quite often and its all back to our morning 
meetings and they seem like they were a lifetime ago.
thanks,

Hi Chris -

Mike asked me to respond on his behalf to find out exactly which dates you 
are referring to in your message below.  We were assuming January 3rd and 
4th, but we did not want to assume incorrectly.  If you are indeed referring 
to January 3rd and 4th, please note that Mike McConnell will be out of town 
January 2nd through the 4th, returning to the office on January 5th.

Please let us know if you will be available on any other dates.  Thank you.

I will be in the office on wed aftn and all day thursday.  I would like to 
catch up with all of
you.  not sure of people's schedules but please advise me of your 
availability and hope 
most of you can make it for dinner on thur.  I will list some important 
things to me that I  would
like to discuss and propose some thoughts on positive changes for 2001.

teamwork/communication/teaching/guidance/leadership -   these are the major 
areas we should be
thinking about how we can improve.  

teamwork - I feel we look at each commodity (crude/light distillates/middle 
distillates/heavy distillates/lpg/
petrochemicals) as a separate business.   try to identify team leaders to 
provide direction for that business,
establish resources required to meet proposed budgets, and work on individual 
limits for the traders in those
groups.  

communication - once we have established global teams this should improve 
significantly.  'the road to hell
is paved with good intentions' and until traders bonuses are directly tied to 
the profitability of someone in 
another office I don't think we will communicate as effectively we need to.  
we have very few niche markets to
exploit that provide us with guaranteed revenues or allow most of our 
physical traders the ability to trade well
without a strong understanding of the push/pull forces at work from the other 
centers.   for the last two years
this has been cited a main area for improvement.  to get to where we want to 
be I feel it has to be done through
global books.   

teaching - given that the growth of the group has shifted away from hiring 
from the outside and toward internal
recruiting we need to focus on how we develop and keep young talent.  also, 
given the lack of depth in our
trading group it is important that our best traders be given the additional 
responsibility for development of 
talent in their teams.    

guidance - I feel that if  we move toward smaller business units it will be 
easier for individuals to understand
what the strategy is and what their specific role in that strategy is.  we 
lost a lot of people at this time last year
and the common complaint amongst all of them was they couldn't see where this 
group was headed.

leadership - with a group of 114 people at last count it is important to 
start thinking about ways to encourage
more people to make a greater  personal investment in making this group a 
success.  not just meeting a
budget but also in creating a  business that will survive the exit of  any 
individual.   a business that will have
a competitive advantage and that those involved in it will be highly 
motivated to keep growing.   

if there is consensus on the need to improve upon the above then we can 
analyse how we go about it.
I believe that by going toward global books we could improve upon many of our 
weaknesses.  chemistry
is the major concern on a such move but best looked at in context of each 
group.  

there are many other important issues such as eol, marketing team, research 
group, recruitment, etc
but I honestly think we have to focus first on how do we make most with the 
exisitng group and then
figure out how to try to build upon it.

look forward to seeing you on weds aftn or thursday and please email when/if 
you have free time to
meet up.

thanks,

chris. 

David,

Thanks for the nice note.  I hope you and your family are having a great 
holiday season.  Please don't hesitate to call me if you come in for a 
meeting, it would be great to see you again.

Sincerely,

Dear Mike,

Thank you for the introduction to David Tagliarino.
We spoke at length yesterday, and he seems like a very
good guy.  He also seemed very receptive to the
possibility of us working together, and I am hoping to
schedule a meeting with him in the near future.  In
the meantime, I sent him some information on our
company, and the players we represent.  I am confident
that we can be of help to you, and obviously, we would
appreciate the opportunity to do so.

I know that you have been very successful at Enron,
and I am happy for you.  I am sure things will only
get better.

If I am fortunate enough to schedule a meeting with
David, I would love to stop by your office and say
hello.  I will keep you posted.  In the meantime, I
wish you and your family a happy holiday season, and
again, I appreciate your help.

Sincerely,

David N. Winkle

Our ability in crude is apparently very poor.  What can J Wilson do thru 
2010?  I want the crude desk to make us a price and present an acceptable 
volume.  

If we have to suggest to PDVSA only doing a crude index through 2012, I 
strongly believe we should try if we can create some additional value thru 
this structure.  Tell me if you would like me to give him a call to explain 
what the effort potentially create.

Thanks
Eric

   

 Per a conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the 
Houston office, the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent 
on a 20 year deal is NOT a possibility.  If we had 1/3 of our GSA price 
linked to Brent our exposure for 20 years would be about 30 million barrels 
notional or about 14 million barrels PV.  At 5% our exposure would still be 5 
million notional or 2.3 million PV.  According to John, he would not be 
comfortable doing anything past 2012 and even out that far he would not 
consider doing more than about 1 million PV barrels in the years 2010 - 
2012.  Given these comments, I would say that the size of our deal basically 
precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time.  As far as the economics 
of the deal are concerned, we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to 
figure out our economics.  I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see 
if we could get a 20 year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that 
the hedging costs would be too high, and therefore have left it at that for 
the time being.   Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue.

Thanks,

Eric

Eric, thanks for your comments. Please see below in blue our observations and 
answers. Let's talk later today if you have further questions.

Guido and Emilio 

Enron Offtake Agreement

Section 2
Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the 
EPC agreement.  Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to 
project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.  In 
addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA.

 The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say. 
The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen 
(that being the earlier of 40 months after Financial  Close or NTP or Dec 31 
2004). We will add to this list "the earlier of" something like: "the date on 
which the plant has produced LNG at at least 90% of its capacity for a period 
of 10 consecutive days". We suggest putting something like this as opposed to 
"commercial hand over" because this is in the plant's/contractor's control 
and they could, for example, on purpose not meet a noise level requirement 
for 4 months  for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract 
while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets.

With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project 
but we, as offtakers, can not wait for ever for the project to be completed 
with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow (directly or 
indirectly) under the project's control. We have 4 months limits to how much 
the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC (or 
another EPC Contractor) already built in.  

Section 6
I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing 
formula associated with expansions.  Structure could be set as in this 
contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of 
Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 
18%.

 We agree that would be better, but we included this section knowing that is 
something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA, because they 
don't want us to sell down and then keep "controlling" new  LNG businesses in 
Jose. They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited 
exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA. We think that 
adding a restriction to the asset's returns now in the draft will make it 
very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause. Thus, jeopardizing our chance 
to control the output of future plants or expansions. We never intended to 
use these off-take agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes. 
Nevertheless, we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial 
control of the output. Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will 
clearly realize what our intent is.

Section 7
Where is the bonus calculation?  We did not include it now on purpose. We 
will include it when ever they "remind" us to do so. We want to have another 
fight about the bonus.
Where is the min price? The minimum price is in. We say that one of the  
terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one
I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number? We are 
going to try to do it, but that is first a GSA issue, and we don't want to 
put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA. We precisely 
bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we 
want to make it zero  
Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics? No, 
we don't have the definitive answer from structuring yet, but our guess and 
based on our meeting with RAC the other day, in which they told us about the 
mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba (Brazil power plant), we are 
pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not 
convenient. But since we don't have a definitive answer yet we still included 
oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting (that should have been 
bracketed in the term-sheet, though, and it will).  

Section 10
you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the 
Equilibrium rate.  Is this your intent to have a mismatch?
 Yes, we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as 
off-taker, and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if 
they do.

you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.  Will the banks 
accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized.  See section 
18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue.
 The exporter of record will be the project, so the buyer has no business in 
Venezuela other than paying port fees. We do not see any kind of taxes that 
could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred 
to the project. Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that 
projects typically take all the time (the heavy crude projects are some 
examples in Venezuela). In addition, the GSA provides for a number of reliefs 
for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel 
safer. Although, a large portion of the underlying risk is always there. 

Other
where are the LD calculations explained?  I think you need LDs for GSA 
default and another for plant default.  GSA default should match LD's in GSA 
contract less compensation to plant debt recovery.
 In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that 
the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better. New 
York law provides for full market based damages (market price of commodity 
plus extra costs) which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD 
clause. So, from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it 
as it is. We are still discussing w/ Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is 
sellable to AA for MTM, but our initial view is that it should be since the 
level of LD can not be better. GSA default is market based (provided that 
PDVSA, as we expect, accepts the change we will propose) so the Project 
Company will be able to pay market based damages. For interruption of gas 
supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out 
if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being 
relieved from performance in such event (this will obviously be to a maximum 
dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time, say 36 months 
- we need time to give you precision on this, but some sort of coverage will 
be available). 

suppose the plant produces 5% less that it is supposed to due to design or 
tech problems (not a FM issue) at commercial hand over.  What happens under 
the offtake agreements?  Will the banks accept this revenue short fall?  Will 
we have to create a reserve?  This may be a big issue with the banks for 
technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry.
  Under the off-take agreements the project pays market based damages if it 
does not meet the contracted volume. We believe that the contracted volume 
that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks 
and equity holders to bear the risk. We are contracting for contractually 
guaranteed production under the EPC which is 3% lower than expected. On top 
of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible 
(meaning a lower LNG volume). This volume is 5% lower than the guaranteed 
production with "Normal" or expected feed composition. Combining these two we 
have a contracted quantity that is 8% lower than the expected production with 
expected feed. On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG 
plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least 10% 
above what was expected (mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners 
making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs). Also the 
EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of 
production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equity-holders 
whole. They don't provide though, for damages payable under off-take 
contracts (nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs). However, 
as we explained, we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by 
producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in 
the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co. Banks will 
most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption, as we already 
did. 

What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is 
resolved? what compensation do the offtakers get? do the banks suffer here as 
well?
 The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to 
determine failure to deliver by Seller. It also establishes that deliveries 
should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant. The bottom 
line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of 
defaults and price differentials. It sets, however, a reasonable standard by 
which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual 
quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur 
based on the "reasonable constant deliveries" provision, damages will be 
payable based on prices during such month. Yes banks suffer here to the 
extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable.  Nevertheless, 
short periods (weeks) of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect 
the Project Company ability to pay the Banks.  It will have to be some 
prolonged period for Banks to be affected.   

Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days.  Will 
the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established.  Is this in 
your model?
 We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard 
(although, we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected). Our 
model assumes the cost of an LC for 6 month debt service (which should be 
plenty). The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same 
or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather 
damages (not BI) are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not 
permitted for MTM reasons. The question that follows is: if damages exceed 
the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its 
obligation to deliver, have the damages have to be senior to debt payments 
for AA to allow MTM to be permitted? If this is so, are the banks going to be 
willing to live with this?, probably not.

insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling.
 It is briefly covered in section 9 second paragraph. This will be expended 
in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to 
PDVSA.

insert termination section
 In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an off-taker than an 
asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better 
protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law 
than if we try to right an early termination clause. They point out also that 
90% of LNG contracts are done in this way, having NY law rule the game. They 
point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and 
prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law.

Enron Offtake Agreement

Section 2
Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the 
EPC agreement.  Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to 
project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.  In 
addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA.

Section 6
I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing 
formula associated with expansions.  Structure could be set as in this 
contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of 
Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 
18%.

Section 7
Where is the bonus calculation? 
Where is the min price?
I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number?
Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics?

Section 10
you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the 
Equilibrium rate.  Is this your intent to have a mismatch?
you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.  Will the banks 
accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalised.  See section 
18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue.

Other
where are the LD calculations explained?  I think you need LDs for GSA 
default and another for plant default.  GSA default should match LD's in GSA 
contract less compensation to plant debt recovery.
suppose the plant produces 5% less that it is supposed to due to design or 
tech problems (not a FM issue) at commercial hand over.  What happens under 
the offtake agreements?  Will the banks accept this revenue short fall?  Will 
we have to create a reserve?  This may be a big issue with the banks for 
technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry.
What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is 
resolved? what compensation do the offtakers get? do the banks suffer here as 
well?
Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days.  Will 
the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established.  Is this in 
your model?
insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling.
insert termination section
put something in about the buyer willing to accept entering direct agreements 
for financing requirements?

I am enclosing a draft of the off-take termsheets to be included in the 
Participation Agreement between Enron and PDVSA Gas. These termsheets will 
rule the following transactions:

  a) Sale of LNG from the Project to an affiliate of  Enron for the plant's 
output minus PDVSA's off-take

  b) Sale of LNG from the project to and affiliate of PDVSA Gas for the share 
of volumes equivalent their equity participation in the Project Co

  c) Re-sale of LNG from the affiliate of PDVSA Gas to the Enron affiliate 
for the volumes purchased by PDVSA according to b) above

Please let Emilio and I know your comments about them at your earliest 
convenience. Please focus on issues with regard to our ability to MTM these 
contracts, such as the force majeure clause. If you have any comments or 
questions during the weekend you can reach me at 713 304-4264 or Emilio at

John,

thanks for the comments.  Absolutely on the trader comment, I forgot.  I like 
the ag business and we are looking at several oppts and making a final 
determination in Q1.  I also think "softs" is a big oppt that is probably 
worth pursuing.  More later.
I like the weather idea as well.

On another note, I met this guy when I spoke at the AA Energy symposium.  He 
runs a power business (i think) in Portugal.  He has attempted to talk to 
someone at Enron in Europe but hasn't heard back.  He has given me his email 
address and requested a contact.  Would you please make sure that someone 
follows up with him.

Thanks for the docusment - I will clearly take the chance to steal some 
of your material for my presentations.  A couple of minor suggestions:

1)  I would generally replace the term "trader" with "market maker"
2)  Are we committed to Ag markets yet?  I have doubts about
     the fit for us.
3)  For Weather how about showing the number of cities for which we 
      make markets?   Also the fact that we trade hot weather, cold weather,
      wet weather, and dry weather.

Regards,

2. revenues
3. on line growth of each
4. size of each commodity;  e.g.:  number of barrels traded, tons of coal, 
tons of freight, etc.
5. other metrics that you think will illustrate the point

 Go back as many years as you can get data.

 Mike:

 I finally got George Damiris' resume (attached) as well as that of Randy 
Balhorn (also attached). I think when you read Randy's CV, you will be very 
impressed. I would go so far as to say that he was the smartest person I knew 
at Koch, and when you see the list of accomplishments that he had there, as 
well as what he was doing with Dreyfuss and Electricite de France, you will 
agree with me that he would be a terrific addition to Enron Global Markets. 
The even better news regarding Randy is that he recently left Dreyfuss due to 
issues with the EDF JV, so he is available immediately and he is very 
interested. He currently lives in London and I think that he knows Joe Gold. 
Please let me know if you would like me to do anything to help facilitate 
this further.  I think George is interested if there was a specific 
opportunity for him here that he felt was an even better fit than what he is 
doing with Koch. The fact that he is moving to Houston makes it pretty easy 
for us to keep having discussions with him. I would say, however, if I had to 
choose which among the two of them would have the most immediate impact if 
hired by Enron, it would have to be Randy, given his experience.

Thanks,

Basil

RAC came by and brought up a couple of concerns.  1- the Var on this deal is 
over $120m (more than all of ENE combined); they wanted to make me aware of 
the size, and they know we are working on it. and 2 - EE&CC; they were 
concerned about them doing the deal and their abilities and effects on MTM 
treatment.  I told them that they can bid on it but we want others to bid and 
that we probably won't use them.  They stated that the deal guys are acting 
like EE&CC is a done deal.

Lets discuss.

Our ability in crude is apparently very poor.  What can J Wilson do thru 
2010?  I want the crude desk to make us a price and present an acceptable 
volume.  

If we have to suggest to PDVSA only doing a crude index through 2012, I 
strongly believe we should try if we can create some additional value thru 
this structure.  Tell me if you would like me to give him a call to explain 
what the effort potentially create.

Thanks
Eric

   

 Per a conversation I had with John Wilson the head crude oil trader in the 
Houston office, the feasability of hedging price risk linked to WTI or Brent 
on a 20 year deal is NOT a possibility.  If we had 1/3 of our GSA price 
linked to Brent our exposure for 20 years would be about 30 million barrels 
notional or about 14 million barrels PV.  At 5% our exposure would still be 5 
million notional or 2.3 million PV.  According to John, he would not be 
comfortable doing anything past 2012 and even out that far he would not 
consider doing more than about 1 million PV barrels in the years 2010 - 
2012.  Given these comments, I would say that the size of our deal basically 
precludes a look at Crude Oil hedges at this time.  As far as the economics 
of the deal are concerned, we basically cannot even get an Offer to use to 
figure out our economics.  I am confident that if we pushed the issue to see 
if we could get a 20 year offer even for a small portion of the volumes that 
the hedging costs would be too high, and therefore have left it at that for 
the time being.   Please advise if you have any thoughts on the issue.

Thanks,

Eric

Eric, thanks for your comments. Please see below in blue our observations and 
answers. Let's talk later today if you have further questions.

Guido and Emilio 

Enron Offtake Agreement

Section 2
Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the 
EPC agreement.  Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to 
project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.  In 
addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA.

 The agreement should start at commercial hand over of the plant as you say. 
The draft as it is now has only outer limits as to when that should happen 
(that being the earlier of 40 months after Financial  Close or NTP or Dec 31 
2004). We will add to this list "the earlier of" something like: "the date on 
which the plant has produced LNG at at least 90% of its capacity for a period 
of 10 consecutive days". We suggest putting something like this as opposed to 
"commercial hand over" because this is in the plant's/contractor's control 
and they could, for example, on purpose not meet a noise level requirement 
for 4 months  for example and delay commencement of the offtake contract 
while the project sells LNG at higher prices than in the term sheets.

With regards to the EPC LDs we agree that they should go only to the project 
but we, as offtakers, can not wait for ever for the project to be completed 
with out receiving gas or damages for something that is somehow (directly or 
indirectly) under the project's control. We have 4 months limits to how much 
the project can be delayed on top of all the conservatism that EECC (or 
another EPC Contractor) already built in.  

Section 6
I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing 
formula associated with expansions.  Structure could be set as in this 
contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of 
Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 
18%.

 We agree that would be better, but we included this section knowing that is 
something that is going to be a very difficult sell with PDVSA, because they 
don't want us to sell down and then keep "controlling" new  LNG businesses in 
Jose. They will oppose this clause as they violently opposed the limited 
exclusivity at Jose that we managed to include in the GSA. We think that 
adding a restriction to the asset's returns now in the draft will make it 
very tough to sell to PDVSA the entire Clause. Thus, jeopardizing our chance 
to control the output of future plants or expansions. We never intended to 
use these off-take agreements as a vehicle to control future LNG volumes. 
Nevertheless, we felt it was a good chance for us to start getting partial 
control of the output. Pushing it too much will back fire and PDVSA will 
clearly realize what our intent is.

Section 7
Where is the bonus calculation?  We did not include it now on purpose. We 
will include it when ever they "remind" us to do so. We want to have another 
fight about the bonus.
Where is the min price? The minimum price is in. We say that one of the  
terms in the price is Pg x En where En is never less than one
I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number? We are 
going to try to do it, but that is first a GSA issue, and we don't want to 
put it here as something firm before we change it in the GSA. We precisely 
bracketed the CPI percentage in the formula because of our thought that we 
want to make it zero  
Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics? No, 
we don't have the definitive answer from structuring yet, but our guess and 
based on our meeting with RAC the other day, in which they told us about the 
mess created by an oil escalation in Cuiba (Brazil power plant), we are 
pretty much convinced that oil escalation without oil based LNG sales is not 
convenient. But since we don't have a definitive answer yet we still included 
oil as a possible escalator with a zero weighting (that should have been 
bracketed in the term-sheet, though, and it will).  

Section 10
you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the 
Equilibrium rate.  Is this your intent to have a mismatch?
 Yes, we did it on purpose because this will apply also to PDVSA as 
off-taker, and they have a record of paying late so we want them to suffer if 
they do.

you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.  Will the banks 
accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalized.  See section 
18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue.
 The exporter of record will be the project, so the buyer has no business in 
Venezuela other than paying port fees. We do not see any kind of taxes that 
could be imposed on Buyer by Venezuela that would eventually be transferred 
to the project. Banks should be fine with this as this is a risk that 
projects typically take all the time (the heavy crude projects are some 
examples in Venezuela). In addition, the GSA provides for a number of reliefs 
for the Project Company that will help Banks and equity holders to feel 
safer. Although, a large portion of the underlying risk is always there. 

Other
where are the LD calculations explained?  I think you need LDs for GSA 
default and another for plant default.  GSA default should match LD's in GSA 
contract less compensation to plant debt recovery.
 In stead of writing an explicit LD calculation our lawyers suggested that 
the sole use of New York law to rule the deal was simpler and better. New 
York law provides for full market based damages (market price of commodity 
plus extra costs) which is the maximum you can get in a negotiation for an LD 
clause. So, from a legal and commercial point of view we much rather have it 
as it is. We are still discussing w/ Brent Price and Cris Sherman if this is 
sellable to AA for MTM, but our initial view is that it should be since the 
level of LD can not be better. GSA default is market based (provided that 
PDVSA, as we expect, accepts the change we will propose) so the Project 
Company will be able to pay market based damages. For interruption of gas 
supply from PDV for Force Majeure reasons our insurance team is finding out 
if the market will cover such risk so that the project can afford not being 
relieved from performance in such event (this will obviously be to a maximum 
dollar limit to be determined and for a maximum period of time, say 36 months 
- we need time to give you precision on this, but some sort of coverage will 
be available). 

suppose the plant produces 5% less that it is supposed to due to design or 
tech problems (not a FM issue) at commercial hand over.  What happens under 
the offtake agreements?  Will the banks accept this revenue short fall?  Will 
we have to create a reserve?  This may be a big issue with the banks for 
technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry.
  Under the off-take agreements the project pays market based damages if it 
does not meet the contracted volume. We believe that the contracted volume 
that we included in the term sheets though has enough of a cushion for banks 
and equity holders to bear the risk. We are contracting for contractually 
guaranteed production under the EPC which is 3% lower than expected. On top 
of that we are considering LNG production with the richest inlet gas possible 
(meaning a lower LNG volume). This volume is 5% lower than the guaranteed 
production with "Normal" or expected feed composition. Combining these two we 
have a contracted quantity that is 8% lower than the expected production with 
expected feed. On top of this it is important to note that every single LNG 
plant in the world ended up with a production capacity that is at least 10% 
above what was expected (mostly due to EPC Contractors and tech partners 
making very safe assumptions on guaranteed volumes to avoid LDs). Also the 
EPC contract being negotiated provides for pretty severe LD in case of 
production shortfalls that are enough to pay for debt and make equity-holders 
whole. They don't provide though, for damages payable under off-take 
contracts (nobody will take this potentially huge exposure on LDs). However, 
as we explained, we believe that this is a risk that is typically taken by 
producers and that we have already taken a very conservative assumption in 
the volume contracted and that should be beard by the Project Co. Banks will 
most definitely also take a conservative volume assumption, as we already 
did. 

What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is 
resolved? what compensation do the offtakers get? do the banks suffer here as 
well?
 The term sheet establishes an annual quantity as the only standard to 
determine failure to deliver by Seller. It also establishes that deliveries 
should be at rates and intervals that are reasonably constant. The bottom 
line is that the termsheets do not go into all the detail about timing of 
defaults and price differentials. It sets, however, a reasonable standard by 
which if at the end of the year seller did not deliver the full annual 
quantity and a particular month can be identified where the deficiency occur 
based on the "reasonable constant deliveries" provision, damages will be 
payable based on prices during such month. Yes banks suffer here to the 
extent that the cause of the short fall is not insurable.  Nevertheless, 
short periods (weeks) of failures to deliver by seller will really not affect 
the Project Company ability to pay the Banks.  It will have to be some 
prolonged period for Banks to be affected.   

Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days.  Will 
the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established.  Is this in 
your model?
 We are not sure off what the banks are going to require in this regard 
(although, we agree that some sort of reserve or LC is to be expected). Our 
model assumes the cost of an LC for 6 month debt service (which should be 
plenty). The issue here is if MTM is going to be able to live with the same 
or longer grace period for damages to kick in under the termsheet and weather 
damages (not BI) are insurable and to what extent if FM relief is not 
permitted for MTM reasons. The question that follows is: if damages exceed 
the insured limits in a FM event that does not relief the project from its 
obligation to deliver, have the damages have to be senior to debt payments 
for AA to allow MTM to be permitted? If this is so, are the banks going to be 
willing to live with this?, probably not.

insert something on planned maintenance timing and scheduling.
 It is briefly covered in section 9 second paragraph. This will be expended 
in later drafts once the PA is signed and we are home free with regard to 
PDVSA.

insert termination section
 In light of the fact that we will end up being more of an off-taker than an 
asset owner in this project our lawyers suggest that we will get better 
protection if early termination is ruled by what is provided under NY law 
than if we try to right an early termination clause. They point out also that 
90% of LNG contracts are done in this way, having NY law rule the game. They 
point out also that from the project point of view banks are very used to and 
prefer having early termination be ruled by NY law.

Enron Offtake Agreement

Section 2
Should this agreement start at commercial hand over of the plant under the 
EPC agreement.  Benefit here is LDs under the EPC for late delivery go to 
project company and project company has no obligation to lng buyers.  In 
addition it preserves your 20 year offtake which should still match your GSA.

Section 6
I would like to see some language in this section describing the pricing 
formula associated with expansions.  Structure could be set as in this 
contract where Pg is to reflect GSA costs and where the combined value of 
Pcpi and Pa should be derived to provide an equity return to the sponsors of 
18%.

Section 7
Where is the bonus calculation? 
Where is the min price?
I thought you guys were going to trade out CPI for a fixed number?
Have you decided that a WTI index percentage does not help the economics?

Section 10
you have incorporated the GSA default rate for late payment as opposed to the 
Equilibrium rate.  Is this your intent to have a mismatch?
you have all new taxes being borne by the project company.  Will the banks 
accept this as the project company will be thinly capitalised.  See section 
18 of the Arcos CTA for ideas if this is an issue.

Other
where are the LD calculations explained?  I think you need LDs for GSA 
default and another for plant default.  GSA default should match LD's in GSA 
contract less compensation to plant debt recovery.
suppose the plant produces 5% less that it is supposed to due to design or 
tech problems (not a FM issue) at commercial hand over.  What happens under 
the offtake agreements?  Will the banks accept this revenue short fall?  Will 
we have to create a reserve?  This may be a big issue with the banks for 
technology reasons and lack of experience in this industry.
What happens if plant starts producing less for a few weeks until problem is 
resolved? what compensation do the offtakers get? do the banks suffer here as 
well?
Under a plant FM issue you may not get BI cover for the first 60 days.  Will 
the banks accept this or will they want a reserve established.  Is this in 
your model?

Lets talks about his one

Guido Caranti@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
22/11/2000 23:34
I am enclosing a draft of the off-take termsheets to be included in the 
Participation Agreement between Enron and PDVSA Gas. These termsheets will 
rule the following transactions:

  a) Sale of LNG from the Project to an affiliate of  Enron for the plant's 
output minus PDVSA's off-take

  b) Sale of LNG from the project to and affiliate of PDVSA Gas for the share 
of volumes equivalent their equity participation in the Project Co

  c) Re-sale of LNG from the affiliate of PDVSA Gas to the Enron affiliate 
for the volumes purchased by PDVSA according to b) above

Please let Emilio and I know your comments about them at your earliest 
convenience. Please focus on issues with regard to our ability to MTM these 
contracts, such as the force majeure clause. If you have any comments or 
questions during the weekend you can reach me at 713 304-4264 or Emilio at 
011 5814 330-9016. Otherwise we would like to discuss this with you on Monday.

Thanks for your input and happy Thanks-giving

Guido

Jonny,

Howdy, I bet you had a great time at the game.  I did watch it and it never 
felt good and I am still amazed at the outcome.  Did it feel different 
actually being there?

Are you going Miami?  Mark and I may be in.  What about you?  I figured for 
sure that you are already making plans.  Also, do you think it will be 
impossible to get tickets?

We are in for spring break.  We will not be able to be there the entire week 
and we are looking at the exact dates and my schedule - but count us in.

If you get a chance why don't you give me a call and we can catch up.

Mike

PS - Enron stock was down $15/share, ouch.  No partiuclar reason mainlly huge 
sector movement.

He sure does not look like a Heisman winner to me.  We will wait to hear
your spring break plans.

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Howdy,

Kansas City will be great.  Thanks for the invite but I can't go.  I pray
that the Nebr. Sooners show up,  not the Sooners of the last 3 weeks.  We
really look awful.  Early peak?

That's great news for spring break.  Let me talk to the boss and let her
know that is still and option and see if it still works.

Thanks,
Mike

Go Sooners.  Shame about Hipel, he has thrown away his Heisman over the
last couple of weeks.  Do you agree?

Speaking of great to be back... we are heading to Kansas City on Saturday.
If O.U. plays in the National Title game we are going to try to go.  Any
interest? I can probably come up with some tickets.

Spring Break for us is also the 12th - 16th.  We have not made any other
plans.  Lets ski in Telluride.

Continental fly's direct from Houston to Montrose, but the flights book
pretty early.  I just checked and there are two flights per day and seats
are available. Let me know if you need help with your travel plans.  We
will
go up on Friday the 9th and return on Sunday the 18th so whatever schedule
you can make is great.  We will have you picked up at the airport, no
problem.

Pelt,

Howdy from Houston.  I hope you had a great Thanksgiving.  I took the week
off and it was what i needed.  I have been working at a hectic pace and was
on my annual sick rotation, although a little earlier than normal.  I
needed the break.  My international traveling is over for the year, thank
God.

Chris and i were talking about life and vacations and spring break came up.
I thought i would send you our information and see if our breaks
co-ordinated and to see if we still wanted to try and get together to go
skiing.  We didn't know if you made other plans or moved on since our last
discussion a while ago.  Our spring break is March 12-16th .

Please let give an update via email when you get a chance.  I figured that
you are in Telluride right now on holiday.

Give my love to all.

Mike

PS - How about those Sooners!  OU/TX wasn't a fluke. Hard to believe, we'll
see what will happen with K State and bowls.  No matter, its been a fun
year.  It is nice to be back.

Jeff, attached is an expanded 1st draft of the memo.  I would like to keep 
this expanded format to show the progress that we have made in the group.

Please make any changes and send back for the next round.  After we both look 
at it 1 more time, we will circulate to the heads of the group for 
commentary.  I would like to have them feel part of the memo.

Mike

Chris, thanks for the email.  I don't have a need.  Thanks for letting us 
know.
mike

Elise,

Thanks for the email.  In August i changed jobs and am now the CEO for Enron 
Global Markets.  I am no longer in the technology sector (although I enjoyed 
it very much and it was a difficult decision to leave).  Please remove me 
from your email list for further HTC events.

Thanks and good luck,
mike

This is good.

Jeff,
I can't sleep and have been cleaning out emails.  Not my favorite past time 
at 2:30am.  I didn't see the draft reorg memo we've been talking about for a 
while.  Please send it to me for my review.  I think it is important to get 
something out and i believe that people expect some changes
Thanks, m.

I couldn't sleep so ive been doing emails, its looking a little better.  And 
I didn't get up in the middle of the night and come into the office.  I think 
I'll try again and can still get a few hours sleep.  

I will be in a little later than I expected, I must drop young Michael off to 
school and cant leave there until 8.

See you in the morning.

Sleepy

John, 
You caught me.  I've been hit again with the bug, the 3rd time in November, 
and the combination of drugs has me wide awake.  I did promise Chris that I 
wouldn't run off to the office when this occurs but she didn't tell me I 
couldn't do a lot of emails from home! - there is always a catch!

Actually I'm back to bed to try again after this one.  

Hope all is well in merry old England.

Cheers,

Guys,

I had an interview with a reporter from the Economist yesterday.  He is doing 
a big story on business changes, online changes, Jeff Skilling and Enron. 
Coal came up a lot and i described my enthusiasm for our coal business and 
our growth.  He wants to put some focus on the coal business and i need some 
facts to get back to him.

What percentage of our coal transactions or business is online?
Speed changes on a typical transaction post and pre online?
Other changes you see or products to develop
International effects
Total coal moved (physical and financial) especially online
Other competing exchanges and why ours is better
Other proEnron facts that illustrate our growing business especially as it 
relates to paradigm changes or online changes

Please feed me this info and if there is something specific that you don't 
want me to say let me know that too but go ahead and give me the answer.  I 
need this information pretty quickly.

Thanks,
m

Thanks for the email and kind words.  

I did recover over thanksgiving and it was nice but I am sick once again and 
cant' sleep.  I am catchin up on this emai at 2:15 wednesday night.  I will 
try and go back to bed after this email.  

Let me know how the contract goes, i don't see any issues.  I actually 
thought it got done and that is why i havent heard anything.

Sooners have looked ugly lately, Saturday will not be a good day for the 
Sooners.

Mike

   
	
	

Mike,

Per our conversation at the Mgmt. Conf. thank you for everything you have 
done for the group and for me. 

I hope you have regained your voice and that the McConnell family has a great 
Thanksgiving holiday. 

Congrats on your JDF efforts. You should be very proud of your fundraising 
for such a worthy cause.

After your Sooners beat KSU again are you going to the Orange Bowl?

I am planning to meet with Shankman next week to discuss my contract or lack 
there of. It seems to have been on the back burner for the last two months. 

Happy Holidays,
Doug

Thor, 
Very creative and i bet everyone had fun.  We need to try it over here.  I 
bet it would go over here as well.  Thanks for sharing the story.

As discussed with Mark, I have set up a summary of what we did to get people 
interested in weather trading at the Marketing event that we had here in Oslo.

Background:
First we wanted to do something new that would promote Enron positively. 
(There are a lot of conferences with happenings for power traders)
Most of the participants were traders or very interested in trading.
Could we do any deals that evening? We invited them because they should start 
doing deals with Enron.
Several of the companies attending needed to change their risk policy to do 
weather deals.

Lottery:
We made a lottery that was similar to a weather deal. But we made the option 
premium to 15,-  Nok and max payment if the option stroked to 100,- NOK. Our 
counterparties should not loose a lot of money, so they paid the premium 
upfront and they was not allowed to sell any options. 
The counter parties, that were the traders and not the companies, did their 
first weather deals with Enron.  It was important that the traders could go 
short or long or both. (Buy both put and call, for the traders that was 
afraid of their possitions) Some bought 10 contracts and they really felt 
that they traded weather deals. 

The most positive in my opinion was that over 20 companies have traders that 
have done weather deals already.

Enclosed

June 10, 11 ,12 the Canadian Energy Research Institute will host a 
petrochemical industry conference in a mountain resort 60 miles from Calgary. 
Our steering committee (Dow Nova, Williams, Shell chemicals, Canadian Pacific 
Railway, BP) has suggested that we ask you to address delegates on Enron's 
leadership role in e-business. I am making initial contact to explore this 
possibility, and to ask if is possible for you to recommend an alternative 
person within Enron, as I have lately learned you have changed positions. 
This is a high level conference for industry decision makers, which will give 
you an idea for this presentation: not necessarily the IT approach, more of a 
business strategy approach. I look forward to hearing from? you.

Best Regards.

uncertainties resulting from the substantial shift in Enron's business 
paradigm.  I look forward to communicating with the individuals you

As you requested, attached below is my resume.

Juiced

By Julia King and Gary H. Anthes
(Nov. 20, 2000) Wall Street analysts and oil industry executives were thick 
among the legion of skeptics who thought Enron Corp. President and Chief 
Operating Officer Jeff Skilling was nuts to launch a Web site for the trading 
of natural gas and electricity over the Internet. 
That was last November, before EnronOnline locked up more than $120 billion 
in transactions in its first few months of operation, quickly establishing 
itself as the world's largest e-commerce company. As of Oct. 11, just prior 
to Enron's report of its third-quarter earnings, EnronOnline had executed 
more than 350,000 transactions, representing a gross value of $183 billion. 
Since then, the $40 billion Houston-based energy giant has elbowed its way 
into several new diversified markets. And it plans to continue its push into 
many more, ranging from railcar cargo space to broadband networking and 
data-storage capacity. 
In doing so, Enron is turbocharging its transformation from a stodgy, 
old-line fuel company to an entirely new kind of business-to-business market 
maker, with information technology and an all-out emphasis on 
entrepreneurship at the heart of its New Economy operations. Enron has been 
so successful in leveraging IT to pioneer new markets that others are trying 
to emulate its approach. 

First to Market 
"Enron often introduces a product before the competition even senses a market 
exists," the company says in its latest annual report. A prime example: 
online trading of data-network capacity. 
Indeed, "there's a low degree of awareness [among carriers] about the 
bandwidth-trading business," and Enron is ahead of the game, says Seth Libby, 
an analyst at The Yankee Group in Boston. 
At present, there are only a handful of network professionals who are aware 
of these capacity commoditization plans, says Libby. But not for long, 
asserts Enron President?? Jeff Skilling. "Within five years, the bandwidth 
market may be bigger than the gas and electric markets," he says. "So for us, 
it could be as big as the rest of our existing energy business." That's 
currently a $35 billion business. 
But critics say trading bandwidth is much more complicated than trading gas, 
especially for a company with little depth in telecommunications. And critics 
add that although carriers stand to benefit from the ability to buy and sell 
capacity, they might prefer to do it through some channel that's independent 
of the control of a single market maker like Enron. 
"Enron's argument is that its trading capabilities are the differentiator, 
and that it need not have deep telecom expertise," says Lisa Pierce, an 
analyst at Giga Information Group in Stamford, Conn. "But I'm not convinced 
it's that simple. Technology isn't a long-term competitive differentiator." 
Houston-based Enron Broadband Services Inc., formed last year, offers IP 
transport on its 15,000-mile fiber-optic network. Enron Broadband Services 
also trades - that is, makes a market by buying and selling - network 
capacity to and from other data carriers, conducting some of the transactions 
on EnronOnline. 
Enron Broadband Services also offers content-oriented services, such as a 
video-on-demand service it will market with Dallas-based Blockbuster Inc. to 
home viewers starting next month. 
"When we started the gas business, they told us we were nuts," Skilling says. 
"They said, 'You're going to sell gas but not own production? How does that 
work?' Then we did electricity and they said we were nuts again, and even 
louder than before. They said this stuff moves at the speed of light; you can 
never create a market. Then in telecommunications, they said we were nuts 
again." 
Despite its share of skeptics, some experts like Enron's prospects in this 
space. "I think aspects of this have the potential to be very big," says 
Libby. "The carriers like the idea of instantaneous provisioning. And I think 
it has a lot of potential [for] . . . selling it to businesses and giving 
them the ability to cut their costs significantly by buying it as they need 
it." 

"We aspire to that kind of model," says Fred Buehler, director of electronic 
business at Eastman Chemical Co. in Kingsport, Tenn. 
"In every sector, there will be one or two innovators who get out front and 
do things differently to create shareholder value," Buehler says. "We're 
trying to be one of them." 
Market Maker 
Stroll through the gas-trading section on the 32nd floor of Enron's 
glistening 50-story headquarters, and the company's technological 
sophistication is immediately evident. Traders like 26-year-old John Arnold, 
who personally executes about $1 billion per day in trades, have real-time 
access to virtually any information that might affect their split-second 
buy-and-sell decisions. 
That information might be a meteorologist's prediction of a 
colder-than-normal winter across the Plains states or a live news report of 
political instability in an oil-producing country in the Middle East. 
Behind the scenes, all of Arnold's trades are instantly analyzed and 
processed by a sophisticated, proprietary risk-management system and then 
updated across multiple back-end computer systems worldwide. Less than a year 
after launching the operation, 60% of the world's gas is traded on 
EnronOnline. 
"What we are doing, no one in the industry did 10 years ago. Eighty percent 
of our income this year is from businesses that didn't exist 10 years ago," 
says Skilling. 
For example, EnronOnline contributed heavily to its parent company's 
third-quarter earnings, which were up 31% to $292 million, compared with the 
same period last year. 
"The change is technology-driven," Skilling adds. "We couldn't do what we do 
without massive amounts of computing capability." In this regard, Enron joins 
a short list of companies that includes Wal-Mart Stores Inc., FedEx Corp. and 
American Airlines Inc., which famously pioneered various mission-critical IT 
techniques to leapfrog competitors and create a whole new class of IT-enabled 
industry leaders. 
Among Enron's boldest ideas is its use of a single, powerful software-based 
trading platform to insert itself as a principal buyer or seller in hundreds 
of different markets. Currently, Enron trades more than 1,000 different 
commodities, such as gold, natural gas and metals, on EnronOnline. 
"The core of our business is our business model, which is a centralized 
risk-management and market-making business model. It just so happens that the 
Internet is just perfect for improving the efficiency of that model," 
Skilling says. 
But as a market maker, EnronOnline stands alone. For starters, unlike most 
other Internet marketplaces, it's free. There are no transaction fees or 
catalog, inventory or subscription costs for users. 
"Enron has broken away from the pack in the last year, in terms of their 
capital growth," says Ian Wylie, vice president of e-business at BP Amoco PLC 
in London. "And e-business is responsible for a lot of this change." 
Even more unusual is Enron's role as a principal in each transaction. That 
means Enron is either the buyer or seller in every trade in which it's 
involved, unlike market makers that simply act as matchmakers between buyers 
and sellers. 
In fact, Skilling, as well as Mike McConnell, who heads EnronOnline's global 
expansion efforts as president and CEO of Enron Global Markets LLC, dismisses 
much of the current hyperactivity surrounding other fee-based 
business-to-business exchanges as a flash in the pan. 
"[Many of the] B2B guys think all you have to do is set up a bulletin board 
and people will start transacting, but it doesn't work that way," Skilling 
says. "You need to know you can deliver if push comes to shove." 
As either the seller or buyer in all of its trades, Enron, an established 
brand name with 32,000 miles of pipeline and deep financial pockets, 
guarantees delivery or payment on all trades that are executed on 
EnronOnline. 
"We're creating markets that were highly illiquid, so someone has to put 
their reputation on the line to say, 'We'll deliver,' " Skilling says. 
But guaranteeing delivery also requires having guaranteed access to physical 
assets such as network bandwidth and papermaking plants. Guaranteed access 
also ensures marketplace liquidity. For Enron, this is where the bricks and 
mortar come in. 
For example, to help drive its liquidity in the pulp and paper market, Enron 
paid $72 million in July for Garden State Paper Co., a recycled-newsprint 
mill in Garfield, N.J. 
Skilling's current market fancy is metals, and in May, Enron bought MG PLC, a 
London-based metals marketer. "You have to break the liquidity logjam, and to 
do that, you have to take a risk position," Skilling says. 
But once the logjam is cleared, Enron is just as likely to sell off the 
brick-and-mortar assets it acquired and use the cash to invest in new 
business. 
For example, to finance its new bandwidth-trading operation, Enron is selling 
Portland General Electric Co., a Portland, Ore.-based power producer that it 
bought in 1997, so it could bring liquidity to and guarantee trades in the 
online electricity market. 
Eventually, Enron may end up trading commodities that aren't even considered 
commodities - at least not at the moment - such as data storage capacity or 
empty railcar space. 
"Might we move into sauces or meats or grains? Potentially," says McConnell, 
who was Enron's de facto CIO before moving into his current role. 
"You have to be creative every day," McConnell says. "You have to be 
open-minded to trying new things." 
But what remains constant throughout all the upsizing and downsizing is 
Enron's core IT-enabled business model, which is what puts it in a class of 
its own, analysts say. 
"People have talked a lot about systems that they're about to roll out, but 
there is just not much out there for direct trading," says Mike Heim, an 
energy analyst at A.G. Edwards & Sons Inc. in St. Louis. "Enron rolled out 
its technology 10 months ago, and still there isn't much else out there. 
There hasn't been much competition [because] there isn't anybody in the same 
class." 
But just last month, Houston-based Dynegy Inc. launched Dynegydirect, an 
Internet-based, commission-free trading site for energy and communications 
commodities. 
Also last month, IntercontinentalExchange in Atlanta, whose partners include 
BP Amoco and The Hague-based Royal Dutch/Shell Group, added natural gas and 
power to its online trading system, which already included precious metals 
and crude oil. 
Skilling doesn't get called "nuts" much anymore. In fact, he's a darling on 
Wall Street, where Enron's stock has soared from around $40 per share last 
November to $81 as of this Nov. 2. As a result, Enron - by all accounts, an 
Old Economy gas pipeline company until 12 months ago - is widely regarded as 
a New Economy pioneer. 
Says Skilling, "We like to say we were B2B before there was B2B." 

Thriving On the Unconventional 
As head of two Enron pipeline subsidiaries, Mike McConnell knew a lot more 
about gas flows than he did about data flows last year when he got a surprise 
call from Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Jeff Skilling. 
Recalls McConnell, "Jeff went into this whole thought process about how the 
Internet is changing everything. He said, 'We need to make Enron an 
e-business, and I need a guy that can run this as a business. We need to 
change the way we view technology.' 
"I thought he was a little crazy and I said, 'Jeff, I'm not a technology 
person at all,' He said, 'No, seriously - this is going to be big.' So I took 
over as CEO of Enron Global Technology," and thus became the company's de 
facto CIO, McConnell explains. 
Appointing a person with no technology background to the top IT post is an 
unusual move. But Enron often defies convention and typically thrives as a 
result. Indeed, Enron boasts an entrepreneurial culture that's unusual in 
large, long-established companies, and in utilities firms in particular. 
McConnell relates the tale of how 29-year-old Louise Kitchen, Enron's head 
gas trader in Europe, spearheaded the creation of an online gas-trading 
system, recruiting IT people from elsewhere in the company to do the 
development work. Word of the Web-based platform, EnronOnline, which is 
literally remaking the company, didn't reach top management until a few weeks 
before it went live. 
Kitchen enlisted the support of Enron's initially skeptical top traders, and 
she scoured the company for software developers and other experts. Her small 
army of volunteers worked nights and weekends on the project while carrying 
on with their regular jobs. 
"It's an amazing story about not getting corporate approval and going through 
all the bureaucracy," McConnell says. "No one went to the board and said, 'We 
want to change the way we trade.' You just do it." 
Glowing Endorsement 
Soon after McConnell became the de facto CIO of the $40 billion energy 
company, he joined eight of Sun Microsystems Inc.'s top Houston customers at 
a breakfast hosted by Sun CEO Scott McNealy. 
"I was very nervous," recalls McConnell, 40. "I mean, McNealy is the guy, and 
here I know nothing about technology. I'd been on the job maybe two weeks." 
McNealy asked the attendees - all but McConnell were middle-aged CIOs with 
many years of IT experience - to introduce themselves in turn. 
"When Scott came to me, I said, 'I'm the CEO of Global Technology, and we 
want to be the leader in B2B commerce in the world.' He kind of sat back and 
said, 'How long have you been in the IT business?' " McConnell explains. " 
'About nine days,' I said, 'and we are going to take a little bit different 
approach to technology.' Scott chuckled and said, 'That sounds like Enron; it 
always looks at things differently.' He then stated that my CEO title and 
Enron's approach were very unusual but that it would be more commonplace 
soon, as this was the way of the future." 
McConnell says McNealy's endorsement had "a huge impact" on how he structured 
IT at Enron during the following year. 
"I realized that we weren't too late to change our approach and take a 
commercial view of technology," he says - a view of IT as an integral part of 
the business, not as something that supports business functions. "None of the 
other companies were thinking our new way at all." 
Taking a commercial view of IT has led to a blurring of the line that 
traditionally separates IT organizations from the business units they 
support. When McConnell became CEO of Global Technology, Enron had five CIOs 
who were predominantly operating independently inside the company's major 
lines of business. 
"Each CIO had his own agenda, his own thought process, his own goals, and 
they did not communicate at all," he says. 
McConnell established corporate standards for IT, created a management team 
that included the five CIOs and put all IT people under a new chief 
technology officer, Philippe Bibi. 
But IT is far from centralized at Enron. "We wanted to make people think 
about technology not as IT and support, but as an extension of your 
business," he explains. "So we seeded people out into the business units. 
[IT] directs the performance review process, but the business units have the 
greatest influence on where the person actually ranks and is rated." 
Firms like Enron that merge IT departments with the business units they serve 
will be the winners among fast-paced e-businesses, says IT organization 
expert Robert Zawacki, president of Zawacki and Associates in Colorado 
Springs and a professor emeritus at the University of Colorado, also in 
Colorado Springs. "We need more entrepreneurial leaders in IT, and 
[McConnell] is certainly one," he says. 
IT makes it easier to be entrepreneurial, says McConnell, who is now 
president and CEO of Enron Global Markets. "We really do like to try things 
and see what happens, and when you have an electronic platform like 
[EnronOnline] that we can model into different sectors, it's very inexpensive 
to try it. We are not afraid; if it's not working, we'll just stop." - Gary 
H. Anthes and Julia King 

						
						
						

William,

I am very interested in both the Signac and Cross.

A few  questions about the pieces.  You referenced Meier Graefe for "Pan" for 
both pieces.  I don't know what that means could you please clarify?  Also I 
don't understand the reference to an Album.  Is the Signac numbered?  Are 
either signed on the stone?

Thanks,
mike
 

Dear Mr McConnell

Thank you for your e-mail of the 20th October. I apologise for the slow
reply but I was travelling when it was received at the gallery.

I now have 'pointillist' colour works by Cross and Signac which might be of
interest to you. Both are from the collection of one of my clients.

The Signac is similar to the work that you liked on the website. The
details are:

Paul Signac Le Soir - Evening Jetty at Flessingue

Dear Mike,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me this afternoon in spite of your 
busy schedule.  Your encouragement is appreciated, especially in light of the 
uncertainties resulting from the substantial shift in Enron's business 
paradigm.  I look forward to communicating with the individuals you 
suggested--in particular, Randy Maffett, Per Seska, Mark Tawney, and Eric 
Gonzales.

As you requested, attached below is my resume.

Jim,

Thank you so much for all your help on this matter.  I know how difficult 
your job is day to day without items like this popping up.  I spoke with 
Carol Randall and Cindy Levi, the principal of the school, and they are so 
appreciative it is hard to describe it.  The school constantly talks about 
Enron and hundreds of children are using the donated computers and now 
printers.

Thanks again and have a good holiday.

Sincerely,
Mike McConnell

Several developers in your groups have asked questions recently concerning 
the future of EECC and whether EECC would be there for them in the planning 
process for future Enron turnkeys.  Some of these turnkeys, like Venezuela 
LNG, we are currently working on but there's some uncertainty in their minds 
whether or not we'll be allowed to do the project.  Let me clarify the 
current situation.  

Lou Pai and I have briefed Jeff Skilling as part of the 2001 budget process 
and obtained his approval for EECC to continue with the following role:  

EECC will manage Enron's technical and engineering risk for large asset 
construction projects.  EECC can perform the Enron turnkeys when we mutually 
agree that we have the market price and schedule.
EECC will shut down third party work (not related to Enron projects except 
for NEPCO and power projects).
EECC will leverage its approach to technical engineering and construction 
risk management to develop new products and services, for example, lender's 
engineering due diligence, etc.
EECC will develop an Enron Construction Risk Book for all Enron projects, 
including NEPCO.  (This process is underway with the help of Rick Buy's group 
and should be completed by mid-December.)
EECC will transition NEPCO into our project power company.  I'm beginning 
this transition by moving the Enron Brazil projects and their project teams 
under the NEPCO umbrella.  However, NEPCO cannot manage the Arcos project in 
Spain, which has already begun engineering, and I will grandfather Arcos (and 
probably the second project in Spain) inside EECC.

As before, business units can bid for outside prices and schedules.  I think 
in that regard nothing has changed.  I would like to continue working with 
your teams to continue looking for the best deal for Enron on every project, 
whether that's an EECC/NEPCO EPC or an outside EPC.  I think we expect to 
manage the outside contractors when a decision is made that the best choice 
for a particular project is a third party contractor.  I would like to follow 
up and meet with you in due course to answer any other questions.

Wendy Gramm invited Jeff Skilling to attend a social event for Senator Lugar 
(R-IN) in Dallas on Sunday, November 19th.   Jeff is going to be out of town, 
so I wanted to know if you are interested in attending on Enron's behalf?  
I'm told it's going to be a small gathering of CEOs from Texas companies.   
Senator Lugar is the Chairman of the Senate Ag Committee, which has primary 
jurisdiction over the Commodities Exchange Act legislation.   Lugar is a 
senior player on ag issues, and will be very influential in the farm policy 
debate -- which begins anew next year.    He's also involved in foreign 
relations issues, and is pro-trade.

Let me know if you're interested (and available) to attend this event, and I 
will get additional details to you asap.

Mike,

We met back in the early summer and made a presentation to you, Steve Horn,
and Allan Sommer regarding SeaLogistics.  Since that time, we have completed
a merger with one of our primary competitors, launched our bulk
shipping/e-chartering exchange and now have begun trading on the site.  We
currently have support from charterers representing approximately 10% of the
global petroleum shipping spot market volume and from ship owners
representing approximately 15% of the large tanker fleet.

I saw that Enron announced last month its entry into the freight futures
market for bulk petroleum shipping.  Given this event and our marketplace
momentum, I thought it may make sense to have a more strategic discussion
around possible opportunities between Enron and SeaLogistics.

Please let me know your interest in discussing further a potential joint
opportunity.

Brad

It is my understanding that the office of the chairman will be distributing 
the attached memorandum to all employees on June 7.  Furthermore, it appears 
that the policy committee recommended that business unit heads send e-mails 
to their staffs, echoing and supporting these recommendations.  We would be 
pleased to prepare a draft for your consideration, if you would like to send 
out such an e-mail to the EGM staff.

Mike:

I enjoyed your remarks and meeting you after your speech.  I remain quite
interested in your comment that Enrononline expects to trade more coal that
natural gas or electricity in the future.

As we discussed, we are the dominant software fossil fuel developers in the
generating space, having our operating systems installed in 23 of the
largest generating companies.  The largest of our customers are also the
largest consumers of coal, and include TVA, Southern, AEP, First Energy,
CP&L, Exelon, New Century/Excel, and Southern Energy, among others.  At
several of the companies' request, we have developed our Fuel Optimizer
Module (FPO), which tells the fuel buyer what the delivered cost to a plant
specific specifications is, once the coal cost is factored into the
equation.

Attached is an overview of our system, and the specs on the FPO.  Please
forward these on the appropriate people in your organization.  I look
forward to hearing from them.

Thank you for your time.

I received a message from Mike McConnell yesterday about co-ordination in  
the middle east. I think ur experiences with EBS relate to some people who 
may have visited ur region before I took over. I do not think that u will 
have a problem working with Anil. He understands the sensitivities and has 
worked in the Middle East earlier for over 5 years. I have asked him to 
co-ordinate with ur team. Pls help him get started.

Dear Rick,

You might remember me; we met in September when you visited Metgas in Mumbai 
with the LNG team. At the time I presented a piece on the MetGas equity sale 
and opportunities of cooperation with the Indian Oil Company.

Following Sanjay's new role in the organisation, he has now charged me with 
developing the EBS business in the Middle East. In this regard I had a 
telecon with Mac McClelland yesterday, the details of which are copied in the 
mail below. 

I would like to visit Dubai possibly next week to see the Dubai Internet 
City, meet with senior officials at the Internet and Media cities to identify 
what opportunities there could be for EBS.

We look forward to closely cooperating with you and your team in Dubai.

With best regards,   Anil

Mac,

You would be aware that Sanjay Bhatnagar has been given the responsibility of 
managing EBS business in the Middle East and Asia and our team reports 
directly to him. We are currently wanting to develop an EBS strategy for the 
Middle East. For this objective Amr Ibrahim (Director, Regulatory) and myself 
would like to plan a visit to Dubai in the near future (possibly early next 
week). We would like to have a half hour conference call with you today to 
discuss this visit. Based on your exposure and presence in Dubai, we would 
like to seek advise from you on the below, which would be the objective of 
our trip;

Dubai Internet City. We are well aware of this tremendous infrastructure that 
has been developed in Dubai. Our information is based on what was available 
on the web. We would like to see this facility, meet with the relevant people 
in the Communications group and establish what business opportunities could 
be available for EBS. From our understanding, the DIC infrastructure has 
being developed by Siemens, Sun and Cisco. Fibre connectivity is provided by 
a local telecom party. 
Business potential. We would be developing a business plan for the Middle 
East region and would like to identify what support we could get from Enron's 
immendate presence in the region, in the way of direction.
Immediate business opportunity. What are the low hanging fruit for EBS in the 
Middle East region and what are the first areas we should focus on that would 
give us success, to quickly neutralize cost.
How do we get multiple entry visas for Dubai. Is it possible to get a one (or 
three) month visa. Can we them for coming Sunday or would it be a rush? We 
have Canadian and Danish passports.

I will call you at 12 noon (Dubai time) this morning. 

With best regards,   Anil

we could offer employees.....I will meet with him in the near future!!!!!!!!

FYI
Just received return phone call from Ito van Lanshot at Reliant.  I 
referenced earlier telecon between Bob Harvey and Mike McConell regarding 
possibilities on coal side.  Ito mentioned that he has an on-going dialog 
with John Sherriff regarding joint opportunities.  I explained nature of 
delivered coal deals we are doing in UK/Germany/Spain and expressed interest 
in similar arrangement in ARA ports - mentioned I had on-going dialog with 
Peter Davies.  He responded that they are evaluating continuing relationship 
with GKE on and on-going basis.  He would be interested in hearing more about 
nature of deals we are doing - he will get update from Peter Davies on status 
of GKE relationship and then would like to schedule a meeting in either 
London or Amsterdam to discuss possibilities.  Said he would touch base with 
John Sherriff (or directly with me) during the next 2 weeks.

Will keep everyone posted.

John,
 I previously asked you to quantify the global size of your business (in 
Billions) and you sent me a voice mail on it.  I have misplaced that note and 
don't remember the global size for the presentation.  Please re-provide as a

Sorry for the inconvenience.

Please followup and send her a copy.  I am not sure which one she is 
referring to however.

Hi Mike, 

I am an account manger in the San Ramon, CA office.  I am also an MBA 
student.  I am currently taking a class in marketing and my group will be 
doing a presentation on E-commerce and how it is affecting the way businesses 
are marketing to their customers (and even how they decide what customers to 
market to).  I came across your powerpoint presentation on the EnronOnline 
website and found the information to be extremely relevant and useful to what 
we plan on covering.  Would it be possible to get a copy of that presentation 
from you?  Also, would you be able to provide more insight on how you feel 
the internet has made an impact on the energy industry?  I recently heard 
that a couple of other utilities (I believe Duke and Sempra) are also putting 
together plans for e-commerce websites.  What are your thoughts on that?

Any insight and information you could provide would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks, 
Renee Fernandez

Many thanks for all of the support in the placement of the former CALME 
employees.  We are done to just a very few at this time.

It appears that your new squad is getting some traction on building the LNG 
business.  I'm pleased to hear that.

I look forward to hearing how our transportation or logistics business is 
developing.  Perhaps we can get together sometime during the San Antonio 
conference to catch up.

All the best.  Shawn

'Dot-coms' explain how they hope to compete in intermodal market and among 
themselves 

With some 150 websites devoted to transportation, e-commerce companies 
acknowledge that it's difficult for potential customers to cut through the 
confusion and figure out who's doing what and who's going to be with them for 
the long term. 

Because of the competition between their respective railroad partners, one of 
the bigger questions for intermodal shippers is the relationship between 
Arzoon and Freightwise. There has been speculation that after Freightwise was 
established by Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway, four competitors -- 
Union Pacific Railroad, Norfolk Southern, CSX and Canadian Pacific Railway -- 
teamed up with rival e-commerce site Arzoon in a response to BNSF's proposed 
merger with Canadian National Railway. However, both Freightwise and Arzoon 
claim that's not the case. "I'm continually asked, 'What's up with the four 
railroads and Arzoon?'" said Charley Eisele, UP senior vice president, 
strategic planning. "People are trying to make a whole lot out of the 
coincidence of these two things from a timing perspective. The reality is, it 
was a decision made on the underlying business model." 

Freightwise executives agree with that assessment, pointing out that because 
the industry happened to be divided along merger lines at the same time the 
railroads were aligning with e-commerce initiatives, it seemed too much of a 
coincidence that the same four railroads opposing the merger were the ones 
joining Arzoon. However, "I think to launch a company like this takes more 
than just a reaction to a merger," said Freightwise Chief Marketing Officer 
Sanjay Joshi. 

There are major differences between the two Internet companies starting with 
their business plans. Arzoon categorizes itself as a "shipper-centric 
transportation management system," whose target market is the roughly 80 
percent of the transportation business that currently moves under contract. 
Freightwise, on the other hand, classifies itself as a transportation 
exchange and is targeting the remaining 20 percent of the market procured on 
a spot basis. Arzoon, whose primary focus is the shipper, is setting out to 
help manage the relationships that already exist between shipper and carrier. 
The priority for carrier-focused Freightwise is to make sure the capacity is 
there for shippers who log on to their system. 

In addition, Arzoon, which currently is involved only with rail and truck, 
wants eventually to become a transportation management system that "manages 
across all modes and borders," including ocean and air freight, said Eisele. 
Freightwise will stick to truckload and inter-modal for the time being. 
"We're not sure about getting involved with air freight, given the size of 
the market and the economics," said Joshi. "It takes a different set of 
products and economics than surface transportation. Maybe sometime down the 
line, but right now we really plan on getting entrenched in the truckload and 
inter-modal spot market. We think that's a lot to chew. The key is to focus 
on a particular footprint that we can begin to own rather than get too broad 
and lose focus." 

The fact that Arzoon and Freightwise have teamed up with different rail 
carriers is another cause for concern. Will there be a disincentive on the 
part of carriers to use each others' e-commerce initiatives and ultimately, 
therefore, a disadvantage for prospective customers? 

"The answer is the 90-10 rule," said a source from an Arzoon rail partner. "A 
particular shipper is in a position where 90 percent of their business is 
conducted via truck and other modes, and maybe only 10 percent via railroads. 
If the choice presented to them is to select a system that addresses all 
modes effectively or one that only addresses a particular mode, then the 
90-10 rule would suggest that greater leverage would lie in picking the 
broader, multimode transportation management system. In that case, even 
though a railroad may have another (e-commerce) approach, it would clearly 
have to respond to the customers' needs in that situation." 

Freightwise's Joshi makes a similar argument. "Freightwise is merely another 
channel for BNSF to market its services," he said. "It posts a certain set of 
rates for what it believes to be fair for the service. It's not for 
Freightwise to decide what rates BNSF decides to move through its channel." 
UP may not decide to post its rates on Freightwise, Joshi said, "so then BNSF 
would have to find out what's the competitive rate relative to UP." 

Another question arises as to whether Arzoon may have a competitive advantage 
over Freightwise, particularly from an intermodal standpoint, because it is 
backed by both Eastern and Western carriers. whereas Freightwise is backed 
only by BNSF. "I would only say that the partnership we have with BNSF is not 
exclusive and that we're talking to other railroads as well," Joshi noted. He 
added, "This is an exchange to market your capacity and services. It would be 
very difficult for six railroads to do something on their own; there would be 
no critical mass. It's to the advantage of the other railroads to 
participate." 

Along with BNSF, which provides Freightwise with instant capacity, the 
company recently signed GE Corp. as an "anchor tenant" and equity investor 
that will help Freightwise reach the critical mass Joshi talks about. As both 
a major supplier to the rail industry (locomotives) and a potential shipper 
(appliances), "the goal is to use GE as something we can leverage, and work 
with their respective divisions as a way to reduce their transportation 
costs," he said. 

Visibility is a key advantage for potential customers of both Interment 
companies. "As a transportation management system with access to all modes, 
it allows shippers to be more efficient in the management of transportation," 
Eisele said. "Cross-modal visibility means that because they'll be managing 
their truck business under the same system as rail, the economics of rail 
will be much more visible. And we believe that with comparable reliability, 
the economics will be compelling to the point where rails will garner a 
greater share of those customers' total transportation buy." 

Joshi claims a big difference between Freightwise and other exchanges is that 
when a shipper is looking for transportation options between specific 
origin-destination pairs, Freightwise allows customers to make side-by-side 
comparisons between truck and intermodal. It is this price and service 
transparency, Joshi says, that will save its customers money: "We're giving 
customers three to five choices between truck and intermodal, not 50, so that 
they can see service and price parameters." 

Intermodal e-commerce ventures such as Freightwise also bring up the question 
of competition with traditional intermodal marketing companies. Joshi points 
out that its fee for doing a lot of what small and midsize IMCs do currently 
-- such as load matching, tracking and tracing and order processing -- is 3 
percent, which is split between the buyer and seller of the services. This 
compares to the 18 to 20 percent that customers traditionally have paid for 
retaining an IMC. "I don't think all brokers will embrace us," Joshi 
conceded, but at the same time, "there will be a segment of brokers who will 
begin migrating into higher-added-value services, for example, the 
third-party logistics side rather than the classical brokerage. They'll get 
into things like inventory management on behalf of shippers and leave 
back-end processing to firms like Freightwise." 

Webmodal, which is a purely intermodal e-commerce venture whose vision is to 
"make intermodal much more like truck in the eyes of the shipper," points out 
that it can take customers several days to receive a bid from a traditional 
IMC. "We can immediately configure door to door intermodal solutions that we 
can put together using our underlying carrier relationships," said Webmodal 
founder and CEO Chris Kravas. "We do business with a lot of large U.S. 
railroads and with 37 drayage companies. We give everybody access to all the 
information they might need to make decisions on price vs. service tradeoffs, 
and which carriers make most sense based on what the shipper is trying to do. 
And we do it without the traditional one-to-three-day wait that typically 
happens in response to a normal request for (intermodal services)." 

Kravas said the company has invested time and expertise in developing what it 
calls a "first-ever" schedule engine that works door to door. "Traditionally, 
the industry hasn't had a schedule engine that involves the 
'dray-plus-rail-plus-dray' services, so there's been pretty much a reliance 
on rules of thumb. But the truth is, it doesn't take anywhere near eight days 
for most origin-destination pairs. We have a very robust way of representing 
the capabilities of the dray carriers as well as the rail carriers, so that 
much more truck-like transit can be shown to be viable." 

Because of this, Webmodal sees itself as more of a technology and e-commerce 
company than a traditional IMC, and considers itself more a vendor than a 
competitor. How does a small or midsize IMC work as a customer of Webmodal? 
"Not all small IMCs are set up to do business with all of the railroads or 
with a large set of drayage companies," Kravas said. "What we do for them is 
give them a low-cost way to access, a comprehensive array of intermodal 
products and services available in the U.S. We've established ourselves as a 
business partner with a large base of first-rate drayage companies across the 
country. So if you're an IMC with an opportunity to handle freight in a new 
market, Webmodal allows you to put together a service and pay only a modest 
fee." Kravas wouldn't disclose the company's fee structure, only that it 
charges per shipment for a web-based order and a "slightly higher" fee for a 
phone or fax order. 

A smaller IMC also could use Webmodal to put in place a private version of 
its technology that would enable the IMC to better manage its business. "That 
would range from pricing, order fulfillment, customer service -- kind of the 
whole spectrum of capabilities that would allow an IMC to take advantage of 
our system," Kravas said. 

Everyone's waiting to see who's going to survive the transportation dot-com 
fallout. Before that happens, however, Freightwise may find itself as big a 
competitor with Arzoon as it is with a company like Webmodal. "We're starting 
from different points," said Freightwise's Joshi, "but down the line, yes, I 
can see" more head-to-head competition between the two companies. 

In addition to establishing itself in that 80 percent of the market devoted 
to transportation contracts, UP's Eisele notes that Arzoon also has a 
catalog-capability function, which eventually can be used to auction capacity 
in the spot market -- the market in which Freightwise is establishing itself. 
"We will very much have the capability to enable spot market buying," he 
said. 

As Webmodal's Kravas pointed out, "It's going to be an interesting next six 
months." 

Arzoon-A.T. Kearney partnership 

Consulting firm A.T. Kearney, a unit of Dallas-based EDS, and Arzoon, which 
provides Internet-based services for managing transportation work processes 
worldwide, have formed a strategic alliance. 

A.T. Kearney was one of the first to establish a dedicated practice helping 
shippers manage transportation more effectively on a global basis. Its 
clients now will have direct exposure to Arzoon's transportation management 
trading network, which provides online services for managing the full life 
cycle of work processes across all modes, systems and enterprises. 

Similarly, Arzoon and its clients can access "select" A.T. Kearney consulting 
services, the company said. That includes inbound transportation management, 
supply-chain and distribution rationalization, carrier selection and process 
improvement, Arzoon said.

"Superior transportation management has emerged as a critical success factor 
in the increasingly competitive world of commerce," said Randy Garber, 
transportation services co-leader of A.T. Kearney's operations services 
practice. "We think service companies, manufacturers and retailers that 
incorporate the speed, simplicity and efficiency of the Internet into their 
supply chains will lead their markets." 

The plan is for both A.T. Kearney and Arzoon to gain valuable understanding 
and insights into how the Internet creates great efficiencies in both the 
strategic and tactical needs of transportation professionals, Garber added. 

"We believe that the knowledge gained from this collaboration will benefit 
our clients as well as Arzoon's customers involved in the $1 trillion global 
freight transportation market," Garber said. 

An Arzoon official said the company was "very pleased" to be associated with 
A.T. Kearney, which Arzoon described as a "premier problem-so1ver." A.T. 
Kearney has a global presence that includes 62 offices in 37 countries. 
Arzoon.com, San Mateo, Calif., is a year-old Internet startup that describes 
itself as a company that is working on "the transformation of the worldwide 
transportation market into a networked community."

Take care!

Greg, a quick note, although a little unclear, all of your businesses remain 
in EGM and are not going to go to R McDonald's new group.

Please inform your group.

Thanks,

For your further handling.  I don't know what this is.

Eric,
I was examining EGM's businesses for 2001 and I wanted to ask you a question 
about your specific business.  As you examine your goals and objectives, I 
would like to know what you think I could do to help you accomplish your 
plan.  Please send me a return email with 3 specific items that I could do 
personally to add to your business.

Thanks,

Mr. Skilling,

We are a group of EE&CC engineers and we have an idea about trading gasoline 
online. 

Enron can trade gasoline as a commodity the same as natural gas and 
electricity.  The idea is any one can buy an amount of gasoline at a 
pre-determined price with a certain premium for an extended period.  Which 
means there is an expiration date for the investor or buyer.  

When the gasoline price is low, such as last year, people are able to buy a 
certain amount of gasoline from Enron,( Enron is to negotiate with gasoline 
producer for an amount and certain price (whole sale) that Enron believes 
they can sold in a certain period of time through market study and be able to 
make the profit), say  3000 gallons regular unleaded and with 10% (the profit 
margin to be determined  by Enron) premium.  The buyer will receive a debit 
or credit card to be used to purchase the gasoline and  the amount will be 
automatically recorded  each time when they fill up the cars until the amount 
of pre-purchased gasoline is used up in that period of time (prior to the 
expiration date).  The buyers (or customer) can also sell the unused gasoline 
back to Enron anytime before the expiration day the same price they bought 
from Enron for profit if the market gas price is lower or take a loss if the 
market price is higher.   By doing this, Enron creates a market that can 
allow customers to short the gasoline when the market is high.  

There are many other ways to trade the gasoline. Nevertheless, the potential 
market ( if a minimum of 50% household can sign up) is tremendous.  I 
sincerely believe that Enron has the capability to make it happen through 
existing Enron online e-business. We hope this idea has not been thought out 
before for its feasibility.

Regards,

Peter Lee

I think the entire event was outstanding.  I also enjoyed it but my hand

Mike,

Certainly appreciate you visiting the office and helping with the opening... 
not the least shaking over 300 hands and breaking the barrell.  Sorry we were 
not able to spend some time discussing business.  We did get some good time 
with Jeff on Wednesday.  I understand we will now be on a weekly call.

Ken seemed to be satisfied with the opening.  His visit has done quite a lot 
for us.

thanks,
Joe

We did fall apart in baseball this year.  We are not a 1 sport team we are 
the sport team.  Football is just a tad more important then the others.  On 
last count our 7 national championships in "the" sport does add up.  By the 
way, we hold 2 national championships today, football and the mighty women's 
softball.

Stellar in the eyes of the WSU graduating class of '76.  I am not sure that 
Enron (or myself for that matter) hold the same opinion.

The Shockers current sports program sucks, but fortunately for Enron the WSU 
graduating class of '76 had some stellar students. 

As I read the USA Today on the plane back to God's country last evening, I 
noticed something very surprising.  The mighty Bucks were the #2 seed in 
their region.  Mysteriously absent were the Shockers and Sooners.  Doug, I 
guess you can still look forward to bowling season.  Mike, it is down to a 
one sport school.  

Go Bucks!

Mike - I enjoyed your presentation  and comments about Enron Global Markets 
last week.
Your comment about being passionate about things which add value to the 
company is important for success at Enron was very helpful.

I am an originator in EIM for our pulp & paper businesses. I am starting 
business development effort in Asia for Pulp & Paper which I am very excited 
about. I will be in Asia visiting potential consumers and producers in major 
countries in Asia e.g., Japan, India, Singapore, Korea, Thailand, Australia 
and others.
I would like to know if you recommend someone in Enron offices in these 
countries who may have originated businesses with major pulp & paper clients 
for other products e.g., energy or other commodities. 
Thanks for your help in advance.
   

Hi Nina -

It is highly doubtful that Mike will be available to attend the Art Committee 
meeting since his big 2001 budget meeting with Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling will 
begin at 2:00 p.m. on that same day.

Can you do us a big favor and please also send the Art Committee messages to 
me.  When Mike is traveling it makes it much easier if I have been copied on 
messages that involve putting meetings on Mike calendar.

I hope all is going well for you.  Thanks so much.

This is to confirm that there will be an Art Committee meeting on Tuesday, 
November 7, at 1:30 p.m. in conference room 461 of the Enron Building.  We 
realize that some of the committee members will not be able to attend.

Christine,

I so rarely write love notes.  17 years ago it was common place, even a daily 
event.  What happened to that guy?  I could have been a cartoonist in another 
life.  

I am here at 35,000 feet 2,000 miles from Bankock Thailand, flying  by China, 
soon to be over the Philippines and pondering our lives.  You said something 
very interesting to me on the phone as I was getting on the bus to the 
airport.  You said that you would love to have 6 hours on the airplane by 
yourself.  I can certainly understand that.  I seem to have a l lot of that 
on this trip.  I am sitting here on the plane, a little tipsy after a couple 
glasses of wine, and my mind turns to you and the kids.   I wish I could be 
there now to see the kids all dressed up in their costumes ready to go out 
trick or treating.  I bet they look great.

As i sit here and feel a little sorry for myself then i come back to reality 
and realize just how lucky we really are.  I turned to Ken Rice at the 
ceremony yesterday and said, "What is an Okie and a boy from Nebraska doing 
at a Japanese barrel ceremony with Thomas Foley, former Speaker of the House, 
breaking a barrel of saki in front of 300 Japanese executives and TV.  The 
Prime Minister of Japan didn't show up and actually it is expected that he is 
out of a job on a no confidence vote last night.  (Really bad luck for Enron 
here) I would have liked to have met him.  Actually, the ceremony was neat 
and I imagine that they will have some funny pictures from it.  You should 
see me in a Happy coat.  I'll explain when i get home.  

Can you imagine sitting in our home, right after Michael was born and even 
imagining what are lives are like today?  We are so blessed.  Even more than 
that, I am so blessed to have you. I was writing in my journal on the trip 
over, you know my journal - that project that I have dedicated a big part of 
my life to and that you have never read, reflecting on our lives and 
wondering why God let me find you so many years ago.  I must have been a 
priest in a former life.

Anyway, I just wanted to say I love you and there aren't any phones on this 
airplane.  Thai Airlines, go figure. So I am calling you via email.  Although 
I am not sure when I will get the opportunity to actually send this over the 
internet.

I love you and miss you very much.

Eternally,
Michael

See you soon and in time for soccer.

xxxxxooooo
  

Brent,
I would like this to become formal policy within EGM as well. I know that it 
exists and is around but no one is familiar with this or exactly how it 
works.   We have made strides with credibility with RAC regarding coal and we 
are doing a better job of seeing deals in general but I would like to put out 
a policy like this for us.  Please take a look at this and draft a memo that 
can be sent out addressing the approval procedures and the guidelines and 
limits around them.
Thanks,
mike

Yes, there is a formalized process.  After Credit and Legal, and in most 
cases RAC, look at transactions, a VP or higher will sign the Dash.  For Doug 
to sign the Bahamas option contract, I need to know the premium.  Please 
contact Brent Price for our DASH.  (Deal approval sheet)

Jeff

   Merritt Thomas                10/23/2000 04:51 PM

Jeff,

I'm sorry to bother you with this, but I can't seem to get a straight answer 
from anyone - when one is signing a contract around here, is there a form you 
fill out for approval?  In London, everyone fills out a CACS form (Contract A
uthorisation Control Sheet), and if the deal is > $0.5m, then a DASH is 
required as well.  Brad seems to think that if a DASH is not required, then 
the business unit head signs off on the expenditure?  Is there a formalised 
global-markets process for this, or is this a product-by-product thing?  (in 
which case, I'll assume LNG has no process, and I'll direct Eric to implement 
one...)  (Doug Arnell needs to purchase his option for the Bahamas land 
thing, thus the reason for the question).

fyi, attached is European CACS form. 

Thanks,
Merritt  

John, 

What exactly are we trading here and how do you think it is going?
mike

Louise,
I was clearing some old emails.   What ever happened with this guy?  Did you 
hire him or blow him off?  
Thanks,
Mike
Dear Mike, 

My name is Joseph Mathew and I used to work with Enron from 1996-1999, where 
I was last a commercial Director as of 1998.? I have worked very successfully 
with Greg Whalley, Jeff Shankman, Fred Lagrasta, John Arnold, Duane Hart, 
Amanda Martin, Harold Buchanan, among others in the past.? I had also 
authored a financial products paper with Louise Kitchens that was published 
by two European trade magazines in the spring of 1997.

I am currently a Vice President and Senior Officer of Chematch.com, a 
Houston-based online bulk petrochemical, polymer and fuel products trading 
exchange.? We founded the firm over one year ago, and things have been going 
quite well.

However, the landscape for our business model, industry market penetration, 
as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue 
success of this company, and I wish to return to Enron, but staying within 
the dynamic, challenging high-tech areas, such as Enron Global Markets.

My responsibilities here at Chematch.com have been multiple-fold.? I have 
been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan (and 
its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that 
permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed 
industry participants, venture capital raising process for three series of 
funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work.

I currently head up all of the Chematch.com content, information and 
analytics efforts, for both cash and paper markets.? I also head up 
Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com.

Prior to joining Enron, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a 
Master of Business Administration in Analytic Finance and Accounting.? Prior 
to b-school, I worked on Wall Street for 3 1/2 years in investment banking 
and capital markets.

Attached is a copy of my resume.? My goal is to procure a challenging 
leadership position within your group in the capacity of Business 
Developement, Corporate Finance, Mergers & Acquisition, or Venture Capital.? 
I would be open to other suggestions.

Please review my resume when you get a chance.? I appreciate that you are 
very busy, but I would very much appreciate hearing back from you if you see 
a fit between what I can offer and what your group is doing.

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication

Mike Brown, David Terlip, Janice Moore and I met today.  Plan is for Mike to 
get an answer from Siemens (probably this week or next) on spec.  If Siemens 
amenable to relax First Gas' spec to plant, request First Gas to relax it's 
spec to us.  Mike will report to you as soon as he has heard from Siemens.   
If either Siemens or First Gas recalcitrant, move to litigation strategy.  
This would mean at next cargo delivery (due mid-November):  (1)  if cargo 
"off spec" demand separate test using "ashing" technique (more likely to 
pass) and if it passes using "ashing" declare on spec and arbitrate dispute 
over acceptance of "ashing" as industry standard; (2) if cargo rejected 
(either because First Gas refuses to accept "ashing" or because off spec even 
with "ashing") resale cargo and force First Gas to locate alternative 
supplies; dispute First Gas invoice for cost of cover.   Mike mentioned a 
possible dispute over storage which could also arise with the next delivery.  
This could bring us into a dispute with First Gas even if the cargo is on 
spec.

Our plan is to get back to you in any event next week when you return with a 
status report.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers.  And congratulations on the Sooners' win.

Rick,  

While in Tokyo, Sanjay grabbed Jeff and me regarding redoing and re-looking 
at the existing LNG fuel deals for Dabhol.  The bottom line is that he 
believes that the government may have issues on actually performing post 
phase 2 and if we could redo the LNG contracts and allow more flexibility we 
could help them, thus help ourselves.  We need to look into this and I would 
like your initial opinion.  This is complex to say the least and it would 
involve using the ship differently than scheduled and diverting some of the 
Oman LNG to other markets with their approval.  He believes that there is 
some flexibility in the shipping and Oman contracts to address these issues.  
If it works we could create a long physical condition and an extra ship for 
transport.  Is there an opportunity here if all the cards fall into place?

Lets discuss when I am in Dubai.  Sanjay is not going to let it go so you 
need to think about who can look into this further.

Mike

Cindy,
I have a friend that is a principal in a company called Nexstar.  The 
company  is on a roll and offers an interesting product.  I have attached his 
email and basic presentation but I thought it was interesting enough to bring 
it up to you.  Also he is a friend and I don't want to ignore him.  Do we do 
anything like this with our employees?

I would really appreciate some feedback on this.  Unless you think it is a 
total waist of time, I would appreciate you and some other appropriate 
members of your HR team to attend 1 intro. meeting to listen to their pitch.  
I would of course attend as well if you like.  They have an impressive 
customer list already.

Let me know what you think and I'll help co-ordinate the meeting.

Thanks,
Mike
 Mike,

 It was good to talk to you this weekend and hope you had a great
stay in Dallas. As we discussed, I am attaching a brief introduction to
Nexstar Financial and a copy of our latest press release. Nexstar is a
financial services company that is currently offering mortgage lending
products. We began the company in May 1999 and have spent the last 18 months
building a state of the art high tech (web) high touch (telephone) customer
communication/service center located in St. Louis Missouri.. We specialize
in working with Fortune 500 companies to provide superior mortgage products
to their relocating employees as well as to their  general employee
population.

 Our management team of industry leaders launched Nexstar after
holding senior positions with some of the most prominent mortgage companies
in the business today. Our Chairman, Marvin Moskowitz was Chairman of the
parent company of Prudential Home Mortgage while it grew to industry
prominence in  providing mortgage products to corporate America.  Rick
Thornberry, our CEO and President, most recently held the COO and President
positions at Citi Mortgage.  I serve as Managing Director of Business
Development at Nexstar and served as Managing Director of Sales at Citi
Mortgage responsible for the Corporate Relocation and Employee Program.
Previous to Citi I served in several executive positions with Prudential
Home Mortgage.  Helen Garrity is Managing Director of Sales and Marketing.
She joined Nexstar from her position as SVP of Norwest Mortgage, where she
led the corporate and affinity mortgage programs.  Our experienced and
visionary management team has been joined by some of the brightest
individuals in the mortgage industry.  Since May 1999, our collective team
has succeeded in designing and implementing the most advanced mortgage
program available to corporations and co-brand partners today, resulting in
an easier mortgage process with reduced customer expenses and savings to the
corporation.

 I'd love to have the opportunity to meet with the appropriate people
at Enron to demonstrate the benefits Nexstar offers for Enron's relocating
and general employee population.

 Please give me a call at your earliest convenience to discuss
Nexstar and how we could bring value to Enron. Thank you.

Mike:

One of the things I wanted to discuss in our meeting was your advice on one 
of the CALME personnel for deployment, Antonio Jenkins Lara.

He is a very solid candidate that I'm confident can add great value in Enron.

Antonio has been a strong performer for us in his short stay with us.  He 
joined us around the middle of the year, so we did not have much data when we 
conducted our mid-year review.

He is an entrepreneur with strengths in logistics and systems.  He has both 
technical and commercial backgrounds.

During this year, he used is background in logistics and management to 
identify $1.8MM in recurring annual savings for Ventane, one of Enron's 
businesses in Venezuela.

I had initially placed him with Dan Reck because of Antonio's background in 
logistics.  However, it appears that Dan is more interested in bringing on 
people with a background in trading, which is not Antonio's strength.

I encourage you to closely examine his resume and I appreciate any good ideas.

I'm also looking forward to getting together with you soon.

Many thanks.  Shawn

CP,
Please send on and co-ordinate a 30 minute meeting with Jeff McMahon and Ray 
Bowen for discussion.  They might be able to use him as well.

him to talk with Jeff Shankman.

Thanks,

Hi Mike:

I talked to you briefly earlier today immediately after the "Enron at a 
Glance" session.  We discussed the subjects of Enron looking at the purchase 
of GATX Terminals Corporation and the hiring of an individual from GATX 
Terminals.

As I mentioned earlier, I know an individual who has worked for GATX 
approximately 20 years in several capacities who is interested in joining the 
Enron team.  His name is Steve Denney and he resides in Chicago, IL.  He 
travels each week to Houston for his current job as President of GAXT 
Products Services (GPS).  Capacities within the GATX organization that Steve 
has held include:

President of GATX Products Services (GPS)
Executive Vice President Domestic Sales and Marking for GATX Terminals
Southern Region Business Unit Manager (Texas, Louisiana, and Florida) for 
GATX Terminals
General Manager of Calnev Pipe Line Company (a subsidiary of GATX Terminals)

I have worked with Steve in different capacities since 1991, and think he 
would be a GREAT asset to the Enron organization.  I would like to introduce 
the two of you to see if there is a fit for Steve within our company.  You 
expressed interest earlier today when we talked.  If you are still 
interested, could you please advise me on what steps to take from here?

I appreciate your time in considering Steve as an employee and look forward 
to pursuing him as an Enron team member.

Thank you,
Gene

Dana,

Hello from Tokyo.  I sent you a reply and forwarded your resume to our HR 
group.  I don't know if you got my reply the day I received your resume.  I 
have had a lot of people tell me that they didn't get a response from me 
about the same time as you contacted me.  My sent mail doesn't list you as a 
completed return email.   

I hope all is well.

Anuj is a great guy who worked for me then left (as they all do!) to work for 
a dot com.  The business has folded and now he's looking to get back into 
Enron in a structuring role.  He's a real smart guy with an MBA from Harvard 
and a petroleum engineering background.  He worked for the Global Investments 
group of EI before coming over to broadband.  I think he would be a dynamite 
structuring guy, or could help out in the upstream side of the petroleum 
business.  Do any of you have a need?  Rich

Maryfran,

I would like to thank you for your very nice nomination.  As flattered as I 
am, I believe that our current Chief Technology Officer, Philippe Bibi, is 
more appropriate as a nominee from Enron.  I am very proud of our 
accomplishments when I was responsible as CEO for Enron's Global Technology 
group but my tenor was only about a year.  In August I was asked to take on 
another assignment as CEO of Enron Global Markets.  Although this was an even 
more challenging position I will say that it was a tough decision to leave 
the technology world.

Philippe Bibi has driven our technology group for many years and deserves a 
great deal of the credit for Enron's recognized technology advantage and 
innovation.  He has been in the tech business for about 17 years.

Sincerely, 
Mike S. McConnell

10/25/2000 03:45 AM
Mike/Jeff:  

Each year at about this time I hold an LNG Offsite meeting to review the 
progress of the year and to set direction for the next year.  This year's 
offsite has been scheduled for 20/21 November at the woodlands.  We picked 
these dates and reserved (and paid for) the Woodlands earlier this year 
because almost all members of the worldwide LNG team will be in the US at 
this time for either the San Antonio conference or Gastech.

Given the recent reorganization and changes in Enron's international 
direction, I feel that this meeting is more vital than usual.

I assume that some members of the group will want to take vacation later in 
the week because of Thanksgiving---therefore, I plan to compress the offsite 
into a one-day meeting on 20 November and leave 21 Nov for ad-hoc team 
meetings and/or golf for those who want to stay another day.

This would be a perfect opportunity to educate the entire team on "mark to 
market" mechanics, the LNG "book", enron online and any other similar topics 
that may be appropriate.  To that end, we are working on the following agenda:

Overview of EGM/Enron Corp direction:  Mick Mcconnell/Jeff Shankman

LNG organization and strategic objectives:  Rick Bergsieker/Eric Gonzales

LNG risk book:     Presented by Merritt Thomas/Brad Hitch??

Enron Online demonstration and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brad Hitch

Mark to Market fundamentals and applications to LNG:    Presented by Brent 
Price

2000 review/objectives for 2001:

Eastern Hemisphere:  Clay Harris

Atlantic Basin:  Doug Arnell/Emilio Vicens

Shipping, terminalling and Fuel Management:   Wayne Perry

Legal:  Dan Rogers

Several questions:

Mike/Jeff:  would either or both of you be available to participate,at least 
for an hour or so to get us started?

Eric:  can you be there at least for Monday?

Jeff:  have I picked the right people for risk book and online presentations?

Brent:  can you be there to conduct a seminar on Mark-to-Market (including 
key contractual provisions required)?

FYI, Wayne Perry and his assistant Cindy Long are coordinating arrangements 
for this offsite.

This is the proposed invite list to the LNG offsite that has been scheduled 
for the Woodlands on Monday, Nov. 20. Please send me the names of any 
additions you suggest. I would like to get out a note to people on this ASAP.

We plan an all day meeting on Monday and Golf, etc for those that want to do 
so on Tuesday. That way those that need to travel or work are only tied down 
one day. I would also appreciate any agenda ideas you may want to include. 

Thanks

Wayne
Wayne -

I heard back from Emilio and he said to go ahead and leave Margaret's name 
(she might be gone by the time of the offsite) but he would advise of her 
replacement.  He does not have a replacement as this time.

Wayne -  Below is the revised list, please note I am waiting on information 
regarding Margaret Rhee and/or replacement.

A friend of mine, formerly with Bankers Trust, called to see if we are 
interested in hearing a story about a floating LNG facility. He is with 
Merlin Production, a small producer, that thinks there is a large market for 
accessing stranded gas in offshore fields.  If you have an interest let me 
know and I'll arrange a meeting. I owe this guy nothing other that a call 
back so if you have no interest say so. Rick

computer but that you replied to her telling her that it was functioning.  
The link is on http://ecinside.enron.net/apps/jdf.nsf ... I have tried this 
link in 3 different browsers on 4 different computers and it is not working.  
Maybe the link is there but it's got high traffic, but we've tried it several 
times over the last hour and it is not responding, the message that we're 
getting is that "A connection could not be established with the server."  
Please respond.

Sunday, November 5th, is the big day.  Although we have less than two weeks 
left, we still have several exciting fundraising activities taking place.  
All walkers should continue getting pledges and watch for further 
instructions on turning in the walk forms.  Everyone has done an incredible 
job this year.  Great news, we are getting very close to reaching our goal, 
but if we want to continue to be the number one walk team in Houston, we need 
to continue with our fundraising efforts.  Please plan to join us for the 
following activities this week:
 
Silent/Cyber Auction - The JDF Silent Cyber Auction will open for bids on 
Wednesday, October 25th, at 8:00 a.m. and will close on Thursday, October 
26th, at 4:00 p.m.  You may access the Cyber Auction to place your bids at 
8:00 a.m. on Wednesday, October 25th, by launching the website at 
http://ecinside.enron.net/apps/jdf.nsf  or go to the Enron home page on the 
Intranet and click on the JDF Cyber Auction.  For more information, contact 
Sophie Patel at ext. 35055 or Eddie Sera at ext. 30480.  

Bake Sale and Raffles - Just in time for the Holidays!  On Friday, October 
27th, we will have several groups selling delicious baked goods on the second 
floor level of the Enron Building outside the Energizer.  In addition, we 
will have representatives from some of our walk teams available for the 
purchase of raffle tickets at the same location.

For all that are not signed up, please join us in the walk.  You still have 
time.  It will take 2 minutes to fill out a walk form, you get a great 
Enron/JDF T-shirt for collecting or donating $25 or more, and will join 
hundreds of Enron employees and approximately 10,000 Houstonians for the walk 
on Sunday, November 5th, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I promise this will 
be a blast.  The Enron tent will be great again this year!  We will begin 
with a continental breakfast prior to the walk and when everyone returns from 
the walk we will have music, balloons for the children and wonderful Frankie 
Mandola's hamburgers, hot dogs and fries.  Parking at the Sam Houston Race 
Park is free.  You will be part of something very worthwhile and it will make 
you feel great.  This is a world class event.

Please contact any of the following Steering Committee members to make a 
donation, sign up as a walker, or ask any questions you may have.  Come join 
the fun.

I apologize for my tardy response to the JDF Fund-raiser.  The letter went
to my old office at EnergyEcomm.com.  Unfortunately, that office has closed,

Anyway, as they say, "The check is in the mail."
Best of luck in raising funds for such a worthy cause.

Gary,

1.  Correct
2.  Global tech drove and directed the PRC (performance review committee) for 
all of it's employees.  Enron ranks all of it's employees 2 times a year.  
The employees are examined and given feedback on their performance.  It is a 
very lengthy process but it is very fair and insures and identifies excellent 
performance.  The criteria for the rankings comes from a person's 
accomplishments, characteristics and customer feedback from numerous 
sources.  It is all on computer and when we discuss a persons performance and 
ranking, that feedback (primarily from the business unit) is a key driver.  
Plus, there are business unit reps on the PRC.
3.  I guess the way i would describe it would be that on every major 
expenditure and project, the commercial people involved helped drive the 
process as well as our group looking at it the same way.  An example would be 
that traditionally any IT group or technologist is in love this the latest 
and greatest technology.  and could look at embedding a new system in the 
company because it is the latest technology and is very cool.   I would ask 
what commercial function does it perform and how does it give us a 
competitive advantage.  It was a very customer driven (internal and external 
customers) process.  It was also a mind set and paradigm shift internally 
within the group because they started looking at themselves adding to the 
bottom line rather than simply a cost center.

I hope that helps.

Sincerely, 
Mike

Hi Mike, three more questions. I hope I'm not wearing out my welcome.

1. Is Philippe Bibi spelled correctly?

2. You said, "When it came to the review process itself, Global Technology
ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit had the greatest
influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated." I may not have
gotten this down correctly, but I don't quite understand it. Are you saying 
that
IT basically just lists the people but the business units actually rate them?

3. When you refer to taking a "commercial" view of technology, what do you 
mean
exactly and how is that new?

Thanks again.

Regards,
Gary Anthes

Jeff, 

Sorry for the slow response.  

I don't have a strong opinion either way.  I am fine with the combo idea.

In the future, please let me know if something has a short fuse.  I am still 
slower on email but I do respond very quickly to voicemail.  I am almost 
caught up on back log emails but this will probably never by my first and 
best way to communcate.

Thanks,
Mike

Jeff,

Let me know what you think of this guy.  Wade Cline and Tim Det. are both 
high on him.  Jeff Donahue is not so sure but will meet with him on Friday.  
During my lunch with Jeff, we discussed that we need a Corp. Dev guy 
dedicated to us full time but if he reported to him, that would be great.  I 
think we could use that co-ordination with his group as long as we didn't get 
a part time guy in the process.  He could also report to us obviously (like 
Larry) but i think in this case a dual role makes a  lot of sense.  What do 
you think?

If you like Don, he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our Corp 
Dev work, but that is of course not the best reason.  I thought he was all 
right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an 
innovative thinker.  He has also worked as a trader and although it doesn't 
seem possible by his personality, having some background is a plus.  

Mike

Jeff,

 I like the memo and I'll keep my ears open for feedback.  Your presence is 
needed more than I thought.  My gut told me that they really needed your help 
but its more than that.  Taking contol of that P&L is the highest return of 
your time and talent for EGM and for Enron, atleast for this quarter.  They 
will learn or they will be out.

Hey John  

just to let you know we went on line today for the first time with tanker 
freight futures
(last week had some teething problems, as eol didnt know about world scale)

anyway we traded 320,000 mts freight in the first day 

so encouraging signs .....

(p.s. fyg i think coal have done about 350,000 mts in the last 6 weeks...)

Dana,

Thanks for the call and email.  I will look at your resume and get back to 
you .

Mike

Greg, I need to talk with you about your EBS/fiber project.  Please give me a 
call in the morning.  I'll be in first thing in the morning.  I don't have 
your telephone number.  You are listed on a Houston number.
Mike

Gary,
I turned 40 in March.

As discussed.
m
Just to give you an example of the requests that came up one day last week 
within Enron directed to me.

1) The Panama office (EGE-MINSA) called with budget help and need forward 
Panama Parity prices for Bunker C and MDO for the next 15 months. There is no 
forward Panama Parity market, but we have been able to produce a forward 
curve by updating the historical PP prices. This process helps the Panama 
City office be able to deal with the local regulators and get dispatched 
more. 
2) Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico called and needed historical NYMEX NX3 natural 
gas prices back to 1993 due to a dispute with their power purchaser because 
their contract is poorly written. Knowledge of these numbers will help them 
make a better case with their customer. 
3) The Buenos Aires office called and needed help with their EOL rollout and 
hedge prices tied to NYMEX crude for a crude producer in Argentina.
4) The Guatemala office (PQPC) called with a sulfur issue on the latest cargo 
delivery. This lead to numerous discussions with the independent inspectors 
and fuel supplier. The issue is of particular importance at PQPC because of 
the recent financing of the project and the scrutiny regarding the emissions 
at the plant. 
5) Mariella Mahan's group called looking for help on physical and financial 
resid into Nicaragua regarding their bid/negotiation with ENEL on the 
privatization of some power plants in Nicaragua. The plants currently buy 
from Esso and we hope to improve their fuel prices by up to a $1/barrel. That 
would create an annual savings of over $1.5MM per year. This involved a 
lengthy conference call, existing contract review and several forward curves.
6) The weather group was looking for historical propane prices for a new 
product to be offered to Conoco.
7) The San Paulo office called looking for a twenty year forward curve for 
crude and three grades of resid to help them with an LDC project them 
operate. 
8) The Metgas office in India called looking for a one year naphtha hedge 
tied to crude. 
9) ENA called to talk about using jet fuel instead of low sulfur diesel in a 
proposed peaker in Florida. I went through a cost/benefit analysis with them 
and they went back to using the LS diesel curve for the project. 
10) Rob Bradley called looking for help with the Enron Washington, DC office 
who was fighting off a challenge from the NYMEX who wants EOL regulated like 
an exchange. We were able to provide Chris Long numerical data that helped 
Enron's case and ultimately Enron got the initial ruling they were looking 
for. 

All of the above were in addition to our normal daily duties (battles) with 
the five EI power plants and their fuel deliveries, along with the new 
business ventures we are involved in. If you want specific big money savings 
for other Enron entities or projects I would refer you to the previous memos 
I have sent you regarding India, Guatemala and Panama which exceeded $20MM. 
Hopefully, the daily requests that we service for other Enron groups leads to 
better projects with better actual returns and less overall problems. 

If you need additional information I would be glad to provide it.

Virginia,
Thanks for the email.  Go ahead and send it unframed.  I don't  remember what 
the frame looked like so it will probably be easier to send without.  For my 
later reference, how much do you charge for framing?
Mike 

Dear Mike:

I wanted to let you know the status of your artwork, "The Blue Note."  We
should receive the artwork in-house latest Friday.  By the middle of this week
I should know the exact edition number for you.  I will keep you updated.  Do
you want us to frame the artwork here or ship it to you unframed?

Warmest regards,

Virginia Repasky
Christopher-Clark Fine Art

Doug,

Last week, you referenced that there are a lot of deals that come up during 
the day for various regions and companies around Enron that your group 
doesn't get any monetary recognition for but that they need to be done or are 
provided as a service to save money. By the way, saving money is real money 
to Enron.   Would you please provide me with some examples of that so I can 
put it in context?

Thanks,
Mike

Jim, I think it does.  I am usually unable to attend so I would really like 
you to stick with this as our rep.  Also we will talk about the best uses of 
your time after this weeks budget meetings.  I'll give you a call.
Thanks,
Mike

Mike, I have been the CALME rep on this task force. Given that CALME no 
longer exists and that you are already there to represent EGM, do you think 
that it makes sense for me to continue to attend these monthly meetings?

Jim

please put on my calendar.

Hi Mike,

I'm going to use this from you in my story:

"The IT personnel reported into Global Technology, but we did that for
communication and consistency purposes rather than simply control. They 
attended
business unit staff meetings, and the business units gave constant feedback.
When it came to the review process itself, Global Technology ranked all the
employees and peers but the business unit had the greatest influence on where
the person actually ranked and was rated."

If it's OK with you, I'd like to put it in the present tense as I understand
this is still the case today. I think it might be confusing to readers in the
past tense, as if it no longer applies. Would that be OK with you? Thanks 
much.

Regards,
Gary Anthes

Mike McConnell asked me to contact you to set up a 30 minute appointment with 
him and Jeff Shankman for next week.. Please let me know if you will be

Any chance you will be able to attend the office opening on 31 Oct?

Erin, here are a couple of responses.  Please rewrite as you see fit.  
Mike

1. Agriculture.    We are currently looking at and studying the industry.  We 
have traded some commodities as well.  We believe that there may be large 
opportunities to apply the Enron model to the agriculture industry.  We have 
spent quite a bit of time an effort and are currently developing our 
strategy.  This is very early in development but we have high expectations in 
this area.  I don't feel comfortable going into more detail at this time.  
Gary Hickerson is responsible Enron's ag business.

2.  Rail.  We are looking at numerous opportunities in the rail and 
transportation businesses.  I haven't seen a lot on the electricity piece of 
rail.  It is an interesting concept and one that we will look at.   Dan Reck 
is now responsible for looking at transportation opportunities in the US.

The following questions were asked but not addressed in today's all-employee

respond?  I will route to Ken, Jeff and Joe for approval, then post the 
questions and answers in eMeet.

Thanks for your help.

What is our strategy/plan in agricultural commodities trading?
Energy opportunity:  Have you thought about supplying electricity to 
railtrack for its EC4T (Electric Current for Traction), i.e. all its traction 
power (overhead power lines and 3rd rail system).  The full idea has been 
submitted to eMeet.

Dan, Thanks for your donation.  I appreciate your support.

Can you believe my email!

Ron,

Hello.  I am back in the country -  I've been out for 2 weeks since I picked 
up the car.  I am very happy with the car and your contact treated me very 
well.  The transaction went smoothly and they worked with me to get the car 
before I went off to Asia.

I wanted to thank you again for all your help and efforts.   I have had many 
comments already and there is not doubt that this will lead to a new wave of 
Enron purchases of Mercedes.

 I am a Mercedes believer.

Sincerely,
Mike McConnell

Virginia,

Thanks for the email.  I apologize for the slow response.  Life is crazy and 
I have been back on the road again.

 I am interested in purchasing "Blue Note" and I understand that the price is 
$4,500 framed as before.  I am chasing down another piece, as i think i have 
stated before, but have not closed yet on it.  It is significantly less but I 
have not closed the deal.  I would like to own the piece.  Do you think there 
is any room on the price from your seller?  I will commit to you but I can't 
leave a couple of thousand dollars on the table because of my impatience.  
That being said, i do want it and this one is found and ready to go.  I will 
commit today to purchase the picture in this condition for $3,500.  you can 
tell the seller that I will commit with American Express immediately at that 
price.  I don't know if that works for you or the seller.

Please let me know what you think.  I am in this week.

Thanks and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.  I am 
ready to make a decision.

Mike

Dear Mike:

Good point on extra space.  Please call Wes Colwell and discuss.  I think 
that makes 33 less of an option.

Mike,

I am totally open to wherever you think would be best.  If possible, it would 
also be good if there were a few extra
spots for some people in the group to be together.  I am not sure yet how 
many people will be needed but I would like
to optimally have a small swat team to focus on each business.  

Thanks very much for the kind words.  I look forward to focusing
on the new businesses quickly and figuring out ways to add value.  I am very 
excited to be working with you again.  Talk to you soon.

-Larry-

Cool, nice job.

Your schedules are very full so I went ahead and spoke to Mark F. about the 
drift budget for 2001 and my thoughts of keeping drift as a consolidated 
number (including Europe).  He agreed it would be easier for me to manage it 
in a single unit  and will get together with you and Dave D. for agreement.  
I suggested that he and all his managers get together with me if additional 
explanations are needed.

Hope this is satisfactory.

Gary

Also, Elsa and I meet with Greg on Monday at 10 am for ag review.

Well, we finally got Greg Whalley enrolled in the "Executive Impact &

"peer/other" category.  It is crucial to Greg's success in the program that 
all feedback be submitted.  

I'll check back with you in a couple of weeks to make sure you are in receipt 
of the feedback forms.

Many Thanks,

Larry, here is the publication we discussed.  If you have an interest, let 
this guy know. 
Thanks and welcome aboard.  Wes Colwell is looking for an office.  Right now 
there are 2 oppts he is looking at; 1 up here on 33 which is a problem, and 1 
office on finance floor.  Do you have a preference, if we have an option?

you feel are needed.  Especially focus on coal which is on page 5.  Please

Hi. I hope everything is going well at your end.

I would like to announce some good news. I have decided to get married at the 
year end on Saturday, 2nd December to be precise. 

The lucky or should it be foolhardy ladies name is Jaya. 

I would like to extend an invite to you and your family, a formal invite will 
follow in the post. 

I hope you are able to attend even if it means combining it with a business 
trip to this region. (December climate wise is the best time of year and the 
Taj Mahal is very romantic place and being one of the seven wonders of the 
world worth a visit).

Good wishes to your family.

Thor,

A quick note.  I don't believe I ever followed up with you on your weather 
business plan.  I looked at it several times primarily in pieces while 
traveling overseas.  I read it again today and wanted to give you some 
feedback.  I thought it was excellent work and very well presented.  Thank 
you for all your effort. 

 I am in town this week, I canceled being out of the office an additional 3 
days, and I will be spending time thinking about weather as well as some of 
our other businesses.  I'll give you a call toward the end of the week to 
discuss some of the ideas you presented. 

Mike

Gary,

There were two such events.  On the Scott McNelly side, I realized that we 
weren't too late to change our approach and take a commercial view on 
technology.  None of the other companies were thinking our new way at all 
plus when someone of the caliber and reputation of McNelly gives you a 
general approval and confirmation, as a new guy, that meant a lot.  It 
inspired me to keep going on a "nontraditional" path.  The other big  impact 
moment was listening and having a brief conversation with John Chambers of 
Cisco.  It was at the eCommerce Summit in Washington DC and he gave his, "its 
a matter of survival" speech.  That really hit me and our conversation was 
also similar about my new job and Enron's new approach.  He gave me a 
positive response and also gave me some advice that included an observation 
that the incumbent IT people may not have the abilities to help me lead Enron 
in the eCommerce world.  It was going to take a different kind of 
technologist.  That moment had the most impact on me of the two.   I saw John 
again and spoke with him at an Economist  conference in Laguna Nigel and told 
him of his original impact and I think he appreciated the story.  He also was 
very nice to give me some time to talk after that speech as well.

I hope that clarified things,  good luck with the piece.

Thanks,
mike 

Hi Mike, just one more:

You said, in describing the Sun breakfast, "I'll never forget this; this had a
huge impact on the way I ran that group for the next year." What did you mean 
by
that? Just how did it affect your approach?

Thanks again.

      I wanted to follow up with you regarding Billy Lemmons.  As you know, 
both myself and Gary have spoken to Billy about an opportunity in the Ag 
effort.  I think Billy could help us pursue the origination opportunities we 
discussed on Wednesday and help us develop many more.  In addition to the 
tremendous experience he would bring to our team, he seems genuinely 
interested and excited about the opportunity.
      I know you and Billy have discussed the Ag effort and I wanted to know 
if you felt this would be the right move for Billy at this time.  Certainly, 
it is his decision but I believe he is looking to you for EGM's committment 
to Agriculture.

Please let me know if I can answer any questions you may have.
Thanks,  Elsa Piekielniak (37613)

Gary,

Thanks for the email.  Here is my attempt to type out a response.  I hope it 
helps.

1.  It was a matrix organization.  The IT personnel reported into the Global 
Tech. group but we did that for communication and consistency  purposes 
rather than simply control.  They attended business unit staff meetings and 
the BU had a great influence in the review process and gave constant 
feedback.  It was vitally important for the "customer" to be happy and that 
the IT person completed the projects from the BU.  When it came to the review 
process itself, GT ranked all the employees and peers but the business unit 
had the greatest influence on where the person actually ranked and was rated.

2.  When Enron Net Works was formed, nothing really changed on the day to day 
working of the IT world.  IT (Global Technology) was folded into the newly 
created 5th business unit at Enron.  Remember Global Technology had more that 
IT alone.  We had an eCommerce commercial group, a principal investments 
group and was developing eCommerce or Technology origination roles developing 
around the world.

Philippe Bibi is the CTO for Enron and Enron Net Works.  He is in the office 
of the chairman of ENW with Greg Whalley, CEO and Louise Kitchen, the newly 
appointed COO.  Both LK and GW are non IT people.  There are many VPs on the 
next level that are IT executives.

3.  In a nut shell, Scott grinned when I told him of my 2 weeks experience 
and title as CEO with Enron's goal of becoming the largest B2B player in the 
world.  He chuckled and said something like, "That sounds like Enron, it 
always looks at things differently.  He then stated that my CEO title and 
Enron's approach was very unusual but that it would be more common place 
soon,  as this was the way of the future and Enron was the first to recognize 
it and change its culture".

4.  When i used the word cannibalize, I meant that if we didn't change the 
business ourselves, than our competition would do this for us.  For example, 
we were the leading trader of natural gas in the US by far but we initiated 
EnronOnline and completely changed the way we traded natural gas and did it 
for free.  Thus we cannibalized our own successful business even when it was 
going great.  We are looking at all of our businesses for changes like that.

Gary, I hoped that helped.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have 
any other questions.

Mike

Hello Mike,

Thanks for sending me those presentation slides. They are good background. And
thanks so much for meeting with Julia and me this week. It was most 
interesting
and helpful. I'm confused on a couple of points, so would you mind answering a
few more questions?

1. You said that after Enron created the Global Technology group, you "seeded
people out into the business units, and the way we did that is we had those
people be totally accountable both to us and to the business unit head." So, 
at
that point it was a sort of matrix organization, with IT people dispersed
thoughout the business units but at the same time accountable to a central IT
organization for things such as standards, is that correct?

2. Then, this spring when Net Works was formed, did those 1,500 IT people
essentially leave the business units to join a more traditional IT 
organization?
Roughly how many non-IT people, and of what types, are part of Net Works? Two 
of
the three top managers in Net Works are non-IT (from trading), correct? Does 
any
given IT person now still live in a matrix world with responsibilities to IT 
and
to a business unit?

3. For some reason, my recorder messed up and I couldn't decipher what you 
said
about Scott McNealy's reaction to your background, etc. at the breakfast. 
Could
you repeat that?

4. You said: "We had to cannibalize our own businesses. So what I think you'll
see five years from now is that the IT world will look totally different." 
What
did you mean by "cannibalize our own business"?.

Thanks again.

Regards,
Gary Anthes

successful.

If you have any other questions or comments please let me know.

Sally,

Thanks for the e-mail regarding summer interns.  I apologize that Lexi and=
=20
Shelly were unable to provide you with the answers you were seeking.  I wis=
h=20
that you had contacted either Celeste or me to indicate that you were havin=
g=20
difficulty.  I have personally assured you on several occasions that I was=
=20
available to either speak with you or meet with you if for some reason any=
=20
member of my staff was not responsive.  That being said please allow me to=
=20
explain the recruiting strategy since I was instrumental in helping to set =
it.

You are absolutely correct.  It is great to do market research if time=20
permits or it is regarding an issue of which we have little knowledge.  As=
=20
you are aware, over the past year we have engaged a professional recruiting=
=20
firm (Brecker & Merryman) who has assisted us in a number of different mark=
et=20
research projects.  However, in my opinion, this issue is not one that=20
required much research.  I have been involved in recruiting in some way,=20
shape or form at both the graduate and undergraduate level for the past 10=
=20
years.  Most major organizations, with the exception of the Accounting firm=
s,=20
begin the summer intern recruiting process in early spring.  There are=20
actually some universities that do not allow recruitment of summer interns=
=20
until after a certain date, particularly in the MBA programs.  For example,=
=20
Harvard does not allow an organization to come on campus and speak to first=
=20
year students until January.  As indicated, the firms that generally recrui=
t=20
in the fall are the Accounting firms and they are primarily recruiting for=
=20
"spring" internships.

The recruiting strategy at Enron is no different this year than it was last=
=20
year with respect to summer interns.   Presentations were made in January &=
=20
February and offers were made in February and March.  The only school that=
=20
did not follow the normal process was OU under the direction of George Hope=
. =20
We did, of course, recruit summer interns in the fall for the tax group=20
because they are competing directly with the Accounting Firms.

Utilizing this strategy did not impair Enron=01,s ability to hire quality s=
ummer=20
interns.  This past summer Enron had 76 summer Analysts (undergraduate) and=
=20
40 summer Associates (graduate).  We intentionally limited the number of=20
summer hires to ensure that the individuals hired received meaningful=20
assignments.  Approximately 85% of these individuals received permanent=20
offers to join Enron.  =20

The reason Enron has not had a problem recruiting quality undergraduate=20
summer interns is primarily because many organizations do not hire=20
undergraduates for summer positions.  They generally focus on MBAs,=20
particularly the investment banks and consulting firms which are the firms=
=20
that Jeff Skilling identifies as Enron's competitors.  Because the=20
undergraduates are not actively recruited by our competition we have=20
continued to have a special focus on these individuals (i.e. the reason the=
re=20
were 76 undergraduates and only 40 MBAs).

With respect to OU and UT specifically since those were the schools about=
=20
which you raised a concern, let me address your concerns.  In your e-mail y=
ou=20
indicated that you had research conducted at UT and OU.  You did not howeve=
r,=20
provide the results of the research or the person to whom they had spoken=
=20
therefore I had Lexi Elliott contact both UT and OU.

While OU has not gotten back to her, following is the information obtained=
=20
from UT.

o The contact at UT Career Services is Cindy Henson. =20
o According to Cindy, approximately 5% of companies actively recruiting on=
=20
campus conduct interviews in the fall for "summer" internships.  Cindy=20
attributes  this to the fact that these companies cannot come in the spring=
,=20
or, in the case of Andersen Consulting, have a tremendous need and conduct=
=20
all interviews  at one time. =20
o In conclusion, Cindy estimated that 95% of companies actively recruiting =
on=20
campus recruit in the spring for summer internships.

We have not received information from OU therefore I am unable to provide t=
he=20
statistics at this time.  I will provide as soon as I am in receipt of such=
=20
information. =20

It appears that the information your source obtained is considerably=20
different than what we were told.  If you would provide the name of the=20
individual to whom they spoke I will follow up to determine the reason for=
=20
the discrepancies.

While I understand your concern with respect to OU, they appear to be=20
different than most of the other schools at which we recruit.  If you belie=
ve=20
that it is critical to recruit summer interns at OU in the fall we are=20
supportive; however, because Lexi has other school interviews that are=20
already scheduled she will not be in a position to facilitate the interview=
=20
process during the trip you have scheduled currently.  As you are aware, in=
=20
most instances, the dates for presentations and interviews are dictated by=
=20
the respective universities and were secured in early August. If you would=
=20
like for her to try and secure an interview schedule for a later date this=
=20
fall she can certainly work with your schedule and her current schedule to=
=20
support your efforts.

I hope this has been helpful.  I can understand and appreciate your=20
frustration if you are not getting answers from the recruiter or her=20
manager.  Again, I offer that I am available and willing to work with you i=
f=20
you are having difficulty with members of the Program staff. =20

Please let me know what you decide about recruiting this fall for summer=20
interns and whether I can be of any additional assistance.

Charlene

fine, sorry for the delay.

Gentlemen,

Below is a draft org announcement I would like to send out to the HR team 
today or towmorrow, essentially clarifying responsibilities following the 
formation of EGM and EIM. I do not intend to circulate outside HR other than 
to then 7 of you, Cindy O and the other HR leads. This essentially reflects 
what I hope you already know that your HR lead support is:

ENA - Me with Sheila Knudsen (I ultimately hope Cindy Skinner will move to 
take this lead sometime next year).
EGM - Cindy Skinner and Shanna Funkhouser (We believe Shanna will develop to 
lead this in the next 12 months)
EIM - Me and Fran Mayes (the plan would be for Fran to eventually take lead 
on this when she is ready).

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

David

CC: Olson, Delainey, Lavorato, Frevert, McMahon, Bowen, McConnell, Shankman,

Western Hemisphere Wholesale Energy HR Group Organisation Change

When we launched our HR Franchise Team structure in February this year we did 
so with the commitment to continually refine and challenge ourselves to 
ensure we were optimising the resources we have available to help our 
businesses achieve and exceed their goals. In fact you will recall in 
communicating the changes in February, we actually highlighted what we 
anticipated would be a need to make further refinements and changes to 
maximise our effectiveness.

A great deal has happened in these last 6 months and I am delighted that the 
Franchise team concept has contributed so much towards our far greater 
partnership with our individual business groups and our own outlook, 
priorities and objectives. We truly have revolutionised how we provide HR 
services and advice. More importantly, the business has recognised us for the 
huge progress we have made to date. This success is an outstanding 
achievement and one that I hope you join me in being extremely proud of.

As is always the case at Enron, continuous change is the norm and so as to 
illustrate this point quite effectively the businesses previously part of ENA 
have over the last 2 months, essentially been split into three: Enron Global 
Markets, set up to focus on the Global Fuels markets which were previously 
part of Enron Europe and CALME,  Coal, Financial Tarding and 
Insurance/Weather which were all previously part of ENA. EGM is now led by 
Mike McConnell and Jeff Shankman. Enron Industrial Markets, set up to focus 
on the Industrial markets and expand our activities across new Industrial 
sectors which will build on the success of the Paper, Pulp and Lumber 
business previously part of ENA and immediately develop a steel market. EIM 
These changes in the businesses we support clearly force us to re-examine the 
HR business model and adjust our strategy accordingly. Fortunately, our 
flexible organisation structure lends itself extremely well to realign along 
these new business lines and as such the changes illustrated below in the 
attached org chart are far easier for us to make than they might otherwise 
have been. In addition, given the immense value and positive client feedback 
we have received on our efforts to concentrate our HR resources on Franchise 
skill lines, this also provides us with an opportunity to reinforce and 
refine our efforts in developing market intelligence, employment 
propositions, compensation ideas and best practices, as well as the 
innovatively sourced talent pipelines in each of these areas to pro-actively 
provide our clients with a competitive advantage.

I believe the changes outlined on the attached org chart are self 
explanatory, however if you have any questions please feel free to raise them 
either with your team leads or me. Given that we have a staff meeting 
scheduled for Friday I would plan to walk through these changes with you and 
answer any questions at that time.

Finally, to reinforce our goals and prepare you all for the next 6 months, I 
would like to underline the overall commitment to continue to change and flex 
our resources to anticipate, meet and exceed our businesses needs. This will 
clearly mean further organisation changes as we move forward. This is not 
Change for change's sake, but change, and our ability to change quickly and 
as often as necessary, is essential for us to remain a competitive and 
effective HR resource for our clients.

The situation of this file, which was on the last leg , is suddenly 
worsening.  (cargo payment exposure decreasing as follows :  19 million oct 
3rd  / 14.5 million oct 15th / 5 million oct 30th,  zeroing in november  as 
we have stopped deliveries to GM  - We continue only to supply KPC and Conti 
cargoes direct to the third parties) .
Main cause is the fuel crisis in Europe, particularly in Spain,  where 
combination of prices kept low under government pressure, and blockade of 
terminals by strikers, have cut  the cash flow of GM,  putting into peril the 
above plan;  and this is worsened by the attitude of the owner, who seems to 
be unable to face the situation. He is now stopping his management effort to 
sell the company,  which was the only viable solution;  the company being 
unable financially to sustain the burden of carrying the strategic  
inventories, a direct consequence of the increase of the trading volume in 
the early 2000.   
As a reminder, we have 20 million USD of strategic inventories in the name 
(and paper control) of ECTRIC Spain. We need however to urgently get 3 more 
documents  to have paper  title/possession of these, with always the risk 
that a Spanish liquidator contest our position.
We could initiate the sale of these inventories, however as they are used by 
GM in their strategic inventory figure, we immediately make GM unable to 
continue their operations, as they will loose their operating licence and 
stop payments...

GM general manager was here today, he was asking if Enron could step in and 
save the company ;  however,  it doesnot seem to be possible without 
increasing our exposure, which we have no appetite for..

We are going to meet asap GM President to put all possible pressure on him to 
accept to sell the company to a third party (Tamoil/BP are  potential 
buyers), and sign the few documents missing, giving us full control of ECTRIC 
Spain. We will then monitor situation on a daily basis;  fear that we will be 
in a difficult corner if Spanish conflict is not ending, and if company 
cannot get sold.

Thanks
Michel

    

Howdy from Tokyo.  Brutal trip.  Thanks for your follow-up
m

Sally,

Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly 
to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as 
an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very 
happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that 
you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you 
offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that 
momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most 
don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I 
have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we 
wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to 
accomplish with their guidelines.

Please keep me up informed on this matter.

Thanks and good luck with the students.

mike

   

While recruiting on campus recently I became aware that a decision was made 
at the Program level to not interview this fall for 2001 summer interns.  In 
talking with students and faculty at The University of Texas and University 
of Oklahoma, it became clear that there is concern over the feasibility of an 
internship with Enron, as other top firms will be recruiting this fall for 
summer 2001 interns.  I have communicated my concerns to Lexi Elliott and her 
manager, Shelley Jones, and was told by both that the decision to delay 
interviews for summer interns was made at a Program level based on Enron's 
staffing.  When I asked about the competitive data available regarding the 
practice of other firms on summer intern interviews, I was even more 
concerned to discover that neither Lexi nor Shelley had that data.  It would 
seem critical to know what the competition is doing in terms of summer intern 
interview schedules in order to understand the risk that could be created for 
Enron by not interviewing this fall for these important feeder positions for 
our Analyst and Associates programs.  

I have had conversations over the last two weeks with Lexi and Shelley, with 
no resolution.  When they could not provide the competitive data to either 
confirm or eliminate my concerns, I volunteered to have James Scribner, a  
Senior Director on my team, obtain this market information.  Lexi and Shelley 
either did not have the time to gather this data, or were not sure how to do 
so.  They were pleased to have some help in getting our hands on this 
critical information.  I now have information at hand with regard to firms 
that will be recruiting at UT and OU this fall for summer intern positions.   
And based on this information, I believe that Enron is at risk for not hiring 
top students as interns for the summer of 2001 if we do not interview for 
these positions this fall.  

While my research only touches on two of the schools at which Enron recruits, 
I want to raise concern over this as a potential problem at many, if not all 
campuses that we have targeted for recruiting.    As administrators of the 
program, you rely on the involvement of senior members of the company to 
carry the Enron message to campus.  I believe that we also have an obligation 
to make this a two-way messaging system.  I strongly believe that we must 
address this potential risk for Enron extremely quickly, as teams will be on 
campuses across the country to conduct interviews in a matter of days.  I 
suspect that many Enron participants in the recruiting process are unaware of 
the Program's decision regarding the timing of interviews for summer 
internships.  In working with Rick Causey and Mike McConnell, executive 
sponsors for UT and OU, respectively, they are as concerned as I about the 
decision on interviewing summer interns.  I have copied both of them on this 
note to the two of you. 

Please let me know how this can be resolved.  With the help of James Scribner 
and others, we have already compiled a list of students at UT and OU that 
should be targeted for summer internships.  I will offer as much of my time 
as is feasible to work with staff members of the Program to devise creative 
ways to turn this around.  

Doug,
Sounds fun but I can't commit now.  Please do not wait on me, go ahead and 
fill up the foursome.
thanks,mike

   
	
	

Mike,

Can you join us on Wednesday morning, November 15 to play golf at Canyon 
Springs golf course in San Antonio prior to the Enron Management Conference? 
Canyon Springs will allow us to book a 10:00am tee time thirty days in 
advance. Once I have confirmed the tee time I will forward directions to the 
course. Should be a fun group. Might even need a practice round at Champions 
prior to the trip. 

Doug

Jeff, You're right. I missed it.  Go ahead and send yours back with the 
Singapore operations and current trading operations exclusion and mention 
that I agree with your assessment also even though i said fine earlier).

I have not followed this closely  but question why we would give a noncompete 
for this much of Asia in exchange for what I gather is an increased 
expectation in the valuation of Newco in the future if we want to sell.  This 
was the one question I have asked about Dragon all along.  It is a big piece 
of the world to do everything as a minority with these two other partners 
going forward (or have them have a right of first refusal over whatever we 
do).  It is difficult to predict the future and this seems restricitive.  
Maybe I don't understand it all.

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

Jay,

Attached for your review and commentary is a copy of the draft review I 
prepared for Steve.  I would appreciate your views and please make changes 
you feel are necessary and appropriate.  It is set up for Thursday morning at 
9 am.  I could use your help. 

 What do you think?

mike

thanks, i like the letter.

Rick, Obviously we want to control access to the LNG terminal.  I don't 
really understand why it is so difficult if we go to 50%, its a negotiation 
item. Or at least a cheap retention option not to be given away for free.  
After your follow-up meetings, please let me know if we need to get more 
involved.

Mike/Jeff:  per your instructions, we have taken a look at Enrion India's 
plans regarding selldown of DPC/.Metgas to determine what impact this could 
have on our LNG business.  The second paragraph of Wade's note below sums up 
the current situation.  Bottom  line, if Metgas is sold down by Enron India 
from 100% to 50%, we would lose the right to control unilaterally decisions 
related to the use of the Dabhol LNG terminal.  I don't know how much someone 
may be willing to pay for Metgas, but I suspect that at this time it is a 
relatively small number when compared to the strategic value of controlling 
this terminal

We will discuss next week when we are in India.  Please advise if youhave any 
thoughts or suggestions

Rick

	enron india
	

Rick, we can discuss this more at length in Mumbai this coming week. Metgas 
is the only company that has any access to DPC's terminal. As you know, DPC 
is owned today by Enron (65), MSEB (15), GE (10) and Bechtel (10). At year 
end, Enron's 65 will be split to Enron (50) and new investor (15). Any 
changes to the terminal or the TARA have to be approved by DPC, which is 
heavily influenced, but not controlled, by Enron.

The real asset that Enron has today is the TARA, and Enron has this through 
Metgas. Under the TARA, Metgas has right to have DPC regassify any gas that 
Metgas delivers to DPC. In addition, Metgas has rights to increase size of 
terminal at its cost. So whoever owns and controls Metgas is who has the real 
value here. Today, Metgas is 100% owned and controlled by Enron, so Enron has 
control. But in any sale of Metgas, Enron's control will be lessened. Under 
current plans to avoid debt consolidation, we will reduce Enron's equity 
position to 50% or less, which means we are at best sharing control with 
someone else, or maybe a group of someone else's. If Enron is uncomfortable 
with this because it views access to Metgas terminal as part of larger LNG 
role, we should discuss ASAP.

AG -- please allow time on Wednesday's agenda to discuss these issues with 
Rick and Clay.

Wade

Clay:  I suggest taht you meet with David Forbes asap.

Bill/Wade:  I would like to understand how DPC/Metgas selldown will impact 
Enron's ability to control acces to the DPC LNG terminal.  If an LNG 
competitor buys in (e.g., Total or British Gas or Shell) could they block our 
acces to the terminal?

Bill Gathmann
09/28/2000 01:15 PM
Clay,

As you know, we are selling portions of both Dabhol and Metgas.  For fuel 
supply, they can supply Nahptha to Dabhol and LNG to Metgas.  They will have 
BOD positions pro rata with their ownership.   Finally, in the case of 
Dabhol, there are significant minority shareholder protections given the way 
the the various voting procedures are designed.  I am not as familiar with 
the Metgas voting procedures, but there is certainly the opportunity to 
negotiated something there since it is still in development.  Also, there 
should be attractive commercial returns with each project.

I feel that these opportunities certainly meets their investment criteria.  
If they are interested, we need to get them up to speed quickly.

Call me or let me know how you want to proceed on this.

Bill

Bill, please get back with Clay on this and let him know if you think there 
is a fit. It sounds like DPC meets their requirements, but as Bill is leading 
our selldown efforts, I'll let him respond.

Based on the email below is IPIC worth pursuing??? Please advise.

Clay,
Thanks for the information on DPC. IPIC's current focus on India is to
identify investments with related crude, naphtha or gas supply needs which
could be filled by Adnoc or Adgas, with priority currently assigned to
Adnoc's naphtha. IPIC would also be looking for a commercial return, BOD
participation & strong minority shareholder protection. Does the DPC
opportunity fit this profile? If so IPIC could certainly look at it...

Best Regards

Dave Forbes

TO: Houston Area Employees Participating in the Domestic Medical Plan Benefits

You may have recently received communication from United HealthCare (UHC) 
concerning Memorial Hermann Health Systems' (MHHS) decision to terminate 
their contract with UHC  in the Houston/Beaumont area.  This communication 
also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network 
due to this action.  It is our intent to help you understand the situation.

It is our understanding that Memorial Herman Health Systems asked for a 40% 
increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to 
you and Enron!  When United HealthCare attempted to negotiate with a counter 
proposal, Memorial Hermann cancelled their contract.

While this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and UHC, 
Enron continues to support UHC in their ongoing contract negotiation 
efforts.  At this time, it is only UHC which has been affected, however, it 
is our understanding that Cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group 
and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well.  

Many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals 
within the UHC Network or have contracted directly with UHC including those 
with admission privileges to The Woodlands, Sugarland and Clear Lake 
Hospitals, to name a few.  In a further effort to limit disruption to our 
affected employees and families who are enrolled in the UHC Network or EPO 
options, Enron has authorized UHC to process claims incurred between 
September 28 and December 31, 2000 as if the termination of the Memorial 
Hermann Health Systems from the network had not occurred and In-Network 
benefits applied.  Office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other 
charges will be covered at 90%.  Hospital admissions will still need to be 
pre-certified with UHC.

These steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by Primary 
Care Physician disruption from 1,050 to 127.

If You Need Medical Attention:  You or your doctor/hospital must call UHC's 
customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.  In some cases 
the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.  
If this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to 
UHC with a claim form for prompt reimbursement.  Claim forms can be obtained 
by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in Houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).

Open enrollment materials will be coming soon.  Take this opportunity to 
consider your elections for 2001.  

United HealthCare and Enron HR are committed to assisting Enron employees 
through this transition.  We will communicate any  further developments that 
may impact you or your family.

Carol,
Thanks for the email.  Please send it to the office upon your receipt.  On 
the coat, I don't have time to think about it now.  Thanks for bringing it to 
my attention.

Joe,

I enjoyed it as well.  We all have a lot to do and money to make!  I got a 
long voicemail back from K Lay on my message to him and he heard me on the 
ePower side.  He also said that he had heard similar concerns as well.  

Rick Bergseiker (LNG) will be calling you.  He left me a voicemail that he 
has been working with ePower quite a bit and has talked about 2 LNG 
facilities.  i told him to work with you.

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Don,  

Howdy from Tokyo.  Thanks for the email.  It was great hearing from you.  I 
would be happy to talk with you in Dallas about your business.

In the mean time, why don't you send me a new email (without the personal 
stuff) about your company and references to your website and i will forward 
it to the appropriate people within Enron with a note to insure that it gets 
the proper attention.

Thanks and see you soon.
Mike

 Hey Mike, It's been a long time since we last spoke, hope all is
well with you and the family in Houston. I saw Jonny & Brenda in Telluride
this weekend and he mentioned we would be getting together in Dallas. It
will be great to see yall again.  It's already that time of year for the big
shoot-out when the Horns tangle with the Sooners. It looks like this could
be another very interesting game, no telling what will happen with the way
both teams are playing this year.

 I have been thinking of you and I had planned to call you to talk a
little business. Our company, Nexstar  is now up and running and working
with major corporations like Enron to provide mortgage loans to their
relocating employees and as a benefit to the general employment base. We are
a high tech , high touch approach to mortgage lending providing employees
with internet and/or telephony interaction with Nexstar. As a follow-up to
our discussion in the bar last year in Dallas, I thought we could chat about
what's going on in the financial services industry and if Nexstar's products
and services could be of any benefit to Enron. If you have any interest you
can view our website at nexstarhome.com.

Please drop me a note or give me a call so we can catch up and even talk a
little business. I also wanted to talk about that ballpark with your name on
it. I have not had a chance to see it yet but plan to when I get down to
Houston. Take care, and don't forget to HOOK-EM  Horns!

   Don

Beverly,
Wow!  Fantastic.  Thanks for sharing your success and letter.
mike

I wanted to give you an update on my progress in EES with the JDF - - - -as 
of this afternoon, I have collected (with Enron matching) $4,600.  

This is the letter I sent to my solicitation list last week - .....  Pretty 
good for one week, right?

Good afternoon.

My 17 year old son has had diabetes since he was 2 years old.  Imagine this - 
as of today, Austin has taken more than 16,425 shots and more than 27,300 
finger sticks.  It never gets easier for him and it will never go away until 
a cure is found.   Diabetes is the leading cause of kidney failure, adult 
blindness and non-traumatic amputations, a leading cause of nerve damage, 
heart attack and stroke.  Until a cure is found, his health is better today 
than it will be tomorrow. 

Please let me know if I can count on you to walk with me or help raise funds 
for Juvenile Diabetes.  84% of the money raised goes directly to diabetes 
research.   My commitment to you is this - walk with me - I guarantee you a 
morning of fun, good times and the opportunity to meet a large, dynamic group 
of people committed to finding a cure.  Sponsor me - you will help millions 
of kids like mine that are desperately looking for a cure.  

The walk is on Sunday, November 5, 9:00 AM - 4.5 miles at Sam Houston Race 
Park.   If you cannot join in the walk but want to help monetarily, please 
send your check payable to the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) to my 
attention - 1400 Smith Street, EB 760 / Houston, Tx 
77002.                                                                        
                                                   

From the bottom of my heart, I thank you.    My son and millions of other 
kids with diabetes thank you as well.

Virginia, 

Thanks for the update.  I will not have an opportunity to talk with you right 
now.  I am in Tokyo and my next destination may change due to business events 
in the middle east.

I am very interested in acquiring Blue note, however,  I do want to know more 
about the price.  I was close to locating one via a gallery via ebay for a 
lot less.  Also, your price was $4,500 for the same piece framed.  Is there 
room on the price if I give you a firm commitment.  The ebay price is 
significantly discounted but they are not ready to close the deal yet 
either.  If you can't get them down on the price,  it is worth me chasing 
down the other option for a while.

Please let me know via email and I will attempt to be responsive via odd time 
zones.

Thanks,
mike

Dear Mike:

Glad to hear from you.

The Lichtenstein "Composition No. 4" is exactly like the one you saw except
that it would be a different number in the signed and numbered edition.  The
price is $4,500.00.  That is unframed.  We can frame the artwork like the
Liechtenstein you saw here or if you prefer like the Matisse.  You have that
option.

I will contact the owner and send you an image either by e-mail or by mail.
The window of opportunity to acquire the artwork is limited.

I would love to talk to you personally about the Matisse "Icarus" artwork.
When would be the best time to contact you and Chris?

As I mentioned to you this artwork is hard to find and cannot be easily
replaced.  Please keep in mind that several of our consultants are working
with clients and galleries to place this artwork.  I mention this only to
encourage to contact me if you have serious interest in adding this artwork to
your collection.

I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.

Most sincerely,

Mike,

Please see the attached POA authorizing you and Rick Bergsieker to execute 
the referenced agreement and related documents.  The timing of execution of 
these documents is unclear at this time.  This matter has been pending for 
about 5 months as full agreement has not been reached with PDVSA, I believe. 

Please note that I will need your passport number to include in the POA, as 
this is required by Venezuela law.  Thank you.

Rick,

Nancy Corbet has advised that the timing for the execution of the referenced 
document is unclear; however, a POA was prepared in April of this year, 
authorizing Frank Stabler, David Haug, and Doug Rotenberg as 
attorneys-in-fact to execute this and other related "transaction documents."

We should replace Frank and Doug.  Nancy has suggested that you could be 
named to replace one of them.  Is this okay with you?  Should David be 
retained?  Who else do you recommend naming as the third 
signatory/attorney-in-fact?

Please advise.

FYI, project Dragon.  It looks like it is done.  i replied that we understood 
and it was fine.

General Counsels -

At the direction of the Enron APACHI Office of the Chairman, I am sending 
this e-mail to you pursuant to the Enron Corp. Policy on Noncompetition.  I 
would appreciate if you would check with your CEO/COO regarding this e-mail 
and respond to me by Friday, September 29 if you have questions or concerns.  
Enron APACHI may need to commit to the following provisions (that bind Enron 
affiliates) by Monday, October 2.

Given the consolidating power generation market in Asia Pacific, Enron Asia 
Pacific/Africa/China (Enron APACHI) is proposing to enter into a transaction 
with Marubeni and Sithe Asia to combine the respective power generation 
portfolios into a single company (Newco).  Newco would be charged with making 
the shareholders' investments as liquid as possible to allow for sale of the 
shareholders' respective stakes in Newco.  

The shareholders believe that Newco must not be seen by the market as a 
"dumping ground" for existing power projects but rather as the vehicle 
through which the investors will continue to pursue power generation 
opportunities in Asia.  As a result, Enron APACHI proposes to include 
competition restrictions in the Marubeni/Enron Shareholder Agreement that 
would bind their respective affiliates.  

The following is a summary of these competition provisions:

Enron affiliates (with the exceptions stated below) could only develop or own 
power projects in the Asia Pacific Region (as defined below) after first 
offering the opportunity to Newco.  If Newco declines the opportunity, Enron 
would be free to own the project itself or offer the project to third parties 
provided that the terms do not materially improve.  Development or ownership 
does not include the provision of construction, O&M, offtaker or risk 
management services.

There are a number of exceptions to this rule:  (a) small projects involving 
20 MW or less; (b) projects in which Enron owns less than a 1/3 interest; (c) 
projects initiated by our SK joint venture; (d) Korean projects using natural 
gas produced by Enron; (e) projects obtained in a corporate acquisition in 
which Asia generation is less than 20% of the value of the acquisition; and 
(f) situations in which any Enron company would be exposed to fiduciary 
liability to another shareholder in complying with the competition 
restriction.

"Affiliates" will be defined to exclude Enron affiliates which are 
publicly-owned (e.g., Azurix).

"Asia Pacific Region" will be defined to include Brunei, China (including 
Hong Kong and Macau), South Korea, North Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, Laos, 
Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, East 
Timor, Singapore, Papua New Guinea and the Pacific Islands (including Guam, 
Saipan, the Federated States of Micronesia, and Fiji, but excluding Hawaii).  
It does not include Japan and Australia.

The competition clause would survive until the earlier of (a) Enron selling 
its interest in Newco or (b) December 31, 2003.

Thank you,
Bruce Lundstrom, General Counsel, Enron APACHI

Thanks, understood and good luck.

Hi Mary Anne -

I am responding to your message on behalf of Mike McConnell.  Mike is in 
Singapore at this time and we are not sure if he will be successful in 
dialing up to catch up on his e-mail correspondence.  

Thank you very much for your message.  We solicit one time lump-sum 
contributions to JDF rather than per mile.  In addition, we collect the 
pledges for the walk - rain or shine.  The reason of course is that our main 
goal is to raise money to find a cure and we would prefer that weather or 
other elements beyond our control not impact our ability to raise funds.  
However, we have a great time on walk day and we have a lot of people turn 
out for the walk.  This year we are anticipating in excess of 500 walkers.  
The total amount of donations that are turned in by Enron employees are very 
generously matched dollar-for-dollar by the Enron Foundation.  Therefore, the 
matching forms are not necessary.  

If you happen to be in Houston on November 5th we would enjoy having you join 
us for the walk.  If you care to make a donation, it may be mailed to Mike at 
the following address:

 Mike McConnell
 Enron Global Markets
 1400 Smith Street, EB 3328
 Houston, TX  77002

If you donate $25 or more you are entitled to an Enron/JDF Walk T-shirt.  If 
you are interested just send us your size (M-L-XL-XXL) and location and we 
will get one to you.

Thanks again.

Hi Mike -
Saw your announcement regarding the walk on wEBSource.  Although I don't have 
the funds to fly down to Houston to participate, I'd be happy to at least 
make a donation!  How are the donations tallied?  Pledge per mile walked?  
Lump sum contribution?  Let me know!

I too am an insulin dependant diabetic - for 32 years now - and do know what 
a child goes through when diagnosed with this disease.  I just thank God that 
I have parents that instilled a strong sense of self and urged me to 
understand as much about the disease as possible.  I've seen too many kids 
and young adults, in my association with the Oregon Chapter of the JDF, that 
didn't understand and didn't want to deal with their diabetes - some of them 
dying at a very young age due to complications.  I volunteer my time to talk 
to newly diagnosed diabetic children, so they and their parents can 
understand that it isn't a death sentence, it's a way of life.  And a way of 
life that can be long and productive.

Here's wishing you the best in your endeavors on the JDF's behalf.

FYI, the "Hanjin Muscat"  sucessfully delivered our Oman spot cargo at Lake 
Charles and departed without incident on the evening of 24 September

Because of the high price differential (ENA bought the LNG from us at $4.23 
Henry Hub price) we drew down on the LNG heel and thus discharged more LNG 
than ENA had committed to buy.  By doing this, we picked up perhaps an 
additional $50 thousand of income in excess of what was originally intended.  
I expect that our total net income from this cargo will be about $175 thousand

congrats.  see you next year.

Hello Kevin,

My name is Joseph Mathew and I used to work with Enron from 1996-1999, where
I was last a commercial Director as of 1998.  I was asked to contact you
directly by my friend Abrar Sait, whom with I am sure you are acquainted.

I am currently a Vice President and Senior Officer of Chematch.com, a
Houston-based online bulk petrochemical, polymer and fuel products trading
exchange.  We founded the firm over one year ago, and things have been going
quite well.

However, the landscape for our business model, industry market penetration,
as well as increased competition has eroded the chance for strong revenue
success of this company, and I wish to return to Enron, but staying within
the dynamic, challenging high-tech areas, such as Broadband Services.

My responsibilities here at Chematch.com have been multiple-fold.  I have
been directly responsible for the creation of the business strategy/plan
(and its changes), the pro-forma financial statements and projections that
permutate with the strategy, key strategic alliances with best of breed
industry participants, venture capital raising process for 3 Series of
funding, the Investment Banking presentations/diligence/IPO work, and
currently head up Petrochem.net, the sister company within Chematch.com.

Prior to joining Enron, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a
Master of Business Administration in Analytic Finance and Accounting.  Prior
to b-school, I worked on Wall Street for 3 1/2 years in investment banking
and capital markets.

Attached is a copy of my resume.  It could be a bit more detailed, but I
prefer to keep it lean as it is easier to read, and I can always talk it
through in detail.

My goal is to procure a challenging leadership position within a business
developement role, such as Mergers & Acquisition, Venture Capital, or
liasing between deal structuring and commercial marketers.

Please review my resume when you get a chance.  I appreciate that you are
very busy, but I would very much appreciate hearing back from you if you see
a fit between what I can offer and what your company is doing.

John,

I just realized that I didn't return your call on Friday.  I ran out of the 
office on Friday after two difficult days and had Cathy collect all my stuff 
for my trip.  Jeff and I landed in Singapore last night at 1am (it is odd 
leaving for the airport on Sat. morning and arriving on Monday morning) and 
are in the office for a while this afternoon.  I'll give you a call a little

is a tough one.   Please let me know your views on the tone and message as 
well.  I will give him  the actual review when i get back from Asia.

Thanks,
mike

 

Unfortunately, Mike will be unable to attend the meeting on Sept. 29th since

Joe,

Stan Horton has been invited to attend a series of meetings associated with  
INGAA in Tokyo.  I believe that Stan is the Chairman of INGAA.  There are 
some Tokyo companies that are a part of the organization.  Bill Smith, CEO of 
Sonat (now El Paso) and will be talking about LNG and Japanese requirements 
and will be going to Tokyo.  Stan has asked both Sherriff and me if this is 
worth his attendance.  I thought you would be the best answer to that.  I 
also told him that you could represent Enron very well in any meeting in 
Japan. 

Please call Stan at 713 853 6177 and discuss with him.  He can fill you in 
better on the details.  Your call.

Thanks, 
mike

George,

I would like to have a brief (30 minute) meeting about the noise in the 
political system about synfuel and reaffirm Jordon's viewpoint on Section 29 
credits.  This is big issue and without this reaffirmation I believe we will 
have approval issues with RAC and others.  I want Jeff and/or I in the 
meeting. 

Thanks,
mike

CP, what do you think of this draft.  Too close to last year?

will be more than happy to coordinate with the rest of the ag team.

Please read the following message from Jeff Shankman:

Mike and I have spent the last few weeks meeting with the different business 
teams and would like to begin our staff/budget meetings.  We feel this will 
provide an opportunity to build our management team, to ensure long term 
viability of our business, and to establish new contacts and to present 
business ideas in a flexible manner.  

Our first meeting will be on Monday, September 18th, from 8:30 - 9:30 a.m. in 
video conference room EB 32C2.  Thank you.

Thank you all for signing up to be Team Leaders for our JDF Campaign this 
year.  The first Enron JDF/Team Leader Luncheon is today, Wednesday, 
September 13th, at 11:30 a.m. at the Met.  This will be a very important and 
informative session and I hope that everyone will attend.  

I look forward to seeing you at the luncheon.

My sincerest thanks to all of you that were able to attend the JDF Kick-off 
Luncheon on September 6th.  It was a great event and a wonderful opportunity 
for those of you not familiar with JDF to find out what the JDF Walk is all 
about.  For those of you that were not able to join us, we missed you and we 
look forward to having you join us for our future sessions.

The Enron/JDF Team Leaders Kick-off Luncheon will take place on Wednesday, 
September 13th, at the Houston Metropolitan Racquet Club (The Met) beginning 
at 11:30 a.m.  I would like to encourage each of you to mark your calendar 
and make plans to attend this very important luncheon meeting.  At this 
kick-off meeting we will be distributing supplies and gift bags, reviewing 
important details about our campaign, learning more about JDF, and discussing 
our fundraising goal for this year's campaign.  Enron has been the number 1 
walk team in Houston for 5 years in a row and we plan to continue in that 
position and we need your help to make it happen!  

Please take just a moment to RSVP your attendance via e-mail to Rachel Feldt

Attached you will find the first draft of the B-plan for Europe.
Please give me feedback on it and I will finish it.

When it comets to limits for European Weather I would say that we within the 
next 6 to 12 months would need $3 million ( same as world wide weather today)
So we need to discuss this more before I type up the formal limit request 
letter.

Hi Mike,

I don't know if you'll appreciate the following info, but there is a book 
called "The Cure For All Diseases" by Hulda Clark. She outlines how to cure 
diabetes so there is no need to take insulin.  It worked for my hypoglycemia, 
and a lot of other things.

$500.  I do not see this function as a competition, only as a wonderful 
opportunity to help so many people fight a disease that touches too many 
lives.  I have not worked for Enron for very long but I am happy to know that 
we have been #1 for 5 years!!  I hope that I can help to keep it that way 
again!!  I think that what you are doing is so great and I just felt like 
telling you!  Hope to meet you at the walk!!

          Sincerely,
          Lacye Brymer Trevino

Mike: You can certainly count on my support.  My son Brandon Johnson was 
diagnosis with JD when he was 11 years old.  Needless to say my family was 
traumatised by the event, however my son handled it like a trooper.  He is 
now 16 years old and has very good days with his blood sugar, but then he has 
his bad ones as well.  I have walked since he was first diagnosed with JD and 
will continue to provide my support.

Thx

Wanda

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this

THE ROAD WARRIOR REPORT - VOLUME VI, ISSUE 7 - SEPTEMBER 10, 2000 -

PRESENTED BY SOONERFANS.COM

NORMAN - The heat was down, the offense was clicking, and the Sooners  looked

much crisper in defeating Arkansas State Saturday night, 45-7, for a

pleasant 40th birthday present for head coach Bob Stoops. Josh Heupel,  who

completed 50% of his passes last week, but was inconsistent and  off-target

at times, bounced back with his usual superb showing against the Indians.

Heupel completed 24 of 32 passes (75%) for 301 yards, one interception,  and

three TDs. In the process, he tied former Sooner QB (now OU running backs

coach) Cale Gundy's career record for TD passes with 35. It took Gundy  four

years to set the record, while Heupel equaled it in only one year and two

games.

The Sooner special teams, which were solid but not spectacular against  UTEP,

had their moments against Arkansas State. The punt return game was

outstanding, as J.T. Thatcher broke Jarrail Jackson's single-game record  for

punt return yardage, set last season against Missouri. Thatcher's stellar

day included a 66-yard punt return for a TD and an interception from his

safety spot on defense.

Mike,

Thanks a lot for your efforts here.  I've got interviews with Louise K, 
Jeffrey Shankman and Dan Reck this week!  I'll let you know if anything 
happens.

Fred

   

Dan,

Fred has not had much luck with getting attention with this.  This sounds 
like it should be in your (new) group.  Please give Fred a call, I think this 
sounds very interesting and is worth a follow-up.

Mike

Hello Louise:

I recently authored a white paper, giving some background on the air cargo 
business for Enron Net Works.  In the paper, I identified the hurdles we 
would need to overcome in order to create a market for trading air cargo 
capacity futures, none of which were deemed insurmountable.  I further 
suggested that Enron could approach this business by leveraging EOL to act as 
a non vessel owning common carrier, trading physical capacity while readying 
the market (and ourselves!) for financial trading.

I am very interested in moving this business idea along here within Net 
Works.  I have some ideas regarding likely industry partners that could move 
us along rather quickly.  I think the logical next step may be to get with 
you or with someone on your staff to begin some dialog with the eventual goal 
of creating a business plan.  Any thoughts?

Thanks!

Fred Philipson
5-9323

Congrats to all.  Jeff and I believe that EOL is a vital part of growing our 
businesses and your focus is appreciated.
mike 

Nice job, John.  Keep the volumes and information flows growing - $$$ will 
follow.

 August EOL EmissionsTrades exceeded projections and posted another record 
trade month. We continue to show signs of strong trade growth and gaining 
market share. I am hopeful that Arizona Public Service & Conectiv will use 
the system more heavily in the future (hedge option trades) and that we can 
obtain at least one new counterparty a month vis-.-vis EOL marketing/and or 
our own internal marketing.  Our gain in market share has not gone 
unchallenged. Bloombergs Powermatch system has been more active in the last 
month and bid/ask spreads continue to narrow. To combat this we continue to 
show (90% of the time) the tightest markets and obviously offer a cost 
advantage over the Broker market & Bloomberg.   The increase in EOL volume 
has increased liquidity in the whole market.  I am hopeful that overall 
market volumes continue to grow as we get closer to compliance.

Number of Trades: 77
Number of Allowances: 192,500
Approx. Notional Trade Value: $28,875,000

Ron,

Thanks for the great news.  Also thanks so much for the gifts that I just 
received.  I wrote you a separate note on Friday, but I wanted to thank you 
again. The car is great and it arrived in a time of chaos and was a very 
pleasant distraction.

I am gathering information on my BMW so that I can sell that to the 
dealership at the same time I pick up my new car.  I will have all my lease 
information with me.  I have a few months left on the lease and will have all 
the needed information to complete the transaction.  If you would, please 
forward this to or let me know who I should deal with at the North side 
dealership.  I don't want another Bob Brooks situation to occur.  Also I 
don't want him dealing with the purchase of my BMW since I believe he is in 
that part of the dealership now.   I expect a fair price for my car and with 
our history, I don't want him involved in pricing my car.  I am confident 
that someone else will be better to deal with and will give me a fair deal 
with my cash purchase for the CL.  I guess I just need a name at the 
dealership. 

Thanks,
mike

Mike:
I am in San Francisco on a short vacation (wife's Zurich, Switz. high school 
reunion).  However, I made a call this am to the Jacksonville, FL port and 
your car has arrived.  They could not give me any details yet as they are in 
the process of surveying (inspecting) all the cars that came off the ship 
whch is stanadard operating procedure.  Since your planned trip is in October 
and today is 9/8, I have to assume that you should be in your car by then.  
While I know what "assume" means, I also know that the port will not release 
any car until they have inspected it and have determined that it has no flaws 
(ie. scratched bumper that may have happened on the ship).  So, while I 
really cannot give you a 100% guarantee as to when you will receive your car, 
I do believe you should be fine for your trip to Dallas.  At times, it's a 
frustrating procedure, but in the end it is the correct way to deliver a MB 
and especially this type of car.
Ron

Ron,

I'm back in the office today and was of course thinking about my car.  Did
we make the dates you referenced earlier?  I have a weekend in Oct. that
will require a drive to Dallas to meet many of my old school friends and
was wondering if I would have the car.  Also, I have an extensive
international travel schedule coming and I can schedule around a possible
delivery date.

Thanks,

As we discussed today, I am sending you this preliminary list of the Calme 
employees.  I will also fax a copy to your attention at the Drake Hotel.

We still have some work in progress on the allocations of certain people.

Upon your return we can begin to review the individuals on the list.

The enclosed list indicates the current proposed "New Roles" for each of the 
Calme employees.  As mentioned on the phone, we've allocated the employees 
among:  

Deploy immediately (however, certain individuals will have residual jobs to 
complete)
Transition Team (TT) to carry out the deployments and asset disposals
LNG/Middle East to go to EGM
Southern Cone (SC) (for Venezuela and Colombia businesses)
EES (which primarily include our development engineers and certain 
technical/operations people)

The table also indicates the Calme senior people (Resp Pty) assigned to 
ensure that no individual falls through the cracks.

The column "Calme" merely indicates our current internal sub-groupings, and 
you may wish to ignore it.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Shawn

Thanks and good luck.  Be sure and thank your wife for me for all her efforts.

Mark,

The bigger issue is what are we going to do with EE&CC.  If their time is 
coming and we need to split them up then I would agree with this but 
otherwise I am not sure this is the best thing to do.  I have had very little 
actual work with EE&CC in the past year and can't really comment on their 
effectiveness.

This fundamentally changes the entire basis of our approach to EECC and the 
way that the engineering organization works. The idea was that the 
engineering expertise resides in EECC.If u want to change that, it requires a 
broader discussion.

Larry L Izzo
09/08/2000 04:37 PM
In light of the lesson learned on Project Lightening and in view of the 
recent CALME reorganization, I suggest we simplify the payroll structure for 
Development Engineers (DE's).  Currently, the DE's listed below are still on 
EECC's payroll, although they are direct-line support to the Regions/Business 
Units.  I suggest that all DE's transfer from EECC's payroll to the Business 
Units they are supporting.  Some DE's are already on the regions' payrolls  I 
don't think this will have a budget impact, because at this time each region 
below is paying the total costs for these engineers, through EECC invoices.  
Please let me know if each of you agree and I will have HR do the payroll 
switch.

My sincerest thanks to all of you that were able to attend the JDF Kick-off 
Luncheon on September 6th.  It was a great event and a wonderful opportunity 
for those of you not familiar with JDF to find out what the JDF Walk is all 
about.  For those of you that were not able to join us, we missed you and we 
look forward to having you join us for our future sessions.

The Enron/JDF Team Leaders Kick-off Luncheon will take place on Wednesday, 
September 13th, at the Houston Metropolitan Racquet Club (The Met) beginning 
at 11:30 a.m.  I would like to encourage each of you to mark your calendar 
and make plans to attend this very important luncheon meeting.  At this 
kick-off meeting we will be distributing supplies and gift bags, reviewing 
important details about our campaign, learning more about JDF, and discussing 
our fundraising goal for this year's campaign.  Enron has been the number 1 
walk team in Houston for 5 years in a row and we plan to continue in that 
position and we need your help to make it happen!  

Please take just a moment to RSVP your attendance via e-mail to Rachel Feldt 
on the Corporate Lotus Notes directory or to rachel.feldt@enron.com.

The Steering Committee members for this year's campaign are listed below.  
Please feel free to contact me or any Steering Committee member if you have

Can you please arrange for this message to be sent to all of Enron - Houston 
this evening.  It should have Mike McConnell's letterhead and we would like 
an opportunity to preview the final message before it goes out.  Please 
contact me at X-36898 if you have any questions.  Thanks.  

Cathy Phillips

It is my sincere honor to once again lead the Enron team in this year's 
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation (JDF) walk scheduled to take place on Sunday, 
November 5, 2000, at the Sam Houston Race Park.  I continue to serve on the 
board of JDF representing Enron and will be Enron's corporate executive for 
this year's fundraising efforts.

As many of you may already know, I am an insulin dependent diabetic myself.  
Even though I know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the 
multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, I cannot 
imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease.  Taking 
insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of 
complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it 
they would die.

Enron continues to be a major corporate sponsor for JDF again this year.  JDF 
is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money 
raised goes directly to research.  Enron's goal this year is to raise 
$225,000 and we need your help.  Enron has been the number 1 walk team for 5 
years in a row and we are not ready to give up first place!  We need team 
leaders, walkers and volunteers to help us reach our goal.  The theme for the 
walk this year is "Knock Out Diabetes" and we would like to have you join us 
for this great event.  The Walk is truly a blast and we had about 500 Enron 
people participate last year and everyone enjoyed it.

If you are interested in volunteering to be a walker or a team leader, or if 
you would like to make a pledge, you may call any of the steering committee 
members listed below.  If you are interested in being a team leader, please 
contact one of the following people immediately so that you may be included 
in the first important and informative training session taking place this 
week.

Thank you very much for your support.

Stuart,

A quick second follow up.  I talked again with Cindy Olson and she has 
discussed the issue in detail with the Astros organization.  They are going 
to think about this and examine for next season.  They did say that this was 
the first time this was brought up but they want to be sensitive and will 
consider at change.

Thanks for bringing this to my attention.

Mike 

I think so, you saw the email i sent this morning regarding india.  You must 
visit there so we need to have it atleast long enough for you to visit!!!!!!!!

Dear Mr. McConnell:

I have been referred to you by a neighbor of mine, George Fastuca. I have
known George for approximately 18 months and when he heard I was looking to
do differently he strongly suggested I contact you. I am searching for a
position that will permit me to utilize the broad based business experience I
have acquired in commercial and investment banking, industry and public
accounting.

Most recently, I was Vice President for American Electric Power Energy
Services, a natural gas and electric power trading start up, responsible for
business development. As Senior Vice President of Capital Markets at Chase
Manhattan Bank, I launched an extremely successful derivative
products/structured finance business in Texas and contiguous states. At
Continental Bank, Citicorp and Motorola, Inc., I was responsible for a
variety of innovative marketing and financial initiatives which included
establishing new businesses, restructuring existing businesses and
refinancing established or newly acquired businesses.

Attached is a copy of my resume. Qualities which have contributed to my
success are:

? Entrepreneurial. 3 of my last 4 positions were start ups or turnarounds.
Experience with early stage ventures and acquisition identification.
? Partnership. Ability to build strong relationships by providing solid
counsel and negotiating skills. Established and maintained excellent working
relationships with other senior operating managers.
? General Management. Have held full P&L responsibilities. Established
policies, programs and procedures to achieve growth objectives, including
recruitment, evaluation and development of personnel.
? Core Competencies. Development and refinement of organization
infrastructure, including external marketing, joint venture relationships,
internal operations management, strategic planning and new product
development. Have identified and concluded acquisitions. International
experience.

I would appreciate the opportunity to speak with you about opportunities at
Enron. I will call Cathy this Friday to see if there is an appropriate time
when we may speak next week.

Sincerely,

Michael E. Fitzgerald

Julie,

Thanks for the email.  I have moved again within Enron.  I am now President 
and CEO (about 3 weeks ago) for Enron Global Markets, a new business unit 
within Enron's wholesale group.  This group is responsible for all Crude and 
Products, Coal, Emissions, Global Risk Mgt. (insurance), weather, LNG, F/X, 
interest rates, equities and agriculture.  It's a wild time yet again for the 
McConnell family.  It's nice to be back in the energy business.

On the technology side, Phillipe Bibi is the Chief Technology Officer for 
Enron Net Works and he would be a good contact.  His email address is 
phillipe.bibi@enron.com

Thanks and I'll pass on SMU news to Chris.  Her email address at home is 
mmccontex@aol.com.  Say hello to Bob.

Tell Chris that we are heading up to see the SMU ponies in their new
stadium!!  Know you are busy, but have been trying to find out the contact
person in your new business unit.  Just completed two more assignments for
dot.coms, and have two others on the crest of huge developments.  Any help
would be appreciate, as we might be able to explore some mutual business
opportunities.  Thanks..

CP,

Attached is the latest draft copy of the memo.  Each group has had an 
opportunity to comment and it has been amended several times.

I would like you to take a look at it and add your comments and changes.  You 
are always the key to a good memo and your changes are vital to making this a 
first rate memo.  Also Freight is in blue and i don't know how to take it 
back to normal.

I would like this out on Tuesday evening.  After i get your version back, go 
ahead and make your changes directly on the memo. Please send to Jeff for 
final review and one more pass thru the business units on Monday.

Thanks,
m

I'm there!

Mike, I am in the middle of the Project Triple Lutz data room and unable to 
attend the OU recruiting meeting tomorrow - HOWEVER, I will do anything you 
or the recruiting office needs me to do to get more Sooners down here.  Let 
me know what I can do to help.

Patrick

Wade,

Thanks for the email.  I would be an angle investor in your 24 hour a day 
extension machine.  If anyone could do it, it would be Sanjay.  I would very 
much like to meet with you.  Jeff as well.  I"ve got several openings that I 
can create on Wed Sept 13th.  10:30 - 11:15, 1:30 - 2:00; 3:30 - 5:00.  

Let me know what works.

Mike

Mike,

I saw today's announcement regarding you taking responsibility for the Global 
LNG work. This is great news, and congratulations. And as soon as I fine tune 
my invention for Sanjay of granting more than 24 hours in a day, I'll forward 
it to you also, as you both need it.

I would like for Sanjay and me to have an opportunity to discuss India and 
its LNG potential with you. Both Sanjay and I are in town next week for the 
PRC process, and I am tied up Monday in that and you and Sanjay are busy 
Tuesday with PRC. Would it be possible to visit with you sometime on 
Wednesday, Sept. 13 for 30 to 45 minutes so that we can give you an overview 
of the India LNG market, discuss some opportunities and challenges we have 
learned in our couple of years of marketing to downstream customers, and 
perhaps some things that Enron can do to really take a dominant position in 
the India LNG market? I'll put together a brief overview presentation, and we 
can walk you through that presentation. After our meeting with you, I would 
be happy to discuss this with other members of your new team as well.

Please let me know if a meeting on Wednesday works for your schedule. 

Thanks,
Wade

Dan,

Fred has not had much luck with getting attention with this.  This sounds 
like it should be in your (new) group.  Please give Fred a call, I think this 
sounds very interesting and is worth a follow-up.

Mike

Hello Louise:

I recently authored a white paper, giving some background on the air cargo 
business for Enron Net Works.  In the paper, I identified the hurdles we 
would need to overcome in order to create a market for trading air cargo 
capacity futures, none of which were deemed insurmountable.  I further 
suggested that Enron could approach this business by leveraging EOL to act as 
a non vessel owning common carrier, trading physical capacity while readying 
the market (and ourselves!) for financial trading.

I am very interested in moving this business idea along here within Net 
Works.  I have some ideas regarding likely industry partners that could move 
us along rather quickly.  I think the logical next step may be to get with 
you or with someone on your staff to begin some dialog with the eventual goal 
of creating a business plan.  Any thoughts?

Thanks!

Ron,

I'm back in the office today and was of course thinking about my car.  Did we 
make the dates you referenced earlier?  I have a weekend in Oct. that will 
require a drive to Dallas to meet many of my old school friends and was 
wondering if I would have the car.  Also, I have an extensive international 
travel schedule coming and I can schedule around a possible delivery date.

Thanks,
mike

Renee,

What a wonderful surprise to see you in the Enron Building today!  I thought 
you had left the Company.  Glad I was wrong.   I want to get caught up with 
what you've been up to since Park Street.   As I mentioned, maybe we can grab 
Mike and get some lunch next week.   Or if you and Mike have already shared 
recent histories you and I can go.  I have no plans next Wednesday, Thursday, 
or Friday.  Mike?

Mike McConnell is out of the office on vacation until next Wednesday.  He 
does not have his computer with him on this trip, therefore he has asked me 
to scan his e-mail for him.  Since he returns Wednesday, his calendar is very 
full and unfortunately he will be in a meeting with the Executive Committee 
off-site on Friday.  I can tentatively hold 1:30 - 2:00 p.m. on Wednesday 
afternoon.  Since I will be unable to confirm this meeting with Mike until he 
returns that same morning, can you please call me at X-36898 on Wednesday 
morning to confirm the appointment.

Thank you.

Cathy Phillips
Assistant to Mike McConnell

I understand you were in London last week. I'm sorry I missed you. As you 
know we have people in London supporting coal, global liquids etc and I would 
like to take the opportunity to chat about your plans and how we can assist 
you in the most efficient manner possible. 

I am in Houston next week with Janine Juggins who leads our trading support 
team in tax and would be available Wednesday afternoon or Friday morning to 
meet if you can fit us into your diary.

Regards

Rod

Jane,
I certainly fine with joining the board.

Pup,

Howdy.   Back from the UK and Norway and am off for vacation to Boston and 
area for a wedding in Chris' family at lunch today.  There will be 65 Flynns 
there.  Hopefully it will be cooler.  

Update for Dallas.  Golf - tee time for 4 (I didn't know if anyone else would 
join us) at 1:28.  Spa - Brenda and Chris both have 1 1/2 hours massages at 
1:50 pm.  If Brenda wants anything else she can call the Four Seasons but at 
least they both have a spot.  I look forward to the weekend.  

This is the most prepared we will have ever been for the weekend.

Mike 

We have a reservation and made one for you as a backup which I will cancel.
Golf & massages sounds great.   1 pm on Friday for golf would be great.  I
have the tickets covered.

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Pelt,

We have made reservations for Fri. and Sat,  I didn't make yours but i
would move quickly.  Would you like me to set up a tee time and massages
for the girls?  I figured a 1 pm tee time?  Also what about tickets for the
game itself.  Will you have access as years gone by or does the search need
to begin?

Mike

You are the first to be invited and there are no plans yet other than
showing up.  Will you handle your own reservations?

Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

Pup,

That sounds great to us.  I take it you are not bringing the kids.  Have
you already made reservations and a tee time?  Who else is included in
this?  Also, am i interfering by inviting ourselves in your plans!

Mike

We definitely are planning to go to Texas - O.U.  We are considering
staying
at the Four Seasons at Los Colinas.  Possibly a little golf and R & R mixed
in with the game.  It would be a bit out of the way.  We might go up as
early as Friday morning to play golf that afternoon.  Let me know what you
think.

Jonny,

Thank you so much for the email and kind words.  I was very moved by it and
you know I feel the same way.  I have become very reflective with the more
"success" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.  I am so thankful
and appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual,
it has grown more deeply.  I see so many people that have lost their
perspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the
blessings that our family has received.  Chris and I often discuss how we
can help others and what can we do to really make a difference.

The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.   Thanks, and give my
love to your family.

Mike

PS:  What about OU - Texas, do you have any ideas or plans already in the
works?

Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance
because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we
strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the
incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age.
You
and I are two of the luckiest people in the world and must always remember
to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive.

Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my
friend.

Jonny

Please consider this as authorization for use of this room.

Mike:

Your authorization is required to reserve conference room EB3014 from August 
29 - October 15 for the McKinsey Railroad study.  During this time the room 
will not be available to anyone other than McKinsey team.

My assistant, Angie has received authorization from Lisa Cousino, ENA/EGM 
floor co-ordinator, to utilize EB3014 for the period mentioned, but Lisa 
needs to hear directly from you that this is ok.

Thanks for your help,

Dan Reck

Fred,
Louise Kitchen was going to look into this.  Please give her a call and get 
an update.  
Thanks,
mike

   

Mike,

I haven't heard much feedback.  I'm sure these things take time, but anything 
yet?

Thanks,
Fred

   

Fred, thanks for the info and I am going to give it to several people to look 
at.  I do need to move our meeting.  I'lll be in touch to reschedule.
Thanks,
mike

Joe,
Sorry for the big delay in all my responses.  I'm out on vacation Wed - Wed. 
and can't make the video call. Please don't hesitate to set up with 
Shankman.  In general he is very on board with a big effort in Asia and 
realizes my views on Asia and that we have issues in Singapore.  Japan will 
be a  real focus for Enron Global Markets.  He could use an update.
mike

Joseph P Hirl@ENRON
08/27/2000 05:49 PM
Mike,

Would it be possible to get yourself and Shankman on a video call sometime 
this week?  While we have given you an update a little over a month ago, 
quite a bit has happened since then.  This might also be a good intro for 
Shankman, particularly before we can you the both of you over this way.

Wed your time would be preferable... but we are flexible.

Joe

Apologies again, we do need to talk.  Asia is critical to our growth and we 
do need to talk.  My schedule is a mess but as i stated in last email, go 
ahead and call Jeff and discuss.  LNG is ours and thanks for the input.  We 
will be making big changes and growing without incumbency.  Mike Brown does 
work for us but I dont really know what he does and would like your input.

mike

Joseph P Hirl@ENRON
08/21/2000 10:01 PM
Mike,

Any chance we could set  a time for Jonathan and me to speak with you and 
Shankman on crude & liquids possibilities in Asia?  Also has Mike Brown and 
his group now moved under Global markets?  And lastly, any further thoughts 
on LNG?  These LNG guys showed up this week without much direction and it 
turns out the person they were going to meet with is not even here.  In 
effect, they have come to Japan to make a conference call.

Joe

Understood, here's to hoping.
m

Darren Maloney@ENRON
08/28/2000 04:30 PM
Agreed, Mike.  I think they are a strong company, however I don't think they 
will be looking for another round.
I think the 2nd round takes them through the critical mass of content......

talk about.  Thanks, Thomas x58286.

Our relocation to the new building is fast approaching and there are several 
important move related items that I would like to stress at this time.  I 
would appreciate your cooperation with the key move issues that are outlined 
below:

IMPORTANT - A special building tour has been scheduled for the EGM business 
unit heads receiving this message.  Jeff and I, along with Bill Donovan, 
would like to invite you to join us for a tour on this Friday morning, June 
8th, from 8:30 to 9:30 a.m.  Even if you have already had an opportunity to 
visit the new building, we think this would be a great opportunity for all of 
us to see the space together and discuss any issues at that time.  Please 
contact Cathy Phillips at X-36898 if you plan to attend the tour.
New building floor plan modification requests will no longer be accepted.  
Any change requests that have already been received are currently being 
considered and will be conveyed to the appropriate business unit head.
If vacant positions exist and they will be filled before the move on August 
3rd, they need to be identified on all reports and floor plans with their 
name, NH (for new hire) and an approximate hire date.  Example:  Bob Smith NH 
7/25
Any space/move related questions or issues that may arise should be addressed 
by Cathy Phillips.  Please do not contact Susan Lopez for any space related 
issues.  Jeff and I have asked Cathy and Jennifer Burns to be responsible for 
the allocation of space in the new building and they are keeping us well 
informed as to the progress and any issues as they arise.
Jeff and I are very aware that space is very tight in the new building and we 
will be addressing growth and additional space needs and issues in the near 
future.
A limited number of Turret phones will be available in the new building.  The 
Turret phones will be assigned to traders and their assistants only.  
Everyone else on the floor will receive a new upgraded version of the Lucent 
phone (with the existing phone numbers).  Please contact Jennifer Burns if 
you have any questions or issues related to phones.
All private team rooms, offices and conference rooms have been assigned and 
there are no more available for assignment to the individual groups or 
people.  On the 3rd floor we will have the following public conference space 
available by making reservations (specific scheduling details to follow 
later):
1 Mega conference room
1 Large conference room with videoconference capabilities
1 Large conference room - no videoconference 
3 Team rooms
File space on the floor is being upgraded and allocations of file space will 
be made for each group.  Every attempt is being made to have the assigned 
file space as close to each individual group as possible.
At this time, details related to food deliveries and distribution have not 
been resolved.  Your patience and flexibility with all food related issues 
will be appreciated.  It is highly probable that food service in the new 
building will be very difficult at first and as we get closer to the move 
date, more information will be provided related to food service, deliveries 
and distribution.
Since Jeff and I both already keep Cathy and Jennifer very busy, we would 
appreciate it if you would send all your comments, questions, or issues to 
them via e-mail.  They have agreed to make themselves available every Monday 
at 4:30 p.m. to meet with anyone to discuss their questions.  Please make 
arrangements with them directly to meet regarding your issues.
There will be a 60 day freeze on any building changes once we move into the 
new building.

I understand that this is a difficult process and that there are a lot of 
questions and issues, but Jeff and I are convinced that this will be great 
and everything will work out in time.  Thank you for your cooperation and 
assistance in making this transition to the new building as smooth as 
possible.

Mike

John, 

Attached is the latest draft for your review.  I changed the format on your 
section and some of the wording.  I was attempting to make this easier for 
some of your employees by the wording.  

Are you sure you want to separate out Doug F from Randy's group?  I also 
added Doug L in there as well.  

Please check the wording and spelling of everyone's name carefully.

Please make any changes on the attached word file and return. I'll cut and 
paste your new section in the master memo.  

Thanks,
Mike

Yes, I thought it went well also.  We can find a way to get a long term 
commitment from EOTT, thus changing their organization, without taking on the 
price risk.  

On the hiring, I think that is a good idea.  If it is put in a way that due 
to the extensive growth that we expect to have, you want to be in the hiring 
loop, I don't see how people can object.  It is not a trust situation but an 
additional reference point.  We are here to help.
mike

   
	
	

I think that meeting with Stan was good.  I'll push Nowlan, Schroeder, etc.

On another note, I want to send out an email to the business unit heads about 
hiring.  Obviously crucial to our business growth is more talent, I'm just 
worried we could be bringing in people on the trading side that do not 
upgrade our group.  After we feel more comfortable, and I feel good our 
assessment of talent, I'd loosen the reigns substantially.  This is driven by 
the crude and products group primarily.  Any thoughts?  

Jeff

Cathy, before I forget, would you please make a tee time of approx. 1pm for 4 
people at the golf course at the Four Seasons under my name (friday).  Also 
if you would set up massages for Brenda Jones and Chris at about the same 
time or later.  I would really appreciate it.  All can be a little later but 
cant be any earlier.  We need to begin golf by 2pm to finish.
thanks,
m

Guys, 
I received this today.  FYI and follow-up if you're interested.
Hope all is well.

Dear Mike,

Rene Ortiz, the recent Minister of Energy for Ecuador (1998-1999) and former
Secretary General of OPEC (1978-83) is Conference Chair for a major gas and
power conference in Quito, September 18-19.  The Conference is expected to
attract key energy leaders from latin America.  I understand that former
Sauid Minister Yamani and Fadil Al Chalabi will also attend.

Rene is an old, old friend.

If this is of interest to you, ENRON please let me know.  From your
description of ENRON ONLINE at the Price School of Business in April, I think
this is a natural.

My Institute for Energy Economics and Policy will also partner with Global
Change Associates and a number of major services providers to hold a major
conference on energy ecommerce in Beijing, May 24-5, 2001. Again if this is
of interest we would welcome ENRON's participation on the program, as a
sponsor and/or an exhibitor.

Please let me know the next time you visit OU.

Best regards,

Dennis O'Brien

Jeannie,
Hello, I'm back this morning from overseas.  I am assuming that you got what 
you needed but in case you are still waiting on a response, I like the 
article.  If you still have time or want any additional comments.  I would 
simply add a couple of products to the list of Enron Global Markets.  The 
group is also responsible for Global Risk Management (insurance products), 
LNG trading, agriculture trading, and Interest rate trading.  I just don't 
want to leave any groups out of the article if possible.  Thanks and good 
luck and i certainly understand if I'm too late.

By now all of you should have received an invitation to the JDF 2000 Walk to 
Cure Diabetes Kick-Off Luncheon on Wednesday, September 6th, 11:30 a.m. - 
1:00 p.m. at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  I would like to take this opportunity 
to personally invite and encourage each of you to attend and join me as we 
represent Enron at this important meeting.

Our plan is to reserve several tables at the luncheon just for Enron.  
Whether you have received an invitation or not, I would like for each of you 
to make plans to join us at the luncheon.  In order to reserve sufficient 
seats at the luncheon (and even if you have already made a reservation with 
the JDF office) please send a brief Lotus Notes message to Cathy Phillips or 
call her at X-36898 to let her know if we may plan on your attendance.

I look forward to seeing you at the luncheon and working with you on the fun 
and exciting JDF campaign that we have planned for this year.  Thank you.

If any interest - -
Dear Mr. Lay:

Because you were recognized Business Week in 1999  for "taking Enron into
the red-hot communications industry" by "developing an intelligent network
platform to facilitate online business and building a market for trading
bandwidth", we'd like to get your opinion on how we can contribute to your
initiative.

TBD Networks is a Secure VPN Management software company here in Silicon
Valley. We believe Enron could benefit from using our highly scalable
software to manage VPNs Enterprise-wide by:

1) Speeding up the setup and provisioning time for tens of thousands of
VPNs.
2) Uniquely Vendor-Independent: Supporting all types of VPNs (Remote
Access/Site-to-site/Extranet), based on equipment, products and technologies
from Cisco IOS, PIX, Altiga, Nortel and Check Point.
3) Reducing training and support needs by using our easy-to-use, web-based
GUI based on high-level policies, hiding low-level, vendor-specific
interfaces.
4) Providing significantly higher levels of security and control VPNs via
advanced features such as random policy auditing and proactive service
monitoring.

We would be very interested in meeting with someone at Enron to find out how
you would like to proceed. Who would you suggest we contact?

Sincerely,
Simon Stokes
Director of Sales

Thor,

Thanks for the email.  The timing of it is amazing.  We were talking about 
this yesterday late afternoon.  Jeff and I will be in London next week to 
meet everyone and to get a full briefing of activities and everyone's views 
of their markets.  Cathy Phillips, my assistant, booked us to go to Norway to 
meet you and hear about all the activities that are going on there.  I hope 
you are in and can give us a full download on your business and obviously 
weather.  We made arrangements to go on Thursday and stay Thursday night.  We 
made these plans in advance of knowing your availability.  Do you have dinner 
plans on Thursday evening?  We are scheduled to leave on Friday morning to 
return to Houston.

Please send me a return email to confirm availability and Cathy will add to 
our schedules.  I look forward to meeting you and learning about your 
successful business.  Jeff and I will be available for your entire staff, if 
you would like us to talk about what is going on back in Houston.

someone to represent you.  Those of you out of town need to call me if you 
have any input.    Thanks again for all your support.  Ted

Greg,

Thanks for the clarification.  I guess I was too serious and in a business 
mode.  By the way, I don't have any photos, all they would do is scare 
people, especially me.

Mike

GKarnes@aol.com on 08/16/2000 01:09:18 PM
God, or Mike I mean to say-

I think I may have confused you a little. I don't think we need a picture of
you presently (unless you have any nudes, especially a picture of you with a
morning missile). What I was trying to say was that I saw one or more
pictures of you in the brochure the actives prepared for last year's
President's Trophy competition. What I was hoping was that the actives could
have some more of those brochures printed up for distribution. You might
enjoy a copy. I'm not sure, but I assume they will do another one next year.
If so, they might appreciate a new photo if they include an alumni section.
It is basically their deal. The alumni did not help them on this project.

Greg

John, 

Thanks for your outlines.  Here are a couple of others that aren't kid 
related.  The Choice is just 1 small piece but I love it.  Actually,  The 
Choice moved me so much, I sold my piece of the business (Excel)  and 
returned to Enron -  the rest is history.

Enjoy,
Mike

PS - We are way to similar!

Everett,  congrats!

George, 

Thanks for the email.  Congrats on the getting non-binding bid, I think.  
When we get a chance, after Sempra closes, please set up a meeting with all 
of us and Frevert to discuss in detail.  Also include Jeff Donahue. You are 
aware of my concerns and issues and we need to discuss them in great detail 
before we move forward with Pacificorp.

Mike

   
	
	

Pacificorps' board has given the ok for their capital division to negotiate 
with us on an exclusive basis for the sale of the 4 - synfuel machines they 
currently own and operate in Alabama.  Pacificorp advertises that each 
machine is capable of producing synfuel at the annual rate of 1.5 - 2.0 mm 
tons,  for a total of 6 - 8 mm annual tons.  

We will meet with Pacificorp early next week in Portland to discuss a due 
diligence schedule and ground rules for the sale.  We will obviously require 
one or more qualified monetizers to work with us on this deal from day one.  
If we line up more then one monetizer it would be helpful if we appoint a 
single monetizer to be the lead, otherwise we may end up facing conflicting 
demands from each monetizer.

Our ideal structure would have the monetizers immediately owning 100% of the 
equity in the machines, while we provide the sites, coal supply, and synfuel 
sales.  We need to work with the monetizers to identify qualified operators, 
while not taking any operating risk ourselves.

Given the "lease"  issue surrounding the Sempra deal, we need to make sure we 
structure Pacificorp (and AIG) as a mtm deal.  

We currently have a site team that has identified appropriate sites, and is 
starting the preliminary engineering and permitting work on each site.  The 
sites include river terminals and mines in West Virginia and Kentucky.

We expect to finalize Sempra this week ( 2 - machines on an accrual basis).   
"Team Synfuel" will then focus their activities on AIG (3 - machines) and 
Pacificorp (4 - machines) in order to close at least one of the deals by the 
end of October.  Our goal remains to secure 4 - 6 machines by the end of the 
year.

Greg,

I didn't realize you were doing that, that's great.  I am sure they need your 
help, so few people are willing to give back to their old collegiate  
experiences.  My thanks as a Sig Ep.  

I just changed jobs within Enron  (again) and have had a wild and difficult 
morning and your email made me chuckle.  I have done a few things at OU, and 
may be coming up in Sept. for a speech, and I'm not sure what pictures you 
are talking about.  The business school took some pictures and so did the 
Energy Management Program (the old PLM school) but I have not seen them nor 
do i know what they did with any they took.  If you are talking about a 
formal picture, I could provide one with my corporate bio if you need it for 
some reason. 

Thanks for the chuckle,
mike

PS:  I have been called a lot of things including "that God damned 
McConnell"  but that is as close as it gets.

GKarnes@aol.com on 08/16/2000 09:10:27 AM
Spot-I don't know if you know it or not, but a year ago I started serving as
Treasurer of the Sig Ep alumni board. It has been an interesting experience.
Some months back, it came to my attention that you have on occasion dropped
by the house. I am not sure what you said or did, but some of those actives
now think you are God. In fact, they put together a brochure that helped them
win the President's Trophy, signifying the best fraternity at OU, and
pictures of your visit were prominent in the brochure. We were kind of hoping
that some more copies could be printed, but I am not sure where we stand.
Just the same, I thought you would get a kick out of knowing that some of
these guys are now getting down on their knees and saying their nightly
prayers to you. It has created a bit of a problem in the pledgeship program.
If you recall, many of the fraternity's principles were based on God, and
some of the pledges seem to think Carter Ashton Jenkins was referring to you.
I think with some hard work, this will not be an insurmountable problem,
however.

HFF,

Greg

Dons loss was a shock to all of us and his family is in our prayers.  He was

Mike, 
 I wanted to personally thank you for your support to the fund that was 
established for Don's family.  As of today, we raised $4,106.62.  We have now 
closed this account and are in the process of distributing this money to his 
family.  I have personally spoken to his family regarding this fund and they 
were very thankful and speechless at the generosity that the Enron employee's 
have shown by attending his funeral, creating a scrapbook in his memory, and 
contributing to this memorial fund.  
 I assured the family that Don would be sorely missed, and although I did not 
have the opportunity to personally know Don, he must have been a very special 
person to have touched so many lives, both in his personal life and at work.

Attached is the first draft of the first organization announcement.  Please 
add your changes, ideas and corrections and return to me.  Once you have 
provide comments, I'll send to sally and Brent to make sure all of the that 
part is accurate.  Also I have a call into Jere confirming the move on the 
Corp insurance piece.  I didn't but in anything about Cindy Skinner, go ahead 
and add that as well.

Please don't hesitate to make wording changes.  I don't have any pride of 
authorship here.

Thanks,

Paula,
Thanks for the email.  I do have a question.  I am talking with these folks 
because of your personal reference but how does this work with Project 
Summer.  Although we don't talk about this, I have heard (not first hand) 
that there will not be an opportunity for people transfer because of the 
deal.  I don't want to waste anyone's time if this is just an exercise  What 
is the scoop?

Mike - As a followup to my voicemail, I am forwarding the resume of Rafi 
Khan.  I have worked directly with Rafi previously and have a very high 
regard for him.  Currently is Enron's Middle East/LNG group, Rafi's 
experience spans tax structuring, financial analysis, risk management and 
deal structuring and origination.  He also has completed his law degree.  
Rafi is seeking a Houston-based opportunity and, with his global finance and 
commercial experience, would be a strong candidate for a position in your new 
business.  Please expect a call from Rafi.  Thanks, Paula

Lea,

I like this and it gives us something to start with.

Let's us this as a "living" document and expand it with the thought that we 
can present this to Ken as a presentation.

A few thoughts:
Add a section of what the collection will not be. e.g.:  not so contemporary 
that majority of people will have a very negative reaction.  Understanding 
that not everyone will ever agree on everything
Address a few ideas on key locations and options per key areas.  For 
example:  5 key large major areas could contain the following themes - 1 
large painting by commissioned contemporary recognized artists.  Present a 
few artists as options and ideas.  Key trading areas:  could be modern and 
high energy to reflect the culture or the opposite, more serene commentary as 
a balance.  pick artists as an idea.
Address key themes:  trading are will have xxxx, individual business unit 
common areas can be distinct to their culture with guidelines such as xxxx.  
Describe the area reserved for Enron  memorabilia?
General theme considerations and guidelines: Innovation, global, as you've 
already addressed
List out options with front entry area (Nevelson)
Address old building and what we are going to do with the collection:  for 
example art work will be more consistent within business units and will be 
re-aligned, common areas will link with new concepts and themes
A few thoughts on budget and generally how it will be spent as a guideline:  
e.g.:  20% will be spent on 5 key areas, 10% on trading floor areas.....
Timeline and the need to start now
Update:  RC set up and ready, funding by Andy Fastow

I hope this helps and gives you feedback as you wanted.  With Jeff and my new 
responsibilities, we have even less time to spend on this then before.  We 
should discuss and address now so that it is fair on you and we put that plan 
tougher as well.

Thanks,
Mike

PS:  I'm sorry but I forgot to address the sponsorship idea you had.  If you 
still feel strongly about it send me an email and I'll run it through the 
channels.

I agree, congrats.

Matt - awesome!!

Excellent job on hitting 100 EOL trades today.  This is especially 
significant given the fact that the OTC market only handled 10 trades today ( 
and we even participated in 4 of those).  Who woulda thunk!

Keep going,

George

Pup,

That sounds great to us.  I take it you are not bringing the kids.  Have you 
already made reservations and a tee time?  Who else is included in this?  
Also, am i interfering by inviting ourselves in your plans!

Mike

We definitely are planning to go to Texas - O.U.  We are considering staying
at the Four Seasons at Los Colinas.  Possibly a little golf and R & R mixed
in with the game.  It would be a bit out of the way.  We might go up as
early as Friday morning to play golf that afternoon.  Let me know what you
think.

Jonny,

Thank you so much for the email and kind words.  I was very moved by it and
you know I feel the same way.  I have become very reflective with the more
"success" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.  I am so thankful
and appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual,
it has grown more deeply.  I see so many people that have lost their
perspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the
blessings that our family has received.  Chris and I often discuss how we
can help others and what can we do to really make a difference.

The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.   Thanks, and give my
love to your family.

Mike

PS:  What about OU - Texas, do you have any ideas or plans already in the
works?

Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance
because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we
strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the
incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age.
You
and I are two of the luckiest people in the world and must always remember
to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive.

Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my
friend.

Jonny

Chris,

Thanks for the response and thanks for the consideration.  I accept and we're 
done.  I will have a check out to you today via overnight mail.

Price:  9,500 less $500 plus $150 = $9,150

Please ship to:

Mike McConnell
13451 Belhaven Drive
Houston, Texas 77069

I look forward to doing business with you in the future.  I'll let you know 
the next time I'm back in the market for a specific piece or artist.  Also 
please give my home a call (281-895-6855) when the piece gets in the mail so 
that I can make sure that my wife is around to accept delivery.

Sincerely,
Mike 

PS - Your price was right on the mark for an easy personal decision.  My wife 
actually preferred another piece that was slightly cheaper and this let me 
get my favorite piece!

Dear Mike,
Sorry the photos took so long to arrive in Texas.  We feel the piece is
fairly priced at $9,500. but will give you a $500. discount if this helps
your situation.  The crating will be $150. and the gallery will cover
insurance.
May Thanks,
C. Neptune

Dan,

I have read the Synfuel marketing plan, it is excellent work and I would like 
to see this duplicated (or amended) with AIG or other concepts like this as 
they develop.  

Thanks,
Mike

Dan,

Thanks for the email and quick response.  I am in the process of discussing 
this with various people.  A couple of observations that have become clear 
and  I want to pass them on to you.  Overall, the size of the transaction is 
not going to fly.  If we brought in other players and significantly reduced 
our exposure and the other players validated the technology and overall play, 
it would increase the odds that we are interested in this type of deal.  Rick 
Buy stated firmly that Jeff will not be interested in taking this type of 
deal to the board especially with what just happened with Ecogas and Kafus.

I called George last night and touched on these topics but they have been 
reconfirmed this morning.  I understand that the deal is very active and 
needs to move forward now, but I think we should inform Pacificorp that we 
will not take the entire deal.  Last night George stated that he may not want 
to tell them that and I agreed.  But upon reflection, I think that needs to 
be re-addressed.  The original deal size is DOA and if I really believe that, 
then not passing that information could hurt us in getting any size deal 
potentially closed with these guys.  Also having them assist in bringing 
others to the table might be beneficial.

I'll keep you informed as i move forward and learn more.

Mike

Mike and Jeff:

Attached is a copy of the Pacificorp presentation from last week.  To 
reiterate, the key commercial risk issues are:

1)  Tax--Jordan Mintz has a high degree of confidence regarding the 
qualifications of the Pacificorp machines.  Thorough due dilligence will be 
required to investigate the representations made in the private letter ruling 
applications.

2)  Syndication--Joe Deffner and Tim Proffitt are working to find 
monetizers.  Ideally, the monetizers would close when we do.  Realistically, 
we have to assume that we will bridge the deal and wear equity risk until we 
can shed our ownership.  Pacificorp has expressed an interest in staying in 
as 25% owner, which should reduce the bridge risk, since we can show the 
former owner staying in the game.

3)  Operations--The risk of operations will lie with the holders of the 
equity.  Post-syndication, the new owners can contract directly with an 
operator.  For tax purposes the owner needs to have some risk.  We will guide 
the monetizers to this risk.  If we have to indemnify them in this area, we 
will need to better understand the available insurance products.
4)  Marketing--This is the risk the coal desk is trying to acquire.  The desk 
believes that the coal/synfuel spread risk will decrease dramatically over 
the next 12-18 months.  We have put $6.00/ton into the model, and the desk 
will buy $3.00/ton today for seven years.  The current market is anywhere 
from $1.00-3.00/ton.  We have also developed a list of strong sites that are 
looking for machines, three of which we control, either through options or 
marketing agreements.

The economics of the deal are compelling.  We put out $100mm to Pacificorp as 
an equity bridge (maybe less if they stay in as 25% owner).  We collect 
$30-50mm in commodity spread origination, and another $30-50mm in equity 
origination.

Commercially, the deal makes sense, and I am confident that we can structure 
around the risks.  The decision we need from senior management is whether 
this is a game we want to play.  The machines fit into the letter of the 
law.  Big companies (AIG, Florida Progress, Detroit Edison, etc.) have joined 
in the reindeer games.  We can put on the position we want by bridging this 
deal.

On the flip side, people have heartburn over "spirit of the law" issues and 
those are questions that senior management has to decide.   We have a chance 
to move on these machines, but need to make up our mind by the end of this 
week whether to put resources on it.  We can back out later (our commitment 
so far is non-binding), but we can't get back in.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Regards,

Dan

Kevin,

A quick question before our meeting.  Didn't we have a little different form 
that you used at HPL?  I thought I remembered a little different version of 
the Contract Approval Sheet.  One that had more detail and description of the 
risks.

Thanks,
Mike

Rick Buy asked me to let you have a summary of the limits that would now 
apply to commodities in Enron Global Markets.

I have set them out below, together with the levels at which various people 
in the organisation need to get notified (the respective Operations groups 
will take care of that). 

After tomorrow's Board meeting at which various other commodity group limits 
may get revised, we will issue rather handy laminated versions of these, 
which will better withstand general wear and tear and tend not to get mislaid.

Let me know if you have questions.

PS:  What about OU - Texas, do you have any ideas or plans already in the 
works?  

Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance
because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we
strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the
incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age.  You
and I are two of the luckiest people in the world and must always remember
to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive.

Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my
friend.

Brandon,

Randy,

Thanks for the email.  Yes,  life is wild at Enronville.  It was a very 
difficult decision to leave this group but I am enjoying my first week.

I keep up via old channels with your company.  I am so glad that it all 
worked out and I know you will have continued success.

I'll give you a call when things settle down.  I hope all is well with you 
and your family.

mike

I was on vacation last week, and just read the announcment.  Congratulations, 
you are really getting up in the thin air now!  Things are going well here.  
Give me a call sometime when you have a break in your schedule (ha) and I 
will treat you to lunch.  Take care.

Just wanted to let you guys know, that while on a family vacation last week
in Red River, New Mexico, the youngest sister on John & David Denner was
killed while driving one of those 4-wheel motor bikes. I guess John had to
hold on to her lifeless body for about an hour until help could reach the
spot on the mountain where she had the accident. I spoke to John on Saturday,
and at that point he seemed to be handling it well. The funeral is tomorrow.

FYI and follow-up.

Mike,
 It was nice talking to you at the EGM info session on Monday, the 7th at the 
Hyatt.  As we discussed, I am interested in opportunities within your group, 
specifically the LNG arena.  I interviewed and discussed this issue with Greg 
Curran and Doug J Arnell on Tuesday the 8th.  I strongly believe in the 
mutual benefits derived both from my learning and ability to contribute to 
your efforts.  
 I am currently in my second rotation working for Dan Leff and Dick Leibert 
in EES.  I have been at Enron since 1996.  In my former role, I served as the 
controller for GPG Operations Support (CO 423).  There I managed 25 cost 
centers which perform O&M, Procurement, Document Mgmt, and Regulatory 
Services for GPG and other assets across the globe.  My role was the sole 
source for general administration, budgeting, planning, and financial 
reporting.  This included management of $19.5M on a gross basis and 
overseeing the day-to-day operation of the Mustang timesheet system.  I also 
represented my organization as a Subject Matter Expert (SME) for the July 
2000 implementation of SAP within GPG.  
 In my first rotation in Enron Energy Services I performed analysis, 
forecasting, and pricing of power and gas risk management instruments.  
Currently I am working on projects ranging from Customer Satisfaction, system 
development and implementation, budgeting/space management, California Crisis 
Taskforce to new business ventures and cost savings initiatives.  Although an 
American citizen by birth, I have also spent 14 years living in the 
Caribbean.  I am a team player and a very motivated, high energy individual.  
My experience, the responsibilities bestowed, along my willingness to give 
110% will provide a valuable asset to a group.  I would like to generate a 
dialogue with you regarding the issue.  If there are any questions or 
requests of me, please feel free to let me know.  Thank You
 Adrian Woolcock

I started last Monday and this is VERY cool. It is also going to be quite a 
challenge, as the deals are much more complex than what I had the chance to 
see in Europe. Seems that I am going to learn a lot!! so far, expectations 
are met.

 I am also writing you because I have been contacted by an associate who is 
very interested in joining the LNG group. He has been working for Enron since 
1996 and has been involved with gas transportation and EES. He heard about 
the Bahama project and thought that he could add tons of value there, as he 
was raised in Jamaica. He also wants to be involved with a group that allows 
him to have international exposure and, ultimately, the possibility of 
working abroad. I am attaching his resume, in case you are looking for people 
for your group.

Have a nice trip back home.
Fernando

Stuart,

Thanks for the email and raising this issue.  While reading it, I must admit 
I was very surprised.  I am not a big baseball fan and have been to only 2 
games this year and I hadn't noticed it.  I just called Cindy Olson and left 
her a voicemail with your concern.  I will not forward your email and I will 
respect your privacy request.  When I hear from her, I'll let you what she 
says.

Thanks,
Mike

Mr. McConnell,

I went to Enron Field this past Fri.  and saw something disturbing.  Just 
after the Astros pitcher stuck out a batter, a cartoon came on the screen.  
The cartoon showed 3 K's dropping on a batter, turning him into a small black 
puddle. The 1st thing that ran through my mind was the Klue Klux Klan, and 
some extremely unpleasant memories I've had with them. If I'm alone in my 
thinking there should be no problem, however if other people have similar 
thoughts, this could raise some bad publicity. 

I did not feel gong through the proper chain of authority would be correct in 
this situation. (The less people that know, the better)   I do not know who 
the proper contact is to voice this concern, but felt you would be in a 
better position than me to decide if this is an actual problem, and how to 
resolve it if it is a problem.

Stuart

Bob, 
I hope all is well.  I appreciate your thoughts of including me and sending 
me emails but I need you to take me off your distribution list.  This type of 
emails are not allowed at Enron and there are consequences with opening 
them.  

I hope you understand.

Mike

Jeff, do you know this publication?
mike
Mike,

We have an opportunity that may interest your management team.  We publish
LNG Express and the related website www.LNGExpress.com.  LNG is a unique
form of natural gas trade, representing some $20 billion per year and
growing at 7-8%/year.  The industry is a fairly insular community.  Our
publication, website, industry reports, databanks, annual conferences and
consulting services have grown to be possibly the most visible.

LNG has a growing spot and short-term contract market. There is currently no
exchange for global trades.  Nor is there an exchange for carrier vessel
capacity, excess plant capacity, e-procurement or remote gas leases.
LNGExpress.com could be platform for such an exchange with content and
readers already established.  We might also assist Enron sign up exclusive
agreements with LNG suppliers and/or buyers.

Please let me know your thoughts ASAP.  I suspect this window of opportunity
will close quickly.

Best regards,

Jay,  

I think that should be looked at and re-evaluated. The way I had it, AS, PB, 
DB and I (we had commercial and IT infrastructure covered in  1 call) all 
attended the video calls but I primarily drove the business activities and 
co-ordination.  I had envisioned Allan and your group taking over directly 
pre my change and pre other international ongoing activities.  I suggest that 
all of you re-look at it and do what you want but there are obvious big 
changes coming that will affect your decision and how we will approach the 
business opportunities.  I believe they are a great resource for future 
development and they really appreciated the communication effort and we 
really helped them.

Good luck,
Mike

changes.  I did not provide any commentary on the specifics for obvious
reasons.

Mike
D'Arcy Carroll@ENRON
07/24/2000 07:24 AM

I think there are 2 principal drivers:

(1)  the respective Business Unit heads inside of Networks (Houston or
elsewhere ) need to know who Steve and I are, that we're involved and that
we have a      mandate ( actually this probably warrants some clarification
vis-a-vis the Argentine office, as well; especially given the hiring of
Bastos - I for one would like      to get a clear and substantive
understanding in regard to his trading background, priority for physical
vs. financial products, and expectations ) and
(2)  we (Enron SA) need an invitation, but also need to probably be more
aggressive about participating in meetings, discussions - both strategic
and       functional for each of  the Business Units

Once we reach a consensus on an Enron SA Bus Plan with focus, targets will
establish some parameters to participate inside the group going forward.

Mike, your efforts to communicate both updating events vis-a-vis the weekly
call and overtures outside the group have been a great initiative and much
appreciated.  It's made an important, productive impression on Enron
employees "outside"of Networks.  Look forward to further discussions all
around.

Mike,

Per your request, attached is the draft Business Plan for South America.
Due to agenda constraints, Joe Kishkill has not yet had the opportunity to
review.

As part of structuring the regional effort, it would be important to
streamline and coordinate the due diligence and market study efforts. There
appears to be some confusion between Houston and S?o Paulo over who is
responsible for what. We may need to formally announce D'Arcy's and my
roles, including the need to channel information through us into and out of
the region.

Please let us know your thoughts.

Thanks, Steve

do some good work to help you in your quest for world domination.  Good luck 
with this.

I think there is some duplication from these guys internal to Argentina.  As 
you know we had a visit from Patrick Hansen, Bastos and Mike Guerriero 
recently where I think we agreed on the concept behind www.enron.ar - ie 
using our vertical concept.

I think Steve and the team who came here probably need to get on the same 
page as the presentation doesn't quite reflect where we (Dave Forster)  
thought they were going.  

We are not worried if they want to go that way - the budget plans are way out 
of line though (but they do need to tell us to stop the development we are 
doing for them).

Dave, if Mike agrees - the easiest thing to do would be for you to ring Steve.

Louise

in London at some point during the year.  I'll give you a call.

Jeff, FYI and consideration, here is another speaking oppt!  Jeff S. is the 
keynote and our group has participated with Bob, Suzanne's husband, before.  
This is the conference when we came out with EOL last year.
mike
Thanks, Mike. I know you keep a packed schedule.  We'll work to accommodate
it.
Bob

Bob,

Thanks for the email and invitation.  I am out of the office traveling
right now and must get back to you on my availability.

Mike

Mike,

I'm putting together the keynote session for Interactive Energy and
wondered
if you'd be available on Tuesday morning between 8-11, October 24, at the
Houston Adam's Mark.  It'll give you an excuse to sleep late in your own
bed!

I envision a panel of the heads of e-business and technology at several
major companies, including Don Paul from Chevron, John Leggate from BP
Amoco, Bob Peebler from Haliburton and one or two others, to discuss a
range
of key issues.  Little if any advance preparation would be needed on your
part.

We're trying to get either or both Keith Krach from Ariba and Mark Hoffman
from Commerce One to provide the opener.  If both accept, we will probably
have one deliver in the morning and the other at lunch.  Or maybe we'll
have
a mud wrestling contest.

Finally, we're much closer to Interactive Texas and wanted to see if there
is anything you'd like mentioned about Enron technology initiatives during
Jeff's introduction.  My wife Suzanne will be doing the intro.  She will
have a wealth of broader market statistics, but you may have some
milestones
you'd like mentioned about EOL's progress or something else suited to this
Texas business and government audience.

Look forward to your reply.

Thanks,

Bob

Bob, thanks for the feedback and I enjoyed catching up as well.  Chris and
I both enjoyed our discussion and introductions at the dinner too.

As far as the 9 initiatives, that number includes all of our activities not
just new ones.  We don't have 9 being cranked out in 90 days, at least not
yet!

When we get closer to your conference, I would be happy to give you a count
for your intro. with Jeff.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

Good to catch up with you and congratulations on a fine opener this
morning.
I think I heard you say that Enron currently has nine e-business ventures
underway and your development cycle from concept to implementation is just
90 days.

I would like to use these factoids in Jeff's introduction unless I heard
you
incorrectly.

Kind regards,

Bob Nimocks

P.S. We're beginning to assemble the program for Interactive Energy 2000,
Oct. 23-26, in Houston.  I will e-mail you an invitation to participate on

Fred, thanks for the info and I am going to give it to several people to look 
at.  I do need to move our meeting.  I'lll be in touch to reschedule.
Thanks,
mike

Wade,

Thanks for the email and invitation.  You never know when I may show up!  I 
look forward to learning more about this and how our groups work together.  
Is John's group doing a good job for you?

Mike

Mike,

Congratulations on your new position with Enron Global Markets. Obviously, 
this is very exciting for you and for us. You probably took this job to get 
away from India, but actually John Nowlan's group serves as the fuel manager 
for liquid fuels (naphtha and distillate) on the Dabhol project.  So the 
standing invitation we issued to you when you visited us last still stands. 
Come over when your schedule allows. Marc de la Roche in your group has been 
threatening to get me out on one of the tankers during unloading while 
bucking in the monsoon tidal flow. Maybe you can join me.

Wade

Mark,

Thanks for the email.  Yes it was a very difficult decision to leave our 
group.  I've really enjoyed working with you and your group;  I think we have 
a great group.   I know you that you are working on  this side of the 
business already and I will be giving you a call to get your input and 
direction.

Cheers,
Mike

   

Hi Mike,

Its sad to see you go, but looks like a fabulous opportunity - good luck.

Regards
MRP

P.S. Let me know how we can help you efforts in Europe (We're already doing 
many thing in this area)

Thanks.

 I'm looking forward to working closer with everone.  Lets get together for 
dinner.  I'll  ask Chris to call your better half.

provide needed commercial balance and if he does, I believe that is all the=

time he has to spend on that side of the business.

I hope you are having a successful trip.

Good Afternoon,

Attached please find the results for your operating company from the "Who 
Wants to Help Millions" contest for United Way.  The spreadsheet contains 
only those who answered them correctly and those who missed 1 to 5 out of a 
possible 15 questions.

We would like to have 5 employees from every business unit for a 
pre-qualifying round to be held before the all employee meeting on August 
9th.  On the spreadsheet that contains the names of those participates who 
answered the questions, please choose the 5 employees you would like to 
represent your business unit.  We feel that those individuals who either 
answered them all correct or only missed one should be automatically 
selected.  How you determine your remaining representatives will be at your 
discretion.  

We must receive your responses by Wednesday, August 2nd.

Should you have any questions please feel free to contact either Kathy 
Mayfield (3-3264), John Walt (3-5379) or myself (3-7554).

Thank you for your support for the 2000 United Way Campaign.

Thanks for the email.  Reorganize and grow this business?  Not me??!  Upon 
first look, this business appears to have huge opportunities and ones that 
can be executed upon, especially if they consider themselves a core 
business.  It will  be a big challenge but we will make it work in a big 
way.  A lot of people have tried to make this business work.

I'll follow-up on Treasury Connect, thanks for the heads up.

By the way, science is Gary's passion and he has an undergraduate and MS in 
chemistry.  He might be an interesting guy to get involved (at least at the 
edges) with this project.  I told him about it and he really would like to 
get invited to the next meeting.  What do you think?  It always helps to have 
an avid supporter in a new business.

Mike

Congrats!  Those guys better watch out, you might organize them.

FYI, we have an investment in a company called Treasury Connect that has an 
interest rate swap portal.  Gary is working with them to do a trade.  They 
are currently negotiating with the World Bank to provide a private label 
product to them.

TC's clients include Xerox, GE, Duke and us.  I know with the webification of 
everything that we will be looking at those markets, but I would like to make 
sure our guys evaluate their technology offering before you move to far into 
their market.  They are focused on the very low value, commoditized 
transactions, so I don't know if it is an area Enron will compete for.

Thanks,
Mark

David,

Thanks for the email.
On metals, I believe all of that will remain under John Sherriff and not our 
new group.  Paper will remain in NA as well.  Both will be re-examined at 
some point but not now.  I like Cindy as well, she sounds fine to me.  Who is 
better, Cindy or Hoyt?

Do you want me to co-ordinate with Cindy while you are on vacation?

Thanks,
Mike

David Oxley
07/29/2000 07:51 PM
Mike,

I asked team to get you some org charts, personnel numbers and PRC results on 
Friday. They may be a little sketchy but we can refine for you over next few 
days. I specifically want to go over employment agreement and comp 
information with you.

Couple of things of immediate note:

 - MG metals is an issue from an HR stand point. I believe (possibly wrongly) 
that much of the NA end of this will fall in your world. Immediate issue 
appears to be desire to let go some staff that MG hired immediately before 
deal went unconditional that now don't fit. Hickerson is aware of where we 
are and I'll keep you informed as things develop.

- I am planning to dedicate Cindy Skinner (Shankman asked me specifically for 
her and I think she is ready for this challenge) to the new business as your 
lead HR person but I also have Hoyt Thomas (you may remember him from 96/97 
era) in the team for the next 6 months (he is on a contract at present and we 
may make it permanent). I'd like to discuss this with you next week.

- I am planning vacation for about 10 days from Weds of next week, but will 
leave you contact numbers.

David

Chris,

I got the pictures yesterday.  They looked great and were very clear.  I am 
interested in buying a Bonnard and am ready to make a decision on the one you 
have as well.  I will send you a check via overnight mail if we can come to 
an agreement.  What is your best and final total  price for the work?  I will 
make a yes or no answer upon my receipt of your email. 

Thanks,
Mike 

 PS -  I am going to pass on the Braque and Picasso for now.

Dear Mike:
Please let me know that the photos arrived.
Thanks,
Chris

Toysmart Will Not Sell Customer Names... For Now
(Posted 28-Jul-00)

Following an uproar over Toysmart's intention to
break the privacy promise it made to its customers,
the defunct e-tailer has done an about-face,
deciding not to sell its database of customer
information, after all.

Massachusetts assistant attorney general Pamela Kogut
told the E-Commerce Times that a "key component" was
missing from the FTC conditions for sale of the
customer database.  "Consumers should be given notice
that their names and shopping preferences are going
to be sold, and the opportunity to provide opt-in
consent," the attorney said...

Mike,
The Enron's Global Asset Management Conference committee would like to invite 
you to speak on Enron's ebusiness strategy for this conference which is being 
held at the Woodlands Conference Center on October 8-11.  We would like to 
have you present on October 10, from 9:00-10:00 AM.  
The conference committee has chosen the One Enron theme since the attendees 
at the conference are coming from all the Enron business units both 
domestically and internationally. The estimated attendance at the conference 
will be 225 Enron and Joint Venture employees.  The invitations are being 
issued enterprise-wide to employees who are engaged in 
operations/maintenance/purchasing.  This conference is the expansion of the 
annual plant managers' conference that is held each year in Houston.  We are 
replacing it with what we will be a "Best in Class" conference addressing 
multiple topics that will provide direction that will result in lower costs, 
increased earnings and employee retention.  We will also be utilizing this 
conference as an additional mentoring activity for our Minority/Women 
Business Enterprise suppliers.
I hope that you will accept our invitation, because I know many of the 
participates are very interested in learning more about what Enron's 
ecommerce strategy.

An agenda has been attached for your review, however it is still in 
development.

If you have any questions, I can be reached at (713) 646-8235.

Allan,

Would you please contact this guy and see what he wants.  We need to 
follow-up because his dad is on the board with me for JDF and he was the 
number  2 guy at Compaq with Rod Canion.  He is a Ken Lay buddy as well.  
Please find out if there is any synergies here and if not please simply 
respond and say thanks no thanks.  We just don't want him to think that Enron 
blew him off.

Thanks and i hope it is not a waste of time.

Mike,

Hello there. If you could give me a name or two of the folks heading up the
Internet - eBusiness strategy I'll contact them. I appreciate your help and
have a great weekend..

Regards,
Scott,

 I was following up on a few old items, has anyone contacted you from
Enron?   If yes, please let me know, if not please resend email and i'll
follow-up to make sure you get a response.

Thanks,
Mike McConnell

Mike McConnell

Tabatha, please schedule this meeting for August 10th.  Greg, Gary and I
should be able to handle it.  Russell, David, Tom - let Tab know if you want
to attend.  Tab, also invite Kevin Lyng, or whoever he designates, so we
have someone who can carry the ball on contacting zees who aren't taxing
correctly.

Also, does anyone have the document showing the taxes and results by store?
I only have the "here's what we did, here's what we found" letter.

To fix all this, we need to know the correct tax rate per store, the method
they should be using, and whether parts and/or labor need to be reported on
the invoice.  Then, our little group can make some consistency decisions
about how taxes will be computed and reported at the company stores (there
are some options we need to nail down), then IT will implement.

Billy,

I like it.  My only suggestion is to put in a statement like - that after all 
your discussions with business unit head and AAs  we are (changing) improving 
the program on the suggestions that you all wanted to see.  I think this 
could help everyone believe they were a part of the changes personally.

Just an idea, I like it very much as it is.

Good luck,

Mark,

Thanks for the updates.  I have big news;  I'm changing jobs.  This is not 
announced yet but I am moving to the wholesale group with Frevert to become 
CEO for a new business unit called Enron Global Markets.  It will contain the 
global commodities including Crude and products, coal, LNG, weather, 
insurance, FX/interest rates/equities, etc.  

 I think MEC is very cool and i am glad we are pursing it.  Please keep 
Philippe, Jay and now Jeff McMahon in the loop.

Good luck with this and I look forward to hearing more about it's success.  
Please keep this news to yourself until next week.

Thanks,
Mike

Steve,

I spoke with David ealier today.  He is planning a meeting with Jim Tour to 
due diligence the technology.  

I would like to put together a team to drive MEC's strategy, including a 
consolidation in Houston.  We would trade this commitment for warrants in the 
company and a right to participate in future fundings.  Effectively, our team 
could help drive the strategy for the company and due diligence a possible 
investment at the same time.

Thanks,
mark

Steven J Kean@EES

I think it would be useful to verify their view that they are really only 2-3 
years from commercial production.  Ideally, we could get that confirmation 
from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest 
in its success.  Their technology pitch sounded good, but I don't know enough 
to recognize the potential shortcomings.  I want to feel comfortable that you 
all feel this is real, then I would be happy to have me and my team spend 
some time with them.

Thank you for participating in yesterday's meeting.  We spoke with Harvey and 
Jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart.  
There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early 
development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one 
thing we also want, people.  I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on 
the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as 
part of a potential investment and strategic relationship.  Given our 
resource constraints, this would most likely be part of the organization that 
sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development.

I was talking to a member of the NYMEX Board and he thinks he can get JDF a 
$5,000 to $10,000 donation from the NYMEX. I will coordinate with Cathy and 
we will submit a request to the NYMEX and he will push the process. His name 
is Rich Schaeffer and he is the NYMEX Treasurer and works at ABN AMRO in NY.

Steve Horn is pushing for us to speak at this conference in Aspen.  I told

also the speakers are first rate.  What do you think?  If you are interested 
please let Steve know.  I told him that I thought everyone was busy.

per your request, attached is a list of speakers at the Industry Standard 
conference.  It looks like a very strong list. They would like to get an 
answer by Thursday.
My suggestion would be for me to go ahead and RSVP that I will do the speech. 
If McMahon is available and wants to do it then we will have the slot held.

Hello Stephen,

As you requested, here's a list of confirmed speakers. Enron will get a
prime slot on Thursday September 7, though we can move it to either Friday
or Saturday if that fits your schedule better. And you'll have a keynote
session, whereas many of the CEOs below will be on panels. Hope to hear a
confirmation from you very soon.

Best,

Per,

Attached is the first draft of an EGM update and org memo.  Please take a few 
minutes and review, add what is necessary for your section and return ASAP.   
Other comments are welcome as well.    I would like to get this at on Friday 
evening or early next week.   Please do so on a hard copy and have brought 
up.  I will incorporate your changes. Some of the changes in the memo are 
still under consideration and need to be considered extremely confidential.  
This needs a lot of work and filler.  Also add a one line update or positive 
statement about your business as an intro line of the section.   

Thanks,

Nice presentation, I'll give other comments later.

I did send on your email to 3 people at EBS:   Ken Rice, CEO; David Cox, MD; 
and Kevin Garland, VP of investments.  They are all out of the office thru 
next week.   If you don't hear back from someone in a couple of weeks, please 
let me know.

Thanks and good luck.  Say hello to my good friend Robin.

Mike McConnell

David,

Attached for your information is an email from the CEO of Six Foot Studios.  
This guy is the brother-in- law of Robin Gibbs, one of the top litigators in 
the country.  Robin and his firm is used a great deal in our key cases for 
Enron.  This looks like a cool company but I have no idea if you have any 
interest in his company or it's products.  I do, however, need someone to 
follow-up with him, even if it is a polite discussion that we don't have any 
interest.  We need to respond in some manner.  I forwarded this a while ago 
but he didn't hear anything.

He is successfully getting in to companies in Houston and Compaq is a big 
supporter.  I hope there is an opportunity here.

Thanks,
Mike

Greg and Jeff,

Attached is the draft announcement for the organization changes.  I am sure 
you will want to change the ENW piece, so far the focus was on the wording 
from the wholesale side but the titles should be correct for ENW.

Please provide your comments and I'll make sure they get included correctly.

Thanks,
Mike

Mark and David,

David I got your latest comments this morning.  I like them and added the 
correct Enron Net Works changes.  

I will send this to Greg and Jeff immediately to work on the ENW piece, I am 
sure they will add to it and change it.

Thanks,
Mike

PS;  Mark, I haven't seen your draft, what do you think about this one?

David, 

Thanks for the comments and updates.  I didn't know exactly how it was 
structured.   I am waiting on the revised draft from Frevert.  After I get 
that one I will circulate it to Greg for his additions for the Net Works 
pieces.  

I don't believe that we are going to add Shankman to the executive committee 
right now.  I am assuming the same is for Lavo.  There may be an appropriate 
time in the near future to make changes to the committee and they may be 
considered then. I don't think they want to add any additional people at this 
time.  Mark may have a different opinion and if he does, I am sure he will  
add it.

I do think we should add that Mark is Chairman of all the organizations.

Thanks,
Mike

David Oxley
07/27/2000 03:37 PM
Mike,

I'll review first para. and get a revised version back to you. Believe Mark 
was discussing/;looking at eblow but FYI my comments on the rest are:

- Wasn't clear on emmisisons, but believe that is McGowan who reports to 
McClellan
- Tawney reports to Overdyke
- Thought Overdyke was Insurance and Weather
-  Won't Shankman also get elected to to the Exec Committee?
-  Above being case I would suggest we announce same for Lavo.
- Should we add that Frevert remains Chairman of Europe and ENA.

David

Steve,

Sorry I missed you yesterday.  There is a lot going on here and in S America 
and we can probably discuss it next week.  I agree with your assessment of 
and the need to clarify roles and implement the business plan.   We will 
address all but there are some things going on that make it appropriate to 
wait a little.  If you have any questions you can address them with Joe but I 
would wait and keep moving forward on your daily business and projects.

I like the plan and we will discuss my comments next week.  

Thanks,
mike

I am in most of next week.

Mark,

Here is the org memo draft we discussed.  I sent it to you yesterday but 
found a rejection notice on your address this morning.  Here it is again.
I'm in all day and tomorrow if you want to discuss.

Mike
	
	

Mark and David,

Below is my first stab at the organization memo.  I didn't over focus on 
specific wording and I am not sure how you want to address the various groups 
that will be affected.  I believe we need to address all of them by name and 
they should probably be in alpha order as to not upset anyone on the order.

I also didn't know any other information that you may want to include with 
regard to the successes from the group year to date.  
Greg, Jeff and I are getting together for lunch tomorrow to discuss the New 
Works organization.  

I think that this should come from Enron's office of the Chairman vs. the 
business units because it does affect 2 different lines of business and it 
will have more impact and clarity for the other groups especially, my 
departure from Net Works.

After you guys pretty this up (and destroy it) please send it back via email 
and i'll make sure and coordinate with Whalley.

Thanks,
Mike

I see we passed $100,000,000,000!   That's a lot of zeros.

Congratulations, who would have predicted this when you got called back from 
your plane trip to work on this new trading idea.  You should be very proud.  
We all are.

you represent Enron.
Mike

Joe, 

Attached below is a draft of an EGM update and org announcement.  It will be 
broad in scope and will address many areas.  Please review and provide 
comments especially on the Japan part.  I went ahead and took a stab at the 
first cut here and expect you to make all the changes and emphasis you feel 
is appropriate.  We are a couple of weeks away from discussing every player 
(Morten Erik) that is why I left it very broad.  Please take a moment, change 
and send back to me for examination and incorporation.

I wanted to get this out on Friday, but may have to wait until early next 
week while i am on the road.

This came through to me through some contacts in the DR. I am not sure if you 
would be interested in seeing if the model applies in any other countries in 
your region. Additionally, who is the person who would be a counterpart for 
the Southern Cone. Let me know if it tickles you as I need to get back to 
them over the next week.

Thanks,
Karen

Mr.McConnell,

I wanted to touch basis with you regarding your laptop tune-up last week and 
any issues that you may have had over the weekend. If there were any dialup 
issues or if you have any questions regarding our dialup process (VPN) please 
let me know. 

FYI,
Per our discussion last Wednesday your Compaq M300 (standard Enron issue) has 
been ordered and I will let you know when it is ready for use. 

Thanks,
Joe

Joe,

Thanks for the email.  Project Summer does bring up some big questions and 
issues and I am not up to speed on the current thinking.  We'll talk later 
and i'll find out the issues and viewpoints.  On your other issue, I 
understand and we'll discuss.

Thanks,
mike

Joe Kishkill@ENRON

Mike,

You have probably heard that a tentative agreement has been reached on 
Project Summer.

When convenient, I would like to talk to you about what that means for the 
South Amercia Networks effort.  Given that we have been pursuing this stuff 
through a matrix approach many questions arise.

I am not sure of the Project Summer view or the Enron view.  I have the 
feeling it is not a "big blip" on anyone's radar screen. 

I did not bring this up during the weekly call because D'Arcy and Steve do 
not know anything (at least officially and/or from me).

Also, for what it is worth, I am assessing personal options at this point.  I 
am not necessarily wed to the "Newco" (unless Enron puts out a former EI 
hiring moratorium) despite what people may be assuming.

Thanks,

Kish

Hi Cate -

Mike McConnell has asked me to respond to you on his behalf.  He said that he 
is fine with the bullet points you have listed below, with the exception of 
"Acquisitions".  Mike will not focus on acquisitions in his speech.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you need any additional 
information.  Thank you.

Mike,
I am delighted to know that you are available to take part in the Atlanta 
E-Business Summit in October. I have tentatively scheduled you for 
mid-morning on October 3rd - let me know if that does not work for you.

With regard to the focus of your presentation, I have written a suggested 
session description below for your review. It reflects a strategic view of 
Enron's move into online B2B markets, which will be very relevant for our 
audience of C-level executives from the Fortune 1000.

The audience at the 21st Century Internet Summit will be primarily CIOs and 
senior executives from Internet companies, so perhaps you could deliver the 
same presentation with a slightly more technological content and perspective.

The programme for the E-Business Summit goes to print next week, so please 
forward me any modifications of the text below by July 19.

Leveraging core brick-and-mortar assets to create new businesses

o     Shifting strategies: turning an energy company into a new economy player
o     Acquisitions: targeting companies on which to build B2B platforms
o     Applying Enron's model to other wholesale commodity markets
o     Added-value as the competitive edge: risk management, financial 
services, liquidity
o     EnronOnline: evolving the customer relationship while increasing sales

Thank you for your interest in this project and I look forward to seeing you 
in Atlanta.
Best,
Cate Ambrose

Cate,

 I could make the Atlanta conference on Oct. 2 - 3.  The presentation would
be similar to the one I am going to do in Sept. would that be a problem?
Actually, I thought the Sept. conference was aimed at this type of crowd as
well.

Mike McConnell

Dear Mike:

On behalf of The Economist Group, I have the pleasure of inviting you to
participate as a key presenter at our second US E-Business Summit in
October 2000.

The Economist's US e-business series was founded in March 2000 with Summits
in New York and Laguna Niguel California, and with the subtext "Strategic
business transformation for chief executives in the digital economy".

I am aware that you attended the event in Laguna Niguel, where John
Chambers, Dan Nordstrom, and Kevin O'Connor were among the speaker faculty.

The fall E-Business Summits are scheduled for October 2nd-3rd at the JW
Marriott in Atlanta, and October 18th-19th at the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago.
I have attached preliminary drafts of the programme for both cities, which
reflect a session dedicated to Enron Net Works.

We are particularly interested in including a presentation on how Enron has
leveraged core competencies to take on a new role in the Internet economy,
including the Net Works initiative to create B2B websites for other
businesses and industries. We would be delighted to have you speak on this
subject at either the Atlanta or Chicago Summit.

I understand that you have already agreed to participate as a speaker in
the 21st Century Internet Summit that will take place September 20-22 in
Laguna Niguel CA. That event, which has been organised by my colleague Lisa
Weiner, is targeted to an audience of CIOs in its focus on technology,
whereas the E-Business Summit targets CEOs in its emphasis on strategic
business transformation.

Thank you for your consideration of this invitation and I look forward to
following up with you following the holiday weekend.

Best regards,
Cate Ambrose
Director of Programmes

Pop,

I got this today but there wasn't any message, was this a test?  You are so 
high tech now!

Mike

?

CP, check out my emails!  As you can tell my trip wasn't all fun.  I was 
obviously able to make the system work from the hotel - finally.  I left a 
few emails from various speaking forums.  Would you please follow-up on them 
and delete items that we dont need anymore.

Thanks,
Mike

Bob, 

Thanks for the email and invitation.  I am out of the office traveling right 
now and must get back to you on my availability.

Mike

Mike,

I'm putting together the keynote session for Interactive Energy and wondered
if you'd be available on Tuesday morning between 8-11, October 24, at the
Houston Adam's Mark.  It'll give you an excuse to sleep late in your own
bed!

I envision a panel of the heads of e-business and technology at several
major companies, including Don Paul from Chevron, John Leggate from BP
Amoco, Bob Peebler from Haliburton and one or two others, to discuss a range
of key issues.  Little if any advance preparation would be needed on your
part.

We're trying to get either or both Keith Krach from Ariba and Mark Hoffman
from Commerce One to provide the opener.  If both accept, we will probably
have one deliver in the morning and the other at lunch.  Or maybe we'll have
a mud wrestling contest.

Finally, we're much closer to Interactive Texas and wanted to see if there
is anything you'd like mentioned about Enron technology initiatives during
Jeff's introduction.  My wife Suzanne will be doing the intro.  She will
have a wealth of broader market statistics, but you may have some milestones
you'd like mentioned about EOL's progress or something else suited to this
Texas business and government audience.

Look forward to your reply.

Thanks,

Bob

Bob, thanks for the feedback and I enjoyed catching up as well.  Chris and
I both enjoyed our discussion and introductions at the dinner too.

As far as the 9 initiatives, that number includes all of our activities not
just new ones.  We don't have 9 being cranked out in 90 days, at least not
yet!

When we get closer to your conference, I would be happy to give you a count
for your intro. with Jeff.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,

Good to catch up with you and congratulations on a fine opener this
morning.
I think I heard you say that Enron currently has nine e-business ventures
underway and your development cycle from concept to implementation is just
90 days.

I would like to use these factoids in Jeff's introduction unless I heard
you
incorrectly.

Kind regards,

Bob Nimocks

P.S. We're beginning to assemble the program for Interactive Energy 2000,
Oct. 23-26, in Houston.  I will e-mail you an invitation to participate on
the senior management panel Tuesday morning Oct 24th.

Matt,
I did receive it and sent it on.  If you don't hear anything please let me 
know.

Mike

Chris,

Thanks for the email.   I certainly understand your situation and 
perspective.  Give me a call when you return and we can discuss it.  We do 
have a lot going on in Net Works and we may have some additional clarity on 
our direction and priorities when you return from your trip.

Thanks for your tips on SF and for offering your home in the wine country.  
Maybe we can take you up on it another time.

Mike 

Thanks, done.
m

Steve,

Sorry for the slow response but I got the latest word on voicemail while out 
here in SF.  They completely screwed up my order, not Ron the guy from 
Mercedes USA, but the dealer.  Ron has stepped in and followed up himself and 
I'll be receiving a 2001 in late August/early Sept..  He is a good guy and is 
trying to make up for the major dropping of the ball.  My sales guy that blew 
it is no longer in that job.  Hopefully it will be coming soon.  I'll believe 
it when i see it but I am very excited and it was a real let down in June 
when it didn't' arrive.

Thanks for asking.

We'll talk soon.

mike

Mike,

What ever happened with your car?

Steve

Andrew, 

How's the working coming?  What is your view of where we are.

Thanks,
Mike

Scott,

 I was following up on a few old items, has anyone contacted you from 
Enron?   If yes, please let me know, if not please resend email and i'll 
follow-up to make sure you get a response.

Thanks,
Mike McConnell

Fred,

I haven't heard anything from you since this email.  Have you made any 
progress on your update?  I still believe this has a lot of merit and would 
like to hear your perspective.

Mike

   

Mike,

You and had a brief meeting in your office last week, where I introduced 
myself as an old school mate of Pat Wade's.  During our conversation, I had 
mentioned a business plan that I had written last year proposing a b2b 
platform for trading air freight capacity which received strong interest from 
ICG.  You then asked for a copy of it, thinking that Enron could use some 
background on the opportunity in air logistics.   

If you don't mind, rather than send you a year old plan for a business that 
didn't get off the ground, I suggest that I work (on my own time) on a 
document that will speak better to Enron's needs, presenting the air 
logistics industry background and mapping it to potential opportunities that 
utilize Enron's core strengths.  I hope to have this doc done and delivered 
to you by the end of next week. 

Fred Philipson

Julie,  thanks, mike

Greg, 

Yes, I am their guy.  I have extensive info and feedback forms on them.  We 
definitely need to talk.  Please set up a 30 minute meeting with Cathy 36898 
and we can go through it and i;ll give you a copy of all info.

Thanks,
mike

PS congrats on ClickPaper.  The site looks great, you and your group 
accomplished a lot in a short period of time.  I know that the big test day 
was yesterday and hope all went well.  
  

   

Are you the PRC rep for these guys?  If so, can I get some feedback on them 
so I can speak for them at the Global VP PRC on July 31st?

Thanks.

Mike,

Previously, Fastow's group was scheduled to vacate floor 27 on the 24th of 
August.  There were a few unexpected construction problems and now the vacate 
date is September 8.

Of course we are not moving to floor 27 "as is".   I expect the rest of the 
month of September to be used for constructing floor 27 to our 
specifications.  We can probably start moving down the first weekend in 
October.  I'm requesting a very aggressive , around-the-clock, construction 
crew. 

I'll advise as necessary.

Many Thanks,

Liz

All,

Attached is the first draft of an EGM update and org memo.  Please take a few 
minutes and review, add what is necessary for your section and return ASAP.   
Other comments are welcome as well.    I would like to get this at on Friday 
evening or early next week.   Please do so on a hard copy and have brought 
up.  I will incorporate your changes. Some of the changes in the memo are 
still under consideration and need to be considered extremely confidential.  
This needs a lot of work and filler.  Also add a one line update or positive 
statement about your business as an intro line of the section.   

Thanks,
mike

Mary, I would say a couple of things.  I describe Enron's unique culture 
using adjectives like , empowerment, innovation, innovation on steroids, high 
energy, exciting, challenging, cool, a great place to work.  Each one of 
these can be made into a sentence and/or a statement.  

I hope this is what you were looking for.

Jeannie,

Thanks for asking about my dad, he is doing very well after surgery which we 
believe was successful.

My kids loved it.  The really enjoyed learning about Dad's work and what I 
do.  I think that this is a very important event because we all spend so much 
time here at Enron.  I have two children Claire - 9  and Michael - 6. They 
both look forward to the event and talk about it for weeks prior to the 
actual day.  Actually my daughter talks about it all year long.  Also they 
really can identify with Enron and talk more about it because of events like 
these.

Mike -- I hope you don't mind this, but I remember seeing you and your 
children at Take Your Child to Work day. I'm writing up a small story for 
Enron Business, and I wonder if you have a comment to make on this day.

Did you and your children enjoy the day? What were their favorite activities?
With all the things you have on your plate, why did you take the time to 
bring them in and accompany them during the day?
What are your children's names and their ages?
Any general comment you wish to make.

If you have time for this, I'd love to see what you have to say.

I hope things are going well for your father.

Regards,
Jeannie

Jay,

 Howdy from Houston.  I bet it is cooler in NY.

I don't really have any other ideas as you addressed below except I changed 
the word "his" to "the" investment group.  As far as other clarification of 
duties, I don't have any issue with it, but every CEO will call me and ask if 
this is a change in how they deal with Alan or investments.  What is the 
status with Steve and how the group is organized?  Did you talk with him and 
let him know that he is a stand alone dealmaker with an area of concentration?

Is that your official assigned work number?  If not, we need to get one 
assigned before the email goes out.  Also, I am assuming that this is in the 
MG office not the small Enron office, is that accurate?  Greg and I both 
think that the MG office is the best location and will help them assimilate 
with Enron.

Thanks,
Mike 

PS, good luck in the move

1)  I'm not sure it is appropriate to get into organizational details of how 
diiferent units will work together in an organizational memo.  We are working 
well communicating with and sharing deals between and amongst the various 
groups/business units on an informal basis.  Formalization of this process 
here adds litlle, and may detract.

2)  How else do I refer to it other than Steve and his group in the context 
in which this is written.  Suggestions appreciated!

Jay

P.S.  I know I owe you an accomplishments list, but as of now, I don't really 
know of too many for 1H2000.  I do not like to be too creative with these 
types of lists, and am not typically at a loss, but right now, I am a bit 
light.  We should discuss this in person, and sooner rather than later.  
Tomorrow is my last day in Houston.  Give me a ring at your convenience.

   

Jay,

I like it.

  Two questions. 
1. You didn't address how our investment group will work with other groups, 
specifically, EEL, ENA will (may) be different than how it works (and 
approves) investments with the investments from the other business groups.
2.  You still called it Steve's group.  Do you want to address the issue more 
directly or leave it more ambiguous?

What are your thoughts?

Please respond ASAP with what you feel comfortable with.

Thanks,

John,

We have discussed i2 in the past  but we need to take some action steps to 
make decisions and move forward.  Here is what I want to see done in short 
order.

Meeting with all key technologist on the full suite of products and 
functionality with complete demonstration by i2.  I would especially want PB, 
JP, BP, HE, and JG from George's group.
Follow-up meeting (after the technologists see functionality and form 
opinions and possible applications) with key commercial leaders:  GP -  P&P; 
TG - CommodityLogic; BG - Metals and steel;  JF - New Markets and 
Investments; AS - New Markets and Bus Dev.  During that meeting, we need to 
have some real players with i2 there to brainstorm and discuss business 
expansion opportunities in the specific verticals.  It would be good to 
actually have this meeting in Dallas but I am concerned about attendance.  i2 
owns the process and supply/downstream management in these industries and we 
need to really look to see if our combination can accelerate our new efforts 
and solve any logistic issues.
Put together an action plan.  George's group has already put a presentation 
together about i2, the products and possible applications.  George, please 
sent that to John.  I would like that document to be our updated business 
plan for i2 to be used as a "living" document as we move forward.
Assign someone to make and co-ordinate the use and full deployment of those 
products (utilize our $10 million spend).  I want someone to have the 
responsibility for i2 and he or she can also work with EBS on what they are 
doing also.  To be clear, we have spent the $10 million already but are not 
using the products.  I want to deploy all (if possible) and make this 
investment fully utilized.  I do understand that we don't drive businesses 
around a pre-purchased product but we should look at is as a sunk cost and 
rationalize why we shouldn't use if rather that simply considering it as an 
option.
Jason Robert, (469) 357-6737, was at the dinner with Sanjiv, Greg Brady, Jeff 
and Greg and he knows some of the mutual objectives.  He would be the guy to 
work with and set it all up.
EBS should be involved as well.  Rex Shelby is spending a lot of time with 
i2, weekly visits, and should also participate and use their products as well.
Is there an application for all of EES and their business?
Remember, Ken Lay is considering joining their board and we should be able to 
give him very clear insight on their products and how their company works.
PB, if you want someone outside Pavetto's group  to work on this that is fine 
but i want to understand the background and how they will make this happen. 

Thanks and please let me know your initial thoughts and timing.  If you need 
to have me send out an email to make sure that everyone understands the 
priority, please draft up and I'll send out.

Mike

Jeff, 

FYI, I just got this from Tom.  We don't have a very big opportunity here!  
Tom did tell me that his numbers were going to be difficult to get.  Not that 
i don't want to put $5 trillion on our chart, but what do you think we should 
put as market size?  Nat gas, power and our existing verticals only?  What do 
you think?

He is the only one to give me a number yet.  I am going to discuss it at the 
staff meeting.

Steve, 

Thanks for the voicemail.  I was surprised that you were not up to speed 
(although I probably shouldn't be).  Please talk with Joe and get is view on 
this.  I left michael an email on my view, which is that it looks very early 
and I don't think it is worth our time or money at this point.  Certainly he 
wants to maintain a good relationship and watch them and maybe you can help 
with that. 

Let me know if you get any other news.

Thanks,
Mike

Richard, 
Life does move on!   What is Malcomb thinking!  Can you imagine intentionally 
working for and believing in Jonathan Legg?

Hope all is well.

Mike

Thank you for the email.  I have forwarded it on for people's consideration.

Mike McConnell

Philippe -

El Paso Energy is acquiring Coastal Corporation, where I am currently
employed.  El Paso will probably retain my employment in my current role as
Project Leader of Corporate/Refining & Marketing Systems Support, but I
would prefer working for Enron.  The proposed acquisition of Coastal by El
Paso will not be effective until October.

I just talked to Steve Schneider at Enron, and he highly recommended that I
forward my resume to you with a copy to Mike McConnell.  Steve also said
that he would be available to provide a personal reference on my behalf.

Attached you will find my current resume.  I would prefer opportunities in
the following areas (in this order if possible): project management,
database development, and mainframe system support.  My ideal job
assignments would include all three, but I am open to whatever might be
available.  Opportunities to learn new technology would be great!

Please do not hesitate in contacting me at my business telephone number
(713-877-3081).

Thank you for your time and consideration!

Gary,

Below is some information that might be of assistance to you.  I don't think 
that I sent this to you when I got it.  If I did please ignore this.  D'Arcy 
Carroll (works for us in S. America) came to us from Cargill and knows a lot 
of people there.  He has a couple of names that I have passed on internally 
for consideration but I am sure they didn't go to the right place.  On a 
recent trip to Sao Paulo, many of the ag products came up in meetings as good 
opportunities for Enron to go in and change that industry.  Coffee, Orange 
Juice, grains and sugar were brought up a lot.

D'Arcy may have traded an ag book for Cargill, I can't remember.

Anyway, I am passing this message and names on to you for consideration.  A 
phone call to D'Arcy might also be worth a few minutes of your time.  He 
knows a lot about Cargill and has an opinion on how to capture their markets.

Mike

Mike,  please find attatched 2 resumes, as mentioned. 

1. Rob Tesar.  Position: Enron Networks, Agricultural Markets.  Rob Tesar is 
American and has worked for 15 years at Cargill, the first 10 or so inside 
the  grains businesses where he managed the central hedging desk out of 
headquarters.   He is a class act; if he has any weakness it would be a 
tendency to  be too cautious.   He is significantly underutilized in his 
present position.

2. Detlev Hartman.  Position: open.  Detlev is German and was my boss at DG 
BANK in Frankfurt, in the early stages of the development of the finanical  
derivatives markets in Germany in the late 80's.  His professional background 
is diverse with a pretty consistent emphasis on finance.   Detlev is one of 
the  brightest, intuitive minds I've ever worked with; he could contribute in 
the MG initiative or in any number of trading, risk management oversight 
positions.   Somewhat volatile personality, but exciting to work with.

Daudi Lelijveld.  Position: Enron Networks, MG or logistics.  Daudi is a 
dutchman with a broad background; he has run Cargill's UK metals business for 
the last 5 years, or so.  He is putting his resume together and I'll forward. 

Paul Lichter and Mike Walden.  Position: IT - I have forwarded information to 
Jahn Pavetto.  

Steve,

FYI, here was my response to Michael.  I was surprised that you didn't know 
about this but i probably shouldn't have been.  Let me know if you have a 
different opinion. 

Mike
	
	

Mike,

I agree with your assessment on keeping tabs on them but currently I don't 
see any real opportunity or decision to spend time or money with this 
effort.  I have received feedback from others in the group as well and they 
agree with our general thinking.  Have you talked with Louise lately?  We are 
announcing today that we will be pushing our pricing to other platforms in 
the US (therefore we keep all the liquidity of their markets).  Maybe this 
will apply to these guys, someday.  Certainly it is not appropriate now and 
with your domination concerns it might scare them even more.

My time is very limited next week and I am double booked most of the time.   
I'm out Wed - Sunday and then the analyst meetings begin after that.  I 
really don't have time to meet with them especially if there is not real deal 
pending.  Is there someone else that is more appropriate, maybe someone can 
take them through EOL?  If you like that, please call Louise and co-ordinate.

Thanks,
Mike

   

I tend to agree with your initial comments. At this point I do not see a 
clear opportunity from a value standpoint but I do need to assist these guys 
and keep tabs on their development.

To me it looks more like a Streamline or Quick Trade product that is at the 
drawing board stage.  They are going to Oklahoma on Friday. William's may be 
the best group for them to ultimately hook up with. 

It is possible that the only thing we can offer this group latter on is a 
link to EOL if we so choose that to be advantageous. This market is too small 
and there is growing concern that EOL is a looming beast that will dominate 
market share. For now I need to continue to foster these projects until one 
is successful or EOL is no longer a political concern.

 Could you be available for a presentation Monday or Tuesday. I will 
participate via conference call. 

Your assistance is greatly appreciated. 

MFG

   

Mike,
I just had my schedule changed dramatically for tomorrow and will not be able 
to talk.  How about Friday @ 10am?
Sorry, but we have a situation I must get involved with and change a 
direction.

I did review the email, and passed it on to others.  I do not see much from 
this site nor how it is actually going to develop real liquidity in the 
market.  If there are a couple of items that you want me to specifically be 
ready for , please send me a couple of comments via email or voicemail.

Thanks,
Mike

I am working on the presentation for the analyst meetings that are taking 
place July 24-26.  Enron Net Works is being featured and as part of the 
overall story Skilling wants to see some basic information on your businesses 
(and a few other possible verticals and market places).  Please provide me 
with these 3 specific items of information.

1.  Total market size for your business:  e.g.  Pulp and Paper is approx. 
$300 billion.
2.  Your target market share of that total
3.  Targeted (or other comparable) margin that you would (or could) expect to 
see

I realize this is subjective but I do need an answer to all 3 questions.  Put 
any explanation that you feel is important or needed.  Also please quote the 
source of the global market size.  When I get all the information, I'll go 
through it with everyone.

We  also need to get the global size of the markets that we are considering 
moving into and if you know any of these below, please let me know.

Data storage
Grains
Petrochemicals
Steel
Logistics

Thank you for your quick response.

Mike 

Cate,

 I could make the Atlanta conference on Oct. 2 - 3.  The presentation would 
be similar to the one I am going to do in Sept. would that be a problem?  
Actually, I thought the Sept. conference was aimed at this type of crowd as 
well.

Mike McConnell

Dear Mike:

On behalf of The Economist Group, I have the pleasure of inviting you to 
participate as a key presenter at our second US E-Business Summit in October 
2000.

The Economist's US e-business series was founded in March 2000 with Summits 
in New York and Laguna Niguel California, and with the subtext "Strategic 
business transformation for chief executives in the digital economy".

I am aware that you attended the event in Laguna Niguel, where John Chambers, 
Dan Nordstrom, and Kevin O'Connor were among the speaker faculty.

The fall E-Business Summits are scheduled for October 2nd-3rd at the JW 
Marriott in Atlanta, and October 18th-19th at the Ritz-Carlton in Chicago. I 
have attached preliminary drafts of the programme for both cities, which 
reflect a session dedicated to Enron Net Works.

We are particularly interested in including a presentation on how Enron has 
leveraged core competencies to take on a new role in the Internet economy, 
including the Net Works initiative to create B2B websites for other 
businesses and industries. We would be delighted to have you speak on this 
subject at either the Atlanta or Chicago Summit.

I understand that you have already agreed to participate as a speaker in the 
21st Century Internet Summit that will take place September 20-22 in Laguna 
Niguel CA. That event, which has been organised by my colleague Lisa Weiner, 
is targeted to an audience of CIOs in its focus on technology, whereas the 
E-Business Summit targets CEOs in its emphasis on strategic business 
transformation.

Thank you for your consideration of this invitation and I look forward to 
following up with you following the holiday weekend.

Best regards,
Cate Ambrose
Director of Programmes

My name is Eric Efron and I am an intern in the tax department for EES.  The 
reason I am emailing you is that I am related to Kathy Knott and she had told 
me that she knows you real well and she wanted me to meet you.  I know you 
have been busy and out of town recently, so I figured I would just email you 
to see when you were available so I could come say hello.  Let me know what 
is a good time when you have a chance.  My extension is 57058.

Mike,

Pete Weidler, a friend of mine, recommended that I contact you feeling that
I may be able to help your group. Like you my background is not in
e-commerce. I was most recently President of an oil company operating in
Colombia. I am a manager in the classic sense, experienced in planning,
project valuation, economic analysis, contract negotiations and
acquisitions and divestitures. I am fluent in Spanish having grown up and
worked in Latin America my whole life. I bring a keen awareness of the
Latin culture and, what's more, a strong desire to continue working there.
Do do this I'm considering a career change and can imagine no better
company than Enron to make that change smoothly.

Pete and I both feel that Enron should have a good situation for a person
with my qualifications; unfortunately Pete's group is actually downsizing
and in no position to hire.

I appreciate your time. Best Regards.

Here is the information we discussed regarding Nodocero. Let me know when is 
a good time to do a secondary discussion. They will be in Houston late next 
week and early the following week. I will give you a call Monday.

MFG 
Patrick Hansen

Michael, I have the following comments to the Nodocero.com project.

Currently works as a platform where buyers and sellers agree on a price 
through an auction process (brokerage fee)
They aim at becoming a regulated market with standardised contracts. (subject 
to market and regulatory evolution)
Their value drivers are the "Payment Guarantee" (through an insurance 
company) and "Backoffice" (registration before regulatory authorities). None 
of these issues are definitely solved (no agreement with Insurance Co. and if 
any transaction is done now, all the backoffice procedures have to be done 
manually with their employees).
No technological partner yet. They have developed the web site platform (you 
can see it at www.nodocero.com), but I understand that they don't have the 
rest of the technological components required (database, operations, clearing 
system, other). 

Apart from this, I would consider the following issues:

Currently there is no regulated market for this sector of the economy 
(Argentina and the rest of Latin America). Therefore their idea of becoming 
one is good.
The competitors in this race are: Nodocero.com - aXesoEnergia.com - 
EnergyVex.com - Rofex (Rosario Futures Exchange) - other.
No competitor has yet taken an important lead in this race. aXesoEnergia.com 
is doing an important investment in marketing, but it currently works via an 
auction process and does not provide any further service like guarantee or 
backoffice.
One of the competitors will eventually succeed in becoming the reference 
market.
Nodocero.com has no strategic partner yet. (this could be taken as positive 
or negative)

The attached file is their business plan

Patrick

Lisa, 

As i was pondering the meeting last night going home in my car, I realized 
that I forgot to talk about 2 people,  including regulatory and your personal 
efforts.  I apologize for that, it was unintentional and I hope you realize 
how important you and your efforts are to EGM and Enron.  I could not read my 
notes very well due to the extremely heavy lighting - that didn't appear on 
my notes just on me.

Thanks,
Mike

Guy, FYI.  Is anyone familiar with this?  Mike is looking for some feedback.  
It looks very premature and not worth a lot of time but he may need us to 
talk with them to help him with his business down there.  Any comments?

Michael, I have the following comments to the Nodocero.com project.

Currently works as a platform where buyers and sellers agree on a price 
through an auction process (brokerage fee)
They aim at becoming a regulated market with standardised contracts. (subject 
to market and regulatory evolution)
Their value drivers are the "Payment Guarantee" (through an insurance 
company) and "Backoffice" (registration before regulatory authorities). None 
of these issues are definitely solved (no agreement with Insurance Co. and if 
any transaction is done now, all the backoffice procedures have to be done 
manually with their employees).
No technological partner yet. They have developed the web site platform (you 
can see it at www.nodocero.com), but I understand that they don't have the 
rest of the technological components required (database, operations, clearing 
system, other). 

Apart from this, I would consider the following issues:

Currently there is no regulated market for this sector of the economy 
(Argentina and the rest of Latin America). Therefore their idea of becoming 
one is good.
The competitors in this race are: Nodocero.com - aXesoEnergia.com - 
EnergyVex.com - Rofex (Rosario Futures Exchange) - other.
No competitor has yet taken an important lead in this race. aXesoEnergia.com 
is doing an important investment in marketing, but it currently works via an 
auction process and does not provide any further service like guarantee or 
backoffice.
One of the competitors will eventually succeed in becoming the reference 
market.
Nodocero.com has no strategic partner yet. (this could be taken as positive 
or negative)

The attached file is their business plan

FYI.  I got this from mike late last week.  Any comments?  It looks very 
early in their development but Mike may want them to talk to a couple of 
people here about their site.  We need to be helpful if it will help his 
business.

Dan are you up to speed on this?  If not please call him and get his 
viewpoint as well.

Mike

Here is the information we discussed regarding Nodocero. Let me know when is 
a good time to do a secondary discussion. They will be in Houston late next

Rebecca, 
Ouch.  Thanks checking, sorry for being out of the loop.  I'll let Philippe 
know, although he should have already been aware of this.

Mike

Beth Perlman was elected a Corp. V.P. in February and Jenny Rub was elected 
in May.  Call me or Kelly Johnson if you have any questions.

Rebecca,

Philippe being the only other corp officer within the large technology 
organization has an enormous volume of contracts to sign.  A large bulk of 
the signatures that are required come from two areas;  Infrastructure and 
ENA.  I would like to have 2 current Vice Presidents within the business 
units made corp VPs:  Beth Pearlman and Jenny Rub.

Can we make this happen and when would it occur?

Thanks,
Mike

I don't think you got a copy of this.
mike

Andrew, please make sure Jeff gets a copy of all of everything.  He is the 
Office of the Chairman sponor of the vertical and will be managing this 
process with Greg Piper until launch.  I stepped in while he was out of town 
on holiday.

The IT Compliance team has been asked to conduct a process review and process 
development project with the Clickpaper team.  The immediate plan is to focus 
on key processes prior to the go live date of July 24.  Arthur Andersen has 
agreed to provide experienced personnel to assist with this effort as 
necessary.

Attached please find a draft work program of the processes we plan to focus 
on over the next 13 days.  Under the execution section, the work program 
identifies the priority processes and the contacts we will initiate 
interviews with.  We will begin scheduling interviews this afternoon.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation,

Please review the attached EnronOnline press releases which are scheduled for 
release at 10:00 AM CDT tomorrow, July 12, 2000.  The purpose of the separate 
releases (the counterparties will make their own releases in addition) is to 
communicate the message that our goal is to continue to increase liquidity.  
One way to do that is give the greatest possible number of  buyers and 
sellers the opportunity to see our prices.

Please send any comments to me by 9:00 AM CDT tomorrow, July 12, 2000.

Mike,
Thanks for the response.  Yes, I would like a complete review of your 
initiatives.  Please call Cathy at 36898 and get on my calendar for a 1 hour 
update.

Thanks,
mike

Mike,
In addition to our e-commerce activity (energy.enron.com), my team has a 
number of "e-business" initiatives either under development or 
consideration.  These initiatives relate to using internet technologies to 
improve customer satisfaction, improve productivity, shorten the sales cycle, 
etc, not directly to transacting per se.  For example, we are creating a 
customer portal that will allow our existing customers to get access to a 
variety of information--such as billing, energy usage, project status, 
general news, etc.--all through a single browser view that can be customized 
to present only the information that the customer's interested in.  Another 
application we're exploring would use internet technology to streamline the 
deal process through on-line collaboration with our prospective customers.  
Although these wouldn't be considered traditional e-commerce initiatives, 
they're examples of using the internet to create more value through better 
execution in our business.  

Do you want to start tracking these kinds of initiatives too?  There may be 
opportunities in other BU's to use similar applications or otherwise take 
advantage of our learning.

Mike

Attached is the first draft of the eCommerce Commercial and Origination 
Activities Contact List.  This is being prepared for a wider distribution, 
therefore, please take a moment to review the list carefully and let me know 
if you have any changes to the list or if you would like to add any 
additional names to the list that you feel are appropriate.  The purpose of 
this document is to provide a consistent means for all areas of Enron to 
direct questions and inquiries related to specific eCommerce issues.

Thank you.

Here are a couple of other thoughts and ideas.

We need to emphasize our new businesses outside the energy business=20

meetings.  This is very exciting and could take the industry by storm=20
(eventually).  Especially with Jeff=01,s comments with the analysts.  This=

should be emphasized with the metals piece.  The concept is that here are 2=
=20
new areas where Enron is going to change the "old economy" businesses and=
=20
industries.  Clickpaper will have real time pricing which is different than=
=20
all the other 15 existing sites.  All of the others are charging 3% fees fo=

matching buyers and sellers in a bulletin board or auction type of=20
transactions. We will also have that functionality (and will charge 1% or $=

(we=01,ll update you later) but will also have an EOL type of real time pri=

component (this piece will be free).  This piece will not be ready for July=

answer any other questions and fill you in and answer more questions.  He c=

be reached at ext. 36635.

Also, on the "Target Markets" page, I would reorder;  put Lumber underneath=

pulp and paper and think about separating the others as potential markets. =
=20
That way we could actually check off the top 3 as "done" and the others are=

Please draft up your initial thoughts on these items and send me the latest=

version and I=01,ll add additional commentary.  I will be in all next week.

Thanks,

First, thanks for jumping in on this.  I am confident we can get it done even 
though it will be a fire drill.

We had a control or process matrix meeting today and it is all there, it was 
just being held or managed in four places.  It will all  be pulled together 
by Monday in one place (one complete document) and will have about 15 major 
categories with specific tasks under each category with status, person 
responsible, comments and date to be completed.  It will also have a complete 
timeline. We can review that Monday and agree on its content.  Louise agreed 
to review it as well.

As it relates to the people you mentioned, let me know how and/or who you 
want to pull in after we agree on the control document.  That way we will 
know which areas I have holes and how we can fill them.

Salley Beck called (she mentioned you had called her as well) and we agreed 
that the ClickPaper's back office representative would officially be Scott 
Earnest (he has been unofficially it for months and we have been working with 
him for months).  She is going to get in place people to be our Product 
Control Group for CP launch on July 24th.  Scott and Salley will work to 
source it so that we have 3 or 4 people trained and ready on the 24th to 
receive password applications, create customer profiles on ClickPaper and 
start the applications through credit, legal and tax and finally get out user 
IDs to clients.  We will leverage off the EOL process but not use their 
people unless there is some emergency.  Remember, we are only setting up 
people for paper so the process is somewhat simplified.

We also have a help desk person starting next week.  I don't have his name 
yet, but we have him and one more on the way.  We will create for them a 
brief manual and train them on the system as fast as we can.

I did have a good meeting with Louise and Dave.  We walked inch by inch 
through getting a user ID and password to getting a trade done.  We have a 
few holes, but it is not that far away.  She is going to think about a 
process document for this and get back to me Monday.  I have a detailed EOL 
one and we will give it our shot this weekend.

Let me know what Mark Palmer says.  He knows we have been using Margaret.  We 
will sit down with Margaret again on Monday and detail for her the PR plan 
and what she needs to do.  We still plan to go out with a fairly inclusive 
mailing ( a letter) that does not include temporary IDs/passwords.  We will 
tell them that the launch is coming and as special customers, we want to use 
this time to get them pre-registered.  Besides, there is no way to test a 
1000 temporary IDs anyway.  We will send those out later.  as I said earlier, 
the goal is to replace the splash screen with the unsecure area (or garden as 
Lousie would call it) by next for Friday or the following Monday. That way 
people can surf the content and get registered.

On legal, I have been using Travis McCullough for at least four months and we 
had a detailed discussion today about the contracts, what is needed and the 
deadline. There is legal work left to do ( the current draft of the password 
application doesn't work), but if Taylor can help, that would be great.  We 
will get our commercial comments back to Travis by Monday.

I have a meeting Monday with Bill Bradford and Ted Murphy (with Bob Crane and 
Hal as well) to discuss the issue of a manual interface and the control 
issues associated with it.  Credit is fine, we have been working with 
Bradford for months, but Murphy needs to understand the issues with manual 
posting. I will also make sure they check with Rick Buy on his approval and 
views.

The entire ENA Paper group has the link to our site and we will have all 
their comments by the end of next week. They will also be given the complete 
Net Works and ClickPaper story on Thursday at their offsite and are ready to 
help the roll out.  We also have them scheduled to come in Saturday, July 
22nd for the final testing of the system.

Remember, the 24th is a one (Enron)-to-many launch with a financial market 
only.  ClickPaper is not the counterparty in the trade section, Enron is so 
it is simply a new distribution channel for Enron's existing financial 
offering.  Later, we will build it out for physical (probably sooner rather 
than later).  Finally, I will incorporate the EOL link or transaction loop 
but Louise said today that is October or November.  It will only be 
many-to-many if someone comes in and makes a compelling case ($$$) to do so.

Thanks.

See you tomorrow.

Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, 
personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another 
good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and 
assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very 
smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and 
he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a 
couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse 
engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has 
others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his 
existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper 
already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the 
short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she 
could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good 
option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary 
Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck 
(advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick 
thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early 
versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the 
marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure 
that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John 
Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday 
afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to 
add a trading perspective?

A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.

Monica,
This looks ok, but I can give you more accurate and more up to date slides 
for the future.  One important fact, we do not distibute the EOL slides to 
the general public.  Normally what we do is present the story but do not 
include hard copies with the conference hand outs.

couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse 
engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has 
others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his 
existing AA resources that are available (some are working on ClickPaper 
already).
Other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the 
short run:  Beth Pearlman, John Tollefson (IT), Bob Schultz (LK said she 
could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), Dave Forester (not a good 
option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), Mary 
Solmenson, Scott Mills, Berry Pearce, David Port, David Sweeny, Sally Beck 
(advice and discuss additional resources).
I did ask Louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick 
thoughts on process and lessons learned.
I saw the process maps for EOL and I think they, or the simplified early 
versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for ClickPaper.
I went by to see Mark Palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the 
marketing effort and what Margarat Allen is doing.  I wanted him to make sure 
that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
I also talked with Beth Pearlman about helping out (or assigning John 
Tollefson) and I told her that we would be talking about this on Monday 
afternoon.
Do we need to have Alan Aronowitz or Mark Taylor look over the agreements to 
add a trading perspective?

A few thoughts,  see you tomorrow.

Greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for Monday's meeting.

I would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, 
personnel responsibilities and key action items.  I think this is another 
good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and 
assignments.
Andrew Parsons Sr. Director (and superior performer) is a great and very 
smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.  You will like him and 
he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a 
couple of weeks.  He wrote the IT compliance process chain and could reverse 
engineer difficult parts that are unique to the Ariba platform.  He has 
others on his team that could help and I've asked him to think about his

Attached is the first draft of the eCommerce Commercial and Origination 
Activities Contact List.  This is being prepared for a wider distribution, 
therefore, please take a moment to review the list carefully and let me know 
if you have any changes to the list or if you would like to add any 
additional names to the list that you feel are appropriate.  The purpose of 
this document is to provide a consistent means for all areas of Enron to 
direct questions and inquiries related to specific eCommerce issues.

Thank you.

Mike McConnell

Ted,
Thanks for the email.  It looks like bad luck again for lunch.  I am out of 
town again.  Life is crazy right now.  Look for more on Enron and Enron Net 
Works in the near future.  We are busy.

Thanks and i hope all is well.
mike

thanks for the follow-up
mike

Don,

Thanks for the fax survey.  We couldn't read the numbers however.  Please 
mail a copy to our house when you get a chance.  

Are there any issues from your point of view?  I would like to understand 
what the limitations are on the easements but it appears that everything is 
done.  Are we ready to close and how do we do this?
Thanks,
Mike

Paragraph 9 of Schedule B of the Commitment for Title Insurance reflects the
number and size of the easements.  However, the survey will show where they
are actually located.  As soon as we receive the survey, we will advise you
accordingly.

       Very truly yours,

       Donald S. Stirman

Thanks, I'll keep my ears open.

Please distribute the following message to Enron - Worldwide and please use 
the Office of the Chairman - Enron Net Works letterhead.  Mike McConnell has 
requested that this message be returned for final review and then sent to 
Enron - Worldwide this evening.  Please call me at X-36898 if you have any 
questions.  Thank you.  Cathy Phillips

Effective immediately, reporting responsibility for Global Strategic Sourcing 
(GSS) will move from Enron Net Works to Enron Corp.  George Wasaff, managing 
director, will report directly to Rick Causey, executive vice president and 
chief accounting officer for Enron.  GSS, formed February 1, 2000, will 
continue to focus on supply-chain management world-wide for Enron.   We 
believe this change in reporting will leverage and enhance GSS's global reach 
and effectiveness while allowing ENW to focus on its core mission of creating 
new electronic market places.

Rick, here is the proposed email on George.  Any comments?  I wanted to keep 
it short and sweet.  This will be sent out at close of business today (they 
like to send out massive emails after hours).

Pleaes let me know any issues or comments ASAP.

Thanks,
mike

On Tuesday, July 25, I am meeting with Molecular Electronics Corp. (MEC) to 
discuss the opportunity for establishing this newly formed company in 
Houston.  For those of you that are not familiar with MEC, they are 
considered one of the premier companies in the area of molecular computing.  
MEC has approached Enron to discuss a possible alliance that would facilitate 
their development and, in particular, location in the Houston area.  MEC 
represents the frontier of computing technology.

I would like to invite you to participate in a working lunch discussion of 
the opportunities and obstacles facing a company that is seeking to change an 
industry.  I would appreciate it if you could join us on July 25  from 11:30 
to 1:30 in EB49C1 for this informal roundtable with the CEO of MEC, Harvey 
Plotnick and one of the founders, Jim Tour.

Will you please let Vanessa Groscrand know if you can attend at 713-853-1769 
or please reply by e-mail to me.

Mike,
I am totally booked today and am physically out of our office most of the 
day.  Cathy has attempted to coordinate and has set him up to talk with a 
couple of other senior people in New Works and technology.  She will know if 
my schedules changes and I become available.

Sorry it couldn't work out.

There is a gentleman in Houston today and tomorrow that I would like you to 
talk to. He has responsibility for one of the online trading systems in 
Argentina that we are looking at and we are in the process of hiring him. He 
is the architect of Argentina's energy sector and the past Sec of Energy. I 
think you will find him quite interesting. His name is Carlos Bastos. The 
system is Nododero. The one Don spoke of.

Would you be available tomorrow some time? You could also be a representative 
of the executive committee in the hiring process.

Hello. I'm amazed we have not met through JDF -- my family has been very
involved for many years and my father, Ross Cooley  has gone on to do more
work for the International JDF group. Anyway, I'm asking for your
assistance. Can you please steer me to the individual(s) heading up
Continental's internet partner development for the different Enron
Companies?

My company, Bowstreet.com (http://bowstreet.com) provides an XML

organization business processes inside partners sites -- allowing rapidly
integration as well as scaling of these relationships. Again, your guidance
is most appreciated..

Mr. McConnell,

I received a call tonight from Elliott Katz in our Sydney office regarding 
the problems that you were having with connectivity. I spoke to the 
technician in Tokyo and we were able to get everything working.

I tested your account via IPass to the Tokyo number  (011813) 3525 3000 and 
through the VPN client - both worked fine. Nobu and I stepped through making 
sure your system was connecting properly and that Notes was operational.

Neither of us had your password so I changed it to change12me. I will handle 
getting the password reset to whatever you would like if you would like to 
email or call me with it. The only catch is that it must be unique.

You can reach me on my cell phone anytime. The number is 713.539.3814.

Thank you and I hope you have a good visit and a safe trip home!

Travis Williams

Joe,

Thanks for the response.  As you heard from Cathy, I got a stomach virus and 
all 4 of us in the family spent Saturday night throwing up.  I am writing 
this from my bed and I am improving.  I should be able to get on the plane 
tomorrow and am about to eat lunch (1st meal since Sat. but I think it will 
be fine).  I'm definitely in recovery mode.

I am having everything messengered out to my house later this afternoon but 
am concerned about contacts and getting to the hotel.  I know you have said 
that it is easy to take the train and the bus but I am concerned about it, 
especially if i am still a little under the weather.  I still don't want to 
have a car, but would you please set up someone on your staff to meet me at 
the gate and escort me through the process.  Sorry if it is a pain but I 
think I might need it and it will make me feel much more comfortable on the 
flight over knowing that I will have assistance.

Thanks for your help and I'll see you soon.

Mike McConnell@ECT
06/12/2000 06:48 AM
Joe, 

Thanks for the email.    I am looking forward to the trip and learning more 
about what you are doing thus how we can help.  If we would have had any idea 
that Europe could have been as big as it has become, we would have done some 
things differently and we can get a head start with Japan.  This would be 
most helpful.  We are clearly trying to avoid the traps that we ran into in 
Europe and in the US.  Faster, quicker, smarter.  Thursday sounds great and 
just let me know about Friday.  Is Anthony in japan during the trip?  Anthony 
was here last week and will be back the week after you arrive.  Remember,  I 
am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss technology specific 
applications just the business concepts and potential ideas and 
opportunities.  We clearly want your business insight wrt the setup and focus 
of the business.  I will send you a presentation that we recently gave to 
Sherriff.  It is mostly up to date although continually changing.  This will 
help give you a feeling for what the landscape looks like.  On Wed, however, 
I would like to take you through our web presentation and how this fits into 
our overall strategy.

A couple of other questions about the trip.  Do you want me to make any 
presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?  I don't think 
presentations are necessary unless you would feel more comfortable or have 
something particularly appropriate.  The discussion with EPower/EJ on 
Thursday afternoon would be good if you could speak about Net Works and what 
Enron is doing across the focus areas.  On Friday, I believe that in the 
proposed meeting with Softbank a presentation is not necessary.  For the 
ACCJ, if you had a couple of slides on Enron and our e-comm initiatives this 
would be great.  We could put this together here if you would like as I have 
a couple of your recent presentations.  Let me know.  Also, what is the 
appropriate dress code.  The Japanese still dress up.  I'm afraid suits are 
de rigour.  I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make any assumptions 
about new cultures.  Do you have any cultural facts that you can fax me about 
the do's and don'ts of both cultures?  We could try and find something, but I 
think you will find that the Japanese are trying to become more western.  
Despite what you have heard, this place is not as foreign as rumored.  Do I 
have clear instruction how to take the train from the airport.  All of us get 
back and forth on the train and the bus.  We can get you a driver, but you 
won't get here any faster and is quite expensive (US$500 one way).  I 
normally get a driver, I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak 
any of the language.  If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.

One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me 
at the hotel.  I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it 
really helps.  Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel 
after the trip.  I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the 
Japanese culture.  Ono will set something set up here.  The hotel has its own 
massage service that can be accessed at almost all hours.

Mike,

We are looking to accomplish a number of things while you are here over 
Thursday and Friday.  Thursday's schedule is fairly set, and we are working 
on Friday.  Thursday morning through to the afternoon we would present to you 
the current state of the business and the initiatives/proposition/etc for 
enron.co.jp.  This would take us through mid afternoon.  We would then go 
over to EPower and we would ask you to give a talk on the state of technology 
at Enron and the initiatives within Net Works.  We would bring EJ over to 
EPower for your talk.  Afterwards we would have drinks with the main 
commercial team at EPower and EJ.  Dinner to be arranged for a smaller 
group.  On Friday, we would like to use the time to set up some meetings with 
key IT/tech companies here in Japan.  To date, we have not yet met any of 
these companies, but there is currently an extraordinary amount of activity 
in the country.  We are looking to leverage some of Enron's banking 
relationships to get as high a level meeting as possible with the likes of 
Softbank.  We are also asking for other suggestions from the banks.  We are 
also considering a potential talk with the American Chamber of Commerce on 
Enron and Enron Technology.  The ACCJ is one of the most active and largest 
chambers in the world and bring in some quite interesting speakers.  We will 
have more on this.

For the weekend we have recd some suggestions from the Hotel and will pass 
these along to you shortly.

I will be travelling with you on Sunday on the trip to Seoul.

Joe

Joe, 

I am looking forward to the upcoming trip.  

Everything is all set for Korea but what do you suggest as an agenda for my 
two days in Tokyo?  Also are there some presentations or items that i could 
review before I arrive that you believe might be helpful?  I will also be 
there over a weekend, I would like to do some site seeing on Sat and Sunday 
(my flight to Korea leaves on Sunday late afternoon).  I would appreciate 
some suggestions and I will need a guide, could you have someone arrange it 
for me?

Thanks, and Cathy will co-ordinate everything.

Mike

I'll let you know later.  thanks,
m

Julie, looks great.  Please make sure the video is also in there.  I'm doing 
better but very week.  Ready to try food.  If I am at all better i will get 
on the plane tomorow.  Yolanda is going to messanger a bunch of stuff to my 
house later, just make sure she gets the CD.
Thanks,
m

Joe, 

Thanks for the email.    I am looking forward to the trip and learning more 
about what you are doing thus how we can help.  If we would have had any idea 
that Europe could have been as big as it has become, we would have done some 
things differently and we can get a head start with Japan.  Thursday sounds 
great and just let me know about Friday.  Is Anthony in japan during the 
trip?  Remember,  I am not a technologist and therefore can't discuss 
technology specific applications just the business concepts and potential 
ideas and opportunities.

A couple of other questions about the trip.  Do you want me to make any 
presentations while i am there or simply talk about our plans?  Also, what is 
the appropriate dress code.  I am assuming suits but i didn't want to make 
any assumptions about new cultures.  Do you have any cultural facts that you 
can fax me about the do's and don'ts of both cultures?  Do I have clear 
instruction how to take the train from the airport.  I normally get a driver, 
I am uncomfortable in new countries that I can't speak any of the language.  
If there is a way to get lost, I'll find a way.

One more item, could you please have your assistant set up a message for me 
at the hotel.  I am usually very stiff and sore after a long trip and it 
really helps.  Make sure it gives me a enough time to arrive to the hotel 
after the trip.  I would also prefer a female if that is acceptable to the 
Japanese culture.

Thanks,
Mike

PB,

Attached is a resume for a guy I know via technology and a very old parental 
friendship.  He is a very aggressive guy and marketer type.  He has the 
personality to be an originator or mid-marketer.  I figured you might need 
someone like this around for Paveto,  Bruce's or in EOL group.   He would 
pound the phones and make things happen.

Follow up if you want to talk with him.

Thanks,
m
Hello Mike,

It has been a while since my last communication with you. I hope all is well.

I want you to know that I greatly appreciated you helping me get in touch 
with Ken Rice and all of the other folks at EBS last year. We made great 
strides and came very close to doing a deal between our organizations. 
However, Comdisco recently has come under some financial duress and is most 
likely going to be sold off in pieces.

I have been talking with some of the folks within EBS about the possibility 
of an origination position with their group. However, I am of the opinion 
that EBS is slightly ahead of the market, and therefore the timing may not be 
right for me to consider an origination position with EBS.

With that being said, I would be very interested in exploring what 
opportunities might exist within your Global Markets group from an 
origination standpoint. As you know, I am professionally aggressive, mentally 
tough and fearless of contacting potential clients. I have solid experience 
in professional selling, possess excellent communication and entrepreneurial 
skills.

Mike please consider the attached resume below. I would welcome the 
opportunity to meet with you or the appropriate person within your 
organization at any time.

Thanks again, and I hope to hear from you.

Mike I will be in Houston the week of the 19th any chance of meeting up?

Richard

Philippe,

I did talk to Skilling about this.  I must have forgotten to call you.  Jeff 
really does want it around, you were correct.  Is there a compromise solution 
here?  Maybe a smaller room with a control center vs an entire floor?  Think 
about items like that and lets discuss.  At this point in time, lets not 
assume we have the option to move it from the new building, at least not all 
of it.  One key consideration is the cost savings by moving it to Ardmore.  
How much will it really save?  Those numbers a long with all the other points 
might bring clarity to what we should do.

Thanks,
Mike

   

Mike,

Jenny and I have been thinking about the new building, I want to minimise the 
amount of space dedicated to a data center Skilling is (from what
Bill Donovan says) keen to have a state of the art data center that he can 
take visitors to. I think that given our notorious inability to plan for 
space 
at this company (We are out of space in London already 18months ahead of 
schedule), I would like to convince Jeff not to have a large DC in 
the new building and add to Ardmore which would on a per square foot basis be 
significantly cheaper we would have the added benefit  of having
an extra floor available in the new building!

I think this is the best thing to do for Enron.

Let me know what you think

Philippe

John, 

FYI,   

Mike
	
	

Mary Nell and Peter,

I certainly agree.  I don't know if Jeff has called Mulva but that is the 
right action before we do anything else.  John will hear the result of that 
conversation as soon as it happens.

Thanks and good luck.

Who would have thought we would ever see the day that the J-Block contract 
was making so much money that the J-Block parties would intentionally default 
under it?  I guess we were just too good at our jobs...  My quick look at the 
amended contract tells me that our best contractual avenue is to analyze the 
possibility of wilful default under the contract, in which case the cap on 
damages would not apply.  Peter, as you and I discussed, the Bacton option 
may help our analysis on this.  I definitely would want to get outside 
counsel advice on the point, and in any event I agree that going to Mulva is 
the right approach to begin with.  Peter, let me know what you want me to do 
next, i.e., should we let the upper management contact run its course before 
I go for outside advice?  I expect so, but please let me know.  Ciao.

John,

Hello from South America.  I just got your email and I certainly concur with 
Jeff making the call.  He has maintained a good relationship with Mulva. This 
was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from Phillips regarding 
performance.  I don't know how much it will help however.  Richard Harper and 
Mary Nell Browning may have some ideas here but I am sure you've already gone 
through it with them.  I am amazed how the details get fuzzy on an old 
project.  When you discussed it, i was trying to think back to our remedies 
and discussions but the 3 years have made it difficult.

I don't know if there is anything I can do but I'm always willing to help.

Good luck,
Mike

I mentioned on our conference call on Monday that J-Block has had problems 
meeting our nominations from the Judy/Joanne/Janice reservoirs.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for 
reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they 
are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of 
May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.  

From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept 
underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since 
returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 
mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).

We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the 
maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than 
make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the 
penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of 
the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily 
price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.

Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to 
deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they 
have not responded yet.

You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to 
getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost 
us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their 
non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.  

By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the 
delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if 
you need me
for a phone call I can break away.

John

Mary Nell and Peter,

Mr. McConnell,

I am an Energy Management major at OU who is interning here at Enron.  My 
work experience so far has been excellent, and nothing less than what I had 
hoped for.  I have had the opportunity to hear you speak a few times in 
Norman and have been very impressed.  I have been impressed by the things you 
said about this company and its ideals, programs and its commitment to 
excellence - all of which I have seen since I started work.  The most 
impressive thing to me, however, were the things you said about positive 
thinking, goal setting, and the power of the subconscious mind in your talk 
with the J.C. Penney Leadership Program.  These are beliefs which I have been 
raised on by my father, and really believe to be true.  It was very 
inspirational to hear that type of message from someone else for whom it has 
obviously worked.  As I have started my internship here, I am implementing 
this psychology into my life and work ethic, and thought you would might have 
some helpful advice.  I know you are an extremely busy man, but I decided to 
send you an email and ask if you ever had a few free minutes in which I could 
speak with you about how this way of thinking has positively impacted your 
career.  If you ever have a few minutes of free time this summer, I would 
really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you.

Thank you for your time

Blake Lasuzzo

Blake,
Thanks for the email.  I will work on it.  I am out for the next several 
weeks, S America (today), Korea and Japan in the next 2 weeks.  If I don't 
follow-up after that, please email me again.

Thanks for the kind words.

Bob,
Hello from S America.  I would recommend 2 people.  Both are obvious but 
Louise Kitchen should do EOL and Ken Rice is the best candidate for EBS.  If 
they aren't available they can pick an appropriate person.

Mike

Mike,

Who should we contact about getting Enron Broadband and Enron Online active
with Interactive Texas (see www.interactivetexas.com)?  With such a broad
cross-section of the state's senior leaders participating, including
Skilling, Interactive Texas is going to be a major event.  We need to make
certain Enron gets early access to exhibit or sponsorship opportunities.

~Bob

PB, what do you think?

I never received and answer from you to the e-mail below.

Can you please tell me who is replacing Alberto Gude for COMIT, so I can
forward information about the meeting on July 18.

Thanks!!

Al

Enron is a member of the Center on the Management of Information Technology
(COMIT) in the Jones Graduate School of Management at Rice University.
Alberto Gude was the Enron representative for COMIT. Alberto indicated that
I should contact you concerning COMIT activities.

On July 18 from 9:30 until about noon, we will have the COMIT planning
meeting to determine activities for the next academic year. Please place
this date on your calendar. I'll be sending additional information at a
later date.

If you are not able to attend the meeting, I will appreciate you sending a
representative.

In the future, is there one individual I should contact rather than the two
of you?

I look forward to working with you.

Please read the attached memo from Larry Izzo. He is obviously wanting to 
resurface Infrastructure World.  As you will note in the last paragraph, he 
is basically staking out a position that EECC is going to have to spend $2 
million on project management software development and  that he can capture 
free optionality of doing a deal with infrastructure world.

On the surface of it, this does not make sense on several dimensions:

1. It is not clear to me why EECC has to spend $2 million on project 
management software development. By definition, such software would want to 
be collaborative  and I don't understand the logic of why we would do it 
ourselves.

2. If there is a seperate carve-out of project management software that is 
required for what we do that is separate from what existing functionality of 
Cepren, Buzzsaw and Bidcom is doing; we may have an opportunity to do joint 
development with any of these players. The question is picking who we think 
would be a winner and figuring out if there is a deal to be done. Allan and 
Drew, together with the EECC, have orchestrated meetings next week with these 
three companies to figure out ways that EECC may be able to work together 
with one of them. I would note that Bechtel is an investor in Cephren so it 
is not clear that they expected these to entities to be directly competitive. 
It is not clear that Infrastructure World is preferable to one of these other 
alternatives.

3. It is obviously not my call as to whether EECC needs or will spend $2 
million for Project Management software development (although I am 
skeptical). From an investment perspective, there has not been that much that 
has progressed on Infrastructure World in the last six to eight weeks. The 
principal change has been a significant revaluation  and critical assessment 
of B2B business plans and particularly revenue models. I would thus say that 
two months ago my assessment given the Bechtel/Hull involvement that there 
was a 75% ability to do legitimate VC at $5 to $10 million pre-money (as 
opposed to the $15 million that it was done at). I would say that the 
probability would be 25% of $5 to $10 million with significant risk of doing 
subsequent rounds. I would thus have a view that we should pass from an 
investment perspective.

I have left Larry a voice mail that I am available to meet when I am back 
Thursday and Friday when I am back from my father's funeral. I will have a 
discussion along these points. I am on vacation next week , but  told Larry 
in the voice mail that the alternative is to meet with Allan (who is out this 
week) and one of the people from my team.

Chris,

Thanks for the email.  I'll wait to get the pictures it will definitely 
help.  I miss understood about the photos, I thought you were sending me via 
email that next day.   Congrats on the Cassatt, that person will really enjoy 
it.  

Let me know about the price as soon as you get a chance.  I understand that 
there is a shipping component and no sales tax.  I like to have all my art 
shipped because the tax savings can be significant, especially in New York.  
I did like that frame on the picture but didn't understand your comment below 
($783).  The price you had did include the frame didn't it?

Thanks,
Mike

Dear Mike:
Thanks for the email.  I sent a package via US mail with photos of each
piece to you on Wednesday night.  (The Cassatt was sold already, sorry.)  I
thought you would want to look at the pieces with your wife, and make the
decision together.

We do not accept credit cards, but checks are fine.  I will speak ot Mr.
Hubert about the price, however are you interested in the frame?  Also be
aware the crating charge for this piece is $150., but no sales tax. ($783.)

Please wait for the images if you like, and we will speak soon.

Best Wishes,

Chris

Thanks for the quick response.  I sent it on to John.  Don't be surprised if 
he calls you;  you are the master of this deal.

Mike

I have not been involved, but only last week a little bird told me that they 
have severe problems with reserve levels and expect to decline in 2002, when 
we were talking it was 2004 and then only by a small amount.  Agip is 
particularly adversely effected (as Agip in particular lacks reserves in the 
area).  I understand the development of Jade by BG and Phillips and the 
squeeze down of Texaco and OMV, the other Jade owners, by Agip  to sell their 
gas to Agip was driven by this lack of reserves.

You will recall that liquidated damages was a big issue they wanted to retain 
them rather than actual damages and we insisted that they remained at the 
same absolute level as in the old agreement, so I believe they are 40% of the 
new price (my memory is fading also).  I do recall that they all insisted 
that they would deliver the gas.  However, as with most companies the players 
have all moved on and a contract is a contract, afterall this was our 
approach.  Also I am sure they intended to maximise production from J-Block 
and did not forsee a shortage of production.

 It would be interesting to know if this is an agreed policy by them or 
whether one of the sellers is blocking the NBP sale by refusing to 
co-operate, they could do this because of the Common Stream Agreement.  
Presumably they have not yet split the 3 agreements yet.

As to opportunity if they are short of reserves, perhaps they can buy 
themselves out of the situation, especially while the contract is in the 
money.

With my adversarial hat on perhaps BG want revenge for their loss in the 
appeal courts?   This is probably nearest to the truth.

I'm afraid this isn't much help and I do not recall any willful default 
provisions in the agreement.

Richard,
 Hello from South America.  I am forwarding this email from John regarding 
the J-Block problems.  Have you been involved in this?  What are your 
thoughts?  If you have any ideas or can provide with some help, please 
follow-up.  This is confidential but i thought you could help.  When he 
mentioned this, I really couldn't remember much.  Amazing how the memory 
fades on some of the details in just a few years.

I mentioned on our conference call on Monday that J-Block has had problems 
meeting our nominations from the Judy/Joanne/Janice reservoirs.

Up until recent CATS maintenance shutdown on 15 May, they were making up for 
reduced production volumes by nominating to supply gas at the NBP which they 
are entitled but not obliged to do.  Since return from outage at the end of 
May they have declined to nominate at the NBP.  

From 1 January to 15 May, the Sellers use of the NBP delivery option kept 
underdeliveries to 350 mmcf (ie one day's maximum quantity) in total.  Since 
returning from the maintenance shutdown, underdeliveries have totalled 850 
mmcf ( averaging 77mcf/d ).

We believe that following the sharp rise in market prices during the 
maintenance period, they have decided to default on the contract rather than 
make up deliveries from other sources.   They have an effective cap on the 
penalties of about 5 pence per therm (after taking into account the value of 
the liquids) and therefore they are not making up the volumes when the daily 
price is substantially higher than about 16 pence per therm.

Prior to the CATS shutdown, we had made them a proposal to enable them to 
deliver additional volumes at  another alternative to avoid default but they 
have not responded yet.

You mentioned that in your negotiations with Phillips they had committed to 
getting us all the gas regardless of the cap on the penalties.  This has cost 
us about $1.5 million to date and they seem to be institutionalising their 
non performance.    Perhaps a phone call by you might help.  

By the way I will be in Houston on Thursday and Friday to meet with the 
delegation from Croatia and I will probably be tied up the entire time but if 
you need me
for a phone call I can break away.

John

John,

Below is a response from Richard Harper.  A couple of interesting thoughts.  
Richard would be a great source for running ideas by and/or  testing 
concepts.  He is brilliant on this.
Just a thought.

I have not been involved, but only last week a little bird told me that they 
have severe problems with reserve levels and expect to decline in 2002, when 
we were talking it was 2004 and then only by a small amount.  Agip is 
particularly adversely effected (as Agip in particular lacks reserves in the 
area).  I understand the development of Jade by BG and Phillips and the 
squeeze down of Texaco and OMV, the other Jade owners, by Agip  to sell their 
gas to Agip was driven by this lack of reserves.

You will recall that liquidated damages was a big issue they wanted to retain 
them rather than actual damages and we insisted that they remained at the 
same absolute level as in the old agreement, so I believe they are 40% of the 
new price (my memory is fading also).  I do recall that they all insisted 
that they would deliver the gas.  However, as with most companies the players 
have all moved on and a contract is a contract, afterall this was our

Julie,
thanks for the update.  a couple of items.
1.  take out IT compliance and we will make it 1 dot point under PB's area of 
technology update
2. metals - call it MG(plc)
3.  take out page 16 (initiatives under consideration)
4.  Change org chart;  Jay - add investments and New Mkt. identification;  
take S horn off
5. on agenda page add sub dots for project updates and accomplishments under 
technology update
6. Jeff McMahon will add a page on finance as well, give him a call for a 
draft.  It will go in the vision section put it toward the back of the vision 
section

On further emails, only send me change or new pages.  It takes forever to 
download this (EOL) when I replicate.

Thanks,
m

John,

Hello from South America.  I just got your email and I certainly concur with 
Jeff making the call.  He has maintained a good relationship with Mulva. This 
was a risk that we had but we did have assurances from Phillips regarding 
performance.  I don't know how much it will help however.  Richard Harper and 
Mary Nell Browning may have some ideas here but I am sure you've already gone 
through it with them.  I am amazed how the details get fuzzy on an old 
project.  When you discussed it, i was trying to think back to our remedies 
and discussions but the 3 years have made it difficult.

I don't know if there is anything I can do but I'm always willing to help.

Good luck,
Mike

Suzanne,

I glanced at the presentation.  It looks good.  
Two comments:
1.  Could we use our older machines for home use?  They are still very good 
they just aren't the newest technology.  All are fast, CD ready  with plenty 
of memory.  It could knock the cost down significantly.
2.  I would have the cost of Houston only to start with as a pilot.  That 
would reduce our initial costs significantly even for NA.  I recommend that 
you at least know what that cost is as a fall back position.

Good luck.  Your teams hard work really shows here.

Understood.  I will be in CA next week meeting with Socal and PGE.  With 
Socal, we plan to discuss their storage capabilities - to take vaporized LNG 
and provide a balancing service.  With PG&E we'll be looking for points where 
they could take gas into their system.  We wanted to be fairly specific, but 
not tip our hand regarding project timing or exact location.  Socal is 
scheduled to release their system study (to receive LNG) tomorrow.

I've requested a meeting next Friday in San Francisco with Jeff Dasovich 
(regulatory) and Sandi McCubbin (legislative) to explain our concept and get 
their input.  On Thursday, we meet with Samuel Wehn, works for Dave Parquet, 
who will tell us how he's permitted power plants in CA.  We'll ask for 
suggestions on local law & engineering firms, plus see what Sam can do to 
help us.

Any instructions?  If not, I'll proceed as planned.

Kurt

Kurt, 

I agree with Eric.   California is very dangerous right now and we would need 
something very real to bring this to his attention.  Steve Kean  really liked 
the idea but only after we were ready to rock and roll.

Kurt,

I spoke to Ken roughly a month ago regarding our desire to have a terminal on 
the west coast.  His initial impression was that given the climate there for 
new build asset approvals this would be extremely difficult.  He preferred 
the Mexico import idea.  Before we ask Ken to get involved I think we need at 
least a skeleton of a project.

Mike/Eric,

Jody Crook & I met this afternoon with Robert Neustadter to review Socal 
storage tariffs.  Robert explained that he had been working flat out to 
prepare materials for Ken Lay who left this morning with Jeff Dasovich to 
meet with senior government officials in California to discuss solutions to 
the energy crisis.

Might be an opportunity to drop the message that we are working on LNG 
solutions and hope to get the politicians support when we make definitive 
proposals?

Pls provide Ono-san in Tokyo with Mike's travel details so that we can 
arrange.

Mike:  We are putting together  a presentation based on the discussion we had 
during our call the other day.  This would be our outline (and vision) for 
our interactive web site and how we plan to take reg/gov affairs online as 
well as some other initiatives.  We will be able to get you  a draft of this 
presentation before you arrive in Tokyo.  We will also look into activities 
for the weekend.

Joe

Joe, 

I am looking forward to the upcoming trip.  

Everything is all set for Korea but what do you suggest as an agenda for my 
two days in Tokyo?  Also are there some presentations or items that i could 
review before I arrive that you believe might be helpful?  I will also be 
there over a weekend, I would like to do some site seeing on Sat and Sunday 
(my flight to Korea leaves on Sunday late afternoon).  I would appreciate 
some suggestions and I will need a guide, could you have someone arrange it 
for me?

Thanks, and Cathy will co-ordinate everything.

Mike

Attached for your reference and commentary is a first draft of a contact list 
to assist in communication of our key efforts globally.  Please make any 
additions, changes (and/or corrections) that you believe are appropriate and 
return to my office for update and distribution.  The goal is not to list out 
everyone working on a project or business but to include a couple of players 
if someone needs information about how this could apply to their business.

Thanks,

As you probably know, the Western Hemisphere A&A PRC will be held in Houston 
on July 19th.  Each member of the PRC committee will represent 15 to 17 
analysts that have been randomly assigned. I've been selected as a member of 
the Analyst PRC Committee representing participants that are under your 
direct supervision.  As a PRC rep, I will continue to represent the assigned 
Analysts (see list below) during their entire tenure with the Analyst Program.

Thus, I need your help in supplying me performance information for these 
candidates (including pre-ratings if available) and recommendations for 
promotion if he or she is eligible.  In addition, for those of you based out 
of Houston I'd like to meet with each of you individually (15 or 20 minutes 
should be enough) during the 17th and the 18th of July (if you are not based 
out of Houston or you'll be out of town during those days, we can certainly 
do it over the phone the week of the 10th.
I'm based out of Sao Paulo (in transition from Buenos Aires) and I'll be 
landing in Houston the morning of the 17th, so I'll be ready to begin these 
short meetings by 11am on the 17th.  I would very much appreciate if you can 
indicate your time preference for those two days. 

FYI, the following is the list of participants that I'll be representing in 
the July 19th PRC meeting:

Analyst Name    Supervisor
Ahanchian, Amir Cyrus    Humphrey, Gene
Allen, Margaret     Palmer, Mark
Ashmore, Garrett    Cox, David    
Benien, Michael     Moscoso, Michael
Black, Robin     Lewis, James
Cerny, Ward     Sethu, Vijay
Chenoweth, Christopher    Lewis, James
Falcone, Daniel     Moscoso, Michael
Ferrara, Julie     McConnell, Michael
Hausinger, Sharon    Vanderhorst, Barend
Hernandez Veiga, Alejandro   Gutierrez, Hector
Hoff, Jonathan     House, John
Jachimiak, Matthew    Lewis, William
Mena, Luis     Leibert, Richard
O'Malley, Justin     Pittenger, Cathy
Scarborough, John    Courtney, Mark
Vegalara, Mateo    Thomsen, Jon

Please call me at 5511-5503-1397 in Sao Paulo or at 5411-4891-3600 in Buenos 
Aires.  It will be of enormous help if you can let us know the name and 
telephone number of your assistants so Marianne Arake (Sao Paulo 
5511-5503-1197) and/or Nadia Rodriguez (Buenos Aires 5411-4891-3644) can 
follow up on the schedule in Houston.

Thanks for your co-operation.

Fede

Allan,
Thanks, I'll add them to the list.  I would appreciate a self appraisal 
feedback form on yourself with your list of accomplishments to date.  (I know 
it is hard to put together when you've been here for as long as you have).

Mike,

I am sorry to hear that you are under the weather - please let me know if 
there is any support I can provide you.  On another topic - would you please 
add the following people to my list of reviewers (Robert Jones, Jay 
Fitzgerald, Steve Horn, Philipe Bibi, Louise Kitchen, Drew Ries, Ellen 
Fowler, Larry Isso, Fred Kelly).  I am afraid that my list was approved 
before I was able to add any of the above people.

Thanks

Allan Sommer

John,

Rick Bergsieker is the key here.  He can certainly direct you to the right 
people or others on his staff to help from Abu Dabai.

Kurt, 

I agree with Eric.   California is very dangerous right now and we would need 
something very real to bring this to his attention.  Steve Kean  really liked 
the idea but only after we were ready to rock and roll.

Kurt,

I spoke to Ken roughly a month ago regarding our desire to have a terminal on 
the west coast.  His initial impression was that given the climate there for 
new build asset approvals this would be extremely difficult.  He preferred 
the Mexico import idea.  Before we ask Ken to get involved I think we need at 
least a skeleton of a project.

Mike/Eric,

Jody Crook & I met this afternoon with Robert Neustadter to review Socal 
storage tariffs.  Robert explained that he had been working flat out to 
prepare materials for Ken Lay who left this morning with Jeff Dasovich to 
meet with senior government officials in California to discuss solutions to 
the energy crisis.

Might be an opportunity to drop the message that we are working on LNG 
solutions and hope to get the politicians support when we make definitive 
proposals?

Kurt

Chris,

Hello from Houston.  I really enjoyed meeting with you last Saturday at your 
gallery.  Your collection of work is very impressive.

I have not received your digital pictures that you were putting together but 
I did talk with my wife about the Bonnard.  The Bonnard is my first choice of 
all the pieces we discussed.  I found an illustration of it on the net (from 
another gallery) and she liked (although - not as much as me).  I am prepared 
to purchase a Bonnard and the Radiator is my first choice.  I would like to 
establish a relationship and do business with your gallery and would like to 
know what is your best price for the piece.  I will not shop the price around 
and will make a quick decision with a credit card number.   When I get your 
response and if it is competitive, I'll confirm the purchase when I pick up 
the email.

Thanks,
Mike McConnell

PS - I will hold off on the others for now and when you send me the pictures 
I will show them to my wife for consideration.  I am considering the Mary 
Cassat as a gift for her.

Joe,

As we review all the options for Enron Japan (people and commodity/business 
plays), we would like to see how you think it should be organized to 
facilitate growth and have the biggest impact.  When you get a chance to 
examine the EGM information and get your thoughts together, lets us know your 
views and your view of the best way forward.  We have everyone thinking about 
it and we are solidifying our own thoughts as well.

It will help with Morten Erik as well.

Thanks,
Mike

Morten Erik,

Thanks for the email.  I thought it was very thorough and hits all the main 
points that we are thinking about right now.  Jeff and I are very bullish on 
the opportunities in Japan are just now focusing on the specifics.  I believe 
that will also drive the structure.  You should have received an EGM overview 
yesterday and it will be an excellent brief on what we are doing and our 
general direction.  I am very interested in having both you and Joe look at 
that and provide feedback on the opportunities in Japan.  
 
We can talk about all of your issues later, when we are more prepared, but on 
the PRC issue, the key is not simply P&L but on transactions and growing the 
business.   I believe that these businesses with proper focus and dedication 
can grow quickly and show success even though the margins may be small.

I am glad that you are coming over and also touring Enron Europe and ENA.  It 
will help you make a better decision and we will have all of this clarified 
in the mean time.  Jeff and I will be talking about some of these points 
tomorrow as well.

Thanks,
Mike

Jeff, 

FYI.  This is an excellent email and one that addresses all the issues we 
need to make decisions on.  Lets discuss because I have some views but am 
very open to others especially when I don't really know (first hand) what 
oppts really look like there.  We need to address quickly.

Hello Mike, 

I tried to call you several times yesterday but you were busy all the time. 
The reason why I called is that I have some questions that I will like your 
input on before I take a decision. I will try to call you later today but 
here are some of the questions.

You and Jeff talks about a senior position for me. What do you mean by that 
and what will Joe's position be. Will he still be the "president" or will he 
take a more active role on the origination side. What will Jeremy's role be. 
Today he does all these senior structuring deals with EGM products.

Focus. There are very many commodities to look at here but since we have 
limited resources at this stage we need some focus in the beginning. If we 
look at everything at once - nothing will happen.

There are two areas that looks "easy" to start with. Softs and Liquids. How 
willing are EGM to focus on these in the beginning. The reason for I call 
these areas "easy" is that there are big and very liquid liquids and soft 
markets here and it therefore will possible to do transactions early to get 
some momentum in the business. The other markets have large potential but 
will take much longer time to develop. I look at Equity/FX/Interest as 
something Darren will continue focus on.

When some of these markets start to develop and we will have some marketing 
activities/trading going on where will the books probably be and to whom will 
we report. If we do Softs will it be to Gary or will it be to Jeff. How will 
it be integrated. I have no problem with say reporting liquids etc to John 
Nowlan, Softs to Gary, weather to Mark. I think this will be a good solution 
because it will force them to follow us up and it will be easier to 
communicate strategies back and forth etc. The situation today on weather is 
something that I do not like. We have the book, but we do not have any real 
support from Houston or real responsibility. If that is the situation we will 
soon have a lot of problems. It is not a secret within Enron that the 
Singapore oil situation, coal in Asia/Australia and the weather in 
Scandinavia/Europe are not optimal. For me to take a decision I will need to 
know that there are support and willingness from all the heads of EGMs 
different commodities for developing the possibilities in this region, not 
only from you and Jeff. I do not want to use all my time fighting internal 
battles, but I know that it will be hard work to make a business grow.

Staff. In my power trading group today I have 2 managers and 9 AAs. The 
managers + 2 Asso are what I call marketing guys and the rest are analysts 
(some with trading potential). We have no one with trading background in EGM 
products so that need to be recruited. At the same time many of these AAs 
have started within the last 6 months so they are not fully Enronized so it 
would be a good idea to send over some AAs or managers to teach people models 
etc. 

You mentioned Singapore in the TC, what will happen with them?

How does EGM reward people for starting up businesses. It was almost 
impossible to get someone to help me building up the power here (both London 
and Houston). People, especially not traders, do not want to leave a 
profitable book or origination activities. Quite many got the feedback in 
last PRC that they need a number to their name, both P&L and number of 
originated deals, so they did not dare to leave. How will that be handled 
here?

I think my main strength is trading, and I prefer to do trading, but I have 
quite good origination skills. Iknow that in a start up process you need to 
do both and I am more than willing to do that. 

This was a lot of questions but to get some feedback on them are necessary 
for me to take a decision. I will probably go to London on Wednesday and 
Thursday next week to speak with Sherriff etc. I will try to call you later 
today

Regards

Morten Erik

Richard,

I sent your info on to my direct reports for evaluation.  I've also sent on 
to others as well.  If there is an interest, you will be hearing from us.

Good luck,
Mike

David,

Thanks for the email.  It did cause an interesting conversation without 
knowing what the situation was.  We all have very open relationships around 
here (it is why we are so successful as a company).  Please don't think twice 
about responding to Greg or any senior manager on an issue - but he would 
also have no issue with your response being cc back to Jeff and/or myself at 
the same time.

Thanks,
Mike

PS;  we are all thinking about P+ constantly.

I would like to invite you and a guest to join me for the annual Juvenile

Thanks for the response.

I found a beautiful Bonnard in London and NY.  I will be buying in next day 
or two.  Asking price is $9,500.  I will keep the Lautrecs in mind.  I think 
one is in my future - next.  I don't think I'll be buying one for a few 
months.

I'll get back to you.

Good morning, Mike.  What time is the meeting?

Rosie

Ken,

Per my voicemail, we are having an all employee meeting on next Monday at the 
Hyatt Regency.  The purpose of this meeting is to pull everyone together for 
an update on EGM and a brief presentation from all the business units within 
EGM.  This includes about 1 hour of business and then drinks and food - we 
expect about 500 people.  

We have made a lot of progress on changing the nature and profitability of 
these businesses and we want to make sure everyone sees just how far we have 
come in a few months.  

I believe they will be motivated to see the growth and profitability.  We had 
a record Q1 with $100 million of gross margin.  That was 50% of what they 
made in all of 2000.  Combined with the fact that in December of 2000 alone 
we made $87 million in gross margin, I believe it will have a big impact.

If you could attend the meeting even for a few minutes it would go a long way 
in helping us drive our other point which is that the EGM businesses are now 
core to Enron and has the attention of both you and Jeff.

Thanks for considering this and let me know if you need any other information 
or assistance.

Mike 

Cindy,

Attached is a list of your rec and del points on 27161 as of Nov 1, 2001.

Great luck running the search firm,

Mark

Mark,

"Godav" to you too. And great to hear from you again.

Yes, certainly the world has changed since we last met. As it turned out I was 
in the Enron building in London when it all happened on Sep 11. And to all of 
us in London, that moment has been as defining as it has been to you in the 
States. 

- With one exception: We have had terrorism here for a very long time. So much 
so that I have learned to tell the difference between the sounds of an IRA 
semtex bomb and a Palestinian fertiliser one...

And life goes on. I keep reminding everybody how many people die in the traffic 
every day, and that I shall have to go someday anyway. So even though London 
probably is high on the hit list, I have not changed my lifestyle significantly.

Now it looks like EBS definitively is closing down in Europe. Personally if 
find it a shame, since I rather valued the people in the group, but probably it 
was inevitable.

But I am pleased that you have moved into the Oil and Gas part of Enron. 
Whatever the current woes of Enron Corp, that sector is doing fine as a whole.

My own stray into telecomms components did not last long. I was out after 3 
months on the back of completely collapsing sales in the US.

Now I have ventured into Executive Search, where I am working as COO for a 
small group with 70 staff in 10 countries. I am not "hunting" myself, but 
rather involved in corporate issues such as reporting contracts and business 
development. We are hoping to place some Eastern European engineers into a 
Houston company before long, but I am not expecting to have to go there for 
some time to come.

You may notice that I am sending this e-mail from a new address. I am trying to 
face out the old one, since it has caused me endless problems. So in future 
please use the new one: martin@heelas-joergensen.com (heelas being my wife's 
maiden name).

I am very pleased to hear that you are well, but would rather hope that you 
could find an excuse to come to London, even if your pipelines do not reach 
that far...

All the best,

Martin

Howdy Heidi,

Well, your name is still on the list so that is good.  I hope all is well with you and your hubby.

Awfully weird times here in the home office.  Really strange vibes all over the building...people wondering about their jobs, sad about their retirement accounts and wonderment about how a proud (maybe too proud) Fortune 10 company could go down in ~3 weeks.  I guess it is the same or similar there too.

The pipeline group is working out.  I really like the people and am starting to get comfortable with the business and my regulated surroundings.

Please respond and let me know what you are up to and how you are doing.  I'm so sorry we didn't hook up when you were in town last time.

Mark

Thanks Eric, I'll call the guy.  If I need any more information, I'll let you know.  Thanks also for doing this so quickly.

Mark

Pipeline: The proposed location would connect to TW's Leedy Lateral, this gas goes to Ivanhoe Dehy. then routes to Bushton processing.  All of our lines are mainlines; however, it is fair to say that the Leedy Lateral gas quality can be compared to that of gathering gas quality (dehydration is required).  The capacity at the Ivanhoe dehy needs to be checked to see if additional capacity would be available for the quantity that you have in mind.

Pressure:  MAOP of Leedy Lateral varies from 1125 to 1200 psi.  Operating pressures in the past year have been between 650 and 950 psig.

Cost: Approximate 4 on 16 hot tap costs would be between $60-75K.  We can price measuring/regulating facilities when expected volume is provided to Planning.

Eric, Perry, Can one of you take this one and respond to Mark. Mark needs the answer back by tommorrow.  Thanks Dennis

Dennis,
Please have someone look at the following, including my request at the bottom.

Thanks,
Mark

Questions

What would it cost?
Is it a Mainline or Gathering line that runs right by this well?
What is the TW line pressure?

Can I get an answer to the last 2 questions pretty quickly (by Wednesday Afternoon)?  The cost can come later.

Thanks,

We'll get that for you.  We are awaiting a call back from Questar to confirm out days in the data room.  This coming week looks doubtful.  We'll be in touch.

Mark

Could either of you provide an address of the location of the data room?

Thanks, LD

Kim, Mark listed below are the ETS Operations employees that will participate in the Southern Trails due diligence October 29th and 30th in Salt Lake City, Utah.

	L.D. Stephens - Team Leader/Operations
	Larry Campbell - Environmental
	???????? - ROW (To be determined by Johnny McGee and communicated directly to you)
	Mike Ames - Pipeline Safety

As discussed, these employees will arrive in Salt Lake, Sunday evening, October 28th prepared to go to the data room Monday 29th and Tuesday 30th.  They will return to their respective home locations Wednesday morning, October 31st.

Please provide a Questar contact person and address of the data room.  If you could also provide the name of a hotel close to the data room, it would be appreciated.
Names of other Enron parties participating in the due diligence and where they are staying would be helpful.  Any specific limitations imposed upon the data room review
should be communicated as soon as possible.

Morris Brassfield (Operations Support) and Jerry Martin (E&C) have determined that it is not necessary for them to have personnel attend the data room.  The operations team will retrieve as much information as possible to support their needs.  It was also my understanding no one from Planning and System Optimization would participate.

As I will be out of town the rest of the week, please communicate directly with these individuals via e mail.  If you need to need to contact me, I can be reached at 713-303-2764.

Monday night and Tuesday?  Craig got a special deal to play golf for half price at a nice course in San Antonio.  I told him yes but I needed to check with you.  I moved our Hoffman meeting back to 5:00 on Tuesday.   I still am committed to play golf on Wednesday as well.  Let me know if this interferes with any plans or if you don't think you'll be seeing enough of me.

Dennis,

To follow up from our meeting today, please provide the delivery report that includes the following:

WHAT	Total volumes (by month) delivered to primary delivery points versus alternate delivery points
WHEN	For the period of 5/00 thru 10/31
WHERE	For all delivery points West of Thoreau (including: Calif pool, Window Rock, PGE/Mojave Topock and SOCAL Needles)
WHO	Send to William Rapp (legal), Kim Watson and myself

This information will be used to respond to criticism by the California PUC.  I believe that Bill Rapp is wanting to respond by early Wednesday so if he could get these numbers by end of day Monday, I'm sure he'd appreciate it.

Thanks for your help,

	Mark: The following are certain Right-of-Way needs and/or questions.

	1. Are the ROW records located in Salt Lake City or Long Beach, CA?
	
	2. Does Questar have a ROW data base? If so, can they prepare a report, which would identify product limitation (i.e. Crude Oil specific), multiple line rights, pipeline size limitations, assignability, consent, etc.

	3. An Encroachment report.

	4. A Rental/Term report.

	5. A report identifying any known curative problems.

	6. Can they identify whether the following problems that existed in 1997 have been cured?
		
		a. BLM issues RE: Contract Purchasers vs. Land Patents
		b. Pipeline lies outside of defined R/W in certain locations
		c. Railroad licenses sold to municipal entities that may have required new terms and rental amounts
		d. Relocations
			i. Anaheim Hills
			ii. Morongo Indian Tribe (possible Union Pacific Railroad R/W longitudinal occupation vs. private)
		e. Franchise Agreements

	7. Will new pipe be required for connection of Four Corners pipeline to existing Transwestern pipeline system? If so, would this be across the Fort Mohave Indian Reservation in Mohave County, AZ?

	It is my understanding that this due diligence will not involve the balance of Arizona, which includes the Navajos', Hopis' and the Bennett Freeze area (disputed tribal lands). Is this correct?	 [McConnell, Mark]  YES, the West Leg only includes California. 

It just goes to show.... If you just keep winning, things usually work out.  Good luck at Texas Stadium.

Debbie,

I can't remember if I responded to you....I took vacation all last week.

Things are fine in my little corner (as good as can be expected).  A bit sad for a lot of other people around here.

As soon as I get caught up, I'll give you a call.

GO GET 'EM

I really can't believe things happened the way they did.  I thought everything was set for you guys to get another opportunity for the national championship.  I also thought the case for Roy Williams to win the Heisman would become really strong.  I didn't get to watch the OU-OSU game, but I received about 30 phone calls the last two minutes of the game.

I am excited that some breaks have gone our way, but it will be difficult to beat CU twice in one season.  Also, I am not sure that I want to ever play Miami after seeing them the last two weeks.

Don't be too upset, you guys are going to be tough next year and you are riding a two year win streak on us right now....(11-0 would sound a lot better than 10-1).

I'll be heading to Dallas early Saturday morning.  

Take care,
Zac

Marissa,

Hey!  Just thinking about you.  I hope all is well out west.  Things here are sure interesting.  You should be very happy that you are not still here going through this stuff.  I feel pretty fortunate to be in the pipeline group.  This group is pretty lean so hopefully, there won't be many cuts (although I am the new boy in the group).  Many of the other groups are getting pretty anxious, including our former bunch.  We should find out pretty soon.

I was in Salt Lake City a couple of weeks ago and I called Rhondo.  He is working for the IOC and is in charge of all the fund raising for the Olympic charities.  It seems to be right up his ally.  He asked me to tell you hello.

Sarah and I took vacation last week.  I played golf in San Antonio (La Cantarra - in case Will is wondering - excellent course) and also played here in Houston with Frank, Marc and Bradford Brooks.  It was fun.

Please write back and let me know how you are doing.  How's the job, How's Will, How's LA, How was Thanksgiving...many questions.

Attached is the confidentiality agreement that we are signing with Aquila.  It was originated out of our legal group but Aquila added:

	2. 	(iv)
	7.  	"for a period of two years."

I would like to use it for Reliant too.  Any problem with that?  Please let me know.

The following 2 scenarios were run and meet our return requirements.  The total volume of 306 comes from the 240 suggested starting volumes and the additional volumes come from expiring El Paso/MGI transportation agreements.

_______________________________

1)  306 total volume

240 @ $.2479 for yrs 1-15
26 @ $.2479 for yrs 3-15
40 @ $.2479 for yrs 4-15

2)  306 total volume

240 @ $.2600 for yrs 1-15
26 @ $.1883 for yrs 3-15
40 @ $.1883 for yrs 4-15
_______________________________

We would suggest Showing PEMEX either scenario but using the round numbers of $.25 (instead of $.2479) for scenario 1 and $.19 (instead of $.1883) for scenario 2.

Please let me know if you have a preference.  We would like to fax one of these scenarios to Jorge @ 3:00 today so that they can digest it and use it for a starting point for tomorrow's meeting.

Everyone,

Looking for a volunteer to market TW to this new power plant so that they will take the supplies off our pipe.  Any takers?

Kim.

Supplies have not been lined up as of yet.  They are waiting to get farther along on the permits.

TK

TK, just checking to see if you have heard who may be supplying the supply for this plant?

Thanks, Kim.

Can we contact them to find out about how they plan to get their gas supply? I know Stan will ask me about this one.

Regent Energy in Pact to Develop 500 MW Plant 
Regent Energy recently executed a contract with Millennium Energy Ventures, a private Houston-based venture capital and project development company, to develop an electric plant with 500 MW generating capacity on Regent's Horseshoe Gallup lease in San Juan County, NM. 
Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at $250 million. 
Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. 
Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. 
MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, "We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies." 
Regent President John Ehrman said, "The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some $1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease." 
The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. 
Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease. 

Mr. Joergensen,

A big "Howdy" from your Texas friend.  

I was so glad to get your voice message the other day (week).  It is always nice to pick up a voicemail and have it turn out to be a colleague from the not so distant past.  I hope you and your family are doing well.

As EBS changed direction, I did as well.  I decided to get back to my roots in the gas and gas asset business.  I looked inside of Enron and also with some outside companies and decided to work with Transwestern pipeline (an Enron company).  I've been here for about a month and all is well.  The people here are very nice and very genuine (just like my old friends from London).  It is weird to actually have a product to sell - if you know what I mean.  I think I'll like it but I'm already missing my travels in your neck of the woods.  Also, I'm home so much now, my wife doesn't know what to do with me.

I'm still saddened by the demised of our Blockbuster/VOD deal.  It was a great concept and it worked.  Oh well.  We'll see it someday, I'm just not sure who is going to win the race on getting it to the public in bulk.

Christian sent an email to me and he seems to be doing fine, loving Rio but still looking for a job.  Speaking of that, I hope your job is going well and as secure as it can be in today's climate.

It is a strange time here in America.  The terrorist attacks, the retaliation in Afghanistan and the constant update on new discoveries of the spread of Anthrax are constantly being talked about and on every news channel.  It is amazing how a handful of people can create such sadness and effect the world in so many ways.  There is no doubt that the spirit of the people will prevail.

Take care Martin.  It was great to hear your voice.

When will we be creating the due diligence team?	

The LOI with a nonbinding bid referencing our interest in their West Leg of the Southern Trail Pipeline was faxed to Questar yesterday .  We are confident that we will be invited to the data room to perform due diligence.  We anticipate that this will occur at the end of this month.  As soon as we know the exact date, we will advise all of those involved.

We will be assembling the due diligence team this week and then we will meet to create a plan for the process while we have access to the data room.

We'll be in touch as the details unfold.  In the mean time, if you have any questions, please feel free to call Kim Watson or myself.

I hope you have enjoyed your time working in Europe as much as I did.  I have recently made a switch and I left the broadband group and joined the Transwestern Pipeline Marketing team.

I'll talk to you later,

Mark

Mark & Scott,

As there has been significant changes at Enron over the last few months, I
wanted to revisit employment opportunities at Enron.  With change comes
opportunity and I hope both of you have been able to adequately capitalize.

My resume has been updated to reflect the work I have completed this year.
As for my immediate schedule, I will be engaged in a consultancy assignment
in Europe until November 9, 2001.  Thereafter, my schedule appears to be
open.  I am hopeful we will be able to talk again soon.

This is Planning's response to your request of 10/10/2001 regarding two new gas wells hook up into TW's system.
The two wells were as follows:

SE/4 of Section 20- 23S-27E Eddy County, NM 

This well is located near Sid Richardson gathering system and approximately 4.4 miles to the suction side of the TW- Keystone Compressor Station.
The suction pressure at Keystone is 525-575 psig.
Are they interested to build up to 4.5 miles of pipe to TW? If they are what is pressure/maximum volume that this well can produce?

Center of Section 22-Block B-3 PSL Winkler County Texas

This well is located approximately .3-.5 mile to TW-Crawford 16" lateral. The Crawford lateral line pressure is 680-720 psig.
Can this well meet TW's line pressure ? what is the maximum flow rate on this well?

Please share this information with your customer and let me know about your response on this project? 

   
Mansoor

Mansoor, Please proceed with Mark's request. Thanks Dennis

I am looking to see if TWPL is close to the two wells that are about to drilled. I work with Lori Vining at Beacon Petroleum and I am trying to find Pipelines in the area.
The areas are:
Eddy County, New Mexico - SE/4 of SECT 20  23S-27E.
Winkler County, Texas - Center of SECT 22 - B3 Public School Land
I went out to the Point catalog and looked up the counties to see what was in the area and found some information, but I was just wanting to make sure I get it right.
I would appreciate any help.

Yeah,  Baylor this weekend and Nebraska next.  This Baylor game is coming at the right time.  Good luck with Colorado.  

I think he is probably making the right call; however, y'all are rolling right now and haven't lost this year.  I'm not sure it is wise to tweak the machine now....then again, you can't argue with a coach on a 19 game winning streak.

Is the OU/NU game next weekend?

Man I hear you.  I have faith in Stoops but I am a little worried.  On the other hand, our offense certainly hasn't dominated anyone this year.  It is a question of what to go with; productive with mistakes or less productive and fewer mistakes.

Be careful with this...I think you saw what can happen last year with us.

Erica,

It sounds like you have the right attitude about the situation (I wouldn't have guessed otherwise).  The fun aspect of it is that you can do whatever you want.  Sometimes the hard thing is figuring out what that is.  I truly wish you the best and I certainly want to know where you place yourself.

Oh, I heard from Andy.  They have settled in Denver and he is still looking for a job but he may do some contract work for Enron.  I'm not sure how definite it is or what he'll be doing.  I'll let you know what I find out.

University of Texas police have smashed a suspected terrorist cell. 
Three terrorists, Bin Losin, Bin Whinin, and Bin Cryin were apprehended 
on the UT campus shortly after the defeat of the Longhorn football team
by the University of Oklahoma Sooners. University police warn a fourth 
terrorist, Bin Winnin, is still at large. However, sources within 
the department concede that Winnin would be very conspicuous on the UT
campus and suspect he has fled to the campus of Oklahoma University.

FERC EXTENDS INVESTIGATION OF NEGOTIATED RATE AGREEMENTS BETWEEN PG&E GAS T=
RANSMISSION NORTHWEST AND SHIPPERS, LOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF MARKET MANIPULA=
TION

09/27/2001=20
Foster Natural Gas Report=20
Page 7=20
(c) Copyright 2001, Foster Associates, Inc.=20
FERC issued an order in mid-month September that set for hearing certain co=
nsolidated proceedings involving several negotiated rate transactions betwe=
en PG&E Gas Transmission, Northwest Corporation (RP99-518) and various ship=
pers. The Commission believes closer scrutiny is called for because these t=
ransactions appear to provide the opportunity to impose rates many multiple=
s in excess of maximum approved tariff rates.=20
The Commission had issued a suspension order in each proceeding that, among=
 other things, directed GTN to explain (1) how it had the firm capacity ava=
ilable to move gas under the transactions in these proceedings, and (2) why=
 its entering into the subject negotiated service agreements did not violat=
e regulations and policy regarding firm transportation service and negotiat=
ed rate agreements. The new expedited hearing procedures are intended to fu=
rther explore these matters. Pending the outcome, GTN must revise both its =
tariff and capacity availability postings to provide for clear identificati=
on of operational capacity; and must post and contract operational capacity=
 on each day of its availability (i.e., on a day-to-day basis), unless it c=
an demonstrate such capacity will be available for some longer period of ti=
me.=20
Questions Same as Those Addressed to Transwestern Earlier=20
FERC's concerns in this case are remarkably similar to FTS-1 deals recently=
 arranged by Transwestern Pipeline Co. (RP97-288) that are now the subject =
of an expedited hearing and investigation. Beginning in January 2001, Trans=
western made a series of eight filings implementing FTS-1 negotiated transa=
ctions with five shippers. The filings were accepted and suspended, subject=
 to conditions, by orders issued March 2 and 28 and April 27. Staff issued =
data requests to Transwestern , Sempra and Richardson. In the March 28 orde=
r, FERC also directed Transwestern to show cause why its negotiated rate tr=
ansactions did not violate the regulations. Transwestern answered that the =
negotiated rate contracts at issue, and any others for that matter, would n=
ot have been any less firm or provided a lower quality of service had shipp=
ers elected, instead, to pay the recourse rate. Underlying these transactio=
ns, Transwestern said, is capacity that becomes available only for a short =
time.=20
In July the Commissioners voted to establish the hearing to further explore=
 Transwestern 's negotiated transactions that tied rates to gas spot market=
 price differentials between the California border and producing basins in =
New Mexico and West Texas. For service to the border, Sempra Energy Trading=
 Corp., Richardson Products Co., BP Energy Co., Astra Power LLC and Reliant=
 Energy Services elected to pay Transwestern negotiated rates as high as $2=
7/MMBtu compared to a maximum FTS-1 (recourse) rate of 38 cents/MMBtu, excl=
uding surcharges and fuel.=20
In Transwestern 's case, the Commission expressed the belief that closer sc=
rutiny of transactions that provide the opportunity to impose rates many mu=
ltiples in excess of maximum approved tariff rates is necessary: "Did Trans=
western withhold capacity that otherwise could have been made available und=
er recourse service in order to make the capacity available under negotiate=
d rate charges at substantially higher rates?" (See REPORT NO. 2346, pp9-10=
.)=20
Background=20
Beginning in March 2001, GTN made a series of separate filings pursuant to =
its rights to implement various negotiated rate transactions under its FTS-=
1 Rate Schedule with (1) Sempra, (2) Dynegy Marketing and Trade, (3) Relian=
t Energy Services Canada Ltd., (4) Western Gas Resources (Western), (5) Ens=
erco Energy, Inc., (6) Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, L.P. , (7) BP Ener=
gy Co., and (8) CEG Energy Options, Inc.. The filings were accepted and sus=
pended, subject to further proceedings by orders issued on 3/28/01, 5/1/01,=
 5/31/01, and 6/29/01. The transactions established transportation rates ti=
ed to natural gas spot market price differentials between the Northwest Pip=
eline interconnection at Stanfield, Oregon and the Pacific Gas and Electric=
 Co. and Tuscarora Gas Transmission Co. interconnection at Malin, on the Or=
egon-California border.=20
According to the data collected by FERC, the negotiated rate transactions w=
ould yield average daily transportation rates many multiples of the maximum=
 FTS-1 rate (approximately $0.155/MMBtu, Stanfield to Malin), exclusive of =
surcharges and fuel, based on the publicly reported price differentials at =
the contract receipt and delivery points during the term of the contracts. =
The Commission initiated additional review procedures to further explore qu=
estions regarding conditions under which operational transportation capacit=
y may be available on the GTN system.=20
GTN has already told the Commission that all negotiated rate shippers knew =
service was available at the recourse rate, but that these shippers chose t=
o structure the pricing of their contracts in this distinct fashion anyway.=
 Further, GTN insists the subject firm capacity was posted as available on =
the company's website and EBB, consistent with the Commission's regulations=
.=20
Pursuant to the suspension order, FERC received the following information:=
=20
- Sempra clarified that 10,000 MMBtu/d of its 20,000 MMBtu/d total capacity=
 arrangement with GTN was subscribed at the FTS-1 rate. But GTN insists Sem=
pra requested firm backhaul service with the intent of reversing the path. =
Under the negotiated alternative, Sempra was persuaded it would not have to=
 pay reservation charges on the full MDQ for a secondary, lower priority re=
verse path service. In its response, Sempra asserted it wanted to use the c=
apacity on a secondary basis and thus chose to negotiate a rate structure t=
hat would best reflect its price risk profile to account for the fact that =
the capacity may not be available every day. Further, Sempra stated that th=
e gas transported was sold into the daily markets at Malin, PG&E's citygate=
, or the Southern California border market.=20
- Dynegy's rationale for choosing a rate formula rather than the FTS-1 reco=
urse rate was to gain additional value from the capacity. GTN had suggested=
 it could enter into a negotiated agreement based on the daily index-to-ind=
ex spread because the Stanfield-Malin spread, less fuel, did not cover the =
cost of the FTS-1 recourse rate. Based on GTN's information, Dynegy believe=
d the price spread was expected to widen and thereby would give it "a prici=
ng opportunity."=20
- According to Western, it initially sought 20,000 MMBtu/d of capacity at t=
he FTS-1 recourse rate, but GTN's response did not allow for the total volu=
me to be shipped at that rate. Instead, GTN proposed and Western accepted a=
nother price option: 10,000 MMBtu/d at the FTS-1 Recourse Rate and 10,000 M=
MBtu/d at the Negotiated Gas Daily Index Rate.=20
- Neither Reliant nor Enserco filed a response to the Commission's 5/1/01 o=
rder.=20
- Mirant cited three reasons for choosing the monthly index spread rather t=
han the recourse rate: 1) the index spread was easily hedged, 2) at the tim=
e the market spread was more desirable, and 3) reduction of market risk. Mi=
rant believed there were no other practical options to move gas from Stanfi=
eld to Malin.=20
- GTN established four negotiated rate agreements with two different shippe=
rs: BP Energy and CEG Energy. The BP Energy agreement was accepted as propo=
sed, but FERC accepted and suspended the CEG Energy agreements subject to r=
efund and further information. Similar to the other parties, CEG Energy sta=
ted that it chose a negotiated rate rather than the recourse rate because i=
t believed the index spread was less expensive than the FTS-1 recourse rate=
.=20
FERC Has Serious Concerns=20
According to the September 13 order, GTN's negotiated rate transactions und=
er investigation "present several serious concerns." Even with the addition=
al information in hand, the Commission concludes that the filings raise man=
y issues that need to be investigated further. Accordingly, an expedited he=
aring should explore issues including, but not limited to: whether the tran=
sportation capacity was advertised and awarded in an accurate and fair mann=
er consistent with GTN's tariff; whether the rates negotiated by GTN were t=
he product of an exercise of market power (i.e., did GTN withhold capacity =
that otherwise could have been made available under recourse service just t=
o make the capacity available under negotiated higher rates); why the shipp=
ers agreed to these rates when lower recourse rates should have been availa=
ble; and, lastly, whether the practice of improving a shipper's standing in=
 the scheduling process by selling firm transportation to undesirable prima=
ry points so an alternative point can be nominated is discriminatory agains=
t interruptible transportation shippers (since the alternative point is als=
o available on a somewhat best-efforts basis).=20
Since the negotiated rate transactions also raise concerns regarding GTN's =
posting procedures and its use of firm service contracts for operational ca=
pacity, the Commission also spelled out the need to require GTN to undertak=
e immediately certain measures to identify more clearly the operational cap=
acity available on the GTN system and the period for which such capacity is=
 awarded.=20
Finally, the Commission discovered discrepancies between GTN and the other =
negotiated parties' representations regarding the capacity quantities avail=
able at the FTS-1 recourse rate. Specifically, FERC's concerns go to the Se=
mpra and Western rate agreements whereby the parties initially desired 20,0=
00 MMBtu/d at the recourse rate but were provided with a combination of rec=
ourse service and a negotiated service. These actions by GTN may reflect th=
e exercise of market power and manipulation of the capacity market, the Com=
mission surmises.

I am looking to see if TWPL is close to the two wells that are about to
drilled. I work with Lori Vining at Beacon Petroleum and I am trying to find
Pipelines in the area.
The areas are:

Eddy County, New Mexico - SE/4 of SECT 20  23S-27E.
Winkler County, Texas - Center of SECT 22 - B3 Public School Land

I went out to the Point catalog and looked up the counties to see what was
in the area and found some information, but I was just wanting to make sure
I get it right.

I would appreciate any help.

Thank you for time,

James,

What do you think?  Can we do the 20 year thing?

Dave,
	Using the numbers we have today and the Pemex volume of 240/day @
$0.25 as we have noted does not get KM to where we would want to be.  I
layered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some of
the gap but we were still short of targets.  I then modified the debt term
to 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported for
that length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion of
the gap.

	However, we are still short of our target and my calculations
indicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lasting
through year 20 to make up the difference.  In the alternative, a rate of
$0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there.  All
in all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we are
looking at.

Mark,
	Could you review from TW's perspective and see if you come up with
numbers in the same ball park?

TK and Mark:  Got a hot potato here.  I hear from Kim via Penny that Mark is handling TW well connections (with Facility Planning I'd guess).  So Mark, you can't say I never gave you anything.  Steve

Steve, would you please help this lady.

Thanks,

TK

I am looking to see if TWPL is close to the two wells that are about to
drilled. I work with Lori Vining at Beacon Petroleum and I am trying to find
Pipelines in the area.
The areas are:

Eddy County, New Mexico - SE/4 of SECT 20  23S-27E.
Winkler County, Texas - Center of SECT 22 - B3 Public School Land

I went out to the Point catalog and looked up the counties to see what was
in the area and found some information, but I was just wanting to make sure
I get it right.

I would appreciate any help.

Thank you for time,

Yeah, what a game.  That 7 - 3 score that held most of the game was a killer on the nerves.  Both Defenses looked very good.  Both offenses looked like they were playing very good defenses.

I do like our coaching staff.  Bob hasn't always had things go his way.  During his first season (7-5) he tried some different type plays and many didn't go his way including a fake field goal in the Independence Bowl that probably cost us the game.  That being said, he has had a pretty good string lately.

Good luck with the rest of the season.

Boomer Sooner,

Mark

Great game.  Until somebody beats y'all, you should be number one as far as I am concerned.  Great play by Roy Williams.  I couldn't believe how poorly both teams ran the football...and for that matter how poor both offenses looked.  I will say that both defenses looked tough.  It was tough to watch the collapse in the final two minutes.

I love our staff, but unfortunately, I think we were outcoached.  That being said, Bob Stoops could be the luckiest coach in the world....everything seems to fall his way.  He is a great coach.

Take care and I guess I am stuck waithing another 363 days.

GO HORNS!
Zac

Zach,

Have a safe trip and don't get in too much trouble tonight.

Good luck to you guys.  I hope the game is a good as the hype.

Again, I can't wait.  It is such a great spectacle.

Robert,

We'll take a look at this too and get back with you.

Mark

Dave,
	Using the numbers we have today and the Pemex volume of 240/day @
$0.25 as we have noted does not get KM to where we would want to be.  I
layered on an additional 5 year commitment on the 240/day to cover some of
the gap but we were still short of targets.  I then modified the debt term
to 20 years which should be acceptable as the project would be supported for
that length by the extended term and that covers an additional portion of
the gap.

	However, we are still short of our target and my calculations
indicate a need to have 22/day @ $0.25 starting in year 3 and lasting
through year 20 to make up the difference.  In the alternative, a rate of
$0.267 with the 20 year term and 20 year debt note also gets us there.  All
in all, neither one is that big of a hill to climb so we know what we are
looking at.

Mark,
	Could you review from TW's perspective and see if you come up with
numbers in the same ball park?

How's it going in Brazil?  I know you are happy to be back.

I transferred out of EBS and got back into the gas business.  I'm working for the pipeline group.  The people here are very nice and I'm glad to be back in this industry.  Although, I must say that I will miss London and working with people like yourself.

I got a message from Martin Joergansen the other day.  Do you happen to know his email address?  Please let me know.

I hope all is well down south.

Jonathan,

Thanks for the email.  I enjoyed the evening in Norman as well.  I also enjoyed the game vs KSU.

Your resume looks very impressive.  I would continue to work through the university and make sure that you get on the interview schedule when we come back up.

I'll hold on to your resume and pass it on to people in the pipeline group that may be looking for an intern.

Best of luck,

Mark

Hello Mr. McConnell,
This is Jonathan Milton at the University of Oklahoma.  I had the pleasure of 
meeting you last Thursday with the JCPenny Leadership program.  I enjoyed 
hearing about your company and I am very excited about the internship 
opportunities Enron offers in sales and marketing.  I have attached a copy of 
my resume and I look forward to hearing from you!

Sounds good.  I was in Norman this last week...recruiting, golf and KSU game (close).  I also picked up my tickets for this weekend.  I don't like thinking about the game, it makes me nervous but that is the fun of it.

By the way, can you tell me the line?  I'm sure you are favored.

Boomer Sooner,
Mark

This game is going to be incredible....I hope.  Both teams looked very good this last weekend.  I am catching a flight to Dallas Friday after lunch.  We should try and grab lunch or coffee sometime this week, just to get a little pregame atmosphere in the office.

GO HORNS!

I have arranged to take off this Friday, so I will be able to attend.  I guess I'll get the directions to the golf course and other details from Weed and Dial.  If the teams are all full, put me on their team.  Otherwise, I'll play with anyone.  My game has gone down the tubes since I started the international work.  I hope to take care of that problem soon.....put me down as a 24 handicap.

I look forward to seeing you and the rest of the guys,

Mark

Jeff,

If you have any problems, let me know.  Otherwise, we'll talk later on how to resolve this.

Thanks man I feel like the old man that I am. I only have 5 years until it 
gets really bad. Hunting was great the dog did great, he tried to attack a 
bull and went tearing through the brush I thought that I would never find

Tiffany told me that you guys taught her how to CALL THE HOGS. Brad

I will check on this, thanks for the info.brad

I was the one that talked to David Behrman. We talked about splitting out the

Greg: I talked to Craig and he wants to bring you back in to meet with Fred 
Lagratsa. You should hear from Fred or Craig sometime soon  to setup a

unless the spread seems way out of line. Brad

Thanks for your help. I hope that you were not offended by my comments the 
other day, they were not directed at you. Brad

Rex: I have an article to fax to you please send me your fax #. I hope all is 
well in Amarillo. Longhorns look good, this weekend will be a good test for 
them. Tiff and the kids are great. Both kids are very excited to be in 
school, lets hope that this enthusiasm last for another 16 years. Brad

YES

Craig: I just noticed that you have me partnered with Les instead of Mills. 
Thanks Brad

Mike: Thanks for the invitation unfortunately I will not be able to attend. 
Brad

Greg: I will not be able to go to lunch with you, dinner is possible. I would

with, I should know soon. I will call you 8/23 to talk about Thurs. If you do 
not hear from me please call me (wk 853-7699, hm 972-1208).

when I went streaking through the RICE campus one late night. The campus 
police told me that they were the only ones with the file and that no one

then i want a map similar to the one john mckay has asap. thanks brad

Brad,

I got a better picture of the delay issue when I talked to Keith this morning.  Apparently, his group has lost their server liscence.  As a  consequence they cannot access their materials.  Keith is doing everything he can that does not require the server, and when they regain access, we will get the map out asap.  In the mean time, I am looking into major interconnects as well as storage facilities.  As of now, I don't have a precise timeline on when the server issue will be resolved.  When it occurs, I'll let you know.

Thanks 

Adam

You guys will love this. brad

Tiff...Love you, Danna
POC ROCKS!!!!!
I am writing this email to express some concern that I have that has
been gnawing at me over the past week.

It is a concern over a feeling that each of us is having.  It's a
feeling of having too much to do.  Too much practice, too much homework,
too much football, too much baseball, too much of everything!

I caught myself recently telling someone about our kids schedules in an
exacerbated way and after completing my sentence it hit me.  What I
realized was that I was complaining about something that was probably
one of the most wonderful "problems" that a parent or child could have.

To have children that have the ability to play sports, the opportunity
to excel in school and have parents that care enough about them to
support all that they do is a true blessing, not a problem.  I am sure
that there are hundreds of thousands of kids in this city alone that
would pay money to trade places with each of us.

I have found a poem that I wanted to share with each of you that I think
says a lot.  To me it says that we should be setting an example for our
kids.  Encouraging their hard work at school and in sports, not
discouraging it through negative comments about having too much to do.
If we all as parents start to "talk-up" school, practice, football,
baseball, etc. about how fun it is and how great it is to be with such a
great group of kids, the results will be amazing!

Little Eyes Upon You

There are little eyes upon you
and they're watching night and day.
There are little ears that quickly
take in every word you say.
There are little hands all eager
to do anything you do;
And a little boy who's dreaming
of the day he'll be like you.

You're the little fellow's idol,
you're the wisest of the wise.
In his little mind about you
no suspicions ever rise.
He believes in you devoutly,
holds all that you say and do;
He will say and do, in your way,
when he's grown up just like you.

There's a wide eyed little fellow
who believes you're always right;
And his eyes are always opened,
an he watches day and night.
Your setting an example
every day in all you do,
For the little boy who's waiting
to grow up to be like you.

Please take a moment to relax your  mind and humble your heart to 
focus on Christ. Allow God, to be the only  person on your mind 
while you read this prayer. If we can take the time to  read long 
jokes, stories, etc., we should give the same respect to this  
prayer. Friends that pray together, stay together. 
Dear Lord, 
I  thank You for this day. I thank You for my being able to see 
and to hear  today.  I'm blessed because You are a forgiving God 
and an  understanding God. You have done so much for me and You 
keep on blessing me.  
Forgive me this day for everything I have done, said or thought 
that was  not pleasing to you. I ask now for Your forgiveness. 
Please keep me safe  from all danger and harm. Help me to start 
this day with a new attitude and  plenty of gratitude. Let me make 
the best of each and every day to clear my  mind so that I can hear 
from You. Please broaden my mind that I can accept  all things. 
Let me not whine and whimper over things I have no control over.  
And when this world closes in on me, let me remember Jesus' example 
-to  slip away and find a quiet place to pray. It's the best response when 
I'm  pushed beyond my limits. I know that when I can't pray, 
You listen to my  heart. Continue to use me to do Your will. 
Continue to bless me that I may  be a blessing to others. 
Keep me strong that I may help the weak. 
Keep  me uplifted that I may have words of encouragement for 
others. 
I pray  for those that are lost and can't find their way. 
I pray for those that are  misjudged and misunderstood. 
I pray for those who don't know You intimately.  
I pray for those that will delete this without sharing it with 
others.  
I pray for those that don't believe. But I thank you that I 
believe.  
I believe that God changes people and God changes things. 
I pray for all  my sisters and brothers. For each and every family member in 
their  households. 
I pray for peace, love and joy in their homes that they are out  of 
debt and all their needs are met. I pray that every eye that 
reads  this knows there is no problem, circumstance, or situation greater 
than God.  
Every battle is in Your hands for You to fight. 
I pray that these words  be received into the hearts of every eye 
that sees them and every mouth that  confesses them willingly. 
This is my prayer.  In Jesus' Name, Amen.  
If you prayed this prayer, change the number in the subject box 
before  forwarding the message so people can SEE how many people have done 
so.  
God Bless!!!!!!!!!!! 
Just repeat this phrase and see how God moves!!  
Lord I love you and I need you, come into my heart, please. 
Pass  this message to 8 people except you and me. 
You will receive a miracle  tomorrow. 
Don't ignore and God will bless you. 
Know that you are already  blessed by the person whom sent this 
to you.

those boys have wads of cash on hand, i am sure they will pay you handsomely regardless of your decision

That's still true - I was getting worried about Chapter X filings.  A friend in b-school worked at Arco when BP bought them - she got a 1-yr package.  Where do I sign up?

yes  i did, from what you mentioned it seemed as if we are a potential take over targe. 

Did you get the message last night that the banks pulled it out for us? 

anytime after 4 is good

we should get together beforehand to talk. when would you be available? 15 min should do it.

Congrats, Please feel free to call me to discuss the trading track program. Brad (37699)

Brad,

Thank you for your vote of confidence today.  I'm really grateful to have a shot at the trading track.  It means a lot to me and I promise to work very hard to prove myself.  

I was wondering if you would be interested in grabbing a coffee sometime over the next couple weeks.  I'd be very interested to hear your take on the trading track and what you would do if you were in my shoes.

Jason

Cross Bay Pipeline to New York City Gets FERC Nod 
FERC granted a final certificate to Cross Bay Pipeline Co. LLC of Houston to assume ownership of a 37-mile portion of Transcontinental Gas Pipeline's Lower New York Bay Extension and add 16,000 hp of compression in Middlesex County, NY, in order to boost gas deliveries into New York City by about 125,000 Dth/d. The Cross Bay project, first announced in January 1998, is estimated to cost $59.5 million. 
Once completed, the compressor station and pipeline would form a new interstate pipeline system that would extend from Middlesex County across the lower New York Bay, all the way to Nassau County, NY. The pipeline's capacity would be more than 600,000 Dth/d, with the additional 125,000 Dth/d of incremental capacity. 
"By expanding the capacity of these existing facilities, Cross Bay Pipeline Co. will be able to create an important gas transportation alternative for New Jersey and New York markets in an economical, efficient manner with minimal impact on the environment," project sponsors said in an earlier statement. 
Williams and Duke Energy each have a 37.5% ownership stake in the limited liability company, while KeySpan, which came on as a third partner in August 1998, owns 25% of Cross Bay (see Daily GPI, July 24, 2000 <http://intelligencepress.com/subscribers/daily/news/d20000724c.html>). 
Since its inception three years ago, the Cross Bay project has undergone some changes in size, cost and design. It originally was scheduled to go into operation in November 2000.

the couch is just right, i did make the beds to the best of my ability. i did not use wally wally. i did however leave a pot that was wet on the bottom that created a stain i forgot that granite is a porous rock it absorbed the water quite well i hope that it will dry out if not we will do what is necessary to fix it. i am totally serious about the granite

Tuesday after 5:00 is good

Lets' try for Tuesday - that's looking pretty good for me.

ok 

I've had something come up today.  I can still do it tomorrow, though I
would hope to be able to go a little earlier than 5.  Are knocking off a
little earlier than usual with Nymex closing at noon?

In an effort to reduce risk, we would like to inactivate all ID's that are no longer valid for traders.  Please note that inactivating these ID's will not effect matrix trades.

Scott,

I checked further into the producer side of the deals that we have going to Boston.  The producers are well out of the money any do not seem excited about taking big losses via unwinding.  We need to come up with an attractive alternative.

Gulf Canada Energy	C$(19,427,920)
Suncor Energy		C$(19.861,007)
Petro Canada		C$(14,574,960)
Encal			C$(14,574,960)

Howard Sangwine is a marketer here who could coordinate the restructuring.  He covers a couple of these producers and has pretty good relationships with them.

Hey Jon,

Can you give me 1, 2, 3, 5 yrs out of Nov 1/01 for SMED (profile attached)? They are pretty keen to deal, but they haven't yet given me their financials. There is potential for us to straighten everything out today. Realizing you always give me tight pricing, can you give me your best here? They want to deal with us as we order furniture from them, but are squeezing us a little saying there is another competitor who is better than us. I have tightened our margins to $0.15/GJ which is small in the retail market even for this size of account.

Thanks, Mark.

 << File: SMED - Buy.xls >> 

The rest should show up by Fedex tomorrow.

Lucy,

Almost all basis in Canada is quoted in USD, normal convention is to quote the fixed price in CAD.  I will get Ian Cooke to send you the historical basis for AECO (in USD).  If you want a currency curve to work the numbers back into Canadian dollars we can also get you that, but I'm not sure what that would tell you.

Please let me know if you need anything else.

Jon

Ian - could you please forward our historical AECO curve to Lucy  - Thanks

John,

Hello again!  Is there anyone up there that can e-mail me historical AECO basis in CAD and USD for the last 5 years?

Thanks Des!

This is what I know so far... the South Wapiti inlet header blew up.  The inspection team is going out today to survey the damage.  From speaking to Ron Johnson (operator @ S Wapiti), he feels the damage is significant thus many parts and valves will have to be changed out.  Depending on crews and availability of parts, the plant will be 0 (zero) for at least 2 days if not until mid next week.  South Wapiti produces approximately 80% of Iroquois Creek meter thus 200,000 GJ will be off until the plant is back up.

I will keep you informed on any new information.

Des

There has been a line rupture at the South Wapiti plant which has resulted
in about 200 mmcf off the NOVA system.  Des doesn't have any details as yet
other than we will likely lose about 5000 gj of production today.  Her info
so far says that no one was hurt but the fire trucks are there.  We'll keep
you posted.

Kate,
 
Greg asked me to get a price for Lindsay Park first thing in the morning.  Given their load profile we would be offered at 4.39/gj for supply one year out of August.  Please let me know if you need any thing else.
 
Best Regards,
 
Jon
Jon,
 
I'm not going to be in tomorrow and Kate Joslyn is going to close the Lindsay Park deal for me.  Could you Email pricing to her directly instead of to me.  Thanks Jon.
 
Hey, if you ever need some tickets to go to a game let me know.
 
Greg

We would be offered at 4.43 right now, but like all things.... what goes up must come down.   We moved down .16 in the front part of the curve, but the back has not followed as quickly.  I would expect we will have a good hedging opportunity the next couple of days, and then rally after that.
 
Regards,
 
Jon

Jon,
 
Lindsay Park is being a pain in the butt - could you update me on price.  I know we are up today - when do you think prices may get back down to 4.25 range again?

Hello favorite Aunt (and I do have more than one),

How much do you want to try to sell the cabinets (dolls and TV) for?  Or a least how much did you pay so that we can get a reasonable price.  My plan was to sell everything I own before moving....sound familiar?  

Anyway I hope everything is going well and have a good time on your Alaskan safari.

Email me with the info. and I'll give you a call.

Love

Jon

Hi Jon

Just read your message.  Sounds like you are going to
be very busy for the next while.  Your house will
probably sell very fast as it is in a great area and
it is a nice place.

You can just sell the cabinets of mine if you want.  I
don't have room for them and neither does your mum or
if you want just take them with you if you want them.
I just dropped a note to your mum to ask her to keep
the mirror for me as she has the table and I am sure
she will keep the Daultons if you do not want to take
them with you.  I know you may not as they are a pain
in the but to haul arround with you.

If you talk to Steve and he wants the TV cabinte he is
welcome to have it, but if he can not use if again
just sell it when you start selling off your stuff.

My new phone is (867) 456-2154.  I am going away
tomorrow morning and will be gone until Sunday
evening.  Ron's mum is here and I am taking her on a
little tour.

Anyway we can talk about this more next week if that
is ok with you.  Drop me a note and let me know.

Lots of Love

Donna

Thanks for sending this to me, it looks good.  Does Mr. Frevert have the other points just in case further explanation is needed ?  I would not include them in his speaking points what you have is sufficient, but he probably needs the back ground just in case.

Here is the slide including Canada Gas Volumes - 

 << OLE Object: Microsoft PowerPoint Slide >> 

Here are the talking points - 

North America Natural Gas Volumes - By Region

?	Enron has a very strong, well-established, broad-based North American natural gas business.  We deliver gas to over 2,000 customers at over 2,200 points across North America.

?	Volumes in each major region increased in the first quarter:
-	In the West, volumes in the second quarter almost doubled to 3.9 Bcf/d.  This increase has been in response to the unprecedented volatility and tight market for gas throughout much of the West.  The West is our smallest region, comprising approximately 15% of our North America gas business.
-	In Canada, our volumes in the second quarter of 2001 decreased 23% over the second quarter of 2000 to 5.8 Bcf/d due to fact that during 2000 we offered a fixed price Alberta gas product through EOL that our customers used to hedge commodity price risk.  With the Alliance Pipeline coming on-line in late 2000, our customers began making more extensive use of EOL's financial NYMEX-like products as an alternative.  During 2001, Enron did not offer this product in an effort to focus on higher margin products.  Our Canadian region continues its strong contribution to our total North America gas activities.  
-	In our Central region, second quarter volumes increased 11% over a year ago to 7.2 Bcf/d.  Our strong, broad-based presence in the region allowed us to grow our Central region business consistently over the last few years.  In addition, our alliance with Peoples' Gas to develop the Chicago hub has brought increased liquidity to the region.
-	In the East, our volumes in the second quarter of 2001 increased 29% over the second quarter of 2000 to 9.0 Bcf/d.  The East region is our largest region, comprising 35% of our North America Gas business.
-	Across all of our regions, EnronOnline contributed to the strong, overall increase in volumes during the quarter.

Jon, 

Since the Time Execption System has been disconnected Tricia has asked that we manually record the days off people request.  
Chad had requested Friday August 3rd as a Friday off and Monday August 6th - Friday August 10th as vacation days before the system was disconnected.  
Unfortunately, I can no longer acces the system to see if his days off were approved.  He made his request prior to Zufferli's transition, so I am unsure if you are to approve his days or if it is John.

If you could me know if his days are approved, that would be great.

Thank-you
Carlee

Hello,

Your right it has been a long time since we have chatted.  Things are a cha=
nge'n with my life.

First I just got back from a little (so called) vacation where Beth and I d=
rove from West Palm Beach to Houston.  We did it over 3 days so it wasn't t=
hat bad.  Day one was a 10 hour hop from West Palm to Desitn, Fl.  You woul=
d have loved Destin, they have the most amazing sand on their beaches.  It =
kind of reminds me of Icing Sugar.  Very white and has a very fine texture,=
 and I felt like I was sink right into the sand. www.holidayinndestin.com. =
 Next stop was in New Orleans, which ended up with lots of drinks and some =
pretty good Cajun food.  It took about 6 hrs to get there from Destin but t=
he traffic was not that bad.  Next stop was in Houston (about 5.5 hrs) from=
 New Orleans.  By now I'm sure you have asked yourself.."Why did they do th=
is drive?"  And the obvious answer is because Beth is moving there.  She re=
nted a really nice loft in down town Houston not far from Enron Field http:=
//astros.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/hou/ballpark/hou_ballpark_history.jsp.  She too=
k a job with Enron Energy Service which is our retail company.  The bad thi=
ng is I'm not sure how I feel about having her work for the same company. T=
he good thing is that she is in a different building than the Wholesale gro=
up so the chances of having my personal life and business life cross are lo=
w.  I guess this would kind of be like if we worked for Shell and I ran the=
 Bulk dealer ship and she was responsible for exploration.  Not the same bu=
siness but none-the-less for the same company.

Second,  It look like I am going to sell my house and probably end up movin=
g to Houston as well.  Believe it or not this was not by design, just a mer=
e coincident.  However, it has presented some tough questions.  Do I really=
 want to move again? and Do I want to co-habitate?  Moving is the easy part=
, I'm starting to become an expert, and I was thinking about selling my hou=
se anyway.  As for co-habitating, the jury is still out.  Beth would have n=
o problem with the idea, but, Cold feet McKay has mixed feeling.  Co-habiat=
ion is in the lead as it stands.

Third, What would you prefer I do with some of the goodie's you have let me=
 borrow. ie Your beautiful dolls, the cabinets the dolls are in, the TV sta=
nd, you mirror, and the other few remaining items.  I thought I would store=
 the dolls at Carol's, but I was unsure as to what your preference was for =
the other things.   I am going to sell everything I can and start over in H=
ouston regardless my living plans (the only thing I'm going to try to take =
is my car).  If you want I can either try to get a fair price for you furni=
ture or Stephen might be able to make good use of the TV Cabinet and other =
things.  Email me your phone number as I do not have it, and we can talk ab=
out what is best.

Anyway, good to hear you are getting some exercise (I am trying to do the s=
ame), and stay off the darts if you can.  If you cann't, reward yourself fo=
r trying!

Take care and I will talk to you in a couple of weeks.

Love,

Jon =20
Hi Jon,

Thought I would drop you a note to see how you are
doing.  I haven't heard from you for ages and was
wondering what you are up to.

If Beth is down for Stampeed say Hi to her for me.

We are slowly getting things sorted out and under
control around here.  We have all of the major inside
projects done and Ron is just about finished putting
up the fence.  This is good as they have just posted a
caution bear in the area sign on the mailboxes.  The
fence should keep them away from the house, I hope.

I sent pictures of the place to your mum so reminde
her to show them to you the next time you see her.  I
really like the place.  Lots of work to keep me busy
and out of trouble but not as much work as the house
and yard in Calgary.

Rons mum coming for a visit on 18 July.  Will take her
out and about in the Yukon and a couple of places in
Alaska.  I am looking forward to going on a tour
again.

Well should run for now.  All is well with me.  Going
to the gym 3 days a week and am working on quitting
smoking, again.

Lots of Love

Donna

How is it going?  I don't want to make this a big deal, (quite frankly you =
and me have better things to spend our time on, and the dollar amount relat=
ing to these cuts is trivial) but with respect to cuts in the future I thin=
k it is important that we teach the people underneath us the correct way to=
 handle these issues, so that in the future we do not have to be involved. =
 Below is a quick dialog that Greg Johnston and I have had with respect to =
the cuts and what we can and can not do.

This seems to be blown way out of proportion by Kevin Heal and if there is =
anything I can do to make this GO AWAY please let me know.

Thanks,

Jon=20

No.  If they declare FM against us, the operative wording in the agreement =
is "to the extent that they are affected by such event".  In other words, t=
hey can only cut a deal to the extent the force majeure prevents them from =
performing.

Greg,

Do they have any right to cut a deal by more than the amount that the pipel=
ine declared as its force majure volume?

Kevin, further to your voice-mail, as indicated to you yesterday, our physi=
cal gas master agreement with ENA is in their form of Enfolio master agreem=
ent and not our form of master.  What that means is that, although the mech=
anics of declaring force majeure, etc. are the same, the definition of forc=
e majeure under our Enfolio master with ENA is not restricted to delivery p=
oint force majeure as it is in ECC's standard form, but is rather a broader=
 based force majeure.  However, it must be kept in mind that, depending on =
the transaction, the definition of "force majeure" may be amended in the te=
rms of the particular confirmation letter.  The application section (which =
is basically the same as in our form) is as follows:

This Article 5 is the sole and exclusive excuse of performance permitted un=
der this Agreement, and all other excuses at law or in equity are waived to=
 the extent permitted by law.  Except with regard to payment obligations, i=
n the event either Party is rendered unable, wholly or in part, by Force Ma=
jeure to carry out its obligations hereunder, it is agreed that upon such P=
arty's giving notice and full particulars of such Force Majeure to the othe=
r Party as soon as reasonably possible (such notice to be confirmed in writ=
ing), the obligations of the Party giving such notice, to the extent that t=
hey are affected by such event, shall be suspended from the inception and d=
uring the continuance of the Force Majeure for a period of up to 60 Days in=
 the aggregate during any 12 Month period, but for no longer period.  The P=
arty receiving notice of Force Majeure may immediately take such action as =
it deems necessary at its expense for the entire 60 Day period or any part =
thereof.  The Parties expressly agree that upon the expiration of the 60 Da=
y period Force Majeure shall no longer apply to the obligations hereunder a=
nd both Buyer and Seller shall be obligated to perform...

I will send a copy of the agreement over to you which also contains the def=
inition of Force Majeure, but again it must be remembered that such definit=
ion may be amended in the particular confirm.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop (stand alone computer).

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Hi Rod,

I am forwarding this e-mail just to let you know what I am being told as far as selecting a realtor (see below).  Today I am going to talk to the relocation people and do what I can about keeping things going with you.  The relocation people don't sound like they know what is going on, as demonstrated by their reference to "favorable tax treatment", but if they insist on having Royal LePage I wanted to see if you could speak to them directly.  My preference is to have you represent me, but if they are "paying the bills" I may have little choice.

Best Regards,

Jon
John:

I did some investigating on the Canadian homesale piece and found out some
interesting facts.  First one and the most important one is that I will not
be handling that piece of the relocation.  Instead a young woman by the name
of Severine Jennings will be handling that our of our International
Department and her number is 800/241-6529 ext. 75910.  She specializes in
Canadian properties and will be the better person to assist you.
Secondly, there is a real need for you to use Royal LePage as the agency to
list your home and the reason is that they know everything there is to know
about the favorable tax treatment on sale of your home.  They know how to
handle the sale in the "U.S. way" and they follow all the strict guidelines
of relocation.  Severine will contact you to go over all this with you
tomorrow.

I will still be your contact for all othe aspects of your relocation.
Remember, Billie will call you tomorrow to get you wiring information for
your lump sum calculations.

Talk to you on Monday - have a great weekend.

Jay,

The never ending saga of Enrononline vs. NGX continues.

Under our settle agreement with NGX, we (somehow) agreed to provide NGX with a password and ID that would allow them to see the products on enrononline that coincide with the index's that we are providing data to.  As a temporary solution I created a filer under my master user Id that gives them all physical Alberta gas products one month and under.  The problem is they can see the rest of month product bid/offer and the product descriptions of other Enrononline products.  

Would it be possible to set up a password and user ID for enrononline that only shows the products we are contributing to?  Or at a minimum, have them set up so they have their own limited access that is not associated with my login.

Call me when you get a chance (403) 974 - 6733.

Happy 4th of July,

Jon

I guess I'm not sure what you are after?  Do you have an example of another one that I could work off of ?  If I had a better idea of what kind of thing were suppose to be included I could probably get you something else.   Are we after more words or more duties.

Jon

Hey Jonathan

anyway in which you could expand this?  If not, I will send it on and see what the feedback is.

Karen.

I hope this works....  << File: Job Description.doc >> 

Hi Jonathan

Don't forget to send me your job description (word doc will work).

Thanks,

Karen.

Please note that because this event of force majeure is at the plant, and not on the pipe, it does not qualify as an event of force majeure under our contract.  Any deals we have that are not done under a Enron contract will probably have force majeure applied to them.

Please endeavor to find commercially reasonable terms to work around this problem regardless of who's contract the deal was done under.

Regards,

Jon

Yes, all trades have and associated contract that outlines the "performance obligations" and this is similar to NGX's.  Still waiting to talk to a lawyer on the other issues.  I will get it to you today.

Jon

HI Guys, 
Thanks for the Data files you sent, if I have any other questions, I will contact you guys today sometime this afternoon. 
Jonathan, Graham and myself were talking to NGX and they said that they almost always have contracts that have "Firm Performance Obligations" and that are non-interruptible.  Is that the same for Enron as well?  And I just wanted to confirm that I will be receiving the policies and procedures for how trades-in-error and breakdowns in communication are dealt with, sometime this afternoon.

Call me on this one.  I think AECO would actually be better due to the fact that plant gate gas in Saskatchewan trades at AECO - X.  Therefore an AECO hedge may be more appropriate to match up their risk.

Hope all is going well.

Boardwalk are looking at hedging the gas for their properties in Saskatchewan.  What would you recommend or a financial hedge?  AECO, Empress??

Grahan Larson at Deloitte wanted us to run the query that is outline in the word doc attached with a few alterations.  He was wondering if we could include the counter party ID, counterpart flag, and the counterpart name in the query we send to him?  Could you please coordinate getting him the information he needs.   His phone number is 630-7618.

Thanks,

Jon

Hi Jonathan.  The attached email contains the requested information regarding Enron security policies.  Additionally, the enclosed document addresses the internal/external issue.  This is the set of information D & T asked me to pass to you to send on to them.

 

Thanks!
 --jay

Jay,

Attached are the Enron Code of Ethics, which includes Enron's IT Security Policies for employees, and the Enron IT Control Standards, which are the standards against which IT controls are audited by Arthur Andersen, our internal auditors. As you are aware, every employee must sign an acknowledgement that they have read and agree to abide by the Code of Ethics once a year.

In addition to these documented policies, Enron also has a group, IT Compliance - the group I work in, that is responsible for managing Enron's IT risks and ensuring compliance with policies.

I hope this is what you were looking for. Please call if there is anything else we can help with.

what time do you need it for?

Hi Jon,

I wanted to ask if I could use the Video 1 Boardroom for Leadership Training tomorrow.  It is available, but I was informed that I needed to ask you first if we have an outside guest.  Michele Brown is the facilitator (the numbers on the board should mean nothing to her as she is not from the industry) and everyone else is internal.  We were unable to book our regular room at the E&Y Tower and Video 2 is a little crowded.  Could you please let me know as soon as possible.  Thanks.

Shyla,

I hope its going well!

I just wanted to respond to your request to have the buy's/sell's outline for you in the summery of one month trades.  Could you please explain why you need this information to complete your pie chart?  It would be my  preference not to include this information as our trading positions could be piece together prior to us having time to close out of those positions.  The risk of outside parties knowing our positions is of grave concern and it would be my preference to avoid this if at all possible.

Please give me a call to discuss.

Regards,

Jon 

I hope this works....  

Hi Jonathan

Don't forget to send me your job description (word doc will work).

Thanks,

Karen.

Jonathan,

Per Jay's request I am forwarding you the E-Commerce Group Org Chart to be passed on to D&T

 

Thanks,
Mary

Ryan could you make contact with Jesus and be his contact for pricing. 

Could you set up a process (maybe the bidfax) where by he can get daily pricing info.

Thanks,

Jon
John,
Would it be possible for you to assign one person that is easily accessible to provide Jesus with indicative pricing for Empress throughout the month?  Possibly Ryan Watt? Maybe you could include Jesus on an email distribution list (if there is such a thing) to provide him with indicatives.  We have one customer in particular that likes kicking tires, and Jesus doesn't like bothering you guys all the time for him.

 ENRON CHAIRMAN GREETED WITH CREAM PIE IN CALIFORNIA
     Enron Corp President Jeff Skilling defended his company's
role in the California power crisis and got a cream pie in his
face for his trouble, reports Reuters. Skilling, speaking at the
Commonwealth Club of California, attacked the Golden State's
botched deregulation, adding: "People in California are angry,
and they should be." The pie thrower was ejected from the
meeting.
     Later, Skilling voiced doubts about FERC's implementation of
limited price caps saying they could work against the free market
principle and put a damper on investment in new generation the
state badly needs. He suggested that a combination of new
generating capacity, a more rational regulatory framework and
consumer conservation could bring prices down. "This one is easy
to fix, and it will be fixed," Skilling concluded. "You'll get
supply, you'll get reduction in demand, and prices will
collapse."
     Meanwhile, today's Washington Post reports that Duke Energy
has been ordered by FERC to pay millions of dollars in refunds to
California, turning down the energy generator's explanation of
the high prices it charged in January for wholesale power. Duke
was told it should have charged no more than $273 per megawatt
hour, while the utility argued that charging nearly $3,900 MWH
during short supply periods was alright because it risked not
getting paid  (Reuters, June 21, Washington Post, pg. E-2, June
22, http://www.washingtonpost.com ).

Hi Jon,  A quick update:

The NGX guys are getting data fine this morning.  They are now working on the conversion of that do their system, but all looks fine from our end.

--jay

The numbers looked good for the 18th's report of numbers for the 15th.  We will watch them closely for a couple of days.  So far 1 for 1.

Thanks,

Jon

The basis numbers published for the 14th were quite different for three of the numbers published

Sumas CashSpread:  Correct basis:  -.495;  Basis Published: -.315
Aeco CashSpread:     Correct basis:  --.478;  Basis Published: -.536
Sumas June Spread:     Correct basis: -.45;  Basis Published +.055

The Sumas June spread is WAY off.

Would you be able to get the numbers fixed for the 15th publication.  We have received a phone call for three days in a row now from Lavo wondering why we marked our curves so off.  We have not marked our curves wrong but the report is wrong.  If this schedule helps I can send it tonight as well.  As I have stated before it would not be correct to get Aeco and Sumas IM numbers for ANY pubcode other that Sumas-US/IM or Aeco-Cdn/IM.  The other pubcodes are not correct 100% of the time.

Jay,

Thanks for all your work on the NGX issue.  I talked with them today and Dan said all that he need was a Address, ID, and Password to get up and going on their side.  Could you please contact Dan, at your convenience, with this information at (403) 974-4335.

Again, thanks for the quick turnaround.

John,

I wanted to talk to you about Disturnal's PRC when you get a chance. Give me a call 403 974 6733.

John, my understanding of our deal with you to sell 51 GJ's of gas to you each day until the end of June was at the AECO daily price with no discount. The Schedule A for Sitara 838545 shows a discount of $0.06835 per GJ. If this should be 0 can you let  me and Lisa McIsaac know so the contract can be changed, if not can you contact Kate or myself when you have a break in trading or after trading has closed for the day.

Thanks

Hi Jon,

Enron currently markets about 4.5bcf of NIT per day but there is no real way of measuring total NIT's taking place in the market place each day.
I have been told that although the total gas produced in Alberta is over 12bcf a day that the NIT number can  easily be double this. It doesn't appear that Enron markets 50% of Alberta's gas each day...yet.  

I hope this answers your question, let me know if you need anything else.

Ian  

Start with Peggy Hedstrom and find out if this is accurate and get back to me.

Thanks,

Jon
Jon
We are getting ready to do a public launch of Enron Direct.  When I was in Toronto Jeff Borg said that Enron Canada marketed 50% of the gas produced in Alberta. 
1.  Do you have a feel for the actual % of gas ?
2.  Can we publically make this representation?  

Would it be possible to get a copy of the fundamentals that one of your analysts puts together for the morning meeting? 

Many thanks
Kate

As for golf course, I was thinking I'd meet you at Pebble Beach..........Just kidding.

Hello John,

Your home looks great with a sold sign on it. Yes it is sold. The only thing
I need now is your new address, phone # and any new e-mail addresses you
might have.

Good luck John I owe you a round of golf at a course of your choosing, say
hi to the gang and I will be in touch.

Have a great day,

Rod Forsythe

How's about US$10,000 to get started or do you need US$20,000 right away?  I'm not sure Enron is going to do the trade with me but I would be glad to help you out.  Do you just want to mail cheques to each other or do something else?  If Enron does the currency trade that I want to do, I'd be happy to do what every volume you need.   

Let me know what you want to do.

Jon

Jon, I am unsure if you got my message the other day, but I am looking at
doing around 20000 US worth of currency.  The bank last week was charging me
a couple of hundred points, so anything less would be appreciated.  I would
like to hold off longer, but my first tuition bill is due Sept 10, so I need
the money by then.

If you can't help, I will probably try and cut a deal with my bank or a new
bank down here.

Thanks!

Jeff

Hi Laura,

I hope all is going well.  The reason for my note is that I was wondered if you can still do the occasional currency swap for employee's.  I'd like to convert C$300-400 thousand and was wondering if I could pay the Enron fee rather than retail.

Hit them down the middle,

Jon

How about 1.5460 as the rate.  I'll just send you a cheque for USD$20,000 and you can mail me the appropriate amount back.(Laura Scott agreed to do the amount that I wanted to swap with her).  Where should I send the cheque?

I would love to do closer to 15000, but 10 will definately work.  I have
about 14000 in tuition bills due in several weeks, and need to definately
convert some money.  Why don't you choose a rate, and e-mail me the rate and
your address (work is probably best, although I don't believe I have any
cards here and will need the address again!).  I will rush you a check,
which you can cash and then rush me back a check.

I really appreciate your help, and will hopefully talk to you soon (we will
have to talk one of these afternoons, as I am generally around and have no
classes!).

How's about US$10,000 to get started or do you need US$20,000 right
away?  I'm not sure Enron is going to do the trade with me but I would
be glad to help you out.  Do you just want to mail cheques to each other
or do something else?  If Enron does the currency trade that I want to
do, I'd be happy to do what every volume you need.

Let me know what you want to do.

Hi John, this is Kim.  Royal LePage Relocations will handle absolutely

all is done.  If you need to get a hold of them, just let me know and I can

Hope it's not too hot down there!!

USD$20,000 and you can mail me the appropriate amount back.(Laura Scott
agreed to do the amount that I wanted to swap with her).  Where should I
send the cheque?

Thanks for you help

Jon

Thank You,

Jon,

I have updated your ADM with Canadian products - you will need to refresh to see them.  Will you be needing to manage them on Stack as well?  I did not update the jmckay1.

Thanks,

Scott,

I still can not seem to pull up TDS.  I can get in to the Position Manager, but I am unable to see any of the trading books (most important FT-East-new).  When you have a few minutes could you please let me know who understands/runs the system, so I can get my problem sorted out.

Thank you,

Dear Mr. Raffaele,

My name is Jon McKay and I just moved from Calgary, Canada to Houston.  Just prior to moving I passed the Level III C.F.A. exam and now find my self in need of a sponsor to join the Houston society.  I was wondering if you could put me in contact with some of the local charter holders so that I could obtain sponsor ship and join the Houston society.  I was not member of the society in Calgary, as I was waiting to pass the third examination before joining, but I could provide some contacts in Calgary that hold charters, who would a test to my character.  If you had a local membership list, or even just a list of Enron employee who have C.F.A. Charters that I could contact, it would be greatly appreciated.

If you can help please contact me at (w) 713 853-4810, (h) 713 225-1230 or, at jonathan.mckay@enron.com.

Thank you,

Thanks Jon,
The work I've been doing here mostly involves project finance and balance
sheet lending to foreign companies.  I'm not necessarily looking to do this
from Calgary though.  When I look at my transferable skills, they basically
boil down to credit analysis, negotiation and documentation.

I've been on EDC's mining and power team for the past year and I really find
the work extremely interesting.  On the power side, Suzanne has a friend who
works for Power-X in Van. as a trader/marketer and his line of work sounds
extremely interesting.  I've talked to Alan W. about his work before and he
said marketing is marketing no matter what the product.  So gas is also of
interest.  This would be a bit of a career change for me and would need to
learn the ropes, but I have no ego.

Also of interest (outside of Enron) is equity research (for an investment
dealer), corporate/project finance (for power/O&G sponsors), and even
investment banking (though Andy has turned almost turned me off on this!).
I'm working on a big power deal in Mexico and wouldn't mind being on the
sponsor's side of the table (vs. banker's).  I'm sure TransAlta has several
generation projects that could be interesting.  I'd be on more familiar
ground in any of these roles and could pretty much hit the ground running.

Is this specific enough?  If nothing else, I'll be able to expand my contact
list to more than 2 (you and Andy!)

Paul

Thank you very much for all your help.

Jon

These are ready for pick up at the receptionist desk on the 16th floor of the Enron North.

nuh uh! i said you could pick who we go to the game with.  i guess i can call my lesbian friend or something

No I thought you were going to take care of that!

You, me, Vladi Pimenov, and his girlfriend Natalie  (who works in EES) will be going to the game.  Where would you like to meet them before we head over?

Kim,

Please make note that I will be out of the office from Sept 19th to Sept 24.

That sounds like AOL not MSN.  I tried using that address for MSN and it said it was not available at this time.  I'll try to add you again later using that address.

i think you can reach me on msn at bjenks1808@hotmail.com does that sound right?

People down here are shocked!  One of the brokers we use was in the second tower when the first plane hit.  All he said was that something blew up and he was getting the (*!@##$ out of there.   Sounds like it was a good decision as he was in the stairwell on the 20th floor when the second plane hit his tower.  He got out alright but many of his co-workers are still missing.  Lots of people have friends and family that worked there so people are keeping pretty much to themselves.  As for me.........I'm wondering why I moved to this country!  Things here are ok but I question everyday whether or not I made the right decision.  Hopefully, some good things start happening to me.  So far I have lost money trading, live with two cats I can't stand, don't have a car to drive (or any of my personal belongings) and this country is on the verge of going to war.  I figure things can only get better!

I'm back in town from the 19th-23rd...(assuming I can fly back)...and hopefully we can hook-up then.  If you need some kitchen-ware (i.e.. utensils) let me know and I'm sure we can work out a deal (There is no room for my stuff in this apartment).

Hope you are doing well and say hi to everyone for me.

Jon

Hey Jonny, what's up?  Jeez, just heard about the bombings, how is that
affecting you guys?  Let me know what's going on....

Scotty told me about your house being sold....that's great.  I think I'm
going over with him tonight to start clearing out some stuff...I'll grab
the plants and the light like we discussed....Scott may store the poker
table for me.  Let me know if there's anything else you need us to do...

Hope everything's okay down there...

I got the check and will cash it on Wednesday when I get back to Canada.  Things down here are not going quite as well as I had planned.  I've been doing a bad job of trading and there is no fundamentals to work off of, nor does anyone want to develop any!  Geof Storey's (who trades Eastern Canada and Chicago) father was in the World Trade Center for a 2 hour meeting on the 101 Floor of the first building that was hit, he is missing and presumed dead.  A funeral is being held for him this Saturday and I think this has caused people around here to take it even more personally.  I have to admit, for the first time in years I'm a little nervous about flying back to Calgary on Wednesday.

Glad to hear school is going well, I kind of wished I was there with you.  Best of luck, and I'll email you when I get back from Calgary.

Regards,

Jon 

I have noticed that there is still a sizeable chunk of change in my bank
account.  Did you get the check?

How are you settling into things down there?  Stuff was pretty crazy around
here last week.  They cancelled classes on Tuesday and delayed them on Wed.
We also had many vigils and moments of silence.  A couple of my friends here
were directly impacted, in addition to one of my profs.  Not good.  Kind of
makes you feel like moving back to Canada.  Other than that, we have started
to learn some pretty cool things in our organizational behavior class, and
sharpened up our excel skills in a decision sciences class.  School is fun.

Hey Greg,

I thought I would drop you a quick note.  How are things going?  I hope your still getting lots of deals done and knocking them deal at Enron Direct.  I decided I would take a look at the Stampeder's stats before I dropped you the line.  It looks like things are getting a little better (other than turnovers).  Good luck tonight.........there is no one I hate more than the Saskatchewan Roughriders.

Are you too busy today?  If not what time do you want to go?

I don't think this is going to be the answer to all your problems.  It's the results of the audit.  I'm not sure they were all that successful?

The Canada Trading Audit, executed by Andersen, has been completed.  The attached Final Report has been reviewed with key process owners and issues were discussed with appropriate personnel, both during the audit and at the Closing Meeting.  Final Reports will also be reviewed in detail with Wes and Sally on a periodic basis.

Thanks,  I'll try it out!

John,

I have added the curves to a curve fetch file in O:\ERMS\Excel Queries\JMcKayCurveFetch.xls
I did not know which curves to get rid of, but if you go through it just hide the ones that you don't want, you won't have to go back and add them later.  I have access to the folder and file, but I don't have rights to run the macro.  I have tacked the curves you requested to the last four columns of each sheet (one sheet for dailies and the other sheet for basis curves).  Call with any questions.

just submitted.  what is your home # for the contact card

How's about 5:30?

run tonight.

Adam,

So far so good!  I'm only concerned with being able to print it out on one page.  If you need more space turn the print page to landscape and use smaller font.  Keep making the font smaller until either we get everything on one page or until you can't read the printout.  Do you need me to do anything?

Jon 

Hi Guys,

I just wanted to show you the progress so far on the Map.  It is pretty rough.  I am worried about Space constraints on the sheet.  As a result, I have cut out Armagh, Lilly, Entriken, Shermansdale, and Bernville on the northern pipe.  Storage points are square and the data in yellow backgrounds.  Compressors are circles with clear data table backgrounds.  I would like any guidance you guys have on how to fit more points in, or which points to drop.  I want to add Transco at Linden, and I am researching other interconnects.

Also, I talked to the IT guys and I will have the links for the Map data up by this evening.
I had signed up for a training class this Thurs and Fri, but forgot to mention it last Friday.  I will have the Map finished by Wednesday, and I will fix any problems after the training class Thurs and Fri.

Thanks,

Adam

 << File: TETCOMap1.xls >> 

Today around 3:30?

Jon,

I have changed the format around to landscape and currently have everything in the report on one page.  Perhaps we should sit down and talk about which interconnects are the most important to add, because there are quite a few.  Right now, I see interconnects with TGT, Tenn, CNG, Transco, CGT, and NFG.  With so many important points, I am not sure which ones to add and which are negligible.

Adam

 << File: TETCOMap1.xls >> 

Are we going today?  I went for a run out to Sheppard and back yesterday it adds about 12min.

On another note, due to the Friday effect running has been cancelled today.  If you want to go this weekend let me know.

How's about today at 2:00?  I looked at the map over the weekend and noticed a few areas that will need further work......overall not too bad!

Jon

Jon,

Let me know when you have free time to talk about the TETCO map.

Or are we running.

What time do you want to run?  The earlier the better for me........bad day and I can't wait to get out of here.

Glen,

YOUR ALIVE..!!!!!!!!!!   Glad to see you are still around.   What's with the new job?  For me the new job is obvious.  We started playing a drinking game where every time the name Enron was mentioned you had to do a shot.  Minutes later I was fired for drunken insubordination.  Sometime in the next 3-4 weeks I'll start working for UBS Warburg (Union Bank of Switzerland).  I'm hoping working for a Swiss company may finally get me out of the middle of all the conflicts (Terrorism, Enron, Anthrax).  No one should want to harm the Canadian working for the Swiss company.

Actually, my division was sold to UBS so the transition should not be that hard.  Mostly the same people, but on a much smaller scale.  If I could make the same amount of money for UBS I did for Enron last year, I'd finally get the Bonus I've always been looking for.  Anyways,  I'll keep you posted.  My Email hasn't changed yet, but I'm sure it will.  If you need to get in contact with me try, Bjenkins2@houston.rr.com

How's the personal life going?  I hope all is well.

Jon

Hey Jonny, sorry I missed you over New Years....I went out to TO on the 28th
for a week....life's been kind of shitty lately so I probably wouldn't have
been much fun anyway...hope you had a good xmas and new year....how're

Kelli Little needs to set up a mtg. w/you re: Yankee Gas for tomorrow sometime between 1-4pm.  Will you pls. let me know when a good time is for you so I can coordinate this mtg.  I appreciate your help.

You are a better man than me, yes, but I'm not so sure it will be outside.

i actually ran yesterday at home.  maybe 3 in a row

Vladi,

I don't know if you are going to get this in time, but I wanted to try to get some of you input on a deal you price earlier for Yankee Gas.  Structuring needs you Gas Daily Daily offer for 30 peak day at TETCO M3.  You previously indicated US$0.13 for 40,000 a day and it looks like they are going to do the whole volume.  They will notify you by 9:00 am the day before delivery.

I don't know what the right price is but it would seem that we could anticipate their need to call and get in front of  the market moves.  I am going to stick with the 0.13/mmbtu unless I hear from you.

I hope the vacation is going well.  Sorry to disturb you.

Regards,

Jon

Heeelllloooo G Money,

Long time no e-mail!....  Things here are starting to settle down a little.  I still have not quite cleaned up my affairs in Calgary and probably need to do a weekend trip back up there, but I'll be sure to give you more notice than last time, as it will probably be less work and more play.  I have yet to do anything too spectacular down here.  Last week end I went to the Houston Grand Prix.  Paul Tracey and the other Canadian (name fails me....you know the french guy Patrick?????) didn't do to well.  Although, Enron had sponsored a car for that race and it  was in 3rd most of the way until it crashed on the 2nd from last lap.  It was kind of fun to have someone to cheer for in the race that was in the "thick" of things.  The day was nice and it beat being inside all day.

A couple of week before that I watched Notre Dame get slaughtered by Texas A&M.  It was a really hot day and Kyle Field (where A&M plays) is the loudest outdoor stadium I have ever been in.  There was 92,000 people there and 91,950 were die hard Texas A&M fans.  I kept pretty quite though, the only thing I had to cheer about  as far as the Irish was concerned was that they won the coin toss.  Everything else was down hill from there........it was a complete domination by A&M.

The apartment is starting to get organized.  It is hard to take two 2,000 square foot homes and move them into one 950 square foot apartment.  I've thrown a lot of stuff out I hope I wont need again or I hope I can replace easily if I need it.

How are things with you?  Are you guys getting out much these days?  Anything new and exciting going on in your life?

I hope all is well and I find myself missing you guys a lot.  Have one for me!

Jon

Hey buddy, what's going on?  Just wondering what you're up to.....things
settled down a little for you?

I'm going to hockey tonight for the first time this year.....I can already
feel the groin pull......

I would love to be included.

Thank You.

Here is the unwind structure for 7500/MMBtu of the Boston Gas deal.  Could you please set aside some time tomorrow to discuss the costs and residual risks that would be left after unwinding this deal.  I would like to include Gerry and Howard from our Calgary office in this discussion so they can brief you on the current status of Cal pine.  Below is a couple of slides that show the unwind.

Fred, 

I just wanted to say thank you for the golf on Saturday.  I had a really good time and enjoyed playing your course very much.  You should be very proud of it as I think it one of the best laid out courses I've played. 

Thank You,

Jon

PS.  Hopefully we get to play together next time.

Jeff,

Good to hear from you.  Things down south seem to have taken a turn for the worse.  Enron keeps making headlines, and not in a good way.  It looks like the market is going to test the big E and make sure that we can handle a little adversity.  Life down here is ok, I am still trying to get settled.  Living with the girlfriend is going pretty well except for the two cats she has.  I can not stand them, and if I could find a way to make them disappear I would.  Cats are the most useless, dirty animals in the world and her cats prove it everyday.

Anyways, I've been doing some fun things down here.  I have gone to a couple of college football games.  I saw Texas AM crush Notre Dame, and the University of Texas kill Colorado.  Both, games were fun to go to and the weather was nice for both of them so I can't complain.   I also went to the Grand Prix of Houston.  That day was also nice and it was fun to watch, but as far as car races go it was not that exciting.  The winner lead start to finish and no one was close all day.  The two Canadian drivers both crashed relatively early so even trying to cheer for people from the homeland didn't go that well.  Other than those few days the weather has been pretty uncomfortable.  Hot and sticky, its like sitting outside and watching the rodeo.  You just don't feel clean when you get back inside.

Trading has been hard.  I've been on a long cold spell and I need to turn it around soon.  But, it always looks its darkest before dawn......bring on the light. 

I hope everything is going well for you.  Sorry to hear the ladies are not plentiful.  Usually that is one of the big upsides to going back to school.  Good Luck on you exams, I'm sure you'll do fine.

Regards,

Jon   

 

Jon, I though I would check in and see how things are going down south.  I
talked to the boys in Calgary last week about the PSAC report, I guess that
they were going to the luncheon last week and wondering if they should anti
up the money for the report.  Other than that, I haven't talked to them
much, but can't wait to get home for Christmas.

Things have been pretty busy up here, I have spent a lot of time partying,
but even more time studying and working.  We have finals next week, then
have a week off, and start up again.  So far, things have gone pretty well,
and I have learned some pretty neat things (why Napster was an efficient
solution, why Microsoft included I.E. in their operating system...).  We are
finishing the accounting (thank goodness), and will be starting into capital
markets and more spreadsheet classes.  All in all, we have covered a lot of
the material that was in the first year of the CFA, but also learned a
little more about the softer subjects and case analysis.

The social scene here is pretty good, other than a definite lack of women.
Our class had one of the lowest female participant rates in history, and it
is starting to show on the faces of many of the single guys in my class
(myself included).  Four of us took a run up to Montreal on Friday for the
night, and it was a welcome relief.  Other than that, we can't complain too
much.  I started to play hockey once a week, and bought a ski pass that I
should be able to use in a few more weeks.

I am starting to think about what I am going to do next summer, and wanted
to talk to you about a few things.  I was considering a brief foray into the
consulting industry, and was thinking about a company in Boston that
specializes in the natural gas and power markets.  They have a pretty good
staff, and are very technical in terms of project valuations, and analysis.
I think that it would be a good, different background, but wanted to talk to
you (and possibly your girlfriend), about other types of work or companies
within the industry, including Enron.

Let me know when you get time to talk, and also let me know how things are
going in Houston.

Later.

Dale,

Thanks for the email.  I would be happy to pay the 50.00 fee one last time, however, given that this account will not be touched and no changes in the accounts holdings are allowed under Canadian tax law given my status, we need to find a way to either avoid this fee in the future or transfer the holdings to somewhere else.  I would much appreciate your recommendation on how to proceed as well as an address as to where I should send the money for the outstanding balance.

Regards,

Jon

Hi Jonathan, 
A couple of questions for you: 
1) Have you proceeded with opening an account at Dane Rauscher yet? 
2) Your RSP account has a small debit of $50.00, probably due to RSP holding fees charged to the account for 2001.  We either need a cheque from you for the $50.00 or we need to sell $50.00 worth of something to generate the $50.00 in the account.
Just drop me a note or call regarding how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.

Hey Jean,

Where are you sitting these days?

Sorry Stephen,

Thing around here have been a little hectic.  Friday would be fine, just let me know where.

Jon

My friends at Duke can not meet Thursday night, but can on Friday.  Can
you get together on Friday?  If so, it will be early (around 5 PM) so
your honey won't get upset.  If Friday will not work, you and I can
still meet on Thursday.  Let me know.  Cabo again is fine with me.

Hey Scott,

I just wanted to verify that we are going to pull the 20 longest dated deals and get quotes from other dealers.  Is that correct?  Or are we going to have them on hand for when the contracts are terminated.... then get the appropriate quotes.

Thanks

Hey Jeff,

How's it going.   Things down here are actually very slow.  They (upper Management) are still trying to figure out what to do.  In the mean time no one is trading.  I sit around most of the day and play games.  I keep waiting for some instruction about what to do next and nothing is being said.  The old hurry up and wait.   Beth's (my girlfriend) whole department got let go the other day.  She is still there until Christmas doing the clean-up but, come the new year she is going to have to try to find a new job.  Things down here could not have gone worse for her. I feel real bad, because in a way I had a part in her moving, but there is nothing I can do about it now.

Are you an unsecured Enron creditor, as they agreed to pay for your school and now won't be able too?  How are thing there?  Are you liking school?

I'm heading back to Calgary on the 21st, and I'll be up there until at least the 30th (maybe longer).  I'd love to grab a beer if you have time.  You can reach me at (403) 239-0299, or I'll be stopping in at the office.

Take care and I hope to see you in cow town.

Jon

I hope that everything is going okay down there for you, I talked to Chris
last week and he said that everyone was kind of just sitting around waiting
to find out what is going to happen with the trading group.  What did they
do with your girlfriends department?  Is she still there?

Are you going to head home for Christmas?  If so, when?  I am heading home
next Friday, and will be around till after New Years.  We should all try and
plan some time to get together if you are going to be there.

If not, I hope that things go okay and you have a Merry Christmas.

fyi.

told him currently we were not nominating all the gas however; the city gat=

ssee the storage was not being nominated & there was a good possibility tha=
t the city gates were not receiving their gas.  I reassured him the city ga=
tes were receiving their gas.  ENA does not nominate storage, it  was autom=
atically done at the pipeline level due to the 2 day allocation lag.    As =
per his previous conversation with Vicki Versen, he has an estimate what th=
e storage levels were &  wanted to make sure there was enough gas in the st=
orage to cover December.  I told him he would need to speak with Vicki on t=
hat matter.  I asked him if there was a problem  that needed to be resolved=
 & his response: Reliant is going to wait it through to see the outcome wit=
h Enron, but wanted to make sure the gas was being delivered. =20

After the conversation, I run the storage report for December & the gas is =
automatically being withdrawn.  I called Royal back  and confirmed gas was =
being withdrawn from storage. He asked for a copy of the storage report.  I=
 did not discuss volume or what Enron's intention were at this time. I have=

I did not want to alienate Royal, but at same time I did not want to provid=

Hello Everyone,

It is time to get started in our quest to figure out the N.E.  Given that we are coming to the end of the heating season our best opportunities to make money over the next little while will be with respect to storage, storage arbitrage, and opportunities surrounding the injection season.   Having this in mind I think the best place to start is with the pipe that has the most storage capabilities and flexibility, and I think that is Columbia Gas Transmission.  I am inviting everyone to attend a meeting Tuesday at 3:00 (location to follow) to discuss the who, what, where, when, why, and how.   In preparation for the meeting we need to have information regarding the pipe:

1)	We need the operational capabilities of the pipe.   This should include major receipt points, delivery points, through put capability, line pack balances, and storage facilities (both owned by the pipeline as well as third parties).  Expect to discuss which regions are the bottle necks, and what operational restrictions or advantages individual locations have. (Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info)

2)	We need to talk about trading and transacting in this region.  Proper contracts with the pipe, what flexibility we have (or could get), transportation costs within the region, etc....(Rob, Meredith, Bob or Chris could you please try to track down some of this info)

3)	Major players on the pipeline LDC's, Industrials, Power Generators, and production companies (i.e.. native production on the pipe) (Adam and Chuck could you please gather this info)

4)	Price Curves and trading opportunities for the region.  (I will be supplying the data for this part of the discussion)

Please come ready to talk freely about what you know and please understand that the point of this is to figure out what pieces of information we lack and to make everyone better informed.  I look forward to see you all on Tuesday.

Regards,

Jon

Due to the popularity of this meeting we will have to move it to 06990.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

It was good.... I went down around noon and hung out for a couple of hours.  It is amazing how excited everyone is for the Texan's to start up.  Thank you very much for the tickets it was a lot of fun.  It seemed like everyone but me knew who they were going to take in the draft.  Look for a check the next couple of days I plan on sending you $25,000 that I would like you to put with the rest of my cash for now.

Thanks Again,

Hi:
I hope this e-mail finds you both in good health and good spirits.
Jon was seeking some information on possible sources for Meteorological employment. I spoke to Jim Renick who is the General Manager of our Alberta program and he has e-mailed this information. He also indicated the university of Texas A&M, was a possible locale to find some graduates, and or students, depending on what level of experience you were seeking. 
If you need anything else, let me know.

Hellllooooo,

How are you doing?  I know I have been delinquent in sending you a note but=
 there has been a lot going on these days.  The move still is not quit comp=
lete, I still have things I need to do up there and I probably need to do a=
 weekend trip to get everything cleaned up.  I ended up selling you curio (=
sp?) cabinets and keeping you TV. cabinet.  Hence I have a cheque for you t=
hat needs to be sent, or picked up if you like?

The move has gone pretty well all things considered.  We managed to fit two=
 2000 square foot homes into one 900 square foot apartment.  It kind of has=
 the cluttered eclectic New York apparent look to it.........you know the s=
ame as your basement in Summerland.  Nothing major got damaged, in the move=
 so that helps.  I still have to switch over my car registration and insura=
nce, and we all know how much fun that is so I've been procrastinating.

I've done a couple of fun things since being down here.  I've gone to two c=
ollege football games, one at College Station to watch Texas A&M beat Notre=
 Dame, and one in Austin to watch the University of Texas beat Colorado.  T=
hey were both day trips about two and a half hours from Houston, so the dri=
ves were not that bad.  Its just kind of neat to be in a Stadium with 90,00=
0 other fans.  It is truly amazing to hear the noise that can be made by th=
at many people.  Two weekends ago I watched the Texaco Grand Prix of Housto=
n.  This is a car race similar to the ones they have in Vancouver and Toron=
to each year.  There are two Canadian drivers in this racing series but bot=
h of them had a bad day.  One of them crashed and the other finished way ba=
ck.  The highlight was that Enron had sponsored a car just for that race th=
at was doing very well up until the second from last lap when it crashed.  =
Oh well, at least it was fun to have some one to cheer for, and it was a pr=
etty nice day to sit out side and drink a beer.

Work is hard and not going as well as I hoped, but I think I just need to g=
ive it some time.  Enron also has been in the news a lot these days for all=
 the wrong reasons.  It sounds like one of the "way high-ups" had a questio=
nable kick back deal with Enron that has come under attack.  The Board of D=
irectors has been sued by shareholders and all the regulatory people are st=
arting to ask questions now.  It looks like my plan for early retirement is=
 out the window as our stock price this year has fallen from a high of $90 =
to $25.  So much for getting stock options as your bonus.

Anyway, the World Trade attacks have not really changed much down here.  Th=
ere seems to be more hype than anything else, you know anything the media c=
an latch its teeth into rip apart.  I'm actually getting tired of all the r=
umors and fear mongering that is going on.  I figure if my time is up, than=
 so be it, but I'm not going to spend all day worrying about it, its a wast=
e of energy.

I hope the new job goes well.  I'm glad to hear that your back working, I w=
as starting to worry about you a little.  You know what can happen when peo=
ple lock themselves in their house and don't get out enough they tend to st=
op going out all together.

Anyway, its time for me to start working so I have to go now.  Take care an=
d have fun at your new job!

Love

Jon

al address so I can mail you the money I owe you. Thanks

Hello,

I was just dropping this note to see if anyone was interested in getting together for the Rice Owls homecoming game against Tulsa this weekend.  Game time is 2 pm and I thought we would get walk-up tickets (eveyman for himself).  If people are interested we would have a little tailgate party prior to kick-off and watch the 6-3 Owls (undefeated at home)  kill the Tulsa Hurricanes.  Drop me a line if you have interest as I am trying to get critical mass. 

Jon

PS. Please invite anyone that has interest in coming along and bring your kids if you have them.

Hello John,

Your home looks great with a sold sign on it. Yes it is sold. The only thing
I need now is your new address, phone # and any new e-mail addresses you
might have.

Good luck John I owe you a round of golf at a course of your choosing, say
hi to the gang and I will be in touch.

Have a great day,

Rod Forsythe

I am interested in moving to the Enron Center or if nothing is available to Allen Center.  I work in Enron Center South and my company number is 0413 and my cost center is RC 107313.  

Regards,

Jonathan McKay

Good Evening,

	The purpose of this e-mail is to inform you that a mandatory move from your current parking location is required due to the expiration of Enron's parking contract with the Metropolitan Garage as of 1/31/01.

	The Parking & Transportation Dept. is offering alternative parking in the Allen Center Garage for $94 per month. In order for us to make this a smooth transition for you, we are asking that you respond as soon as possible, however, all parking changes must be made via e-mail, no later than 1/18/01. The Allen Center spaces will be on a first come - first serve basis. If you have any questions you can contact Parking & Transportation at x3-7060.

See attached for your review and comment to me by end of day (or sooner if possible).  Soon to follow, firm eol with credit.  And the same two firms for over the counter, not eol.
 

Cordially,
Mary Cook

I thought since you wanted to talk, we would skip going to dinner to night.... we'll go tomorrow with tom and miranda.  And the real reason for canceling is ...I'm going to play golf.... I have my cell phone if you need me.

Frank,

By not being able to trade C$ denominated products we would not be able to trade most of the physical products including cash, one month, index gas, or be able facilitate long term structures.  Having said that, if the time period for not trading these products was only 45 days, they could get past that without any major damage being done.  It will take longer to get physical contracts in place in Canada than it will financial.  The extra time the Canadian office would have before it traded physical C$ products would allow them to obtain a critical mass of trading counter parties.  If it was going to be 120 or 180 days, then there would be problems.

I hope this helps, let me know if you need any else.

Regards,

Jon

Jon,
Dealing with Canadian issues and NETCO.  Original thought was that legacy deals go away and we can do in Canada as we do in US.  Unfortunately feedback is that currency issue will still exist.  In your minds eye, will it put Canada out of biz if we require that during first 45 days only "US like" transactions occur?  

Your feedback would be great.
Thanks,
Frank

BACK FOR SECONDS 
Houston again named fattest city in America by national magazine 
By DANIEL J. VARGAS 
Copyright 2002 Houston Chronicle 
Isn't it just like Houston to go for seconds? 
This title-craving city has been named the fattest, plumpest, most rotund city in America by Men's Fitness for a second consecutive year. 
Weigh to go. 
Fattest cities 1. Houston 2. Chicago 3. Detroit 4. Philadelphia 5. Dallas 6. Columbus, Ohio 7. San Antonio 8. Fort Worth 9. St. Louis 10. Indianapolis Fittest cities 1. Colorado Springs, Colo. 2. Denver 3. San Diego 4. Seattle 5. San Francisco 6. Virginia Beach, Va. 7. Honolulu 8. Sacramento, Calif. 9. Albuquerque, N.M. 10. Boston 	
"Houstonians need to turn off the TV and get out to their parks where a variety of programs for kids and adults are offered for free," the magazine writes. 
Last year, Houstonians viewed the national magazine as a svelte bully picking on the chubby little kid on the playground and reacted like a protective, angry mother. 
In 2002, the message is soaking in like a juicy, half-pound hamburger patty on a freshly toasted bun. 
"The first year we were kind of upset because we weren't happy or agreed with the ranking because they took into account air quality and other things people can't control," says Shadston Pittman, fitness coordinator for the city's Parks and Recreation Department. "This year the ranking is motivating because we have some projects in place now. I think we can show the world (weight loss) is a priority for us. 
"But they still got us. Again." 
In fact, Pittman thought Indianapolis would get the top honor. Sorry, they came in 10th. 
"I didn't think we'd be number one because of the proactive steps we took," he says. 
For the country's 50 largest cities, the magazine took existing data and issued grades in 16 categories such as overweight and obesity rates (D), air quality (F), TV viewing habits (F), water quality (D), parks and open space (D+), nutrition (B-) and climate (C). 
When the grades were tallied, Houston once again found itself at the head of the class, albeit the one with all the detention-serving kids. 
The Men's Fitness issue hits newsstands Tuesday. (Meanwhile, we apparently should hit the treadmill.) 
Not to be outdone, other major Texas cities also found themselves on the heavy side. 
Dallas ranked fifth. San Antonio was seventh. Fort Worth ranked eighth and El Paso weighed in at 14th. 
The only Texas city on the light side was Austin, ranked as the 16th fittest. The fittest city was Colorado Springs, Colo. 
Karen Calabro, coordinator of health promotion and health education at the University of Texas-Houston Health Science Center, says although she doesn't put much stock into the magazine's formula, Houstonians could stand to shed a few pounds. 
"We could all lose some weight. Me included," the registered dietitian says. 
Houston, Calabro says, isn't the only city with a caloric-intake and sedentary epidemic. 
Nationally, 55 percent of adults are overweight or obese, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. 
As your waistline expands so do your chances of developing diseases or conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease or diabetes, Calabro says. 
"A big part of this obesity problem," she says, "is that we're not exercising" -- not even when the opportunity presents itself for a brisk walk. 
We opt for the elevator when the stairs call our name. We see escalators as our new best friend. And we drive to the corner store for ice cream. 
But Pittman hopes to alter our lifestyles and ballooning image. 
After Houston earned the first unsolicited title, Pittman and two other city officials visited Philadelphia, which owned the "fattest" ranking in 2000. 
Philly started a citywide campaign called "Fun, Fit and Free" to get its residents to slim down. Last year, Philadelphia fell out of the top spot and this year is in fourth place. 
Pittman, who is also a personal trainer and has been fitness coordinator for just a year, says Houston's version will not be under one umbrella slogan like Philadelphia's. However, there will be several endeavors to involve as many people as possible. 
The city's get-fit effort will kick off Jan. 17 when the city teams up with the Subway sandwich chain to bring the Subway Challenge to Houston. 
The problem is so serious that Subway is sending its big-gun spokesman to the Jan. 17 event. 
From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. outside City Hall, 900 Smith, participants can meet Jared Fogle, who lost 245 pounds on a diet of low-fat, low-calorie Subway sandwiches, and receive a pledge card good for sandwich discounts and a two-week free membership to Bally Total Fitness. 
"That Jared's a nice guy," Pittman says. "That's his full-time job now." 
People would agree that losing weight is a full-time task. 
The city will also team up with the Texas Fruit and Produce Growers Association and Central Market to promote the "Five a Day" message of eating five serving of fruits and vegetables a day. That effort kicks off Jan. 22. 
"We're not saying everyone has to run 10 miles a day around Memorial Park," Pittman says. "We're talking just simple lifestyle changes." 
Later this year, Houston will join other major Texas cities in a program called "Shape Up Texas" to improve health and wellness among Texans. That's not a bad idea considering Texas cities make up 20 percent of the fat list and four of the top eight. 
Mayor Lee Brown says he will do his part to cut out the fat at City Hall. 
Brown, who has put on a few pounds since taking office, says he isn't surprised by Houston's expansive reputation. 
"I'm afraid I've contributed to that," he says. 
Brown says he will set an example for the rest of the city by losing some weight himself, not through a diet but by walking and riding his bike more. However, he wouldn't reveal how much weight he planned to shed. 
Pittman applauds the mayor's words about weight loss. 
"It's great when you have someone of that stature visibly being a speaker for health and fitness," he says. 
The last thing we want is a three-peat in 2003. 

Dear Mrs. Kemp,

My name is Jonathan McKay and the reason I am contacting you is with respect to obtaining sponsorship to become member of the local CFA society. I moved from Calgary, Canada in September and I am not familiar with anyone that belongs to the Houston chapter. I obtained your name from the AIMR website and would appreciate any help you could offer me as far as sponsorship or putting me in contact with some of the local members.  I have completed the third level exam and need this sponsorship in order to obtain my designation.  I can be contacted at (h) 713 225 -1230, (w) 713 853 - 4810, or via email at jonathan.mckay@enron.com.

Thank you,

Jon McKay 

Hello,

Hi
Thanks for the note.  It was great to hear from you and to know that all of the BS down there is not really effecting you and your fun.
My new address is:   Donna Ackert,  21 McPherson Road, WHITEHORSE, Y.T. Y1A 5S3.  Phone #(867) 456-2154.
You do not have to worrie about sending me a cheque.  It is not a big deal.  Just take yourselves out for a nice dinner or whatever and have a drink for me while your at it.  I just appreciate you looking after my Daultons for me while you could.
Work is coming along.  We are in the process of putting product on the shelves.  What a mess everything is in.  We have 24 days before opening and if we make it I will be surprised.  Lack of any sence of organization is a big problem.  All I can say is, I am glad that I am just a flunkie because if I owned the place Heads would roll.
The old bod keeps forgetting that it is six years older than it was in Summerland and just can't figure out why it is so pooped at the end of the day.  I really don't know how I managed 7 days a week, for weeks on end.  GETTING OLD IS NO FUN AT ALL.
Well best get for now.  Love to both you and Beth.
Donna

Jon,
New hire orientation is on Monday's except for next week and begins at 8:30 on the 5th floor I believe.  

Janice-please send Jon the room number.  He is a transfer from the Canadian office.  Thanks.

Hey,

Houston is Hot hot hot..........So far the living arrangements are good, however, I remain cautious about the potential going forward.  The loft is very cool (i.e. trendy, not cool temperature), but I can hear the sucking sound on my bank account.  Its only been a couple of days, but so far so good.  My email address is the same and you can get a hold of me by sending me a note.

I think I may have sold my house, there is still a few thing to be worked out, but I'll let you know when I'm comin' back to Calgary so you can pick-up some of the kitchen stuff.

Regards,

Jon  

Jonny how's it going?  Just wondering how the living arrangements are so
far?  I'm sure it's all still very blissful being as it's only been 3 days.
Hopefully you guys are doing okay!

Wasn't sure if your email address changed or not....get back to me when you
have a minute, let me know what's happening!

Glen

Email me when you're back in town...........I don't have a phone number yet..........and we'll hook up.

Sung to American Pie

A long, long time ago.... I can still remember, how that stock price
used
to
make me smile, and I knew if I had my chance, I shouldn't have listened
to
those analysts rants, and maybe I'd be happy for a while..... but
February
made me shiver, with every option they delivered, bad news in the
Boardroom,
I couldn't believe the pending doom, I can't remember if I cried when I
read
about Skilling step aside but something nauseated  me from deep inside,
the
day, that Enron shareholders, cried. So...
CHORUS
Why, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the
sky
then the bond market went dry and them good ol' boys were high on their
own
supply wailing, "Why Ask Why",  This will be the day that they  drink
Bud
Dry.
Did you write off your shares enough or did you have faith in Jeff
above,
if
the headlines told you so, and do you believe in book-it-n'-roll, can
mark
to market save your p&l and can you teach me how to print money on deal
flow? Well I know that you're in not in ruin I saw your balance in the
credit union, you sold off all your shares and I dig those market bears.
He
was a lonely boomer CEO with a big old House in River O.  but I knew I
was
out some dough, the day, Jeff stepped aside. I started singin...
Chorus

Now for ten years we've been on a roll and all are friends are on the
dole
but that's not how it used to be, when the Ken Lay sang for the George
and
Barb while Rice screwed Amanda in an rental from Harold Farb,  oh and
while
Skilling was looking down, the stock price has made him frown the
shareholder return, has really made him burn, and while he had plenty of
jack, he had lost the knack and had come under attack, , the day, Jeff
stepped aside. We were singin...
Chorus
Helter Skelter in a summer swelter the electricity market was a limit
melter, eight hundred bucks and climbing fast, California credit limit
had
quickly past, the governor tried to get some bills past,  Enron's
receivables have quickly amass, now everyone ran to  in Washington, the
lawsuits have just begun, just before the price would fall, Gov. Gray
bought
it all, as the dust is settling, will prove that government mettling
will
certainly be, a huge catastrophe, the day, Jeff stepped, aside. We
started
singin...
Chorus
Oh and there we were all in one place, a company that needed its space
with
no floors left to grow, so come on, Jeff be nimble, Jeff be quick, Jeff
S.
built a new deodorant stick because hubris the devils only friend, oh
and
as
I watched that tower build, but I doubt it will ever be filled, no more
recruiting trip; as HR doles out more pink slips; and as the building
climbed high into the sky to quite the contractor delight  I saw
shareholders shuttering with fright, the day, Jeff stepped aside. He was
singin...
Chorus
The burning question that I don't know is who can replace him as CEO
cause
the company won't be the same, he transformed the industry his success
is
plain to see but from natural gas to electricity, Dynegy tried, and
Duke
has dreamed but I hate to tease, they are just Enron wanna-be's, and in
hindsight its easy to mock his leaving the firm in a shock, I'm just I
had
sold my stock, the day, Jeff stepped aside, and they were singin...
Why, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the
sky
then the bond market went dry and them good ol' boys were high on their
own
supply wailing, "Why Ask Why",  This will be the day that they  drink
Bud
Dry.

Just in the process of selling the house.   The prospective buyers need to secure financing.  How much are you looking to convert as I am long some USD from liquidating some investments in Canada and may be able to help convert some currency earlier.

Let me know.

PS. How is the good life treating you?

What is going on with your changing currency?  Have you sold your place yet?

Hey, Jeff is this the correct email address to reach you?

Regards,

Jon

Things are going awesome down here, I spent all of last week rowing around the ocean (not as much fun as it sounds!), and spent the weekend with a couple of buddies in Quebec City (also not quite as fun as it sounds!).  
 
I can't believe the people that I have met down here, everyone is really friendly, and all have interesting stories/pasts!  You should seriously think about coming down here, I can't think of another place that I would rather be!
 
Anyway, I will let you guys know a little more when I finally get my computer, as I am using one in a common lounge area (right beside the pool table in my residence!).  
 
Any new information on currency?  I am probably going to have to think about converting it over pretty soon.

XO Jon
TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE FROM A MAN WHO'S HAD ENOUGH:

1.) Learn to work the toilet seat. If it's up, put it down. We need it up,
you need it down. You don't hear us bitching about you leaving it down.

2.) ALL men see in only 16 colours. Peach is a fruit, not a colour.

3.) If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to
act like soap opera guys.

4.) If you think you're fat, you probably are. Don't ask us. We refuse to
answer.

5.) Birthdays, Valentines, and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we
can find the perfect present yet again!

6.) If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you
don't want to hear.

7.) Sometimes, we're not thinking about you. Live with it. Don't ask us
what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as
navel lint, or the shotgun formation.

8.) Sunday = Sports. It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides.
Let it be.

9.) Shopping is not a sport, and no, we're never going to think of it that
way.

10.) When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.

Really.

11.) You have enough clothes. You have too many shoes.

12.) Crying is blackmail.

13.) Ask for what you want. Let's be clear on this one: Subtle hints don't
work. Strong hints don't work. Really obvious hints don't work. Just say
it!

14.) No, we don't know what day it is. We never will. Mark Anniversaries on
the calendar.

15.) Peeing standing up is more difficult. We're bound to miss sometimes.

16.) Most guys own three pairs of shoes. What makes you think we'd be any
good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your
dress?

17.) Yes, and No are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.

18.) Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. That's
what we do.

19.) Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.

20.) A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. See a doctor.

21.) Foreign films are best left to foreigners. (Unless it's Bruce Lee or
some war flick where it doesn't really matter what they're saying anyway.

22.) Check your oil.

23.) It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz
together.

24.) No, it doesn't matter which quiz.

25.) Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. All
comments become null and void after 7 days.

26.) If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways
makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.

27.) Let us ogle. We're going to look anyway; it's genetic.

28.) You can either tell us to do something OR tell us how to do something,
but not both.

29.) Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during
commercials.

30.) If it itches, it will be scratched.

31.) Beer is as exciting for us as handbags are for you.

32.) If we ask what's wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like
nothing's wrong.

33.) We know you're lying, but it's just not worth the hassle.

Helllllooooo Aunt,

I'm on my way to Houston tomorrow.  I've sold the China cabinets, but not the TV cabinet. (Still working on it!)  Some people have finally shown a bid for my house but its a little less than I really wanted to sell it for, so I'm stalling.  I've pretty much sold everything else I own except for the knick-knacks.  I have to come back in a couple of weeks and take care of actually moving everything and collecting the money.   I'll be sure to keep you informed when I know more.

Love

Jon

Hi Jon,
Just a quick note to see how you are making out selling your house.  I hope things are going well.  Got a note from your mom and sounds like your dad's party went well.  Drop me a line when you have time.
Love   Donna

Do You Yahoo!?
Make international calls << File: http://phonecard.yahoo.com/ >>  for as low as $0.04/minute with Yahoo! Messenger.

please price

Charlie,
 
I have a customer ready to do a one year basis  deal.  Can you give me a quote for your offer on a Sumas basis for the  attached volumes?  If they like the price they may do it this afternoon or  tomorrow morning.  
 
Thanks.

The AGA number was definitely more bullish than anyone expected and it has caused us to rally to levels that I didn't think we were going to see a long time.  But, I do not think that the trend has changed.  In my humble opinion, I think that the number was probably an adjustment of over statements of inventory over the past 8 weeks. I do not believe that the number should have any baring on the numbers going forward.

I still expect us to trend down, but it will probably take an extra week to recover from this move.

Regards,

Jon

Jon
Has your view that we are likely to see prices trending down changed based on the AGA numbers that we saw yesterday?  Or is that just a short term fluctuation?
KJ

Empress can be traded in either, but for these purposed we would have it in USD/MMBtu.

Jon

Is Empress traded in USD?  Please let me know.

Here is how Gator's treat there young.  Also, you are  correct, the API polls have Florida ranked one, Miami ranked two, and Florida State ranked 6.  Florida did not have the most vote for the number one place (Miami had more) but non the less are coming out of the gate in the number one spot.  Do you think the sports writers spent all their time in Florida, or what?  Crazy!

  This does not constitute an official document. If you have not received
  your itinerary/receipt by fax or mail prior to the date of travel, please
  pick-up the itinerary/receipt at any Air Canada ticket counter if you are
  travelling between Canada and another country. If you are travelling within
  Canada, you only need to obtain a boarding pass at the airport check-in
  counter, or at the departure gate if travelling without checked luggage.

Don't worry with the 11GJ's just as long as we have the proper volumes over here.  Also, leap years are observed in the gas business.  When working out the number of days on excel, if you take the month in advance and subtract the current month it will give the correct number of days (including leap years).
 
Regards,
 
Jon

Jon,  Thanks for everything.  There was a small error in the buy sheet for haul - all yesterday.  I have attached a correct one.  the problem was the final buy numbers did not divide by the days in the month evenly.  the total is out 11 GJs.  Just let me know what to do.  sorry!  Also, for February on a long term contract covering a leap year, do we need to incorporate a different formula to buy for that leap month with 29 days.

Hi Jonathan, 
Our compliance department has just contacted us back regarding your request to hold a small cash account here to pay your RSP fees each year.  Their suggestion is that we sell the Janus mutual funds and convert this money to US funds then transfer it to your Dane Rascher account in the US because you are now a US resident and the Investment regulations want it handled that way.
You could simply send us a cheque for the RSP fees when we notify you each June. 
I hope you had a good holiday season, did you get home for Christmas?  Let me know by phone if we can proceed as suggested above and I will look after it for you in the new year.  Thanks.

Jon, can you update some SMED prices for me.  I would like to communicate to Kelly McNeill on Monday morning.

Darren

Hi Kelly,

We have had a quick sell-off in gas prices this A.M. A tropical wave that some were fearing would develop into a hurricane has not progressed and the fear that Gulf of Mexico gas production facilities would be threatened has dissipated. As well, hedge fund selling has pushed the market a little lower.

Indicative prices, subject to revision, for SMED's load shape, commencing Nov. 1/01:

1 yr - C$4.50/GJ
2 yr - C$4.65/GJ
3 yr - C$4.76/GJ
5 yr - C$4.87/GJ

Please let me know if there is anything further I can do for you at the moment. I will be leaving on holidays later today and will be returning on Aug. 20/01. In my absence, Greg Mann (663-2817) and Kate Joslyn (663-2801) are familiar with SMED's requirements and would be pleased to assist.

Regards,
Mark Dickin

Jonathan:

Thank you for your interest in becoming a member of the Houston Society of
Financial Analysts. The AIMR web site is your best resource for information
and forms regarding AIMR and HSFA membership.

The HSFA has two categories of membership: Regular and Affiliate. In short,
requirements for Regular membership are a college degree, the successful
completion of Level 1 and three years of acceptable professional work
experience. Requirements for Affiliate membership are a college degree and
one year of acceptable work experience. "Acceptable work experience" is
defined as a professional position in finance or accounting.

The HSFA holds weekly lunch meetings from September to May. The meetings are
at noon on Wednesdays at the Houston Club downtown, 811 Rusk. In addition,
there are usually three or four annual events in the evenings. After you
become a member, you will be alerted by mail and e-mail about every meeting
and event. For more HSFA information, check out
https://www.aimr.org/socservices/socpage.asp?society=HOUSTON .

To join the Houston Society, you also have to be a member of the national
AIMR organization. For AIMR membership, go to
https://www.aimr.org/memservices/join/apply.asp and fill out the Membership
Application Form.

The HSFA currently requires you to have three sponsors: your supervisor and
two HSFA members, one of whom must be outside your firm. (If your supervisor
is an HSFA member, then only two sponsors are required.) If you do not know
any HSFA members, there are people who have volunteered to serve as
sponsors. Attached is a list; just give one of them a call. The form that
your sponsors will need is attached. They may send them in directly to AIMR
or to you. At AIMR, your application package is bundled together and sent to
me for approval. I send it back to AIMR, and they will alert you of your
membership status (and invoice you for dues) by mail. The whole process can
take five weeks or more, because AIMR only processes applications once a
month.

Please call me if you have any more questions.

Deal NL3722 is a deal between ECC and another counterparty.  It is not a John

Thanks,

Errol,
These are the pubs that I changed August 8th pricing, according to Gas Daily 
Price Notice:

GD-TRCOZ6/NY $4.975 changed to $4.965
GDP-PG&E/LG-PKG $4.215 changed to $4.285

If you have any questions, please call me x5-8491.

Hey Johnelle,

It's great to here from you again.  Yeah, I'm over at Enron now.  I manage 
the group responsible for all of the natural gas financial trading risk 
management.  I've been here for a little over a year now.  It's a great job 
and company, but the hours are unbelievable!!!  The family's good.  How are 
Janna, Gina, (sp) and your mom.  I'm afraid to ask --- how old is Janna now?  
When you tell me, I'm going to feel really old!!  Tell everyone I said, 
'Hi'.  The NYMEX was only open for half the day, so I'm taking advantage.  
Call me when you get a minute!!

Robin Rodrigue and I tried to give you a call, but your voice mail says that 
there is no message recorded.  We looked at the October P/L and could not 
find an "Other" column with $9.2MM in it.  If you could, please give Robin a 
call at X5-7478, and she will be happy to answer your questions about this.

This morning it was discovered that a portion of John Arnold's Gas Daily 
position was being captured incorrectly as a February fixed price position 
instead of a February Index position.  I am currently working on  the problem 
and the positions will be captured correctly tonight.  John is aware of the 
situation and has stated that V@R does not need to be re-run.

The total mark to market value for US Gas EOL deals as of 07/31/2000 was:

   $274,477,942

Physical deals totalled $(375,805).  Financial deals totalled $274,853,749.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274

Let me know as soon as possible when you can do Sherry's review and the 
others as well, so I can get with Liz to schedule something that works for 
everyone.  They want the regular ones to be done by the end of next week, and 
Sherry's has to be done by Jan 19, 2001.

Thanks -- I know it's a pain,

Errol

Frank,

After looking the packet over in detail, I found the questions to be a great 
tool, especially the ones aimed at the 'soft skills'.  Previously when 
interviewing people I always struggled for a way to ask these type of 
questions legally and ethically.  I think the packet also will aid in my 
organization and will keep the interview moving at an efficient pace.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin

Jeff,

For a long time John and Mike have been letting counterparties who 
accidentally click on the Gas Daily stack change the deals to NYMEX swaps.  
The counterparty would let John/Mike know and then they would tell us.  In 
addition, at the end of the month, we would get calls from settlements and 
credit telling us (per the counterparty) that there were more deals that 
needed to be changed from GD to Nymex than we had changed.  John would let 
them change those deals too.

On Friday we changed some Jan. `01deals with Utilicorp that had been done in 
late November to NYMEX swaps.  Because of the timing there was a P/L impact 
of -$1.3MM.  When John saw this today he asked me what it was, I explained, 
and he stated that what they click on is what they get.  I relayed this to 
settlements and credit and that is why Kim is calling you b/c Reliant and 
Utilicorp are 'upset'.  They claim that they have John and Mike on tape 
letting them out of the GD deals and into NYMEX swaps.

We do not change the actual deals booked by EOL.  We book two new legs that 
create a NYMEX swap and flip out the GD deal.

Errol

Yes this is correct.  This is the reason Sherry and Amy have to flip out 
deals everyday.  EOL is only booking them to one leg.

Thanks,

Errol

The deals below were changed tonight per John Arnold.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin

should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

Mark,

Deals NZ9791 and NZ9950 were done between John Arnold (gas floor) and Fletch 
Sturm (power desk).  Deals done between desks inside Enron do not have deal 
tickets, nor do they get confirmed.  The details for these deals were 
included in the information picked up Friday.

I apologize for not relaying this sooner, but all question regarding the 
Management book (P&L, etc.) need to be directed to Georganne Hodges at 
713-853-0430.

Attached below is the forwards detail that you requested for the LTX GD book 
for 12/7/01 and for the NG Price book for 12/19/2001.

I am getting confirms on the deals in the table below and will call you as 
soon as I get them.  Please be advised that these deals are in the forwards 
details that I have already given you.  Also, deals QE6558 & QF4044 will not 
have confirms b/c they are intra-desk deals within Enron.

At your earliest convenience, could you please provide the applicable deal 
ticket and confirmation for each of the following deals?  Also, could you 
please provide the Forwards Detail for 12/19/00 as earlier requested?  Other 
outstanding items include:  A) Deal Tickets for Deals NZ9791.1 & NZ9950.1, B) 
Exotic Book Detail, C) Gas Daily EOL Book Detail, D) Support for MGMT P&L - 
Nov. ($130) & Dec. ($274), and E) the December Management  P&L Top Page.

Thank You,

Bianca,

Could you please fax up to me confirms for the following deals:

QE1352.2
QF4333.2,3
QF6287.1
QF6446.1
N60753.4&6

I'm gathering these for Arthur Andersen auditing purposes, so it would be a 
great help if I could get this pretty quickly.  The fax # is 646-2496.

Thanks,

Errol

I had the same problems with this that you all do.  That is why I told 
Gossett that if this is something that has to happen, then only people like 
Joe Hunter and 1or 2 others should be allowed to change the c/p names ONLY.  

Errol

   

I don't thing that is an option.  If we give you the ability to change names 
then you also have the ability to change other parts of the deals.  

Dave

   

In order for our credit exposure to be recorded correctly, our group 
(Financial Confirmations) would like to be able to change c/p names for all 
desks going forward.  One person will be designated to handle all changes and 
an email will be sent regarding these changes daily.  Please let me know how 
you feel about this?

Thanks for your time,

Bianca

Done.

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

Hey, man would you let me know when it is done? Thanks!!!

As a result of restructuring out-of-the-money transactions with BP Capital 
and T. Boon Pickens, we have a total of $9,530,935 in the Schedule C for the 
NG Price book.  These values are negative in Schedule C, thus they are 
positive value to the book.

A total of $9,321,151 will be released out of Schedule C tonite (8/29/2000).  
The remaining $209,784 will be relesed by the end of the week.  We are 
awaiting word on whether or not this value will be needed for credit reserve.

Hi, Errol:

I am doing great because I am going to join your group soon.  

I have a project in hand.  It was expected to be finished by mid Feburary and 
my current unit would let me go on Feb. 19.  
I am pushing hard to finish this project by the end of next week.  But I 
cannot guarantee it now.  Later this week I will have a better idea of 
whether I could report to you on Feb. 12.  Do you think this is OK?

I look forward working with you soon!  Have a great day!

Hey Sherry,

Here is the spreadsheet with the Duke Energy Marketing deals that I need you 
to flip to the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book as soon as possible.  I need to get an 
invoice to them within the next few hours as they need to settle with us on 
Monday.

If you could go through your book and flip any deals between ENA and Duke 
Energy Marketing LP to the P& book to settle with ECC that would help solve 
some problems.  Please let me know if you have any questions on this.  Just 
to let you know, Carole Frank took notes this morning when I walked her 
through running that download in TAGG.  It can be done for any counterparty 
in any book, so you can also run it for Duke Energy Marketing LP as well.

Thanks

Hi Errol & Sherry,

We received confirmations for the above referenced
deals from Paribas (they confirm us) and Paribas' confirm
differs from what we show in TAGG.  Paribas' trader, Herve,
says that he spoke with John Arnold after the deal was done 
and changed the price from 8.15 to 8.14 and the index from
Gas Daily to NYMEX.     TAGG still reflects the terms that
EOL has.  

Can one of you please find out if John Arnold agreed to these
changes, and if so, can you make the necessary changes
to TAGG?  

Let me know.
Thanks a lot,

I have attached an Excel file that values Pete Keavey's Gas Daily swaps and 
options.  In looking at the spreadsheet that you sent, I found these to be 
the most incorrectly valued.  In order to get the valuations, I had book 
administators run calculations in the ERMS system.  These values should 
correlate with how credit valued these deals.  The file consists of a summary 
worksheet for each month and a detail worksheet for each month.  Please feel 
free to call, or have Homer call, with any questions that you have.

(Mike's swaps in the Exotic book,  new blotters, etc.).  The P&L portion of 
the process has been significantly more difficult, but after working through 
last night , I will have the P&L completely split out by the end of today.

Thanks for your help & patience,

Errol

The following deals are being disputed by Reliant Energy Services. TAGG is 
showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they 
should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by 
Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals:

=09
=09 Only three times since 1983 has Texas opened the season 3-0: 1984, 1985=

1994. Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie (1984) or=
=20
losses (1985 and 1994). In each of those seasons, Texas ended up with four=

losses. =20
=09
=09 In UT's two best seasons since 1983, a 10-2 campaign in 1990 and a 10-2=
-1=20
run in 1995, the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season,=

respectively. Before Texas can dream about winning a national title, the=20
Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss.=20
=09
=09=20
=09
=09
=09Longhorn Q & A=20
=09 Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as well as the last three games of l=
ast=20
season) it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue. There =
is=20
also no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think th=
e=20
best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on=20
offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving=
=20
us. =20
=09
=09In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our b=
est=20
athletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experience=
d=20
players, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the=
=20
ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to sta=
rt=20
Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and=
=20
play a one-back offensive set. Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively a=
nd=20
Hodges Mitchell is not an I-back who is adept at following the fullback=20
through the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people=
=20
miss in the open field.=20
=09
=09I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarter=
back.=20
Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and=
=20
probably does) possess all of the same skills. He just hasn't had the chanc=
e=20
to display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if=
=20
we are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season=20
slipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?=20
=09 ?? The Jackson residence=20
=09
=09 BROWN:  With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out=

change coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are telli=
ng=20
this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be to=
o=20
much change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to=
=20
this Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some=
=20
resolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all=
=20
the positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and=
=20
Notre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT th=
en=20
lost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,=
=20
Oklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's=
=20
opponent, Houston.=20
=09
=09That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread =
was=20
that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its=
=20
loss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolv=
e=20
to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that=20
could go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a ha=
rd=20
team to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhor=
ns=20
are not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to=
=20
his team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will b=
e=20
scrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There will be enough fire=20

because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the=

see how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic =

what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other =20

=09
=09Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mac=

Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of=

=20
wanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.=
=20
However, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team "up" sometime=
s=20
and can't adjust the team's mood during a game.=20
=09
=09About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible =
for=20
the offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than on=
e,=20
I put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges=
=20
Mitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis=
=20
love Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of=
=20
those yards were "move=20
=09
=09 the chains" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground=
 and=20
protect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but=
=20
all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning th=
e=20
run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.=20
=09
=09Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive=
=20
tackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through t=
he=20
linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there=
=20
with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a=
=20
receiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.
=09
=09Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY tim=
e=20
against Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury=
=20
may have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up=

=09How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were=

=09
=09 BROWN:  I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are=20
incredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday=
's=20
events. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat=
=20
the team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any=
=20
other part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still=20
learning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.=20
=09
=09To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated a=
nd=20
needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,=20
fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probabl=

isn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams di=

and Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question=

team.=20
=09
=09Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the=
=20
quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still=
=20
working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There'=
s=20
no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are=
=20
the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the=
=20
line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between=20
Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.=
=20
=09
=09Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it =
was=20
taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about=
=20
that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards=20
deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some=20
blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,=20
Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.=20
=09
=09Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in=
=20
games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.=
=20
The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl=
=20
Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a coupl=
e=20
who can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. B=
ut=20
that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because=
=20
one player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed =
to=20
block a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That play=
er=20
has been chewed out every which way.
=09
=09As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brow=
n,=20
who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't sa=
y=20
anything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still=

have a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so=

early will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss=20
constructively or destructively.=20

=09 Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding=

This deal has been changed to a NYMEX swap at $8.14.

Thanks,

Hi Errol.  Have you had any luck with these two deals?

Thanks, Diane

Hi Errol & Sherry,

We received confirmations for the above referenced
deals from Paribas (they confirm us) and Paribas' confirm
differs from what we show in TAGG.  Paribas' trader, Herve,
says that he spoke with John Arnold after the deal was done 
and changed the price from 8.15 to 8.14 and the index from
Gas Daily to NYMEX.     TAGG still reflects the terms that
EOL has.  

Can one of you please find out if John Arnold agreed to these
changes, and if so, can you make the necessary changes
to TAGG?  

Let me know.
Thanks a lot,
Diane

Shannon,

I am in the process of cleaning up the February folder.  When finished you 
will see two DPR's - NG-Price & NG-PR-OPT.  Mike and John have decided to 
split out the old NG-Price book so that swaps/futures go to John and 
options/exchange options go to Mike.  I will call you as soon as I have it 
done.  Tonight is the first night we are using the new book.  I have not 
heard anything back regarding the January variance since I left you the voice 
mail.

Thanks,

Errol

   Shannon McPearson @ ECT                02/26/2001 11:11 AM

Errol,

I received a book request for the NG Options Book (Code ZH). Will this be a 
new roll in the NG Price book, associated with the PG book code? Also, I 
noticed that the PG book has three DPR's in the February folder. Should I be 
using the 022001NG DPR or the 022001NGmike and 022001NGjohn? What did you and 
Todd decide to do with the January variance from the NGP&L? Too many 
questions!!

Thanks!

Shannon

Dawne,

The options should go to NG-PR-OPT, but the underlying swap should continue 
be between NG-Price and NG-Exotic.

Thanks,

Errol

Dawn C Kenne@ECT
02/26/2001 11:50 AM
With this new book, you want the option to go to NG-PR-OPT (it is going to 
NG-PRICE now) and the underlying swap to be between NG-PRICE and NG-PR-OPT?

Please confirm!

I just came across a counterparty that needs to be flipped to the 
FT-US/CAND-ERMS book for all deals in Houston books.  ECC has now signed a 
Master Swap Agreement with Aquila Canada Corp., and all deals traded with ENA 
and Aquila Canada Corp. need to be settled with ECC in the P& book.  These 
deals are showing up in TAGG as settling with ENA, could you all please keep 
an eye out for deals with this company and flip them right away.

Please let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks
Stacey

These deals were killed because we have terminated all deals with BP CAPITAL, 
T BOONE PICKENS, and PICKENS FUEL CORP.  Since there were so many deals we 
did not put comments in the deals.  However, deal tickets have been provided 
explicitely explaining what the Middle Market Group is doing w/ these 
companies.

Thanks,

Errol

Looks good.

Harassment Avoidance FAQ

What do I do if I've already taken the class?
If you've already attended a session in the past while employed with Enron, 
you do not have to attend these sessions.  A "Refresher Course" will be 
offered at no cost.  

How do those of us attend the Harassment Avoidance if I do not work in 
Houston?
We are making the Harassment Avoidance sessions available on Video to be 
forwarded to your HR manager.   You are NOT encouraged to make travel 
arrangements to attend the Houston sessions.

Who pays the $50?
The $50 fee will be billed to your cost center. Individuals are not expected 
to pay.

Are there any additional dates than those listed on previous email?
Due to the number of people who have not attended in the past, we are making 
special arrangements to offer more classes in the next few months. 

It is important to note, that unless you've recieved a confirmation, you are 
not enrolled.  

All remaining questions or concerns need to be directed to David Foster 
(x.54360) or by email (david.foster@enron.com).

	
	

To contribute our personal best at ENRON, our conduct must promote respectful 
and co-operative work relationships. Workplace harassment conflicts with 
ENRON's vision and values and violates Company policy.  Harassment also can 
violate federal and state laws.  By understanding what harassment is and its 
potential harm, we can prevent it in our workplace.

We are pleased to announce that all employees of EWS and EES will receive 
harassment prevention training soon.  This training is mandatory for all 
ENRON employees.

During this training you will:

 Be able to recognize harassment
 Learn to take precautions against being harassed
 Learn to avoid being considered a harasser
 Know how to address a situation involving harassment
 Learn how harassment prevention is consistent with ENRON values

Please click here (  )  to sign up for the session of your choice.    If you 
have problems registering or have any questions, please call 713 853-0357.

The dates and times available for the sessions are:

 Tuesday, Feb 20; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15; 4:30 - 6:00
 Friday, Feb 23; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15
  Monday Mar 5; 1:00 - 2:30; 2:45 - 4:15; 4:30 - 6:00

All training sessions will be held in the LaSalle Room at the DoubleTree 
Hotel.

Please see the attached new book request for the NG-Price book.  John Arnold 
is now trading crude on EOL and they are booking to NG-Price.  Of course, we 
have to have this today.

Thank you,

Errol

BT is no longer a valid counterparty (according to TAGG when you go into the 
deal).  One can not save a deal w/ an invalid c/p name in the deal.  Jennifer 
Blay is currently trying to get us the correct counterparty name.

Thanks, Errol

   

Errol-

There are two Bankers Trust Deals that you changed to Bankers Trust 
International. I pulled the trades from EOL and they say Bankers Trust. The 
Deal Nos are QT6916 and QT7116. Were these changed in error?

Thanks. Julie

John,

In the Position folder.  I saved a file called 'GammaFile'.  The worksheet we 
looked at is called "calculator".  The password is: price.

Thanks,  Errol

Dawn,

John Arnold is now hitting the crude oil stacks.  Currently the deals are 
booking to NG-Price.  Attached is a completed new book request form with the 
short name for his new crude book - NG-Price-Crude.  We are changing the 
deals to the new book today, but we need them to start booking automatically 
tomorrow, if possible.  We can discuss in the meeting at 4 pm.

Thanks, 

Errol

Per the below notice from Legal.  "Bankers Trust" is still a valid Trading 
entity, and we should continue to book Trades to this Entity.  Can you please 
change GCP from "Suspended" to "Active".

Thanks,

Deutsche Bank has gotten back to me and is vacillating on what they want to 
do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't thought 
through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online 
documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the 
trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until we hear back from 
them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades 
and master sit.

Please change these.

Errol, can you look at these deals in tagg stage and let me know if this is 
how they are supposed to look?  These are the deals with the option having 
NG-PR-OPT, but the swap remaining the same as before.  If everything looks ok 
we will put into production this evening.  

Let me know...

Sorry Dawn, QS7544 is not correct.  This deal is an option and is booked to 
NG-Exotic.  It should be booked to NG-PR-OPT.

Thanks,

I am getting a tournament bracket together for the group. Here are the 
important details - $10 per entry, bonus points per upset predicted are the 
differential between the seeds(i.e. 12 beats a five you get 1 pt for the 
victory and seven points for the upset), first round games worth 1 pt., and 
the points for each subsequent round are the round plus 1 pt. (championship 
game worth 7 pts., sixth round plus 1 pt.), tie breaker is total points 
scored in final game.  Brackets are due on my desk or in my email box by 8 
a.m. CST Thursday March 15th.  Here is a link to a bracket.  Please forward 
to anyone you think may be interested.

Deal NN6788.1 with Citibank has been killed.  This was an EOL deal that 
Citibank and John Arnold agreed to cut in half.  Deal QF9221.1 was booked in 
Dec. for half the volume of the original deal.  Unfortunately, deal NN6788.1 
was not killed when we booked the new deal.  Please call me with any 
questions.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274

Durch,

It looks like the unwind was booked incorrectly. Instead of deal QF9221.1 
netting out the original deal, it was adding to it.  I have killed deal 
NN6788.1 for 5000/day, so that all that is left is the deal for 2500/day.

Errol

  
	
	

Errol,

Check this in the system and see if he is being billed for the original deal 
and an unwind deal to net him to the correct position.
Let me know or contact Perry please.

was cancelled per our discussion and rebooked for half the volume in
November (I beleive it was November).  Your deal number on the rebook is

we originally discussed the deal.

I wanted to take a few minutes to not only introduce myself, but also to 
inform you that ProjectGEM - the Windows2000 Global Enron Migration - is well 
underway and is now approaching your group to begin the initial steps of 
upgrading to this newer operating system. 
Currently Jeff Gossett is our pilot for this business unit and is testing out 
all applications associated with your business unit.  We expect to migrate 
Finance and Administration Wednesday or Thursday of next week (4/4 - 4/5)
As a former member of T.S.G. (TradeFloor Support Group - EB31/32) - I'm well 
aware of the time constraints and schedules you all must work with. 
Therefore, I would like to start the migration process first with visiting 
with each of you, going thru a 'profile process' that should last no more 
than 10-15min. Profiling can begin as early as today- so here is what I ask 
of you: 
*** Please reply to this e-mail with your current location, the number of 
PC's you have and the number of screens/displays you have attached to each 
PC, as well a date/time that I can stop by. Being that most of you sit in the 
same, general location - I'm hoping this profiling process should take no 
more than a few days. *** 
Feel free to e-mail/call me should you have any questions or any specific 
concerns with this process, as we strive to ensure the migration from WinNT 
to Win2K is a smooth, efficient one.

Errol,

There are two trades that were done with Mirant Americas through 
Intercontinental Exchange.  TAGG does not reflect these trades.  I faxed the 
broker statements to Sherry D. and she stated that she forwarded them to 
you.  Trade dates were on Nov. 13th and Nov. 14.  I also asked Joe Hunter to 
check into this and he stated that he had spoken to you some time last week 
or the week before and stated that you would be getting back with me on the 
TAGG deal numbers.
 
When I querried TAGG this morning selecting Intercontinental Exchange as the 
broker, no deals were found.

Can you please let me know the deal numbers as these trades need to be 
settled as soon as possible.

Thanks,

2) The $338,955 for the Vitro Corprativo deal will be granted tonight.

Thanks,

Please review the following file (the tab marked "2001 Summary") and help me 
answer the following questions for March:

1.  Two additional originations "corrections" of $379.50 each were granted to 
Mexico, but I don't think they belong to us.

2.  The $338,955 Vitro Corporativo Deal #QW8224 was not granted to Mexico, 
but my originator, Agustin Perez, says it should have been.  Please let me 
know if you are responsible for this deal.

I will be in Monterrey from Wednesday through Friday but will be checking my

Irena,

The team provides us with great service currently.  The only area of 
improvement I can think of regards new-hires.  I need to give you and your 
team a better heads-up when I have new someone coming on.  If we could come 
up with a checklist of everything they need (computers, phones, basic 
supllies, etc.) and have them already at there desk when they start, that 
would help.  I know that the last few people that have come on were last 
minute additions, so there is not much we could have done.  Hopefully, we 
won't have as many space issues in the future.

I really appreciate the work the team is doing currently.  I will work hard 
to give you more lead time when I am adding someone to the group.

Thanks,

Errol

   
	
	

Please reply to the below request, if you have not already done so.

Thank you,

Irena  

Per our off site meeting,

 I would like each of you to send a list of your administrative needs to me.  
Also, what do you feel 
that the administrative team can do/improve for your group(s), that can 
cause  a substantial change for the best?  

 After I receive these listings, I will be meeting with each of you to 
discuss.

Thank you,

Irena

Jeremy,

John and I really need to meet Tuesday for about 30min-1hr with you Dave and 
Sanjeev, so that we can better understand how the options are being calc'd in 
the system.  We thought we had a pretty good idea after talking on Friday, 
but tonight we see that we don't.  John is about one half million dollars off 
every night in his prediction of the P/L for Mike's book, and we're afraid 
our position might not be correct as well.

Please give me a call.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274

John:

The reason for the large Vega numbers on the TopPage report, while there were 
no corresponding changes in the Volatility curves, is due to the change in 
the mid. price for the current day versus the prior day. The corresponding 
volatility skews that are added to the vols. for the 2 days is causing the 
large vega numbers.

For example, for deal number QV5087.2 (exp. date 01-Jan-2002):

  Current Day  Prior Day
Mid. Price 5.885   5.772
Strike Price 3.5   3.5
Mid - Strike 2.385   2.272
Vol.  0.555   0.555
Vol. Skew 0.03816   0.03635
Actual Vol. 0.59316   0.59135

Option value for prior day using current day's vol. =  7,616,935  
Option value for prior day using prior day's vol.     =  7,547,238 
Vega                =  69,697

Errol and Joey,
Just an FYI - 
The Middle Market - West gas orig group is changing it's name to Gas 
Origination - West.  Now when you enter Orig into the West file the Orig 
Group should be the new name.  
Also, on your Orig Schedule please start showing the West orig as Gas 
Origination - West so that everything will match when it is published to the 
web. 

thanks,
brad

working, so I can't get to the part of the website to print off the coupon.  
Could you resend this e-mail to me please.

I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be checking my voicemail 
frequently and communicating with my group.  If the same problem arises 
tomorrow, please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss, because

Sara:

Julie Beck (VP Finance - Inland Paperboard and Packaging) has given me the 
name of another attorney who will review the new ISDA and confirms:

 Jack Falconi,  (214) 360-4865,  jfalconi@gfbank.com

Temple Inland (the parent  -  will provide a $15 million guaranty) has worked 
with Jack in the past and wants him involved.  

It might be a good idea to call Jack.  I am not clear on the role that Grant 
Adamson will play (Grant gave us comments on the earlier ISDA).  From what 
Julie said, I think that Jack will be our main legal contact at this point.

Thanks,  Jim

Melissa Murphy has asked me to revise the language for all financial power 
products on EnronOnline.  Please let me know if the section below (in blue) 
is o.k. by you.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Thanks,

Hello, Kim Theriot and Leslie Reeves have spoken with Debbie Brackett in 
credit to discuss the payment date for financial power transactions done on 
EnronOnline.  The confirmation letters (for all financial power trades) that 
I send out have the following payment date language on them:

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price 
is determinable (for trades one month or longer)

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the last day of the month that 
includes the Determination Period (for trades less than one month)

The language on EnronOnline is different.  EnronOnline has 10 calendar days 
instead of 5 Business Days (see the EnronOnline definition below).

Debbie Brackett wants the payment date to remain as 5 days for netting 
purposes across ENA.

Please let me know if there is anything else I need to do in order to get 
this language changed on EOL for all financial power products.

Thank you,
Melissa

Alan's response is correct.  You might check with Shari to see if she has 
made additonal inquires of Mexican counsel.  Sara

   

Per the email below, do you have any other legal advice with respect to 
trading issues we should address with Mexican counsel when we send out the 
updates below.  Please let me know ASAP, we hope to get our letter out Monday.

I believe we did the initial survey in 1996-97 in Mexico (Sara and I worked 
on it together), cobering financial and physical trading. I don't know if 
there have been any updates since that time. You should check with Steve Van 
Hooser, Sara Shackleton and Peggy Banczak. I do not have any issues to add to 
the original survey.

Alan

   

We need to update the advice we received from Mexican counsel to address the 
online trading issue.  I spoke to Nony and while we're at it I'm also going 
to ask whether there are any other updates since they rendered their original 
advice.  Are there are other issue you would like to add to our request for 
advice?

for your convenience.  Please let me know if those changes are acceptable.  
If so, I
will have clean copies thereof sent to you to sign, and fax back to my 
attention after
which I will provide you with a countersigned copy.  If not, I can be reached

I have a copy of an "equity swap" between ENE and JEDI SPV I, LLC dated April 
20, 2000 which wants to be a "forward", and which terminates on Sept. 11, 
2000. The transaction is for 12,012,804 shares and a Notional USD

Can you send me a copy of the JEDI LP "forward" which appears on Jill's

CA has responded with the following comments:

(1)  Additional Event of Default - CA will accept if minimum ratings are set 
at BBB- or Baa3.

(2)  Financials -  no Cargill entities provide quarterly financials as a 
matter of practice.

(3)  Setoff - will not agree to our usual affiliate setoff language but will 
agree to setoff under the ISDA  or other agreements.

CA has not accepted our cross default threshold language or guaranty pending 
a determination from their credit group.

Regarding the above party, ENA submitted arbitration and the response was to

Clem:

Per my voice mail,  please respond to the remaining issues raised by ConEd's 
lawyer:

(1)  "Guarantor agrees that its obligations are unconditional and will not be 
discharged except by complete payment of the amounts payable under the 
Contract, [without setoff of the amount payable under the Contract] 
irrespective of any claims as to the Contract's validity, regularity or 
enforceability or the lack of authority of Enron to execute or deliver the 
Contract, or any change or amendment to the Contract (whether or not approved 
by or known to Guarantor).'

Response:  the bracketed language is unacceptable.  What about the bolded 
language?

(2)  "This Guaranty shall continue to be effective if the Guarantor merges or 
consolidates with or into another entity, loses its separate legal identity 
or ceases to exist."

Response:  not sure if this will remain effective if a merger occurs and 
therefore not binding (e.g., merger without assumption)

(3)  What are you looking for when requiring an "explanation of why such 
payment is due" in the demand section (paragraph 2)?  Is it to identify the 
type of default suffered by ENA?

Thanks for your response and I'll let you know if this particular guaranty is 
still a rush.  SS

Sara Shackleton

Janelle:

I reviewed the email of 1/19/01 from Ben Chu.  There are only 2 items listed:

(1)  I will beef up the language to make it absolutely clear that ENA can 
select the price only if it hears from ConEd first.

(2)  I am not sure that I agree about the NY ISO changing pricing after 30 
days.  We will need to discuss.  I have heard that this is not as frequent an 
occurrence as in the past and we are using the same mechanism as the ISDA 
procedure for change in prices.

(3)  Other than the foregoing, he had no other comments exept to say that he 
would review again.  

Sara Shackleton

A few items to consider for the paralegals:

(1)  We need to organize the various country opinions (ISDA closeout netting, 
ENA jurisdictional survey, others) so that they are accessible to the group.  
We should also have a checkout process for the opinions.  We should have 
access to the ECTRIC opinion database (which I believe is organized online).  
I know that I can look in a particular file cabinet located near Susan for 
the various volumes of opinions, but where can I find an updated listing of 
all of the above?

(2)  Impress upon everyone the importance of entering information into Lotus 
Notes (for ALL types of agreements).

(3) I believe that Sam is in charge of the unanimous consents (for all Enron 
affiliates).  I for one would like an UPDATED book of the consents (kept 
updated).  These consents must be maintained and kept current.  If Sam is out 
of the office, we need access to the book.

(4)  We should create a "paralegal manual" as we go.  Each person could be 
responsible for drafting sections (and you could review their drafting 
skills!).  Given some time, I could probably help to identify relevant 
sections.

(5)  Agreement checkout.  We need to create a "checkout card" for each file 
so that when files are returned to the file cabinet, the checkout card is 
retired and placed inside the file for the next checkout.  I will volunteer 
my assistant to help out but I don't want to step out of turn here so I'll 
wait to hear from you.

(6)  I have the sense from some of the legal-credit meetings that everyone 
needs to be reminded to follow up on outstanding ISDA's (mainly the Top Ten 
and high priority items). 

I'll send additional items as they occur to me.  Thanks.  Sara

I just finished a conversation with Mara Alexander re:  Cargill-Alliant,

reviewed that master but if she is right, we should not have a problem 
complying with the request.  SS

move negotiations forward by agreeing to your proposed $100MM
Regarding the Set-Off issue, I attach language for your consideration
which demonstrates our agreement to include a Non-Defaulting Party's
Affiliates.  This language does not, however, make Set-Off available
in all instances, but rather restricts it to the market standard of
set-off in cases of any Event of Default and the Credit Event Upon
Merger Termination Event.  In light of our agreement to the 3 major
items above, we ask that you consider using the attached language in

With regard to Credit's "initialling-off" on the Confirmation signature 
pages, that would be my call.  I know we have done so with some other 
structured deals.

So my apologies if this was not to be the case.  If you prefer, Brenda can 
run off new signature pages (where legal wil "initial-off" only).  The others 
can be destroyed.

John Fortunato has advised me that CP has only three (3) issues with the

(1)  CP financials available online - we'll need their website address

(2)  CP Threshold for cross default is too low and wish a "higher number" but 
have not given John any indication of what they want

Please let John and Stephanie know the outcome so that we can prepare 
executable docs.  Thanks.

Rod: Will you please read the email attached below from Cargill and let me 
know the proper Enron party?  Ed has punted this one to you.  Thanks.

And, I hope things are going well.  I know you'll miss rodeo time here in the 
Bayou City.  I just received an invitation (courtesy of  Enron) to the BBQ 
cookoff at the Reliant Astrodome Park (you know, the dome).  I'll bet your

Dear Sara & Cheryl,

I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
International, S.A. ("CISA"), to begin negotiations for
them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.

There had been some question as to which Enron entity
was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
get this ISDA started on Enron's part.

Hello there!  Long time no see!  Can you please give me a call (EXT. 35620) 
to discuss ESA in general?  I want to have Marie Heard available as well so 
that at least two people can keep track of your activity.  Thanks.  Sara

ps  My immediate inquiry is the entity hedging South Americal risk

John:  Please have Caraustar call Paul Radous about the cross default issue.  
Legal will wait to hear back from Paul after his discussion with your 
counterparty.

We are ok with reciprocal website financials.  Please have the counterparty 
call me to discuss the cross default threshold.  We use a widely accepted 
standard in the industry, which is 2% of total debt, rounded.  In fact, by 
this standard, Enron has set it's own threshold too low.

Paul:

John Fortunato has advised me that CP has only three (3) issues with the 
draft which we delivered in November, 2000.  The credit issues are:

(1)  CP financials available online - we'll need their website address

(2)  CP Threshold for cross default is too low and wish a "higher number" but 
have not given John any indication of what they want

Please let John and Stephanie know the outcome so that we can prepare 
executable docs.  Thanks.

P.S.  The legal issue was governing law, Texas or NY.  CP doesn't care but 
needs confirmation and possibly explanation.

Clem:

I know that you sent Sheila Glover a form of ENE guaranty a few weeks ago.  
Sheila forwarded it to Bear and we received Bear's form which is 
unacceptable.  However, if ENE has outstanding guaranties in favor of Bear, I 
would need to know since we may be able to use a previously negotiated form.

Can you let me know if ENE has ever issued such a guaranty?

Thanks.  SS

I don't believe so Sara.  Initially, the cp wanted to do a financial trade 
but since then Chris Foster informed me that they are now looking to take it 
physical.  Therefore, I recently sent a request to the physical power legal 
team to process a draft EEI.

I will advise if financial becomes a priority but it doesn't look like it at 
this time.

Thanks for following up.

Tracy:

We can't move any further with Southern California Water Company (for 
derivatives trading) as they believe that the company requires CA PUC 
approval.  Does legal need to actively pursue this party for financial 
trading?

Melissa:

Please refer to Janelle's request for a draft confirm.  The  counterparty's 
draft has a floating price reference and you should verify with Janelle.  Use 
the ISDA format; the counterparty is the "Power Authority for the State of

Rather than a "redline" of their confirmation, maybe its better if we just 
send our confirmation, and see if that would be acceptable.  Can you either 
email me the appropriate draft to distribute to them or have it distributed 
directly? Thanks.
Janelle
Hi, Janelle - Per our conversation this morning, the appropriate contact
would be Jackie Kmiotek-Welsh in our Legal Dept.  You can e-mail her the
agreement with the desired changes (redline) to her. If you could cc Terryl,

The only change from our previous conversation is the addition of a bilateral 
additional event of default tied to a debt rating (below BBB-) of the 
counterparty or the guarantor if applicable.

Guarantors:
1. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
2. not required; entity rated AA
3. not requried; entity rated AA
4. Bear Stearns Cos. Inc.
5. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.
6. not required; entity rated AA

Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

Tanya:  Based upon our earlier conversation, I will begin preparing masters 
for the following parties with (1) no CSA, (2) bilateral cross-default at 
US$100 million and (3) uncapped (or min US$100 million cap) guaranties for 
counterparties required to post guaranties.  The parties on Clint's list are:

(1)  Lehman Brothers Finance S.A. [have form of master and a form of guaranty 
from Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.] - Stephanie Panus

(2)  Credit Suisse First Boston International [no form of master]

(3)  Deutsche Bank AG [have a form of master from ENA negotiations]

(4)  Bear Stearns International Limited [no form of master] - Samantha Boyd

(5)  Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc. [may develop form from ENA 
negotiations]

(6)  Credit Agricole Indosuez S.A.

Tanya:  Please let me know if any of the foregoing require parent guaranties.

Clint:  Please identify the lawyer to whom I should address comments.  Also, 
are there any others?  ENE has an agreement with Toronto Dominion, NY Branch.

Samantha:  Please assign Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank and let me know who 
is handling.

I am copying Sara on this b/c I would be interested in her input if she has a 
different take than I do.

I understand your message to mean that P&G is offering a representation from 
them that they will strictly adhere to their corporate derivatives policy 
(with a copy of the policy attached to the contract), and, in exchange for 
this, they would like the "No Reliance" representation deleted entirely.

I don't really see how such a representation helps us with the "No Reliance" 
problem.   The CFTC has ruled that in a dealer/customer context, if the 
customer relies on the dealer's expertise in entering into a trade, then the 
trade may be unenforceable against the customer.  The legal principle is one 
of fiduciary duty and doesn't really have anything to do with corporate 
authorization.  In other words, the fact that the trade is authorized does 
not change the fact that the customer is relying on the dealer's superior 
knowledge.

In its 1996 lawsuit with Bankers Trust, Procter & Gamble unwound an interest 
rate swap position when they ended up about $200 million out of the money.  
P&G argued that they were relying on BT due to BT's superior expertise in 
interest rate markets, and therefore P&G shouldn't have to pay.  The issue of 
whether or not P&G was authorized to enter into the swaps was not an issue at 
all in that case, nor would it be an issue, in my opinion, if P&G sought to 
unwind a pulp and paper swap with us based on our alleged superior expertise 
in pulp and paper markets.

The danger of having positions unwound has made the "No Reliance" clause one 
of the most important clauses in the ISDA for us.  I will look at and 
consider any particular language they may wish to propose, but conceptually, 
we can not trade with counterparties who wish to rely on our market expertise 
in deciding whether to enter into a trade. -- Bob

Bob,

P&G business contact mentioned that they have inserted the following into 
their ISDA schedules:

1) a clause that states that P&G will strictly adhere to their corporate 
derivatives policy (that covers deal terms, hedged risks, etc.) and append 
the ISDA with the corporate policy....

Is this something we can consider???  Policy spells out types of deals they 
can and can't enter...therefore, they can't sue us (hopefully) if they have 
followed their policy guidelines...

Thanks.

Mr. Wagner,

Larry Johnson has asked that I respond to your request regarding that status
of our review of your ISDA agreement.  Our counsel has requested that we use
TVA's standard agreement as a starting point, which I have attached for your
review.

All:  Do you need any of the ISDA "boilerplate" language ( the ISDA Master 
Agreement and the ISDA Credit Support Annex) to attach to the draft 
Schedules/Paragraph 13 which we prepare to send to our counterparties?  We do 
not have the "boilerplate" in a word document.

Also, is there anything that Houston legal can do to facilitate your 
transactions?

I would like to contact you in order to follow up to your conversation of
last week with Mr. Chuck Cerria regarding executing an ISDA between numerous
Hess entities and numerous Enron entities.  Unfortunately, I do not have

There are no outstanding issues as to the Tiger guaranty.  We need to have it

I never received any word beyond your e:mail concerning the Tiger Guaranty.

Therefore, the Guaranty has not been sent to Clement for signature.

I will be happy to help when called upon.

On Friday, did you send the Tiger guaranty to Clem for execution?  SS

It's official!  Rod Nelson has been promoted to Director.

But you have to keep reading to get the entire message which is:  I'm so 
pleased to hear of your promotion, and, how well deserved.  We'll have to

I gave my hard-copy of the Act itself (in the version we agreed upon) to 
Kaye, along w/ copies of three or four law firm memos on the CFMA, in case 
you think any or all of those should be included in the binder.  I told Kaye

Does anyone have the blue file for Nexen Marketing (formerly CXY Energy

cabinet.

Carol:

Here's another paper & pulp master with a relatively new deal person (Steve 
Klein).  The file has sat for ages and it looks like outside counsel has some 
time (he's a good guy).  Please let me know.

Also, I spoke with Mark and I'd like to sit down with you to do some 
brainstorming/planning, e.g., a group offsite, in-house training, form 
changes.  Today is not a good day but tomorrow is fine.  How about 2 pm?

Sara:

Any chance you are available at 1:30pm on Wednesday for a call regarding the
Enron/Corrugated Services ISDA?  If that time will not work for you, please
suggest another time tomorrow afternoon that would.

Also, you will be receiving on Thursday morning a copy of some of the more
relevant documentation relating to the June 2000 drop down of the Corrugated
Services, Inc. operating assets and liabilities (including the original
Enron/Corrugated Services, Inc. ISDA) into a newly formed limited
partnership known as Corrugated Services, L.P.  In connection with that
transaction, Corrugated Services, Inc. changed its name to CSI Holdings,
Inc.  CSI Holdings, Inc. also formed at that time and now owns 100% of CSI
GP, Inc., which entity serves as the general partner of Corrugated Services,
L.P.  All of this was done to create a more franchise tax efficient
operating and ownership structure.

Based on the foregoing, we believe that it will be necessary to redocument
the original agreement either through an amendment thereto or the
cancellation thereof and the creation of a new LP/Enron agreement.

We plan on discussing the foregoing during our call tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks.

Sara:

I have made some inquiry and verified that the Bear Stearns Stock Loan
enhanced leveraged product is indeed what is under consideration.

As promised, I have a brief step-by-step  explanation of such a stock loan
transaction, which is appended to this message.  There are actually two
possible scenarios: one where cash collateral is used for the stock loan,
the other where actual securities are used as collateral.  We understand
that, at least initially, you will be using bonds as collateral.

The Stock Loan Agreement is used in connection with our current form of
Institutional Account Agreement which ECT may not have signed.  I therefore
also append that agreement to this message.

I expect you waill wnat to review these attachments before we speak again.
Again, as a reminder, I will be on vacation from Friday the 16th through the
following week.  If you would like to speak before hand, or if you have any
questions regarding any of the documents, please let me know.

Regards,

Sharon

Do you want to follow up with Koch?  Or do you want legal to pursue?  A draft 
was sent out on 01/08/01and we have not heard back.  

Sara Shackleton

I have received the following request from a Hess lawyer:

ECT and Hess have an executed ISDA effective 1/29/98.

Guess what they want?  The following ISDA agreements to trade financial (and 
PHYSICAL):

(1)  Amerada Hess Corp.   and  ENA
(2)  Hess Energy Services Company, LLC and  ENA
(3)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and  ELFI
(4)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECT Singapore Pte. Ltd.
(5)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECTRIC

I explained our financial trading entities.
She did not know what products each of the Hess affiliates would be trading.
Hess CREDIT:  Grim Trivino at 212-536-8979
Hess LEGAL:  Dana Dellacona at 212-536-8133

Please let me know who will handle in credit (and I'll intercede with the 
lawyer).  TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NOBODY AT ENRON IS PUSHING HESS.

We have not heard from the Tiger lawyers.  We have sent the Tiger guaranty to 
Enron Corp. for execution.  No other master agreements/guaranties for the 
other hedge fund entities have been drafted but each will look similar to the 
Tiger set of documents.  Sara

David:

In the midst of leaving my voice mail, I think I realized my error.  
I believe that a guarantor can be a "corporation,....entity" having total 
asssts exceeding $10million.  However, that subpart (I) guarantor cannot be 
one that falls into the subpart (III) category (which is different from the 
prior law).

Hi Justin.  It has been quite some time.  I hope all is well with you.  I am 
back after teaching for a year--it was fun and I received my certification 
(hopefully for later use.)

Sara Shackleton mentioned that at one time your office created (and perhaps 
still updates and utilizes) a legal opinion database with respect to physical 
and financial trading matters in various jurisdictions.  Could you advise if 
this is the case?  If so, I would like to visit with you about it.  If this 
is not within your purview, could you forward this to the correct person and 
advise me of whom that would be.  We are working to organize our opinions and 
thought it would be helpful to know what the London office has.

Bear will agree to the Enron form of guaranty,  our Par. 4 Setoffs and 
Counterclaims problematic in light of Bear's waiver provision.  I'd like to 
discuss with you.  

ENA has agreed to a Securities Lending arrangement with Bear and the ENE 
guaranty (capped at $25million and restricted to ENA's arrangements with 
Bear) is part of that "package".

FYI, several Enron companies have accounts with Bear. 

When do you think we could discuss?

Paul,
I sent our Letter of Guaranttee form to Bear Stearns.  They have forwarded 
theirs to me.  Russ Miron, Bear Stearns, is supposed to call this morning.  I 
will try to conference you in when I receive his call or we will reschedule.
Thanks. Sheila

Have you responded to Aneela yet?  Have drafts alreay been sent?  
I'd like to make sure that our internal process has been implemented so that 
we can address Gary's workload on a timely basis.  If we need to meet, please

You are correct in that I do not need the emails.  However, when I receive 
calls from Sheila or Gary or a counterparty, I rely upon  Lotus Notes and the 
information is not there.  I know that everyone is working diligently to 
satisfy the traders' requests.  The emails you are sending can be entered 
directly into the database so that everyone can access the information.  I 
will be glad to show you how to utilize this feature.

What do you think is a reasonable date to ask Sam and Stephanie to complete 
their review of the brokerage agreements in Lotus Notes?

Sara, earlier this week, I asked Stephanie and Samantha to update lotus notes 
on the brokerage agreements that we prioritized last week.  In addition to 
lotus notes, I often send emails to the traders to keep them updated -- as 
the attached is an example.  If you would like to be copied so that you know 
what's going on -- i.e., that I am working diligently on the brokerage 
agreemetns on a daily basis, let me know.  I fgured that you did not want to 
be flooded with the emails and that, instead, we would meet every other week 
for an update.  Let me know -- whatever makes you feel more comfortable is 
what I would like to do.

Hey Aneela, here is the other email sent to Paul this week.  As you can see 
from the attached, we are still in the process of discussing key issues with 
RJ, the agreeemtn is not yet in execution posture.  In a phone call 
subsequent to the attached email, we resolved all of the issues identified 
below (in Enron's favor), except for the limitation of liability issue (see 
my previous email to you) that Paul and I are looking into.  I just want to 
convey to you that this is a priority to us and we are working on it daily.

Paul, I tried to call you at our scheduled time but you were not available.  
To expedite the process, let me tell you here what the outstanding issues are:

1. Para. 15 - Can we clarify this last sentence that you put in the most 
recent draft.  What are we meaning to say there?

2. We feel strongly about including the limitation on liability issue.  We 
especially want to limit any liability to punitive damages.  We think its 
mutually beneficial.  Did you leave this out intentionally?  

3.  Did you intentionally reject our draft confidentiality provisions?

If you do not have time to call me today, please send back an emailed

Sara - Please find attached the latest version of the ISDA document between
Enron & Moore Global Investments, Ltd. as well as our comments which can be
found below as well as written on the document itself. Please note that also
included in the fax are some revisions to the legal opinion.  I will send to
you any comments regarding the guaranty once our lawyer has completed his
review.

Schedule:
Part 1 (c) "Threshold Amount" - We are willing to accept your proposal for
the flat number of $100 million for Enron, but we cannot accept $2 million
for the Moore Global.  The majority of our documents are bilateral in
nature, but we have accepted a 2:1 ratio, thus we have proposed $50 million
for Moore Global.  Please reconsider.

Part 3(b) Documents to be delivered - I have added the legal opinion
language, but I just wanted to confirm that Enron will pay for these
requested legal opinions.  I found out that FIF Master Fund, Ltd  also uses
Graham Thompson as outside counsel.

Credit Support Annex:
Paragraph 13 (b)(iv) - Thresholds - We are willing to accept a $0 Threshold
even though with most of our counterparties, we have at least a $5 million
threshold.   On the other hand, we find it to be a operational nuisance to
have to transfer collateral back and forth with a "minimum transfer amount"
of zero, thus we would like to stick with $500,000 since we do not think
$500,000 is an unreasonable amount of exposure for either party and it would
eliminate the nuisance factor.

Thank you very much for your help in this matter and we look forward to
hearing from you.

Regards-

Rose

Jeff Fuller is interested in pursuing ISDA's with a number of his other

would like a generic ISDA to start with and hopes to negotiate four ISDA's in

once they get a piece of slice (this is a BPA plan to allocate slices of 
their system to customers).  Feel free to call me if you have any questions 
at 503-464-3810.

Stewart,

PRM has 4 utility clients (Benton PUD, Franklin PUD, Grays Harbor PUD and
City of Richland) that will be purchasing BPA's Slice product beginning
October 1, 2001.  I want to get the process started to get ISDA's in place
between Enron and these utilities.  We are currently in the beginning stages
of discussing financial trades with their legal counsel.  Fortunately for
Enron, I think we can have one attorney represent all 4 of PRM's clients.
(FYI, that attorney will be Doug Rosenberg at Preston Gates & Ellis in
Seattle.)

To get started, I'd like Enron to forward to me copies of the ISDA agreement
that you would propose as the starting point for discussions.  I also ask
that you send me a list/examples of any other documentation Enron will
require (e.g., legal opinion, board resolution, etc.).  Please send just one
set of documentation at this point.  I want to get the basic legal review
process underway before you prepare four different sets of documents.  I'd
also like to request that when we get to the point of having Enron's
attorney walk through the ISDA with our attorney, that Enron use Sara
Shackleton.  Sara was great to work with when we went through this for
Merced, and I think she'd be extremely helpful once again as we venture into
new territory with these 4 utilities.

Thanks for your help.

Good Afternoon Sara,

I wanted to document our discussion this afternoon regarding the Early 
Termination Letter for our Deal No. M368796 that settled on 2/2/01, with the 
Bank of Montreal. You stated that the Master ISDA Agreement states that the 
valuation method for early termination should be the process of obtaining 
Market Quotations from Reference Market Makers. This Early Termination Letter 
reflects that BMO determined the value through its ordinary valuation methods 
instead. This was agreed upon by, the trader, Ellen Su. Therefore, you 
provided your approval for us to execute this letter. Please respond with 
your agreement for our files.

I'm being hounded by ENE but no Enron traders seem interested.  Brant 
prepared a new worksheet based upon which we sent a new ISDA.  ENE 
"represents" four municipal utilities and is trying to negotiate ISDA's on 
behalf of those utilities.  I think the agent is off-base and I'm not sure 
that any of the utilities really want to trade financial.

this one altogether?  Or are we interested in pursuing?

Either Ed or Brant please let me know.  Thanks.

With respect to the ENE form of guaranty, we will agree to delete Paragraph 4

let me know.  Thanks.

Tanya:  There are a few issues left:

(1) [re:  legal name of our counterparty]
 According to FUNB, there is no legal entity named "First Union National 
Bank, Charlotte".  If S&P is including the city where FUNB is headquartered 
as part of their legal name, then S&P is wrong.  FUNB has asked that we 
forward the S&P document that you are looking at.

(2)  [re:  FUNB request to provide us with First Union Corp. financials and 
your response that it's OK if First Union Corp. signs on as a guarantor]
FUNB says that First Union National Bank doesn't prepare annual statements.  
FUNB can provide quarterly call reports (with YTD info) which is also 
available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov).  FUNB annual financials also 
available on EDGAR.  I don't know what a call report is and FUNB did not 
offer up First Union Corp. as a guarantor.

(3)  [re:  10 year bonds which you agreed to accept as Eligible Credit 
Support]
I don't know what the "usual haircut" is on these issues.  You said 90% or 
95%.  Legal no longer offers up bonds in our documents which is why we 
haven't discussed haircuts lately.

(4)  [re:  the Specified Conditions of Tax Event, Tax Event Upon Merger and 
Credit Event Upon Merger]
FUNB would rather terminate than collateralize Transactions (and eliminate 
obligations to transfer in avoidance of termination).  If a Specified 
Condition exists, then there is no obligation to deliver collateral to that 
party (experiencing the Specified Condition) and a Secured Party could 
exercise all remedies available to it against the Pledgor.  (I think that we 
have a different philosophy in that we would prefer to preserve 
Transactions).  I'm more willing to give in on the tax events (but global 
mergers could force that issue and the agreement basically requires the 
Affected Party to try to transfer the Transaction to avoid termination).

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara

I have engaged South African counsel.  The response may take a few weeks but 
your transaction can proceed prior to that time.  However, I will need some 
time to refine our ISDA Schedule and learn about the counterparty.  Please 
keep me up-to-date.  Thanks.  Sara

ps:  I can talk

Dee:  I am trying to hear from credit on about four issues, namely, the legal 
entity, need for First Union Corp. guaranty (due to the availability of 
financials), haircut on bonds and Specified Conditions.  I would then propose 
preparation of a blackline to squeeze out the remaining issues.  If I hear 
from credit tomorrow (and I'm pushing), I could have the blackline by 
Wednesday and we could talk.  Hopefully, we'd be done by this week.  Hope 
this works.  Regards.

Sara Shackleton

Mark:

I vote for a review of the act NOW, say the last week of February (Feb 26 - 
March 2).  The ISDA seminar is the following week if that is an attraction 
for the speaker.  I will give you a list of suggested issues in the next day 
or so.  Have fun.

Sara Shackleton

Tanya:

Our legal group would like to schedule instructional seminars covering the 
ISDA Schedule, Credit Support Annex, omnibus and other forms and, 
specifically, the credit issues which arise in the preparation and 
negotiation of these documents.  Our thought is to eventually offer regular 
instruction every other month but we believe that initially we should offer 
monthly seminars.  

In order to avoid "legal/credit Tuesday" boredom, we propose Wednesday or 
Thursday as a regular luncheon meeting date.  How does the week of February 
19 or 26 sound?  I believe that we can circulate a "curriculum" of sorts to 
you or at the least a listing of topics.

Please let me know what you think.  As always, we welcome your suggestions.

In our previous dealings, the counterparty never responded to the proposed 
EEI Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreements.  Concepts like margining were 
not understood and there was even a case whereby we tried to margin them and 
they failed to post.  Jim Delany at ENE has tried to reignite the EEI 
discussions, but I'm not very interested until I get their comments to our 
original EEI.  Let me know if I can be of assistance.

Ed & Brant:

I'm being hounded by ENE but no Enron traders seem interested.  Brant 
prepared a new worksheet based upon which we sent a new ISDA.  ENE 
"represents" four municipal utilities and is trying to negotiate ISDA's on 
behalf of those utilities.  I think the agent is off-base and I'm not sure 
that any of the utilities really want to trade financial.

Ed, Shari suggested that you may have some insight into ENE.  Should I drop 
this one altogether?  Or are we interested in pursuing?

Either Ed or Brant please let me know.  Thanks.

Dueling wine-shipping measures ferment Legislature and lobbyists

By Laylan Copelin
American-Statesman Staff
Monday, February 12, 2001

In this parched state, Texas lawmakers are fond of saying that whiskey is
for drinking and water is for fighting. But legislators are busy turning
wine into water, squabbling over the selling of wine directly to customers
-- whether over the Internet or via tourists shipping wine home to Texas.

For the second legislative session, the state's small wineries and the Wine
Institute of California are squaring off against the powerful Texas
distributors. Two years ago, the Licensed Beverage Distributors of Texas
tried to make it a felony to ship wine across state lines, while the
California wineries tried to circumvent the four Texas companies that
dominate distribution of liquor and wine.

"We fought to a standstill," said Austin lobbyist Sharon Hull, who
represents the Wine Institute of California.

Now for Round Two. Both sides have their flag-waving issues. On one side are
e-commerce and questions about the right to free trade among states. On the
other side are warnings that taxes will go uncollected, wine will be sold
over the Internet to minors and out-of-state wineries will be bootlegging if
they ship to the state's many "dry" precincts that never approved the sale
of alcohol.

The real issue is money. And the fight is between two business models of how
to deliver wine to the customer. One eliminates the middleman; the other
honors a delivery system that Texas has used since the end of Prohibition.

With rare exceptions, Texas' so-called three-tier system kept brewers,
wholesalers and retailers from joint ownership or ventures. It prevented a
few companies from dominating the alcoholic-beverage industry from
fermentation to final sale.

The law did not keep a handful of companies from dominating the wholesaling
segment of the industry. Glazer's Distributing Co. of Dallas competes
statewide with Republic Beverage Co. of Houston and Block Distributing of
San Antonio. (Block owns 51 percent of Republic.) A fourth, Longhorn Liquors
of Arlington, competes in the Dallas area. Among them, they control all the
distribution of distilled spirits and an estimated 85 percent of the wine
wholesale market in Texas.

That's why some lawmakers want to make changes.

"If the two big (wholesale) guys don't anoint your wine," said state Rep.
David Swinford, R-Dumas, "you're toast."

In addition to major out-of-state brands, Texas distributors sold
three-fourths of the 1.6 million gallons of wine produced in Texas in 1999.
Yet almost all of that was from the state's four biggest wineries: Llano
Estacado, St. Genevieve, Cap Rock and Fall Creek.

So-called boutique wines from California or from small Texas wineries almost
never make it to the grocery shelves.

Current law says Texans cannot bring into the state more than 3 gallons
(about two cases) of wine per month. And buyers must accompany the wine,
instead of shipping it. There are similar limits on beer and liquor.

Also, Texas wineries can sell only 25,000 gallons a year to customers at a
winery if it is in a "wet" precinct that allows the sale of alcohol. And
they can ship only limited amounts of wine to a customer who lives in a wet
precinct.

Last year, a federal judge in Houston said the 3-gallon limit is an
unconstitutional restriction on free trade among states. The judge has
withheld a final ruling, probably waiting to see what the Legislature will
do. Meanwhile, a federal appeals ruling in Indiana upholding a state's right
to regulate alcohol sales has given wholesalers hope that Texas can win on
appeal.

Yet two lawmakers, Swinford and Rep. Anna Mowery, R-Fort Worth, have taken
two different tacks to promote wine sales.

Mowery's House Bill 1046 would keep the 3-gallon limit but create a direct
wine-shipper's permit, allowing wineries to ship to Texans. A person 21
years or older -- with proper identification -- would be required to sign
for the delivery. And the holder of the shipper's permit would be required
to pay all taxes. Wine could not be shipped into a dry precinct.

Only 28 Texas counties allow the sale of alcohol countywide. Eighty-nine
percent of the state is either dry or a patchwork of small precincts where
alcohol can be sold.

Alan Gray, director of the Licensed Beverage Distributors, opposes the bill.
He said he believes that minors would be able to buy wine off the Internet,
that local sales taxes would not be collected and that the shippers have no
easy way to determine where alcohol sales are legal.

"We think it creates nothing more than an honor system," Gray said.

Mowery insists that allowing direct shipping of a small amount of wine to
customers won't affect wholesalers' profits. Gray argued that if wine wins
an exception, liquor could be next.

The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission, which enforces the state's laws, is
not allowed to support or oppose legislation. Randy Yarbrough, the agency's
assistant director, said Mowery's bill could provide equal treatment to
Texas wholesalers and out-of-state wineries. Yet the agency would have to
work out collection and payment of sales taxes to cities.

Also, there is no easy way, such as a database, for shippers to determine
areas of the state where alcohol can be sold.

"No one (at the state level) knows where the wet and dry areas are,"
Yarbrough said.

As for sale to minors, Yarbrough said states that allow Internet sales have
used minors in sting operations. But he believes that sales to minors remain
a bigger problem for local retailers.

"Kids generally do not want to buy alcohol over the Internet," Yarbrough
said. "They want it for tonight."

Swinford, the Panhandle Republican, takes a Texas-only approach. House Bill
892 would allow Texas wineries to ship up to two cases of wine per month
within the state, even into dry areas. Wineries in dry counties also could
sell wine on the premises just as private clubs do with memberships.

"I call this bill `Direct-Ship Lite,' " joked Swinford.

Swinford said his bill will develop the Texas wine industry. Gray argues
that it may be illegal because it would favor Texas wineries over
out-of-state ones.

Swinford said Texas wineries need the help. California produces 400 times
the wine that Texas does but consumes only three times as much.

"This is not a booze bill," he said. "I don't even like wine. I like
agriculture."

Sharon:

With respect to the ENE form of guaranty, we will agree to delete Paragraph 4 
(setoff and counterclaims) in its entirety.  This is a major concession by 
ENE.  Can you now agree to the remainder of the ENE guaranty format?  Please 
let me know.  Thanks.

Richard:

This is a first for me.  I received the following objection to our standard 
arbitration language:

"The arbitration does not provide for expedited procedures with limited 
discovery and limited live testimony.   This could take as long as in court 
and cost more."

Is this a valid objection?  If so, how should we amend our language?  Or 
should we be silent as to jurisdicition without waiving any objections 
(venue, forum) and waive jury trial?

I look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.

Sara Shackleton

Dana:

I haven't heard from credit.  Why don't you call Tana Jones (our EOL 
paralegal specialist) at 713-853-3399 and let her know that you want to 
pursue the Electronic Trading Agreement and GTC's for online trading.  I will 
also provide Tana with the background discussion that you and I had.  At 
least she can get you moving on EOL and pursue credit at the same time.  Let 
me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Per our discussion on February 6th, I was wondering if you had any feedback
from your credit people regarding the five Enron-Hess entity ISDAs we
discussed.  Also, as I mentioned in the February 6th e mail to you, Amerada

immediately.  Can you give me a call to discuss how soon we can make
arrangements for this?

I would like to contact you in order to follow up to your conversation of
last week with Mr. Chuck Cerria regarding executing an ISDA between
numerous
Hess entities and numerous Enron entities.  Unfortunately, I do not have
your phone number.  Could you either call me or e mail it to me?

Thanks so much,

Tana:  A lawyer from Amerada Hess (Dana Dellacona) will probably call you 
about EOL trading.  She is interested in several trading relationships which 
you can see from the email that I sent to Tanya.  Let me know if you have any

I have received the following request from a Hess lawyer:

ECT and Hess have an executed ISDA effective 1/29/98.

Guess what they want?  The following ISDA agreements to trade financial (and 
PHYSICAL):

(1)  Amerada Hess Corp.   and  ENA
(2)  Hess Energy Services Company, LLC and  ENA
(3)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and  ELFI
(4)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECT Singapore Pte. Ltd.
(5)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECTRIC

I explained our financial trading entities.
She did not know what products each of the Hess affiliates would be trading.
Hess CREDIT:  Grim Trivino at 212-536-8979
Hess LEGAL:  Dana Dellacona at 212-536-8133

Please let me know who will handle in credit (and I'll intercede with the 
lawyer).  TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NOBODY AT ENRON IS PUSHING HESS.
As usual, thanks for your help.

Hi Sara,
Thanks for the update.  With respect to First Union Corp., the holding
company of First Union National Bank ("FUNB")  providing a guaranty, I don't
believe that's an option. FUNB is a rated entity and as mentioned in my Jan.
23rd email, we can provide quarterly call reports (with year-to-date
information), which is also available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov). First
Union Corporation's consolidated annual financial statements are available
on EDGAR as well as First Union's home page (www.firstunion.com).  I look
forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.  It seems that our
marketers are asking for credit approval to enter into the Shenandoah trade
today without the Master in place. If approval is given, we will need mutual
downgrade provisions in our confirm.  I think all other pending trades are
on hold until we can get our docs wrapped up.

Tanya:

I know you're swamped so I'll try to make this easy and you can answer "yes" 
or "no", etc.

1.  Is First Union National Bank the correct name?  (as opposed to First 
Union National Bank, Charlotte)

2.  Threshold for cross default:  We used $100,000,000 for ENE and 
$50,000,000 for FUNB.  FUNB wants $100,000,000.

3.  Documents to be delivered:  FUNB will produce audited/consolidated 
financials for First Union Corporation.  We requested FUNB financials.

4.  With respect to the ENA master only (the CSA):

 (i)  FUNB wants to post 10-year government bonds in addition to cash and 
L'C's

 (ii)  I sent you the FUNB matrix  Is it acceptable?

 (iii) FUNB wants to revise the MAC trigger to include "Baa3 by Moody's" and 
"failure to have a Credit Rating from either S&P or Moody's".

 (iv) FUNB wants to revise the definition of "Qualified Institution" to 
include not only the rating we assign, but also "having assets in excess of 
$10 billion" and also not subject to approval by the non-downgraded party

 (v)  FUNB wants all demands for delivery or return of collateral to be made 
on a Valuation Date.  I think we should retain language that demands can be 
made on or after a Valuation Date.  But I think we could agree that demands 
be made prior to 5 pm New York time.

5.  With respect to the ENA master only (the Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of 
First Union National Bank):

 (i)  FUNB wants a $30,000,000 cap (as opposed to the $15,000,000 cap we 
proposed)

Two different FUNB people keep calling me, one on the ENA front and the other 
with respect to ENE.  Now you know why your assistance is always greatly 
appreciated.

Tanya:  There are a few issues left:

(1) [re:  legal name of our counterparty]
 According to FUNB, there is no legal entity named "First Union National 
Bank, Charlotte".  If S&P is including the city where FUNB is headquartered 
as part of their legal name, then S&P is wrong.  FUNB has asked that we 
forward the S&P document that you are looking at.

(2)  [re:  FUNB request to provide us with First Union Corp. financials and 
your response that it's OK if First Union Corp. signs on as a guarantor]
FUNB says that First Union National Bank doesn't prepare annual statements.  
FUNB can provide quarterly call reports (with YTD info) which is also 
available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov).  FUNB annual financials also 
available on EDGAR.  I don't know what a call report is and FUNB did not 
offer up First Union Corp. as a guarantor.

(3)  [re:  10 year bonds which you agreed to accept as Eligible Credit 
Support]
I don't know what the "usual haircut" is on these issues.  You said 90% or 
95%.  Legal no longer offers up bonds in our documents which is why we 
haven't discussed haircuts lately.

(4)  [re:  the Specified Conditions of Tax Event, Tax Event Upon Merger and 
Credit Event Upon Merger]
FUNB would rather terminate than collateralize Transactions (and eliminate 
obligations to transfer in avoidance of termination).  If a Specified 
Condition exists, then there is no obligation to deliver collateral to that 
party (experiencing the Specified Condition) and a Secured Party could 
exercise all remedies available to it against the Pledgor.  (I think that we 
have a different philosophy in that we would prefer to preserve 
Transactions).  I'm more willing to give in on the tax events (but global 
mergers could force that issue and the agreement basically requires the 
Affected Party to try to transfer the Transaction to avoid termination).

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.  Sara
 

Sara Shackleton

I think you were going to identify the Lagrasta deals after our meeting of 
last Tuesday (Oct. 19).  I've done a quick review (although I'm not as 
familiar with the deals as you may be) and think there are 9 deals:
 
Aries Resources, LLC
[Classic Resources Inc.] - dropped
Formosa Hydrocarbons, Inc. - Breslau also concerned

Greg Malcolm, the Contract Administrator for OPG just called to give me the 
status of the following documents that were sent to them by Enron last fall: 

1. EEI (physical power): Said I could expect to receive their comments to our 
initial draft no later than the end of Feb.

2. ISDA (financial): I should receive a response from them on our initial 
draft sometime in March (he was not as firm on this timeframe as he was about 
the EEI). 

3. Physical Power Confirms:  For interim trading, he is going to send me the 
form of confirmation template they want to use for sales to us. 

Commercial People: If these timeframes are unacceptable given whatever 
business you are trying to do with OPG - please ask your equivalent at OPG to 
put pressure on OPG's Legal Dept. There is nothing I can do to make this go 
any faster.

Thanks,

On the thresholds, I will agree to their matrix with one change for BBB-.  
Revised looks like this:

25MM AAA
20MM A or above
15MM BBB+ or above
10MM BBB
5MM BBB-
0 below BBB-

Rounding at 10K is fine.  I would prefer to leave our Min Trf amount the way 
it is (only changes the threshold, in effect).  Or, I am amenable to one 
amount for everyone (say 100K instead of our 0).

Do I need to look at Inser B and C?

Mark:  

Attached is my "short version" of Eligible Contract Participant (I would 
generally send to credit, new lawyer, etc.)  I am still uncertain about the 
status of the Trade Option Exemption (Issue 4); I understood from the 
conversation that you, Brent and I had that the old rules were out.  I have 
heard a different interpretation.  What is the status of this exemption under 
the new law?

Sara Shackleton

Darren:

(1)  Goldman Sachs
ENA  executed the Client Access Agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co.  on June 
15, 2000.  Since you are trading in the name of ENA, you should not need to 
execute an additional agreement.  I confirmed this with Ted Leh this 
morning.  At Ted's suggestion, please forward to me the fax number and email 
address of the Goldman person requesting that you execute further 
documentation.  I can fax to him a copy of the agreement and correspond by 
email.  I will also copy Ted Leh and Vivian Siao (keeps track of agreements 
and authorized traders) so that everyone is up to date.

(2)  UBS Warburg
I spoke with Sheryl Gallant.  ENA and other Enron affiliates are already 
trading on the UBS electronic websites for OTC transactions.  Interestingly 
enough, UBS does not require an electronic trading agreement to be signed by 
a customer for online trading.  In other words, ENA has an executed ISDA with 
UBS dated May 31, 1993, you are an authorized trader for ENA and UBS is happy 
to let you access their platform. Sheryl does not know why Jun Ishi requested 
execution of a "Client User List" (i.e., an authorized trader list) and said 
to forget it.  If you would like for me to speak to Jun Ishi or correspond 
with him (please send his email address), just let me know.

Please let me hear from you if you would like for me to pursue further.  As a 
representative of ENA, you will probably have most agreements already in 
place.

Attached to this email you should find a marked version of the Enron Corp. 
guaranty.  A few points:

(1)  Bear claims that the "cap" language which we typically include is 
inadequate because the wording implies (under NY law) that if a lesser amount 
is owed at any time, then the cap is reduced to that amount. I've not heard 
of this before.  I believe that they can send the treatise background info if 
you'd like.

(2)  The guaranty covers obligations of ENA in its Bear account and with 
respect to the margin lending agreement.  Bear has added "performance" to the 
guaranty as a guarantor obligation.  ENA's account obligations pertain to the 
payment of money (margin); under the margin lending agreement, ENA could have 
to deliver securities sold short in the market pursuant to a loan from Bear.  
Failure to deliver these securities would trigger a default (which is 
essentially reduced to a payment of money).  

(3)  Although Bear removed our Setoff/Counterclaim paragraph, you should 
refer to Par. 5 to see their own version!

Please call me to discuss as ENA is anxious to reduce our margin rates with 
Bear.  The Bear lawyer is leaving town tomorrow afternoon.

Thanks.

Dee:

We are working on the blackline.  Since the "deal" that you mentioned 
yesterday has no bearing on the master between ENA and FUNB, there is no 
emergency at hand.  A few things to note:  

(1)  regarding "Procedures for entering into Transactions,"  my suggestion is 
that you consider a reasonable time period in which to respond upon receipt 
of a confirmation.  It is in both parties best interest to have an executed 
(and therefore enforceable) writing  This can be accomplished by under the NY 
General Obligations law by our agreement as to a "deemed response" if a party 
will not sign a trade confirmation.

(2)  regarding the concept of "Specified Transaction", ENA has reconsidered 
the earlier concession to exclude most Termination Events as Specified 
Conditions.  It is not ENA's position to unwind Transactions upon the 
occurrence of these events, and, therefore, each party ought to be able to 
rely upon the protections afforded it under the related provisions.  
Regarding the Credit Event Upon Merger, FUNB is protected with the amendment 
which we make to Section 5(b)(iv).

I hope that the blackline will resolve our outstanding issues.

Enron Credit Inc. , a  Delaware corporation, has been created for U.S. debt 
trading currently handled by ENA.   As a result, ENA will need to transfer 
its brokerage debt positions to Enron Credit Inc. accounts with those 
brokers.  The brokers include our favorites:

Bear Stearns Companies
Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.
Goldman Sachs & Co. 

ENA will need to assign its positions by the end of February, 2001.
Richard Sage (London office) will need to see the "sample package" (unanimous 
consent, authorized trader list).  Will you please see that an email is sent

Sara -

Jeff Fuller is interested in pursuing ISDA's with a number of his other 
customers after a successful experience with Merced Irrigation District.  He 
would like a generic ISDA to start with and hopes to negotiate four ISDA's in 
the near future.  The purpose of the ISDA will be to hedge their price risk 
once they get a piece of slice (this is a BPA plan to allocate slices of 
their system to customers).  Feel free to call me if you have any questions 
at 503-464-3810.

Stewart

Stewart,

PRM has 4 utility clients (Benton PUD, Franklin PUD, Grays Harbor PUD and
City of Richland) that will be purchasing BPA's Slice product beginning
October 1, 2001.  I want to get the process started to get ISDA's in place
between Enron and these utilities.  We are currently in the beginning stages
of discussing financial trades with their legal counsel.  Fortunately for
Enron, I think we can have one attorney represent all 4 of PRM's clients.
(FYI, that attorney will be Doug Rosenberg at Preston Gates & Ellis in
Seattle.)

To get started, I'd like Enron to forward to me copies of the ISDA agreement
that you would propose as the starting point for discussions.  I also ask
that you send me a list/examples of any other documentation Enron will
require (e.g., legal opinion, board resolution, etc.).  Please send just one
set of documentation at this point.  I want to get the basic legal review
process underway before you prepare four different sets of documents.  I'd
also like to request that when we get to the point of having Enron's
attorney walk through the ISDA with our attorney, that Enron use Sara
Shackleton.  Sara was great to work with when we went through this for
Merced, and I think she'd be extremely helpful once again as we venture into
new territory with these 4 utilities.

Thanks for your help.

Richard:

The corporate workbook reflects that the officers of Enron Credit, Inc. all 
reside in the U.K.  I don't see anyone identified with a power of attorney 
for executing documents in Houston.  

As there may be tax issues associated with U.K. officers signing (in the U.K) 
on behalf of a U.S. company, I am asking  for verification from Janine.

My suggestion is that Enron Credit Ltd. negotiate and execute the agreement 
and include the usual "affiliates, representatives, etc." who may need to 
know any confidential information.  Your V.P.'s are all in London.  

If Janelle confirms that it's alright for Brown, Sherriff or Seyfried to sign 
for Enron Credit, Inc. from London, then we can prepare the document and have 
a V.P. sign and fax the agreement to the U.S. party.  At a minimum, though, 
we should try to work from our form of NDA.

Let me know if you have any questions.

I believe that there is a general consensus that Clem needs assistance to 
respond timely to  the mounting number of guaranties requested from Enron 
Corp.  In speaking with Clem, it seems that any evidence of increased and 
increasing business and demand for guaranties will be helpful for him to 
obtain help.  Would your group be able to put together some facts and 
projections which might address the continuing demand for new guaranties?  
Since you are the first (and most important) point of contact for evaluating 
potential business, I think that your input would be extremely valuable for 
Clem to "plead his case."

Hi Sara:

I heard about a group called "Looking at Art", and they are going to
Marfa, Texas to check out the art colony there. I remembered that you
had gone there a couple of times and enjoyed it. The most important
thing about the conversation to me was that it reminded me that I had
not heard from you in a while. I am sure that you are very busy, but I
wanted you to know that I hoped things are going well with you and that
you get a chance to kick back some soon. Probably because that is what I
want to do.

Take Care,

Carson

Guenther:

Thanks for the response.  I'll wait to hear from Richard Sage as to who owns 
the information.
Only officers at the VP level or higher may execute binding contracts for all 
Enron U.S. companies (bylaws).  I do not know the "rule" for non-U.S. 
companies (although I suspect the articles of association would contain that 
information).

You are right about the tax issue - in fact, we are in the process of 
replacing the UK directors and officers of Enron Credit Inc with US directors 
and officers.

The entity that signs up to the confidentiality agreement ought to be the one 
that owns the information to be supplied.  Based on conversations I have had 
with Richard Sage, I had formed the impression that the owner of the 
information was Enron Credit Ltd.  If this is right, we should pursue your 
first suggestion.  Otherwise, given that the tax issue is being rectified and 
this should therefore be an isolated incident, I think we can wear the tax 
risk inherent in your second suggestion.  Though I do wonder whether an 
officer of Enron Credit Inc, such as Richard Sage (currently), could sign, 
rather than a director?

Kind regards

Guenther Klar

pushing the install of these apps.  I think we are OK on Autex and Instinet 
(although there may be issues with their Win2K compliancy) but do not know 
the status on ITG/Posit.  Although there may well have been further

After the flurry of e-mails below, I received a package from ITG/Posit Europe 
which I subsequently sent to one of you in Houston.  I am not sure who I sent 
it to but I am quite sure it got there and was "put through the channels" 
because Sara Shackleton has been working with ITG on the contractual issues.  
I am now trying to find out if any software was included in that package 
because I would like to get the install process going pending the 
finalization of the contract negotiations.  Please confirm as to whether or 
not either of you are aware of this installation software.

Can you please coordinate with Jamie White at ITG on this install.  I don't 
really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group 
worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original 
install.  If so, please use the same architecture.  If not, please consider 
the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being 
in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London 
install so the two sites are in synch.

This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may 
want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on 
this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it

We should move forward with this waiver.   From a credit standpoint, I do not

Brent Hendry

Do you approve the waiver?
In response to your email, yes, our confidentiality language was so limited 
that it did not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates of either 
party without consent.  We revised the form about 9 months ago to broaden the 
langage to include affiliates, but Duke is an old master so they need our 
consent so they can provide it to their affiliate.  Unless Federico has any 
reason not to waive the language, I think we can go ahead & draft a waiver up 
here and send it to Duke.  Can you talk to Federico asap and run that by him 
and let me know so I can get this over to Duke.  Thanks!

FYI-

Pat - 

We sent them indicative pricing last Friday. Still waiting to see if they 
like our pricing. I still do not know what volume scenario they want to go 
for, but as we see it, they will want to transact starting next Monday. We 
will keep you posted on any update.

Regarding the ISDA, I told them we can agree to sign it without the CSA, 
though we would need to maintain the other provisions. I am still waiting for 
TGS's reply. 

Rolo

Rolo-

Are we going to transact with TGS by the end of the month?  Let me know what 
the status is with TGS.

Regards,

Pat

Susan-

Attached is the revised credit worksheet for TGS removing the CSA.  Given 
that we will probably not have the ISDA executed by the time Argentina 
transacts with TGS (by the end of the month), we will need to confirm the 
deal including a Deemed ISDA per Sara's suggestions.

I advised Argentina that we were making no other changes to our format other 
than removing the CSA since this seems to be the major issue for TGS.  
However, we may want to hold off on sending the 2nd draft until commercial 
has a chance to advise TGS of our position.  I want to make sure that the CSA 
is really the only hurdle for them before we send the revised draft down.  I 
will advise when I have heard back from Argentina on their further 
discussions with the counterparty regarding the ISDA.

Let's discuss if any questions.

Regards,

Pat

Rolo-

We can agree to sign the Master ISDA without the CSA.  However, we will be 
maintaining the BBB- MAC trigger, 3rd Party Event of Default at $15MM, and 
the Change in Ownership provision.  I do not want to agree to any of their 
changes other than removing the CSA.   

Please call me in the morning concerning the 2,500 ton/month LPG transaction

Tanya:

We finally agreed on the guaranty form (the cap is $25 million) and are about 
ready to execute the actual agreement.  I have one question:  in the ISDA 
world, we use "cost of funds plus 1%" as the default interest rate.  The Bear 
document provides:

"...interest thereon at a rate equal to (A) in the case of purchases of 
Foreign Securities, LIBOR, (B) in the case of purchases of any other 
securities (or other amounts, if any, due to Lender hereunder), the Federal 
Funds Rate or (C) such other rate as may be specified in Schedule B, in each 
case as such rate fluctuates from day to day, from the date of such purchase 
until the date of payment of such excess."

What is your preference:  Bear's standard language or do you want to specify 
another rate?

I think this is Kinneman's decision.  To the extent that an agreement uses a

risk.  Not too big of an issue from my perspective.

You are right about the tax issue - in fact, we are in the process of 
replacing the UK directors and officers of Enron Credit Inc with US directors 
and officers.

The entity that signs up to the confidentiality agreement ought to be the one 
that owns the information to be supplied.  Based on conversations I have had 
with Richard Sage, I had formed the impression that the owner of the 
information was Enron Credit Ltd.  If this is right, we should pursue your 
first suggestion.  Otherwise, given that the tax issue is being rectified and 
this should therefore be an isolated incident, I think we can wear the tax 
risk inherent in your second suggestion.  Though I do wonder whether an 
officer of Enron Credit Inc, such as Richard Sage (currently), could sign, 
rather than a director?

Kind regards

John,

Australia New Zealand Bank has put in place FX limits for Enron North
America Inc.(on behalf of Enron Japan) of USD 2 million (R/13 months) and
the corresponding USD 27.5 million in settlement limits (R/3-day) (subject
the full guarantee of Enron Corporation). It would be greatly appreciated if
you could assist us in implementing a guarantee from Enron Corp. to support
these trading lines.

Darren Delage is the interest rate/fx trader in your office - I presume he 
has been in contact with Australia and New Zealand Bank.  He will have 
details on the transaction, but it sounds like we will have several 
transactions on a go-forward basis.  I presume this is why the counterparty 
is requesting a guaranty and an ISDA.

Whichever Enron entity is the transacting entity needs an ISDA over the

Hi John,

I have followed up on this with Darren Delage and it seems that this is the 
situation: The trades with ANZ will be done by Enron Japan but only by virtue 
of "dependant agency" arrangements with ENA. (These arrangements are still 
being documented.)

I think this means that ENA and not Enron Japan will need to enter into 
agreements with ANZ.

I think Darren will follow up from his side but could you go back to Micheal 
on this.

Please respond and we can finalize the agreement.  Please let me know if 
there is anything further you require.  Regards.

which choice of law would be binding on Enron Japan Corp.  However, I note 
that the draft ISDA marked by our Japanese counsel for use by Enron Japan 
Corp. and IBJ elects New York law (AA email to me dated 9/21/00).  Are either 
Texas or New York law preferable for the Services Agreement?

Enclosed is a version of the Commodity Exchange Act, redlined to show how it 
has been revised by the CFMA.  This document was e-mailed to me earlier today 
by Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft.

Chris, the language in the "Definitions" sections (Section 1a) is what 
concerns us most.

A new definition has been added -- "EXEMPT COMMODITY" which is (14) of Sec. 
1a (not to be confused w/ "EXCLUDED COMMODITY," which is (13) of Sec 1a.).  
The new "scheme" is as follows -- an "excluded" commodity (essentially, 
financials and weather) is the most deregulated, an "exempt" commodity is 
almost but not quite as deregulated, and agricultural commodities are still 
subject to full jurisdiction of the CFTC and the Commodity Exchange Act.

As you can see, the definition of "Exempt Commodity" is simply stated as 
everything other than an excluded commodity or agricultural commodity.  The 
ambiguity is that "agricultural commodity" is not defined, so the question is 
-- is the reference to "agricultural commodity" here meant to encompass 
coffee, sugar and cocoa as well as grains and meats? 

FYI, the list of "enumerated" agricultural commodities is in (4) of Sec 1a, 
in the old definition of "COMMODITY," which remains in the Act.  Usually, 
when regulators wish to reference the restricted list of grains and meats, it 
is this section they refer to.  In fact, Congress referred expressly to this 
list in other places in the CFMA.  For example, see the new Section 4p(c)(1) 
(which is on page 59 of the attached document).

Please feel free to call me w/ any comments or questions.  Thanks -- Bob

Trena, attached please find a brief memorandum on the referenced subject.  As 
we discussed, this memo outlines the issues in very general terms.  Some of 
the legal concepts touched upon -- e.g., the exact nature of the fiduciary 
relationship between a licensed broker and its customers -- are rather 
complex, and would bear out very involved legal research and analysis in a 
more detailed memorandum.

Mark Taylor has advised me that the legal department's approval of the 
purchase of any exchange membership (clearing or non-clearing)  will require 
the personal approval of Mark Haedicke, the chief legal officer of Enron

Bob:  Now there's the real reason!  If there are two new softs entities, then 
ENA and ECTRIC lose the netting benefits.  The tax issues are transparent 
(it's like the two credit derivative entities).  Who is involved from 
credit?  We need to discuss the structures with them because credit may be 
concerned about the loss of netting privileges.

Also, we need to verify that US entity softs trades will be USD based and the 
European softs entity will settle in Euro or GBP.  It seems obvious but a US 
entity could routinely settle in a currency other than USD.  SS

Just so you have the answers.

Products will be settled in the currency they are traded in....that is USD, 
Euro or GBP
We would intend the new Enron softs entity to be a US entity and that the UK 
trading would be done through the arranger....EEFT.

I am presently looking at another structure, that if it can be done 
technically then I will go for that.

Lets discuss when you are out of your meeting.

Susan:

The internal EOL FX products will be opened up to third parties shortly.  I'm 
reviewing the GTC's.  With respect to the tax reps which are incorporated 
into the GTC's, I think we need a "universal" rep since the products could be 
traded by parties residing anywhere in the world.  I believe that the first 
week in March is the target EOL date.  

Can you prepare the tax rep section for the GTC's?  I am not aware of any 
other EOL product having this type of rep but I am not familiar with the 
totality of EOL products.

Gentlemen:

Several points regarding the below:

We worked for the first half of 1999 to try and negotiate a master agreement 
with TDCC but failed due to an inability to agree on credit terms (i.e. TDCC 
wouldn't sign a master with ANY credit terms in it at all).  Rod Nelson was 
the Credit Dept. person responsible for this counterparty at that time.
If we want to start down this road again, the first step is to contact 
someone in Credit and have them generate the necessary credit terms for  a 
master agreement.  Unless the commercial folks have already, I'll ask someone 
in my group to get that process started.
The e-mail from Dow indicates:
 "TDCC has never accepted and cannot accept the Terms and Conditions included 
in the
confirmations sent by Enron."
All credit concerns aside, if Dow is not signing and returning our 
confirmations, then based on this statement our derivatives trading with them 
should stop immediately on legal grounds.
The e-mail as forwarded to me did not contain the attachment.  Does someone 
here have it?

Let's hope it works out better this time.

Sara,
Sorry, I wasn't trying to be unreasonable - where I put down dates in the 
past it was because I thought they had been done.
We have found a way of paying intermediate margin, so the only deadline now 
is the end of the month. Can you advise what is reasonably doable by when.

Yes, London will prepare confirmations for ECI.
We will therefore need a services agreement between ECI and Enron Credit Ltd.
This is at the bottom of the list.

Sheila, 
Did the idea of getting a guarantee from Bear ever lead to anything?

Thanks,
Richard

Richard:

Further to my message below, after speaking with Sheila, it appears that the 
Securities Loan Agreement that ENA will sign (hopefully tomorrow) is actually 
the same agreement to be used by Enron Credit Inc. ("ECI").   I think we can 
have this assigned from ENA to ECI.  We will have to get a new guaranty from 
Enron Corp.  I still do not know anything about the Bear guaranty that you 
mentioned in your email.  Please advise.

Also, please verify for me which office will prepare confirmations for ECI.  
If it is London, is there a services agreement in place between ENA and EI?

Richard:

Your deadlines for the securities loan agreement for and related guaranties 
are impossible to meet  (2/16/01 was last Friday).  The same agreement with 
ENA has yet to be completed due to protracted negotiations.  

Please advise as to who in credit approved the USD25million Enron Corp. 
guaranty on behalf of ECI.  Also, FYI, Bear will not provide a reciprocal 
guaranty for ENA.

All,
So that everyone can see what everone else is doing, below is the list of 
steps of which I am aware.
I think quite a few of these were completed in Houston on Friday.
Please shout if:
- I have missed anything
- Any deadlines are unrealistic
- Anybody else should be copied in
etc

Thanks,
Richard

Can't promise 8:30 on the dot so how about 8:45 to 9:00?

   
	
	

Deseret would like to talk tomorrow at 8:30 (Central time).  Does this work 
for you?  Let me know ASAP.

Janine:

Congratulations on your promotion!

I need an update on the back-office relationship between Enron Credit Inc. 
(ECI) and Enron Credit Ltd. (ECL) Does London confirm the ECI trades?  If so, 
I assume there is a power of attorney from ECI to someone in London.  Or will 
ECI trades be confirmed in the U.S.?

I received a call from someone in London inquiring as to whether Greg Whalley 
could sign for ENA because he was in London.  I believe this was in relation 
to the credit business.  Are U.K. traders booking credit deals in the name of 
ENA or is this some type of back-office function performed on behalf of ENA?  
Any reason not to use ECI or ECL  here?

 Also, can you send a copy of the services agreement (if any) between any 
companies performing services on behalf of either ECI or ECL?

Thanks.

Anna:

I just received your voice mail.  The package (including the Enron Corp. 
guaranty) has already gone out via Federal Express to your attention.  You 
should receive it tomorrow.

Sara Shackleton

Sheila:

Just a few questions about this futures agreement:

(1)  Is it OK for JP to combine our orders with orders of other clients and 
JP's affiliates?
(2)  Is it OK (after we deposit property into our account) for JP to return 
"property of like or equivalent kind or amount"?
(3)  Do you want to agree to an interest rate (on customer funds) upfront or 
only "as agreed from time to time"?

Sara Shackleton

Susan:  You've just hit the nail on the head!  Remember, for FX trading ENA 
is always the principal, either in Houston, through EEFT as agent (under 
services agreement which I presume covers FX deals) or Enron Japan Corp. 
(under services agreement).  Most problematic are the counterparties since 
they could originate from anywhere in the world.

I have heard that Enron Japan had some GTC's that contained "universal tax 
reps" but I haven't checked it out.  Why don't you give me a call.

Sara Shackleton
	Susan Musch@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
	02/21/2001 03:42 PM
		
Sara,

Which Enron entities would be a party to the transactions?  Also, where would 
the counterparties likely be organized and doing business?

Best regards,
Susan

Susan:

The internal EOL FX products will be opened up to third parties shortly.  I'm 
reviewing the GTC's.  With respect to the tax reps which are incorporated 
into the GTC's, I think we need a "universal" rep since the products could be 
traded by parties residing anywhere in the world.  I believe that the first 
week in March is the target EOL date.  

Can you prepare the tax rep section for the GTC's?  I am not aware of any 
other EOL product having this type of rep but I am not familiar with the 
totality of EOL products.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Sara Shackleton

Paul:  I am negotiating a new futures agreement for Gary.  Do have any 
input?  Thanks.

Sara Shackleton

Sam:  There are now two entries for J.P. Morgan Futures, Inc.  I didn't 
realize that you had entered an agreement.  I didn't want to delete your 
entry but I don't understand what you entered.  Is it a futures agreement?  I 
am negotiating the futures agreement.  Also, the email address you entered is 
incorrect.  Please help.

Mary:  How are you entering your margin line credit agreements in Lotus Notes

Sara, in the interest of time this morning, I thought  I would send a quick 
e-mail. I have read the appendix to the repo agreement and think it is OK.  
No accounting issues, I think they just want to address the substitution 
mechanics.  Technically, repo transactions are FAS 125 transactions (sales of 
financial assets), so I presume that is why the "FAS 125" is noted at the top 
of the page (I don't believe it is necessary - what value does it add?).  I 
think the issue is one for Treasury  - are we OK with the counterparties 
ability to terminate the contract if we do not agree to the replacement 
(substituted) securities? Hope this helps.

FYI - yes, Wes Colwell and his crew are ENA accounting; however, they know 
nothing of FAS 125/133, as I was directed to Chris Sherman. 

Sara Shackleton
	Mark Taylor
	02/21/2001 07:24 PM
		 
I think the "Wes" we were looking for the other day may be Wes Colwell who I 
think may be in charge of accounting for ENA.  If not, maybe somebody on this 
list will know something about FAS133.

Notes below.  Gary is going to an offsite meeting with JP Morgan next week 
and has requested that he would like this in place when he goes.  
Many thanks. Sheila
Sheila:

Just a few questions about this futures agreement:

(1)  Is it OK for JP to combine our orders with orders of other clients and 
JP's affiliates? YES
(2)  Is it OK (after we deposit property into our account) for JP to return 
"property of like or equivalent kind or amount"? NO
(3)  Do you want to agree to an interest rate (on customer funds) upfront or 
only "as agreed from time to time"? I WOULD LIKE TO AGREE TO AN INTEREST RATE 
UPFRONT. (EG. FED FUNDS). CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT PRU, CARR AND CSFB futures 
agreements TO SEE WHAT IS MARKET?

Sara -
SMUD gave us their version of the ISDA agreement about 6 weeks ago and I am 
still waiting for comments.  I believe Susan Flynn is working on it and I 
thought we would get comments by this past Monday.  They want to start doing 
financial gas and power swaps and I would really like to wrap up the legal 
contract side of things.  Can someone please call or email me and tell me the 
status.

Thank you (503-464-3810)

Thomas:

Attached is a redline of the Client Agreement.  I know that Gary Hickerson 
will be meeting with J P Morgan early next week and would like to have this 
agreed.  Please advise as to what attorney will review my comments and put me 
in touch with that person today.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.

In a mad dash to meet the RFP response deadline, a draft of the Response to 
RFP to be submitted by Las Vegas Cogeneration Limited Partnership and ENA to 
Nevada Power is attached.

The Response to RFP is due tomorrow by overnight delivery.

This is my first foray into the EEI Master, and particularly in connection 
with unit-firm power / tolling contracts.  I would greatly appreciate a 
review and comment by Shari and/or Elizabeth, given the size and duration of 
the proposed transaction.  One of the attachments is a partial cover sheet 
reflecting certain of the changes to the documents requested by Nevada 
Power.  The full list of requests, as incorporated into the RFP form, is 
attached for reference.  

I am not satisfied with the provisions of the "unit firm" contract regarding 
availability/power delivery.  We need to adequately document that the plant 
is allowed to be off-line, and not to make power deliveries, during 
maintenance periods.  The "unit firm" definition should cover other 
unscheduled outages.  Suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

Please note that the form of ISDA contract is not attached.  I understand 
Tracy has done the credit worksheet, and I hope to have a copy of the 
contract for attachment by noon tomorrow.  

Apologies to all for the rushed nature of this project.  It has been one of 
those things.  Your help is greatly appreciated.

Janine:  I would like to meet with you (and Guenther) regarding two topics:

(1)  softs trading (together with Bob Bruce)

(2)  credit trading (do we need anyone else?)

Either of Tuesday or Friday morning works fine.  Let me propose 9 am Tuesday 
for softs and 10 am for credit (and I am flexible).  Bob and I are located 
only several offices apart on the 38th floor of the Enron building.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Sara Shackleton

Marcelo:

Attached are my comments to your initial draft of Appendix C to the Canadian 
form of repo agreement.  Please note the following:

(1)  You attached "Annex II" to the end of Appendix C.  That annex came from 
the US repo with Merrill.  The information should actually be incorporated 
into "Appendix A" of your repo agreement.

(2)  I am waiting to hear internally regarding substitution and a default 
issue.

(3)  Please let me know if we have any issues on the Appendix C (and add a 
reference to Appendix C at the end of your printed form).  

We should be ready to execute shortly.

Thanks.

I work with Enron Investment Partners and would like to set up an account so 
that EIP can sell dribble out of its position in Cynet (CYNE.OB).  We 
currently hold preferred stock, and intend to convert to common for sale into 
the public market. We intend to begin selling dribble in the middle of March, 
so I would like to set up the administrative end now.

It is my understanding that I need:

? Your existing templates for setting up a new account.

? Prime Broker Agreement
? Corporate Resolution
? Form W-9
? Trading Authorization
? Authorization to Transfer Funds

Please send this information to me as soon as possible.

through the London office.  This document is not intended for the purposes of 
opening up a new executing broker accouunt with Goldman Sachs International.  
ECT Investments Inc currently has an existing executing broker agreement with 
Goldman Sachs & Co which should cover trades done in Houston and London since 
we are trading under the same legal entity.  The Terms of Business Letter 
sets forths terms and conditions that would apply to transactions executed by 
ECT Investments in London which is governed under the SFA rules and 
regulations.
 I will forward a copy of the document to Cheryl.  Goldman Sachs 
International is waiting for us to review and sign.  If you have additional

(1)  Goldman Sachs
ENA  executed the Client Access Agreement with Goldman, Sachs & Co.  on June 
15, 2000.  Since you are trading in the name of ENA, you should not need to 
execute an additional agreement.  I confirmed this with Ted Leh this 
morning.  At Ted's suggestion, please forward to me the fax number and email 
address of the Goldman person requesting that you execute further 
documentation.  I can fax to him a copy of the agreement and correspond by 
email.  I will also copy Ted Leh and Vivian Siao (keeps track of agreements 
and authorized traders) so that everyone is up to date.

(2)  UBS Warburg
I spoke with Sheryl Gallant.  ENA and other Enron affiliates are already 
trading on the UBS electronic websites for OTC transactions.  Interestingly 
enough, UBS does not require an electronic trading agreement to be signed by 
a customer for online trading.  In other words, ENA has an executed ISDA with 
UBS dated May 31, 1993, you are an authorized trader for ENA and UBS is happy 
to let you access their platform. Sheryl does not know why Jun Ishi requested 
execution of a "Client User List" (i.e., an authorized trader list) and said 
to forget it.  If you would like for me to speak to Jun Ishi or correspond 
with him (please send his email address), just let me know.

Please let me hear from you if you would like for me to pursue further.  As a 
representative of ENA, you will probably have most agreements already in 
place.

Sara,
As per my voice mail the attached document contains JPM's comments.

(See attached file: JPMorganFuturesEnronBlklned2232001.doc)

With regard to Section 2, 6(c), 14, 17 and 24:

   Section 2: Our debit rate benchmark for $ is the 30 day Libor rate with a
   spread.  We typically do not reference the rate in the agreement to allow 
for
   changes.  We do have an interest schedule that I can have e-mailed to you 
on
   Monday when the salesperson returns.
   Section 6 (c): Our credit rate benchmark for $ is the 13 wk T-bill with a
   spread.  As above, we typically do not reference the rate in the agreement 
to
   allow for changes as agreed between JPMFI and Client.  I will have our

   Section 14: If we are to include arbitration language, the CFTC mandates 
the
   exact form (180.3 of the CEA).  I can fax you the language and the reg.
   Please send me an e-mail with your fax number.
   Section 17: Unfortunately we cannot accept the additional language.  
Clients
   are sent daily statements in which they are required to notify us any
   objections within 24 hours since the nature of the futures market is such
   that large market movements can occur over short periods of time.  The
   monthly statement is a recap of the daily statements and the same reasoning
   applies.

into "Appendix A" of your repo agreement.

(2)  I am waiting to hear internally regarding substitution and a default 
issue.

I also need that same Credit Mgr. to give his final nod of approval to

Set-Off language you'd put into the last draft.  Our Legal only had on

Do you have an answer to this question?  Should ENA continue to transact with 
EI?  Sara

Lynn Aven@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
10/25/99 03:20 PM
Carolyn:

During 1999, there have been several purchases of NDF's related to the 
Elektro risk.  ENA, formerly ECT,  purchased the NDF's and then did a back to 
back NDF with Enron International for the identical risk.  The gain or loss 
associated with the NDF thus was reflected on EI's books.  

Now that EI is no longer an operating entity, I understand that the same 
transactions are still being handled on a back to back basis with EI from 
ENA..  Do you foresee that this will be a long range approach to these sorts 
of transactions or will each of the regions have to execute an ISDA agreement 
with ENA in order to get the gain or loss on the appropriate regions's books? 

From a tax perspective, the income is all US source income and therefore 
leaving the income on EI's books while apportioning the gainor loss to the 
various regions for financial reporting purposes if fine.

Thanks for sharing any insight you may have as to how accounting will handle 
these transactions going forward.

Denis:

I will initial the Security Agreement for you and have it executed.  Where do 
you want the executed documents sent?

As you know, all of our master agreements (whether or not related to 
structured deals) are logged into our Lotus Notes database to which London 
has access.  Please provide me with a list and copies of the ISDA Master 
Agreements (and/or related financial agreements) which have been executed by 
London  in the name of ENA.  These agreements should also be logged onto the 
ENA database.    

Will these masters be assigned to Enron Credit Inc.?  Will all trades be 
assigned?  If so, will you prepare the assignment for execution?

Thanks.

Just to clarify... the transfer of the swap has not been put on hold, but the 
sale of the assets hedged by the swaps.  I have been working on the asset 
sale out of Rawhide, but I'm not familiar with the transfer of the swap.

Sara,

I will send executed copies of the swaps shortly.

Thanks,

Just an update... I spoke with V&E this morning and the sale has been put on 
hold.  The negotiations broke down last week and, with the holiday, there has 
been no further progress.

I'll let you know when I get an update.

Thanks,
B

FYI
I was just notified that the sale of CEG and RioGas which are hedged in 
Raptor 2 will likely close next week.  Current estimates indicate that the 
loss on the sale will be around $30MM.  It is expected that the sale of the 
one remaining South American LDC will result in gains that will more than 
offset this loss.  Obviously, those expectations can change, but I wanted to 
keep everyone informed on this.

Ryan - This expected realized loss is exactly the situation which most 
concerned us in the meeting with Patti this week.  Is there anything we can 
do to push them towards resolving that timing of realized losses is 
irrelevent, and this is not an issue? 

Mark:  Cargill is asking us to execute with Cargill's agent a document 
permitting the agent to act for Cargill online and offline with respect to

I will initial the Security Agreement for you and have it executed.  Where do 
you want the executed documents sent?

As you know, all of our master agreements (whether or not related to 
structured deals) are logged into our Lotus Notes database to which London 
has access.  Please provide me with a list and copies of the ISDA Master 
Agreements (and/or related financial agreements) which have been executed by 
London  in the name of ENA.  These agreements should also be logged onto the 
ENA database.    

Will these masters be assigned to Enron Credit Inc.?  Will all trades be 
assigned?  If so, will you prepare the assignment for execution?

Thanks.

Sara - I did the ISDA with RVI. - This was a structured Credit Derivative 
Trade so you will not find this on the system.

I have reviewed and approved the Security Agreement.

Is anyone familiar with an ISDA Master Agreement executed between ENA and the 
above company?  I have received a Security Agreement executed by this party 
seeking ENA's signature and the document references the Endorsement (to a 
policy  - what policy?) issued to ENA on 10/19/00 which defines the ISDA 
agreement.  This could be related to credit activity in London.  I am waiting 
to hear from Jeff Kinneman and Denis O'Connell.

Do you anticipate doing trades with Sempra in the future?  Please see below 
which indicates Sempra's desire for a master if that is the case.  Please let 
me know.

I suspect they plan to do deals there as they are trying to get Enron Corp to

managing the Sempra relationship over there.

Thanks,
Tanya

Do you anticipate future ECT International deals with Sempra?  

Thanks,

Sara Shackleton
05/24/99 09:15 AM
Credit needs to initiate (and it may have to be London credit) but Tanya 
Rohauer will know.  FYI - London told us that Sempra "will not trade with ECT 
International."   SS

If we anticipate having to document any trades under ECT International Carl 
Petersen is going to want a Master set up with that entity.  Who needs to 
initiate that?

Thanks,
Jeff

I assume that what this e-mail relates to is the discussed "transfer" of the 
2 LDC swaps from Raptor 2 to Raptor 4. Frankly, I do not know what it means 
to assign a swap from 1 of these vehicles to another vehicle. I think that in 
general the schedules to the ISDAs that each of the 2 sets of parties 
executed are the same, but what happens in the case of differences? My rather 
simplistic approach would be to terminate the existing swaps in Raptor 2 and 
execute new swaps at the same time and on the same terms in Raptor 4. 

Unless anyone objects, I propose that we proceed along the lines outlined 
above, using the Raptor process documentation developed by Lisa and recently 
updated by Gordon.

We recently [like yesterday] received closing books on Raptor 3 and 
distributed those. If Anyone needs documentation on the other 3 structures, 
let us know....[Realizing that they are about to change due to the planned 
merger of Raptor 1, 2 and 4 into Mega-Raptor -- sounds like a bad Rug-Rats 
movie I recently had the misfortune of viewing doesn't it?]
No.  I guess the first step is to know into which Raptor the swaps are moving 
and to get Joel to give us a closing book on that Raptor so we can get the 
correct parties etc.  Attached is an assignment/assumption document I drafted 
for the VPP transaction which might be helpful (of course, it has a lot of 
inapplicable specifics) .    We ought to also check with Joel about any 
provisions in the rest of the vehicle docs that may apply to an assignment.  
I would think that if all parties join and consent and provide no ED or TE 
under the ISDAs shall occur on the basis of the assignment that it would be 
clean from the ISDA point of view.  Mary

I was just notified that the sale of CEG and RioGas which are hedged in 
Raptor 2 will likely close next week.  Current estimates indicate that the 
loss on the sale will be around $30MM.  It is expected that the sale of the 
one remaining South American LDC will result in gains that will more than 
offset this loss.  Obviously, those expectations can change, but I wanted to

Yes, my recollection is that Janelle was negotiating a deal with these guys 
in January, 2001.  I had conversations with David Adams and Grant Adamson but 
I can't recall if the swaption was ever executed.  I discussed the 
confirmation problem with David and noted that a small percentage of confirms 
were being marked  inconsistently (in Dec., 2000) after months of trading 
without any changes at all.  He was too busy to focus (and was a new lawyer, 
I think, which is why changes were appearing in the omnibus).

David,

We continue to wait for word from you on the availability of additional 
financial information to review Glencore International AG.  We are looking 
for similair information to that which was provided S&P.  Without such 
information, a limited global credit line  will be allocated per your 
direction.

Sara, I believe we should holdoff preparing executable documents until we 
hear back from David.  That way, we can include in a single amendment those 
changes I referenced in my credit worksheet.

thanks

David - Per our telephone conversation of earlier today, please find the

pages of the ISDA are sent through to FSA today - per my previous email.  I 
have initialled signatory pages for your records and faxed to Samantha this 
morning.  I will ensure the details of each of the ENA ISDAs that I have 
negotiated are uploaded into Lotus Notes. Please call me when you come in.

Many tks,

Denis:

Per my voice mail, please advise which ENA officer will execute your 
documents for ENA.  When we hear from you, we can have the docs executed and 
delivered.

Also, we need copies of the executed ENA masters and the information entered 
into Lotus Notes.

Thanks for your help.

John:  I hope you are able to locate an executed ISDA Master Agreement 
between RMT and EECC inasmuch as neither our database nor files reflect one.  
, I've asked Susan Bailey to resend the draft Schedule.  In the event that we 
need to execute this Schedule, you should provide us with appropriate notice 
information. We can then prepare execution originals.

Let me know if you need further assistance.  Thanks.

With respect to Morgan, I believe that a paragraph could be added to reflect 
the parties' agreement to a forum other than a contract market (i.e., "AAA"), 
and if the customer chose a particular forum for arbitration, then the 
parties could stipulate that the arbitrators not have authority to award 
punitive, exemplary or similar damages.   Because these are fairly old forms, 
I can't recall the reason for excluding this language.

I'll schedule some time on Monday for us to talk.

Hi Sara,

I have completed a preliminary legal review of the Account Agreements with 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  

I read the draft language you sent re: limitation of liability that you 
suggested we add to these and the Bear Stearns agreements for Enron Credit, 
Inc.   Because these agreements have arbitration clauses, this provision as 
drafted might be unenforceable under the NASD rules.  I am going to 
doublecheck the law on this point today or over the weekend.  If this is in 
fact correct, the firms will probably reject the provision on this ground 
especailly if including it would subject them to NASD fines.   In any case, 
we can wait to see what there response is but in the meantime we should set 
aside time to discuss the law on this point.

I think these guys are trying to create a $35M line ($15M Collateral 
Threshold from the ISDA Credit Support Annex and a separate $20M line for the 
Global agency trading).  All trading with Cargill will be subject to the ISDA 
Master Agreement and Credit Support Annex.

Wendi and I discussed briefly and we'll call you later.  It seems that Wendi 
has spoken with Mark Rubenstein who handles credit and there is some 
confusion.

Joe_Lardy@cargill.com on 03/02/2001 10:39:03 AM
Currently Cargill and Enron have a 15MM collateral threshold.  If
possible, I think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a
box around the prime broker biz.  We would still operate under the
master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support annex
for this biz.  We would still keep the 20,000,000 line referenced in
Schedule B of the POA agreement.  The line in the POA is a seperate and
distinct measure from the daily collateral.  The 20 mill reflects gross
exposure.  Let me know if you think this is reasonable and workable.
We too, are open to suggestion as the Global and Enron relationships
are very important and a high priority to us.

Thanks
Joe

Joe-  a few things regading the POA/ Cargill line..

I am going to find out how much line we currently have available... you
probably already have this.  We should allocate a piece to Global which
would solve the problem of other Cargill people using the line, putting
us
over the limit, without me knowing...

We could change the language of the POA to this... we will not go over
Global's piece of the Cargill line...I think this would solve our main
concern...

Please let me know... we are eager to keep trading with Global and
yourselves...

summary, we would like copies.

Other than with respect to the two Forward Extras with Bank of America, are 
there any restrictions in your credit agreements with the various banks that 
require notice and/or consent (with respect to forward positions) when there 
is a change of ownership, etc. (as to Daishowa)?

Interesting.  Morgan just proposed language similar to my earlier email (for 
a futures agreement but the language mirrors that used on the brokerage 
side).  Maybe its unenforceable.

Hey Sara,  

Let's talk in detail Monday but just quickly -  its precisely the decision to 
include the arbitration clause that makes the language prohibitive.  I think 
the gist of the applicable NASD rule is that members cannot draft arbitration 
clauses which limit the damages that either party would otherwise be entitled 
to in  court.  Thus, the solution if Morgan or the others object would be to 
draft a clause that is consistent with what New York provides -- since New 
York is the applicable jurisdiction.  (I'll find a sample clause I drafted in 
the past and bring when we meet).  Otherwise, these firms could be fined for 
including such language.  I am going to find the applicable rule and make 
sure that it is still good law but off hand I believe that it is.  It will be 
interesting to note if any of the firms object on this ground.  

I may have some questions about other legal issues in the agreements; if so, 
I will bring them up when we meet so that we can work through them together.

Guess what they want?  The following ISDA agreements to trade financial (and 
PHYSICAL):

(1)  Amerada Hess Corp.   and  ENA
(2)  Hess Energy Services Company, LLC and  ENA
(3)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and  ELFI
(4)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECT Singapore Pte. Ltd.
(5)  Hess Energy Trading Company, LLC  and ECTRIC

I explained our financial trading entities.
She did not know what products each of the Hess affiliates would be trading.
Hess CREDIT:  Grim Trivino at 212-536-8979
Hess LEGAL:  Dana Dellacona at 212-536-8133

Please let me know who will handle in credit (and I'll intercede with the 
lawyer).  TO MY KNOWLEDGE, NOBODY AT ENRON IS PUSHING HESS.
As usual, thanks for your help.

I received your call.  I have not heard from credit.  There are two things 
that you can do in the meantime.

(1)  For online trading, please call Tana Jones at 713-853-3399

(2)  Please advise what physical and financial products you want to trade.  I 
believe that you didn't know when we last spoke.

speak with you especially since I'm speaking with credit about municipals on 
Wednesday.

As a practical matter, I'm not sure whether we even transact with utilities 
on the omnibus.  Perhaps Tana can answer the question as to online trading 
and the confirmation desk as to offline trading.  Secondly, I'm not sure how 
often the Additional Event of Default is successfully negotiated into the

Ladies,  

Could one of you please tell me what is Legal's position on generating 
confirms for EOL trades?  I was under the impression (evidently false) that 
we did NOT send confirms for gas  deals done on EOL.  I did hear that legal 
was currently reviewing this issue.  Do you know where it stands, or who the 
best person to contact about this would be?  Please let me know.

We are looking to do some confirm automation (at last, at last!) and one of 
the issues we are looking at is do we REALLY need to send paper confirms for 
trades done on EOL.  It seems that it would just give someone one more chance 
to dispute the trade.  

Mary, I was at the DCAF conference where you spoke on the issue of electronic 
confirmtions and on line trading, but I don't remember how far Enron was on 
these issues.  

Sara,  It seems like we talked about this as part of a larger conversation on 
web-based confirms.  

I would be grateful to hear both of your thoughts/concerns related to the 
above.  

Thanks very much for your help!

Sara,

Okay, looks to me like Weyerhaueser wants us to act as their counsel.  I told 
Bill to propose the language he wanted, but he said his lawyer was out of 
town for two weeks.  Which makes me wonder if they can even sign this thing 
without her consent, but I did not think to ask him this at the time.

Anyway, he basically wants to add a third party guarantee as eligible credit 
support in the event of a downgrade.  He said he is willing to include 
language indicating that the nondowngraded party would have to accept this 
guarantee, subject to a commercially reasonable objection.  On its face, I 
have no objection to such a provision, but would like to quickly bounce it 
off of you.  I'm not sure that I want to be forced to disclose what that 
reason is....

And basically, I also have no objection to allowing the posting of collateral 
in a form and amount acceptable to the nondowngraded party, with such amount 
subject to change as conditions warrant.

Also, I thought we usually had assignability to affiliates so long as the 
guarantor remained the same.  I think Bill indicated we probably removed that 
because we had it this way with the Canadian subsidiary.  He wants to put it 
back in.  I want it back in as well.

Otherwise, we are increasing the guaranty amounts to $25MM, and they have 
agreed to the cross default provisions.

Let's discuss this when you get a minute.  He had some additional 
clarification he needed, but these seemed to be the legal issues on his 
list.  I don't think there is going to be any way around this other than to 
call him and explain.  Sorry.

1 - We would like the right to assign to another counterparty as well as
Enron.  Something within Weyerhaeuser.

2 - If Weyerhaeuser or Enron below investment grade, can

 Post collateral, Counterparty will act in a commercially reasonable
manner

 Obtain a third party guarantee, Counterparty will act in a
commercially reasonable manner

Hi, Sara!

Cynthia asked me to check with you guy about a Korean entity.  Michael 
Moulton has done a swap with a Korean entity that will be confirmed under a 
confirmation with Annex A attached.  Are there any special provisions we need 
to add for a Korean entity?

Thanks!

Ed:  I need to understand factually what is happening.  All transactions 
between ENA and Mirant Americas Energy Marketing should be subject to the 
existing ISDA between ERMS and Vastar Gas Marketing Inc., as amended.  The 
existing guaranty from Vastar Resources, Inc. applies to all trades through 
approximately  the end of this week

Who have you spoken with at Mirant as a follow up to our conversation of last 
Friday?  It appears that Mirant is trying to prevent trading until the new 
guaranty is in place.  Frank has contacted Mirant legal and are in agreement 
in principle as to the new guaranty from Mirant Corporation.  However, we 
understand that this entity  will be spun off in the near future and the 
credit could change substantially.  Have you given thought to the effect of 
the new guaranty?

Also, have we traded today with Mirant Americas Energy Marketing?  Online or 
offline?  We should talk to our traders about apparent authority and/or save 
tapes if we are having problem

Call.

We will negotiate a new ISDA in the next few months

It was my understanding that they would not be able to opt out of trading 
under the ISDA, since this contract has not been terminated.  However, if 
this is not the case and the trades that we are currently entering into are 
not being confirmed under the ISDA, I think that we should get together as 
soon as possible.  We do a significant volume of trades each day with this 
counterparty both OTC and EOL.

Lets discuss.

Ed Sacks
  

Ed - After we hung up, I though a bit more about trading with Mirant.  In 
light of the letter sent by Mirant on February 26 that stated ". . . no 
further transactions will be enter into under the agreement", we need to call 
Mirant prior to completing the trade.  I will try on this end, but you should 
also try.  The contact is Nicole Russell (678) 579-7489.

All:

I have verified with CP that we do not want to stop financial trading between 
CP and ENA.  The immediate plan is as follows:

(1)  Immediate new guaranty from Mirant Corporation  (Frank to send draft in 
the a.m.)

(2)  Immediate amendment of the existing ISDA Master Agreement to replace 
Vastar with Mirant Corporation as the credit support provider (CP to send 
draft in the a.m.)

(3)  Immediate execution of a short letter agreement to reflect that all 
financial trades done until the effective date of the new guaranty will be 
honored by CP and subject to the existing ISDA Master Agreement (I will 
prepare)

(4)  Review of the existing agreement to see if CP has issues (which we may 
consider).

If anyone has any questions, please let me knowl  

Let's all stay in touch throughout the day to get this done.  Thanks.

In general, I thought that Wendi was waiting to hear back from Cargill 
Incorporated credit.  Once we understood what Cargill was looking for, I was 
hoping to speak with their lawyer and agree to eliminate all of the 
provisions appearing in the draft POA which did not really concern ENA.  
Recall that ENA does not want to monitor Cargill's agent:  that's an internal 
job for Cargill.

I hope that we can speak on Monday.  Maybe you can coordinate tomorrow with 
Wendi.  Thanks.

Sara- I am going to suggest to Cargill that we will call them before any deal 
with Global gets booked.. they will have to approve it.. and then I'll go 
ahead with the Global deal... they will have to strip out all the references 
to the line... need to ask you a few other things though....
Joe_Lardy@cargill.com on 03/02/2001 10:39:03 AM
Currently Cargill and Enron have a 15MM collateral threshold.  If
possible, I think the cleanest way to run this biz would be to put a
box around the prime broker biz.  We would still operate under the
master isda but could set up a mutually agreeable credit support annex
for this biz.  We would still keep the 20,000,000 line referenced in
Schedule B of the POA agreement.  The line in the POA is a seperate and
distinct measure from the daily collateral.  The 20 mill reflects gross
exposure.  Let me know if you think this is reasonable and workable.
We too, are open to suggestion as the Global and Enron relationships
are very important and a high priority to us.

Thanks
Joe

Joe-  a few things regading the POA/ Cargill line..

I am going to find out how much line we currently have available... you
probably already have this.  We should allocate a piece to Global which
would solve the problem of other Cargill people using the line, putting
us
over the limit, without me knowing...

We could change the language of the POA to this... we will not go over
Global's piece of the Cargill line...I think this would solve our main
concern...

Please let me know... we are eager to keep trading with Global and
yourselves...

Mary/Carol: please note points 2 and 3 below.

Ron Baker: based on my discussions with Rex Rogers, if the existing Enron 
shares are cancelled and new shares issued, ENA board authorization will be 
required. Note that the next scheduled board meeting is in early April.

Ron Astin/Terry Yates: FYI, discuss point 5 below.....

Gentlemen,

After talking with both Joel Ephross and Ron Baker this morning about the 
Raptor restructuring, my understanding of the current plan is summarized 
below.   Please let me know if I have mischaracterized the proposed 
approach.  We have a couple concerns from a tax perspective that are also 
discussed below.  

1.) V&E is currently drafting documents to allow each Raptor structure to 
look to the other structures in terms of credit capacity. 
2.) The previously proposed assignment of the LDC swaps from Raptor II to 
Raptor IV is off the table.  These swaps will now be terminated.
3.) Either Raptor II or Raptor IV will be used to hedge the Mariner 
investment ($360M) instead.  
4.) The JEDI structure is expected to be unwound thus allowing 12M Enron 
Corp. shares to come back to Enron Corp. and no longer be treated as issued 
and outstanding for purposes of Enron's EPS calculation. 
5.) The value of 12M new Enron Corp. shares would be used to capitalize 
either Raptor II or Raptor IV (12M shares x $70 = approx. $840M).  
 a.) As consideration for the contribution of the shares, the receivable owed 
by the lower tier LLC to the Enron member under the grid note would be 
increased by the same amount.
    b.) The credit capacity of the subject Raptor structure would increase by 
an amount equal to the discount on the shares caused by their restricted 
nature.   ($840M x 35% to 45% = approx. $294M to $378M)   
 c.) Ryan has apparently suggested that the shares actually be transferred to 
a trust and that the trust issue a forward contract on the shares to the 
chosen Raptor structure.  We have some concerns about this approach from a 
tax perspective.   I would like to better understand the benefits of using a 
forward contract, who would own the beneficial interest in the trust, and 
what follow-on transactions might be planned regarding the trust.
 d.) I am still confused about the characterization of the contribution of 
the additional shares as utilizing the credit capacity of the Raptor 
structure to which they are contributed.   I can understand why the shares 
would not increase the credit capacity of the structure, but I am told that 
the potential downside on the Enron stock would actually utilize the 
structure's capacity.

Some thoughts on some of these:

Entergy Power Marketing - shouldn't be using anymore - Axia is the mktg JV 
for Koch and Entergy
LG&E - hardly ever see trades here anymore; once in a blue moon we see 
something - not worth anyone's time
PMI - highly negotiated their paper; not going to touch it
Cross Timbers, Belco, Breitburn, Cabot - all Fred customer's - I would not 
hold my breath
Dynegy Canada - should already be on our list
Dynegy - should convert to an ISDA
Reliant - should convert to an ISDA
MSCG - should convert to an ISDA

The rest can wait for another time.

Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.

Agreements (and/or related financial agreements) which have been executed by 
London  in the name of ENA.  These agreements should also be logged onto the

I have reviewed and approved the Security Agreement.

Is anyone familiar with an ISDA Master Agreement executed between ENA and the 
above company?  I have received a Security Agreement executed by this party 
seeking ENA's signature and the document references the Endorsement (to a 
policy  - what policy?) issued to ENA on 10/19/00 which defines the ISDA 
agreement.  This could be related to credit activity in London.  I am waiting 
to hear from Jeff Kinneman and Denis O'Connell.

Mr. Geoffrey Pack;

We received internal credit information in mid-January.  Unfortunately, the

we apologize for the delay in submitting draft documentation to you.  We did

The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements 
Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.  It is an 
Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to "Other 
Agreements".  Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the 
entry in  the master swap agreement database.  Thanks!

You need to speak with the developer.  There is no way to control the 
inclusion of "Other Agreements" in the "All Agreements" section as the system 
is currently designed.

I am not disagreeing with you; I learned this the hard way a few months ago.  
The system is confusing.

Sara Shackleton

	03/14/2001 05:47 PM
		
It has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for 
master swap agreements only.  Having other documents listed in that section 
may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general 
trading purposes, such as Global Contracts.  That is why we created the 
"Other Agreements" section, to house these other agreements.  My 
understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the 
Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously.  
The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong 
agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been 
proliferating.  If my understanding is not correct, than when did the 
intentional use of that first section change?  I think putting all agreement 
is a very bad idea.

Janice/Sara,

Attached please find the fully, negotiated credit terms for an Amended Master 
Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement between CP and EPMI as well as the new 
credit terms for an ISDA Master Swap Agreement between CP and ENA.

Janice/Sara:  Please ensure that Specified Entities for the ISDA include 
Enron Corp. and EPMI, and that the setoff provisions in both the ISDA and 
Master Power are consistent.

Sara:  In the essence of time, Merrill Lynch showed Allegheny Energy the 
existing ISDA between ENA and Merrill Lynch.  So, Allegheny's attorneys have 
reviewed the ISDA terms that we had with Merrill in order to "get up to 
speed" with the ISDA that Allegheny would end up having with ENA via 
assignment or "reproduction of some sort."  After the financial gas and power 
deals are assigned completely to Allegheny, ENA will continue to have 
interest rate swaps/and maybe even a weather swap with Merrill.  That being 
said, I don't think we can necessarily "assign" the ISDA with Merrill to 
Allegheny.  I think we will need to "reproduce" the majority of the terms to 
a new ISDA w/Allegheny.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Raymond James Agreement today for execution.  By the end of the day, R/J 
should call me back with a separate account number for an identical agreement 
for ENA for signature as well.  Please have the accompanying docs ready so 
that we can send everything out for signature asap.

Stephanie, by the end of the day or Monday, we are going to have ready for 
execution the agreements with "Simmons" and Frost -- both with ENA.  Can you 
doublecheck with Aneela that this choice, based on her list, is correct.  
Then, when these come in at the end of the day or Monday I will forward for 
execution.

Do we know who other than Gary could sign any agreements today?  If not, 
maybe we will take all of these, plus Robertson Stephens and J.P. Morgan to 
him on Monday.

We may have to wait until Monday to talk about Enron Credit because I have to 
spend the rest of the afternoon preparing the SEC docs, opinion letters and 
other documents for the sale of the Cynet stock by the Houston Economic 
Opportunity Fund LP.

2:45 Houston time is fine for me.
Also, the Trading Limitation language is NOT intended to kick in for intraday 
limit moves but only at the end of the day (i.e., "closing or settlement 
price").  We want the language to remain the same.  Hope this works.  Sara

Can we have a call at 3:45 p.m. to see where we all are at and hopefully wrap 
up all issues on the agreements?  Thanks

Sorry for the mixup.  Attached is template for confirm and then the GTC 
(minus tax reps).  I'm trying to fit in the tax reps in between phone calls 
and will distribute to Susan Musch (tax) for review.

Stuart:  Who else should be on the review list?

 Thanks.  Sara

Kate:
A few points about the last draft of the Agreement:

(1)  Par. 1(a):  the transfer and assumption is effective as of March 16, 
2001 and not as of the Collateral Return

(2)  Par. 1(d):  the parties have already agreed to use one set of 
spreadsheets

(3)  Par.  3:  the ML&Co. guaranties are not being released because there are 
existing deals in place.  The guaranties will only be released as to the 
transferred Transactions

(4)  Par. 6:  conform language to side letters

(5)  Par. 8:  Please delete the last two sentences.  Enron will agree to be 
silent as to court actions, costs and attorneys fees.

Please call at 713-853-5620 (Sara) or 713-853-1794 (Janice).  Regards.

Attached are my comments to the transfer agt.  I think it makes sense to 
attach the form of each side letter to the agreement for clarity.

I have just gotten off the phone with Lauren and Ken Blasko.  There were 
minor comments to LOC Facility that have been faxed to ABN Amro.  We expect 
that ABN Amro will execute the LOC shortly as soon as they pick up the fax.

The LOC will be sent to Lauren.  If there are no further commetns to the 
various contracts, we shoudl be prepaerd to exchange signature pages upon 
conclusion of the LOC Facility.  Lauren will send the LOC together with the 
Side Letters to Enron and Kate.

Lauren is the ALlegheny point person.  Pls direct all correspondence to her.  
Locke, should signature pages be sent to you as well as to Kate?

Janice and Sara, to whose attention and which number should all 
correspondence be directed?

Thank you all for your cooperation and help in moving this toward closing.

Thank you for your fax.
Section 180.3 of the CEA prohibits us from agreeing to any settlement
procedure/forum ahead of time.  JPMFI, in accordance with 180.3, will offer

will be
subject to the provisions specified in your fax dd 2/26/2001.

Attached is JPM's proposed language for the arbitration agreement.

(See attached file: ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.doc)

If you are in agreement with the language, please forward Enron's proposed
language (detailed in your 2/26 fax) electronically (if available).

Thank you and Regards,

Sara -

I would like to discuss with you a potential opportunity at WAPA Sierra 
Nevada.  We have just sent them an EEI and would like you to send them an 
ISDA.  Basically in the near future they might find themselves quite short 
due to a PG&E contract being invalidated.  If that happens they will either:

1. Buy physical power from the market (use our EEI)
2.Do a financial swap with the market and continue to do the physical index 
with PG&E (there are some reasons for this which I am not 100% sure on).

The lawyer we have dealt with is Koji Kawamura and his email address is:

kawamura@wapa.gov

Thanks for your help - If you have any questions please let me know.

Stewart Rosman

Please review the GTC's for the Canadian FX product.

Stuart:  Please call about your form of confirmation.

Carlos:  We may want to amend the descriptions to match the "ISDA language" 
contained in the GTC's.

Marcelo:  Have you had a chance to speak with AFAC about the week of November 
28?  Please let me hear from you soon.  Regards.  Sara

"Dear Sara:

Thank you for your message below. Please note that AFAC is in a business trip 
in Japan and will be back to Brazil in the beginning of next week. We will

AFAC and Marcelo:  We are in the process of reviewing the Comparative Chart 
and
attached memorandum and will soon provide a list of remaining issues which 
Enron

attempting to identify specific types of transactions which may be required to
hedge Enron risk in Brazil before 12/31/99.  For planning purposes, the 
"group"
would like to meet with you in Sao Paulo during the week of November 28.   We

Mr. Sage requested.  Thanks for your help with this matter. Teresa

Richard Sage has asked us to change the slate of directors and officers of 
this entity to U.S. people, with the exception that perhaps Richard Sage will 
retain an officer title.   Will you please provide to me a list of who the 
directors will be and who the officers will be and their respective titles.  
My understanding is that these elections should take place effective March 5, 
2001.  Please advise or if you would like to discuss please call me at 
X58444.  Thanks for your assistance.  Teresa

All,
So that everyone can see what everone else is doing, below is the list of

I think quite a few of these were completed in Houston on Friday.
Please shout if:
- I have missed anything
- Any deadlines are unrealistic
- Anybody else should be copied in

Susan:  This may look confusing!  It contains all of our "choices" for 
preparing the documents.  See Part 2 (Tax Reps) and the end of the document 
which has our "choices" of tax forms.

I thought it might be helpful to be very basic about withholding issues, 
etc., why we need the tax reps, and what questions we could ask upfront about 
a party that would help us select an appropriate tax module.  We tend to not 
"think" and expect a party "fill in the blank" when we are preparing draft 
documents.

other projects that I have to work on tonight and will not get the

really appreciate your asking me to speak to the group and also (hopefully) 
your understanding and patience in postponing the tax discussion.

Lisa J. Mellencamp

Mark:  This is a chronic problem which I have addressed with Cheryl on more 
than one occasion (hence the email of this morning).  Her priorities are not 
currently with the swap group.  Also, Carol will not be a reliable backup for 
structured deals since Julia's group will demand more of her time.  I don't 
know what Angela's load will be like as an ongoing substitute.  Last night we 
received notice of Yosemite IV and I'm hoping that Angela can cover.  
Alternatively, we may need to consider Frank, Francisco or Cheryl.

Sara, 

Keegan has notified me this morning (!) that my calendar contains a sheduling 
conflict (again) between the swaps group meeting which is 10-11 and a meeting 
with representatives coming from GE.  I think Keegan got confused or 
something.  Since this has happened before, I am going to sit down with 
Keegan this afternoon to discuss how to schedule and to troubleshoot 
scheduling issues.  

For today, I am going to try to do this - I am going to try to end the GE 
meeting early but I cannot promise.  As I explained to Keegan, since the GE 
meeting is with someone traveling to Enron to attend and is critical to Enron 
Corp., I will not be able to cancel it at the last minute.

If I do not attend, please apologize to the Group to me.  I am a bit 
frustrated because I certainly wanted to attnd to find out what everyone else 
is working on and to report on what I am doing.  I will try to email an 
update in advance and if you do not mind, maybe you could share it with the 
Group.

Hi Keegan, 

Thank you for calling this morning to provide me with my schedule for today.  

I want to share some constructive advice on how to fine tune our strategy 
with respect to scheduling because Keegan this is critical to my providing 
the best legal counsel I can to the various clients we serve.  You indicated 
that there is a conflict on the schedule in that there is a 9:30-10:30 
meeting that conflicts with the Swaps Group meeting.  We do not want to 
schedule conflicting meetings and then realize it at the last minute and then 
just notify one group that we can't attend.  

What you want to do is this:  You want to try at the time of the invitation 
to attend or as soon as practicable to notify me that there would be a 
potential conflict.  Then I will try to rescheduel.  This is especially 
important because the meetings with GSS are usually with folks from outside 
Enron, so once we agree to attend, it is nearly impossible the morning before 
to try to reschedule.  But the swaps meetings and credit meetings are very 
important and there are a lot of issues I need to discuss and anticipated 
attending.  Also and I have missed some in the past due to scheduling 
conflicts.  

Again, I also hope and need for you to take this advice constructively and 
not personally.  I appreciate all of your efforts, Keegan.  

Let's meet this afternoon to talk strategy.  Please note on my calendar that 
Ischeduled two meetings this morning, one at 2:30 and one immediately 
following at 3:30 until 5.  So we should meet before then.

Sara asked me to e-mail the attached to you.

Russell:

I received your voice mail about the one (1) year financial trade done 
between ENA and CP.  The three-month limitation on trades is only an internal 
ENA control which was imposed by credit some years ago.  Please refer to 
Lotus Notes for a more comprehensive explanation.

The Master Agreement has been executed.  However, CP was unable to render a 
legal opinion vouching for "blanket" enforceability of the trades due to 
conflicting PUC orders which are still in effect today.

What is credit's position when your internal policy is violated?  Who was the 
trader?  Have you spoken with the trader?

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the "trade options exemption" and as to the 
parties being "eligible swap participants" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was "too old" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. ("ECI").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Stewart:

I spoke with Rawleigh White (Tribal CFO) and the Tribe's outside counsel the 
other day.  Pending receipt of Tracy's credit worksheet, I'll send the 
Tribe/lawyers a "sample ISDA without credit" which is not specific to the 
Tribe.  The lawyers will begin to determine if the Tribe is an "eligible 
contract participant" for purposes of the Commodity Exchange Act.

Rawleigh wants to know if Enron is interested in helping the Tribe finance 
the purchase of the two dams.  Can you please address for West Origination 
and respond to Raleigh?

Thanks.

Sara Shackleton

Susan:

I've spoken with a new Indian tribe and need to send the "sample governmental 
ISDA" to several people.  I"ll forward the names/addresses to you.  Stewart 
Rosman is the commercial person and he should be copied as well as Tracy 
Ngo.  Please include the following message (verify the question I left for 
you) with the attachment:

"Per our recent conversation, please find attached a sample Schedule to the 
ISDA Master Agreement (and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex - 
Susan, can we send?) which is not tailored specifically for the Tribe.  We 
will be able to provide a specific Schedule and Paragraph 13 after our credit 
group has concluded its review.  You may already be familiar with the ISDA 
Municipal Counterparty Schedule and will note that although we are 
incorporating many of those provisions.  We assume that you have the ISDA 
boilerplate (for the Master Agreement and the Credit Support Annex).

Sheila:  Thanks for the message.  I spoke with Mike Schneider (who contacted 
me - he's at 212-648-1164) to confirm our agreement and wanted to let you 
know that he was apologetic for having not having "better rates" to charge 
ENA.  He said he's been after Enron's business for some time and hopes to 
reduce rates in the course of business, if possible.  I thought you might 
want to have this bit of information.  Regards.  Sara

Sara,
We are okay on the rate schedule as it stands.

Theresa and Greg,
The rates from JP Morgan for the Futures account appear to be competitive 
(acutally better) than the terms for our other current agreements.
With 90 day t bill at 4.41%, 90% of this is 3.969% on the credit side vs 4.16 
using JP morgan's less 25 bp.
On the debit side it is competitive.  
Therefore, I am okay with the rate schedule from JP morgan and we can go 
ahead unless anyone can see an objection.
Thanks. Sheila

Further to your e-mail to Justin re equity trading in the UK, I would be 
grateful if you could let me know whether you would be free to have a 
conference call this Friday 30 March @ 3.00 p.m. London time.   If this is 
not convenient, please suggest an alternative time.  

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

How does the attached work for the BOFC/NDF?

I am not necessarily proposing that we use this for the EOL deal.

Sara Shackleton

Hey, Jason:

Hope you're doing alright.  I received a call from NY and before I called 
back, I checked the infamous Lotus Notes.  It seems that you were going to 
send a letter to NY summarizing the outstanding issues (I think there was 
only one issue).  Please let me know if this was ever done.  Thanks.

On a sad note, I don't know if you heard but Samantha's 19-month old daughter 
(adoption not final) was killed in a tragic car accident last week.  The 
child managed to crawl under the car while it was in the driveway and Sam 
didn't see her.  Did you really get to know Samantha?  If so, and if you 
would like her home address, please let me know.

Sara Shackleton

Serge:

Sorry to take so long to respond.  A few things:

(1)  What is the correct legal name of the entity you are inquiring about?  
Is it the unregulated marketing arm of the regulated utility?

(2)  There has not been a commercial push from the ENA perspective to set up 
a new agreement with FPL which explains why I cannot get our credit  goup to 
react.  I'll broach the topic again when  I hear from you.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Sara Shackleton

Maria:

I was waiting to see if Jason Peters ever sent a "position letter" to you 
when we brought this negotiation back inhouse.  Absent that information, it 
appears that we had at least one issue remaining and it concerned the 
disruption fallbacks, in particular, your request for both you and ENA to 
each obtain two quotes and then average those quotes (the ultimate 
fallback).  We cannot agree to your request.  The last database entry I 
reflect was in October, 2000, when we were having difficulty obtaining your 
response.

Given the lapse of time, we could try to generate a blackline and review the 
status.  Please let me know what you would like to do.

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was "too old" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. ("ECI").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

It has recently emerged that we have concluded financially-settled trades 
from London with Sempra in the name of ECT (Houston).

Unfortunately, this could create a significant tax issue for ECT (Houston) 
i.e. a taxable presence in the UK.

Therefore, if we wish to continue trading with Sempra from London, we must 
trade in the name of ECTI (aka ECTRIC), but not ECT (Houston). 

This principle applies generally  - London should not bind ECT (Houston) to 
trades with counterparties.

Please call Janine Juggins or myself if you would like to discuss this.

Best regards

Paul

How are things going?

In response to your question, there is no internal memo but we do have copies 
of external lawfirm memoranda.  Yes, ENA has changed its ISDA Schedule form 
to provide for the "eligible contract participant" rep and line of business.  
I'll verify with Susan Bailey as to whether these changes have been subnitted 
to ECTRIC.  

Rather than bombard you with lots of paper, please let me know what you would 
lilke to see regarding the new legislation.  Please note that the act is very 
broad, extremely confusing (even to CFTC "know-it alls") and addresses many 
types of derivatives (ag, equity, etc.) with some specificity.

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the "trade options exemption" and as to the 
parties being "eligible swap participants" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

Martin

Anna:

I know that you have been negotiating with Cheryl Nelson about the new ECI 
account.  I am receiving urgent calls from ECI traders and hope you give me 
some answers since Cheryl is in a meeting.

Can we execute the ECI agreement today?  
Have we agreed on the assignment?
Does the assignment also provide for the transfer of the Master Securities 
Loan Agreement?
Regarding the new ENE guaranty, Cheryl has told me that this was already 
requested.  I'll check on the expedited delivery date.

Please call me when you receive this email.  Thanks very much for your

Linda & Sharon,

My primary job responsibility is to online trading, and right now EnronOnline 
is quite a beast of a customer.  Because of that I please ask that you direct 
any future questions you may have with respect to confirmations to our two 
paralegals who handle the day to day trading, Susan Bailey at x34737 and 
Stephanie Panus at x53249.  

With respect to the two current Canadian confirmations, Sara Shackleton, an 
attorney in our Group, is working with Credit to resolve the questions on the 
Slater Steel and Casco credit worksheets.

We're glad to hear that you are coming and we're looking forward to seeing
you again.

You can fly into any one of the three Washington area airports.  Reagan
National is the closest (about 35 minutes by car in non-rush hour traffic),
Washington Dulles is about 40 minutes away and BWI is about 50 minutes away.
That is generally our order of preference in looking for flights.  However,
flights into BWI in general may be cheaper than flights into Dulles or
National, and National tends to be the most expensive.  You need to check all
three as to price, because airfares change frequently and sometimes USAir or
another airline will quote a decent price into National.  Once you have
decided which airport you will be using, let us know and we will e-mail
directions.

Love - Anita and Steve

Wednesday, March 28 is the target execution date for the ECI customer

Just wanted to follow up to see if we have a time frame as to when the letter

Thanks,

Here's a recap for everyone.  
Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was "too old" and that we 
negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
Enron Credit Inc.. ("ECI").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.

Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
existing agreement to ECI.

Sara,

I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
Reduce funding to 20% per side.

I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
finalization of the agreement.

Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
execution taken care of immediately?

Thanks,

Tom

I am not aware of any products that need to be identified prior to 12/31/99.  
Going forward into next year, the following products might be of interest for 
trading.  Our current plan for managing risk is via offshore products through 
Gary's group due to tax and regulatory reasons.

1. Brazil corporate eurobonds
2. Brazil Brady bonds
3. Other country corporate and/or Brady bonds (ie, can a Brazil limitada own 
an Argentine eurobond?)
4. Bovespa index futures
5. R$ currency futures
6. Local Treasury bills (both US$ indexed and R$ rate) such as BBCs, LBCs, 
LTNs, NTNs, NBCs, etc
7. R$ currency forwards
8. Rules/regulations/tax effects on individual stock trades
9. Local company commercial paper (typically trades at 105% to 110% multiple 
to the overnight rate depending on credit).

As discussed, it would be interesting to see what the tax effects are on each 
type of investment, what margin is required, and what offshore alternatives 
are available for items #4-8 (the first 3 are bringing offshore items into 
Brazil, which we might do if there was a tax benefit that could be obtained).

Thanks,  Bruce

Schedule).  Tks

FYI, I won't come to San Antonio; hope instead to see you at the autumn

How are things going?

In response to your question, there is no internal memo but we do have copies 
of external lawfirm memoranda.  Yes, ENA has changed its ISDA Schedule form 
to provide for the "eligible contract participant" rep and line of business.  
I'll verify with Susan Bailey as to whether these changes have been subnitted 
to ECTRIC.  

Rather than bombard you with lots of paper, please let me know what you would 
lilke to see regarding the new legislation.  Please note that the act is very 
broad, extremely confusing (even to CFTC "know-it alls") and addresses many 
types of derivatives (ag, equity, etc.) with some specificity.

Will you be in San Antonio?

Elisabeth:

I read an article in a law magazine about the captioned Act and it was, among 
other things, stated therein that CFTC under the Act had been deprived of its 
jurisdiction over swaps (other than those related to agricultural products) 
made by eligible contracts participants.  Since the Oslo office trades 
through ECTRIC, I wonder whether this new piece of legislation has an impact 
on our standard reps relating to the "trade options exemption" and as to the 
parties being "eligible swap participants" (are they still required)?  Is 
there any internal memo yet prepared on the Act and its implications?

Martin

Bob:  

Thanks for the update.  No need to call back but here are my comments:

Allied Waste North America - please follow up on your own as the paralegals 
don't have the resources right now for handling all of Sam's load

FirstEnergy Services Corp - please have your assistant redline changes since 
this is also one of Sam's items

City of Palo Alto and Macquarie Inc. (or "Bank Ltd") -  neither of these are 
on anyone's radar screen so please proceed as you wish

leaving Enron

Allied Waste North America -- Samantha has this marked "sent for execution" 
as of 2/13; can I get one of the other specialists to follow up on this?

FirstEnergy Services Corp -- Very close to finishing this (I hope); I owe 
them another redline that should reflect agreement on all issues

Select Energy -- this has recently been revived after a long dormancy.  Ed 
Sacks is revisiting credit issues.  Meanwhile, I am plodding through minutiae 
with their very detail-minded attorney

City of Palo Alto -- recently received an e-mail from their assistant city 
attorney stating that they are internally discussing what needs to be done to 
their city code to allow for derivatives trading; he also said they will not 
be ready to discuss this w/ me for a couple of weeks

Macquarie Bank Ltd. -- this is an ag ISDA (although there is no specific 
trade for it at this time).  I am waiting for our meeting to discuss 
ag-related changes to our ISDA forms.  Once that is settled, I will send them 
an updated draft

Proctor & Gamble -- I sent Libby Rutherford a letter in December, outlining 
the issues to be discussed.  I think I also put in a few phone calls to her 
at that time.  I never heard from her.  I haven't heard any pressure for 
movement from the pulp & paper desk since I met w/ Ed Quinn and some other 
people in January (although I did happen to get a call yesterday from an EES 
person working on a deal with them; he was just curious as to what we were 
doing w/ them and the status of things; I put him in touch w/ Ed)

still happy to meet w/ you on these if you wish -- Bob

some questions/issues re: the assignment agreement.  (My questions are not 
holding us up since Anna is proceeding to try to get a final draft as we know

1. Is ENA assigning to Enron Credit Inc. any agreements other than the 
Securities Loan Agreement?  If so, let me know.  If not, then would we need 
an assignment agreement as opposed to just having Enron Credit Inc. sign a 
Securities Loan Agreement?

Susan-

Please fax or e-mail the first revised draft of the ISDA to Rodolfo.  I 
believe that TGS is ready to execute this document except for a pending 
question that they have concerning speculation.  I am not sure what the issue 
is exactly for TGS in regards to speculation (see e-mails below), but I am 
calling Rodolfo for clarification.

Also, do you know who could forward a sample copy of a confirmation to 
Rodolfo as well??

Thank you,

Pat

Pat, 

Question: If you hedge something and then you do not produce (you do not back 
up your production with your swap), so basically you are speculating, how 
does that affect your financials??
TGS's lawyer will be back next Monday. I know you and Susan have worked on a 
new ISDA (w/o the CSA). Could you forward that to me so I send it to TGS and 
on Monday they have all the documents ready please?
TGS asked me if we could send them a model of a "confirmation ticket" to see 
how it looks like. Also, I would like to see it as well, cause I never seen 
one. I guess that you will put price, index, settlements and volumes.

Thanks,

Rolo
I talked to Eduardo Pawluszek (TGS) this morning. So that everybody knows, 
last week we quoted propane, butane and gasoline. Citibank and Goldman Sachs 
have also quoted, but Enron came up with the best price. Eduardo told me he 
is ready to go, but he is still trying to waiting for Marketing to define 
volumes.
What the auditors are saying is that if TGS hedges 2,500 tons during one 
month and they end up selling 0 tons, the hedge is now pure speculation. This 
is the main problem Eduardo is having.   We need to communicate that the risk 
on price over the next 14 months is far more that the risk of a slight 
shortfall in delivery over the same time period.  Which is the greater 
speculation??
On the ISDA, his lawyer will be arriving on Monday and we will keep on 
working on the document next week. 
Eduardo told me he is totally on board with this hedge  but he is trying to 
convince Marketing to go for it (and it is giving him a hard time).

We are plannig to pre-pay this swap which, considering current financial 
circumstances, would benefit TGS greatly.

Do we need to go higher up in the organization??  

Thanks,

Jeff and Rolo

We are in agreement with your proposed changes to the arbitration language.

I await your reply concerning the rest of the comments to the client 
agreement.

Sara,
Thank you for your fax.
Section 180.3 of the CEA prohibits us from agreeing to any settlement
procedure/forum ahead of time.  JPMFI, in accordance with 180.3, will offer
3
forums - which will include AAA.  If Enron chooses AAA, the arbitration
will be
subject to the provisions specified in your fax dd 2/26/2001.

Attached is JPM's proposed language for the arbitration agreement.

(See attached file: ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.doc)

If you are in agreement with the language, please forward Enron's proposed
language (detailed in your 2/26 fax) electronically (if available).

Thank you and Regards,
Corinne

Per your voice mail, I have not yet received any credit from Tracy and,

send a "sample governmental master agreement" which would not be tailored

Sara -

I would like to discuss with you a potential opportunity at WAPA Sierra 
Nevada.  We have just sent them an EEI and would like you to send them an 
ISDA.  Basically in the near future they might find themselves quite short 
due to a PG&E contract being invalidated.  If that happens they will either:

1. Buy physical power from the market (use our EEI)
2.Do a financial swap with the market and continue to do the physical index 
with PG&E (there are some reasons for this which I am not 100% sure on).

The lawyer we have dealt with is Koji Kawamura and his email address is:

kawamura@wapa.gov

Thanks for your help - If you have any questions please let me know.

Stewart Rosman

All:

Attached are the two (2) final version GTC's.  The legal terminology is 
identical for each product.  However, Stuart needs to provide a title for 
each product which will also appear in the Paragraph 1.

The former Paragraph 2 has been deleted (it contained the "confirmation 
terms") and the remaining paragraphs renumbered.

Justin:  Will you circulate the revised long description (since your 
conversation with Stuart yesterday afternoon)?  Also, will you let us all 
know when we are competely done?

Please call with comments as soon as possible.

Subsequent to our swap group meeting with Clement last week, I have discussed 
the issue further with Jeff Hodge, Peter Keohane, Russell Diamond and Clem.  
In addition to ENA, ECC is feeling the pressure of delays for obtaining 
corporate guaranties caused by increased guaranty requests, too few signers 
and insufficient legal staffing to handle the volume.

Although Clem will have assistance soon, we concluded that it would be 
prudent to begin negotiation of a guaranty immediately rather than wait for 
the conclusion of the master agreement (or confirmation) negotiations.  
Please try to incorporate this approach, particularly with Canadian 
counterparties. 

Credit will continue to push our internal form of Enron Corp. guaranty.

pat, sorry, but we did go forward with this very small deal before taking all 
the normal credit provisions.  The deal is not signed yet, and is still 
"technically" awaiting management approval.  Please work with Remi Collogne 
and or Gustavo to get information on this company.  let me know how I can 
help.  thanks 

Christine:

Let me know if you have heard about a 10 year deal that Brazil did.  Gustavo 
advised that they are going to buy 1.7MW (24x7)at 40.00Real from a sugar mill 
beginning in May 2000.  The purchase price is suppose to be inflation 
adjusted starting 2001.  ECE will be selling this power to Elektro at a 
biomass pricing that is government controlled and adjusted annually.  The 
price to Elektro is approximately 80.00Real.   

I believe that this deal may have been already executed, but have not 
received a response from Brazil yet.  I have not had a chance to review the 
sugar mill's profile and make any type of credit assessment.

Let me know if you have heard from Brazil on this and whether we have a 10 
year power curve from them.

Regards,

Pat

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Please find the final draft of the GTC:

Jorge:  I may send you some emails throughout the day to help clarify some 
things for me.

 Where are your definitions of "Calculation Period" and "IPA Modified 
Calculation Period"? 

In your definition of "IPA Floating Rate Payment", you use the term "Share 
Spread" which is not defined.  What do you mean?  There is a dangling 
definition of "Share Spread" at the end of the IPA Compensation section, but 
it refers to spreads appearing in either Annex I or Annex II.

In the "IPA Compensation" section, how is "a negative IPA elected"?  Who is 
making an election?

Let's discuss tomorrow.

George:

1.  You didn't answer my question about "Calculation Period" and "IPA 
Modified Calculation Period".

2.  Are you saying that EEL "elects" to increase/decrease the Basket 
Component Shares?
Are you saying that the "IPA Number of Shares" is negative or the IPA is 
negative?
Is the IPA negative when the Initial Price exceeds the Relevant Price?

Sara Shackleton
	Jorge A Garcia@ENRON
	04/03/2001 08:37 AM
		
Good Morning Sara,

"Share Spread" is not applicable and should be deleted. 

A negative IPA is subject to a specific swap traded. It would have to be a 
case where the Stock is already part of the Basket and they elect to unwind 
the swap and reduce the number of shares from the basket. For example, if 
10,000 shares of XYZ Company were part of the original basket, they can trade 
off 5,000 shares of the swap effectively creating a negative IPA. The trade 
is mutually agreed upon. 

Looking forward to meeting with you!

Jorge

someone in your group to negociate it directly with the customer prior to 
sending it up to Clement for sign off, or would you prefer that I go to Cindy 
Richardson and Clement Abrams directly.  Please advise,

WEndy

Wendy, I appreciate you knocking out the CWS so quickly.... Thanks !!  John

Sara, do you prefer to e-mail or mail a hard-copy to Boeing ?  Let me know 
and I'll supply you with the accompanying address. 

John  

Sounds like Keegan has somethig wrong.  I have no meetings scheduled with you 
tomorrow.  I don't know anything about a 9 am meeting.  The brokerage 
meetings were originally scheduled every other week until we could bring 
ourselves up to date (and we met last week).  The swap group meeting is 
always held twice monthly.  Hope this helps.

Hi Sara, 

I need to reschedule on of the three brokerage account meetings that are on 
my calendar for tomorrow.  

My calendar indicates that I have a 9 a.m. one hour meeting with you, a 10 
a.m. one hour swaps meeting, a 1:30 brokerage account meeting a 2:30 one hour 
credit support meeting and a 4 p.m. meeting with someone from yet another 
Enron entity seeking to open a brokerage account on an urgent basis.

Keegan and I have now developed a strategy to ensure that we do not have so 
many meetings on one day.  Most of the other meetings are group meetings and 
therefore are not possible to reschedule.

Cheryl:

I think it would be helpful for the desk and legal to retain monthly meetings 
just to stay abreast of activity and expectations.  Why don't we keep the end 
of month meetings?  I'll resend the schedule to you.

All:

Effective March 19, 2001,  AESC and ENA entered into a "Side Letter 
Agreement" which is an ISDA Master Agreement from a legal perspective.  ENA 
and AESC have agreed this morning to negotiate and execute a new ISDA Master 
Agreement by April 13, 2001.  Until that date, however, we can confirm 
financial trades between ENA and AESC under the Side Letter Agreement.  
Attached below is a markup of an ISDA form of confirmation which contains 
language for these confirmations (the draft was prepared for Kim Hundl 
handling financial power).

Please let me know if you have any questions.

executed.  We spoke with Allegheny this morning and they promise to execute 
next week.

Here's the generated confirmations for you to insert your
language:

Cheryl:

Just a bit of history:  I think that the partial listing of officers on the 
(authorized traders) list is only meant to be illustrative of corporate 
officers and directors.  The ENA unanimous consent for the relevant company 
is the authority for document execution.  If, for example, a VP is authorized 
to execute for a particular company (by virtue of a corporate resolution or 
unanimous consent) and that particular VP's name does not appear in the 
partial listing, exection is not invalidated.  The execution is valid.

Have you had a broker question ENA's authority?

Hey Stephanie, we need to revise this list because it does not make sense at 
least with respect to ENA.  It does not list key people (e.g. Gary) and it is 
inconsistent with the resolutions.  For example, the resolutions say that a 
managing director and treasurer can be a designated person to open an account 
but ENA does not have such an officer.  There are MD's and then there is a VP 
and Treasurer.  There are I think other inconsistencies we need to clear up 
to avoid having the accounts invalidated.  Having these points clear is 
especially important where, like now, we won't have Gary or Mark Frevert sign 
because they are out of town and we need to open the account right away.  

I know you are swamped so I will work tonight on revising the List for ENA 
tonight and give the revisions to do first thing in the morning.

Can you revise the List for ECT today (or just doublecheck it) so that we do 
not have a hold up in executing the Goldman International account for ECT 
first thing in the morning.  I promised Sheila Glover we would execute it 
right away.

Did we open any ENA accounts in the past two weeks and if so, just to be 
clear, can we send them a list that includes Gary's name and title if he 
signed.

Hi, Michael - hope all is well.

Just curious if London might be interested in a George Washington University 
MBA (International Business) looking for work in London or Europe.  She is a 
family friend.  She is bilingual (Swedish and English) and fluent in French 
and German.  She also has work experience.  I am going to send her resume to 
HR in Houston and suggest her for the analyst/associate program.  However, I 
wasn't certain as to whether the London/European offices worked through a 
different processs.  Please let me know if you think there may be some 
interest.

Hello Sara, 

Keegan told me that you had asked her today to send to you an updated 
Brokerage Agreement Status Report.   We (the legal eagles) and the business 
folks agreed at the last meeting on 3/28 that I would distribute the report 
every two weeks - every other Thursday.  This works best for me and Keegan.  
Under that schedule, Keegan and I have planned that the report would be ready 
for group-wide distribution this Thursday.

Ed:

Further to my voice mail of earlier today, the CI guaranty appears to be 
limited in duration but there is not a specific term.  How long must the 
guaranty remain effective?

Sara Shackleton

Mara:

Attached are blacklined versions based upon Cargill's comments to both the 
Enron Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated which I received from Ed Sacks.  Please 
note that I added a comma to guarantor's name in the Cargill, Incorporated 
guaranty since that is how we executed the Cargill, Incorporated ISDA Master 
Agreement.

Also, your change to the setoff language is fine.

Let's try to agree to everything this week.  Thanks.

Sara Shackleton

Ed:  For the Additional Event of Default (ratings trigger), do you intend the 
MAC to apply when only one or both credit ratings disappear?

Sara Shackleton

Tanya:  Do we need to differentiate between the MAC as used in the CSA and in 
the Schedule (as an "Additional Event of Default") with respect to the 
disappearance of a credit rating from either S&P or Moody's (or both) based 
on your usage in power masters?  

I believe that we agreed that for purposes of the CSA (when S&P and Moody's 
are indicated on the credit worksheet), both ratings must disappear to 
trigger the MAC.

For purposes of an Additional Event of Default, should we just pose the 
question to credit?

Sara Shackleton
	Edward Sacks/ENRON@enronXgate
	04/09/2001 05:31 PM
		 
It should say either; therefore, if one were to disappear, an Event of 
Default would occur.  This was the intent and is probably consistent with 
that in the Master Power agmt.

Ed:  For the Additional Event of Default (ratings trigger), do you intend the 
MAC to apply when only one or both credit ratings disappear?

Susan B. should have gotten our draft of the referenced guaranty to you.  It 
still needs to be reviewed by the physical gas group since we are amending 
their guaranty.  Do you care about any allocation of payments between HPL and 
ENA?  At the moment, I do not have any allocation language in the guaranty.

Mark:

When you have a few minutes, I'm glad to discuss continuing "training" and 
balancing workloads.
Mary has no one to unload Canada and structured transactions (Global Finance) 
since Carol does not have time for either.  Angela has no time for equity 
deals.  I think we need a backup for each.  Perhaps Anne Koehler fits the 
bill.  Or Cheryl.  Each of Anne and Cheryl need ISDA experience.
I don't know Francisco's longer term schedule and maybe you need to speak 
with him and/or Mark Haedicke about his contined international workload.  
This could turn into a "Yao long term project."

The referenced agreement was sent  to you for execution on December 7, 2000.  
We have never received an executed original of the agreement or the guaranty 
from Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.  We have called on several occasions to 
locate these instruments.

Please let us know if there is a problem.  

Sara Shackleton

Yes, "eligible contract participant"  ("ECP") is an issue.  Both ENA and 
ECTRI are Delaware corporations and are therefore subject to the jurisdiction 
of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the U.S. regulatory agency with 
oversight for derivatives).  As a practical matter, I understand that ECTRI 
does have many executed ISDA agreements.  I do not know the volume of 
"omnibus" trades.  However, the ECTRI omnibus should have ECP representations 
in the annex.

A financial trade v24545 was done with Total International Limited.  This 
entity is subsidiary of a very good credit customer, TotalElf (S&P rated 
AA-).  Risk is acceptable, small volumes, short tenor, but from a legal 
standpoint, I do not think this entity is an "Eligible Contract Party" as we 
have no guaranty support or financial statements to support trading.  I 
noticed that quite a bit of financial trades are currently booked in London

EWEB's Board Resolution of December 5, 2000 permits financial hedging in 
general and authorizes:

"The General Manager or other authorized officers as noted in the Power Risk 
Management Guidelines to execute confirmations of transactions within the 
limits specified in the Power Risk Management Guidelines."

Each time ENA trades with EWEB, the trader must verify whether the EWEB 
trader is authorized under the then current version of the Power Risk 
Management Guidelines.  Each date you execute a trade:  (1)  you will need a  
list of authorized traders (authorized to enter into derivative transactions) 
certified by EWEB's secretary to be correct as of the Trade Date and (2) a 
statement certified by EWEB's secretary that the Transaction falls within the 
limits specified in the most current version of the Power Risk Management 
Guidelines, effective as of the Trade Date.

We have only a portion of the Power Risk Management Guidelines and it is 
dated April 19, 1999.  Our version is incomplete and probably outdated.  
Maybe EWEB will provide you with the current version.

It would be a lot easier if EWEB's resolution simply authorized it to enter 
into financial trades documented under the ISDA (which is what most 
resolutions permit).  However, EWEB did not obtain a broad resolution.

To Melissa, Sharen and Kim:  We should also verify that our confirmations 
contain these representations.  Please talk to me.

ECT and Sonoco entered into a one- year "plastics" swap which terminated on 
March 31, 1999.  Doug Friedman (plastics trader) has asked that ECT formally 
demand $60,000 from Sonoco for underpayment on the swap.  Sonoco has claimed 
the existence of a Market Disruption resulting from price reformation in the 
plastics publication "Monthly Petrochemical & Pleastics Analysis" which 
caused it to use a differenct Floating Price calculation.  ECT disagrees as 
to the existence of such an event.  Doug will contact me this week to review 
our approach.  Please give me a call.  Thanks.  Sara 

 

Karola Pearce (inhouse lawyer) just returned my call.  PG&E has created a NEW 
document (that is, we should ignore everything previously negotiated) and 
will FEDEX to us this week.  I hope we can negotiate the new document 
quickly.  Let me know if you have any questions. Sara 

If the guaranty is capped at $15million and payment demands are  made by HPL 
and ENA that exceed the cap, full payment cannot be made.  Should the 
payments be allocated proportionately or according to receipt of demand, or 
do we care?  I hope this helps.  SS 

I'm not sure what this means.

Sara Shackleton
11/05/99 03:37 PM
Susan B. should have gotten our draft of the referenced guaranty to you.  It 
still needs to be reviewed by the physical gas group since we are amending 
their guaranty.  Do you care about any allocation of payments between HPL and 
ENA?  At the moment, I do not have any allocation language in the guaranty.  
SS

I don't understand your message.  Parties must be "eligible" at the time each 
Transaction is entered into.

From a credit standpoint, potential risk of this 25,000 bbls/mo, May'01, 
financial swap is very small.  But I recognize ECP issues since no support 
and no information has ever been available.  Can we include a representation 
that, upon execution, would establish eligibility.  I will manage credit 
under volume/tenor limits and implied support of a AA parent.  If acceptable, 
please send language to Confirmations for use in this (v24545) and all future 
trades.

thanks

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside 
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side 
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly 
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some of 
my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

Sara: The only list that we have that is permanent is the Origination list. 
You would receive e-mails about all the deals and prospective deals 
originated by the group, including trading. Would you like to be added to 
this one? The other option would be adding you to specific trading deal lists 
that usually include only those directly involved with that specific deal 
(and is never very consistent. To be quite honest, not all the Origination 
deals are circulated through the Origination list). As far as I know, other 
than Moema - the 10-year PPA, there's nothing going on at the moment. No Term 
Sheets signed or anything. I spoke to Brent today about the Moema deal. There 
are some issues that I still have to clarify with the business people such as 
to who we are going to sell the power, contingencies, etc. I could not get a

send you guys an update.

Since NUI Utilites, Inc. is the rated entity, we are no longer requiring the 
$50MM NUI Corp gty for this transaction.  However, the financial swap (which 
should be 40,000/day total for May-Oct) is being documented under  the NUI 
Energy Brokers, Inc. existing ISDA.  Sara has modified to cross default the 
confirmation to the Credit Agreement.  Stacy, please share the language you 
are using for the Transaciton Agreement to compensate for the Credit 
Agreement expiry in December with Sara so the financial confirmation can be 
modified as well.  We also need to modify the financial confirmation to state 
that for this transaction only, NUI must be the Guarantor not NUI Capital.  
Then we must get a deal specific gty from NUI Utilites to cover this trade - 
probably $10MM.  This all arises because the finc/phys gty we were working on 
is out the window since NUI Utilities is the rated entity with associated 
balance sheet and the NUI Corp is not needed.  Please advise asap and call 
with any questions.

Thanks,

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Please prepare a new ISDA.  I'm waiting for instructions from the 
counterparty as to distribution.

Corporate Treasury has begun implementing a revised guarantee format
(and I am told they are absolutely inflexible about the new language).
We're trying to ascertain whether guarantees are also changing for
Cargill-Alliant, which is a joint venture rather than a subsidiary.
I will advise as soon as I know something definitive in this regard.

Unfortunately, it looks as though this Agreement will need to remain
in the "pending" stack for a little while longer.

Attached are blacklined versions based upon Cargill's comments to both
the
Enron Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated which I received from Ed Sacks.
Please note that I added a comma to guarantor's name in the Cargill,
Incorporated guaranty since that is how we executed the Cargill,
Incorporated ISDA Master Agreement.

Also, your change to the setoff language is fine.

Let's try to agree to everything this week.  Thanks.

Looks like the guarantor will have to change to:  NUI Corp. (and replace NUI 
Utilities, Inc.)  This will require changes to the "Additional Provisions" 
section, part (b) and the Exhibit A.  We will target Monday morning to 
finalize.  Thanks.

Mark,

Attached please see the confirmations, with
a change to the Addtional Provisions (b) section
referencing both deals - which should answer
your concerns, as per Sara.  

Please let me know if these are OK to sign
and send.  If you are unable to OK these by
12:45 today (I'm leaving for the weekend), 
please respond to Joe Hunter and he will 
sign and send them.  

 

Thanks,

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same 
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty 
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion 
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit 
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at least 
BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside

Sara, I wanted to let u knwo that under the FERC rules, we have to file the 
Enron side letter for the physical master agreement in the same manner that 
we filed the original agt between Enron and Allegheny.  Our PA office is 
handling that and, if I am not mistaken, has taken of that yesterday.  I do 
not think that EPMI is requried to file with the FERC because u are a power

Ellen:

I've reviewed WestLB's optional early termination language which is similar 
to the other's which I've reviewed (e.g., Goldman, Chase, Merrill, etc.).  
Here's how it works for your 3/26/01 - 3/26/21 swap:

(1)  March 28, 2011 is the "Break Date" or "Early Termination Date".  

(2)  Either party can give notice of early termination to the other party on 
the day that is 5 NY Business Days prior to the Break Date.  By the way, this 
is also the day on which the parties must mutually agree on 5 leading dealers 
in the relevant market in case the valuation process in (3) below is later 
disputed by the other party.

(3)  The party giving notice determines (in good faith) the Cash Settlement 
Amount as of 11 a.m. NY time on the Break Date (which should be the 
mid-market value of the deal on the Break Date.

(4)  Payment will occur on the Break Date.

(5)  I am adding a provision requiring the exercising party to notify the 
other party on the day that is 3 NY Business Days prior to the Break Date.  
There may be a dispute over the calculation and the parties will need to 
resolve.

(6)  If the parties cannot agree on the Cash Settlement Amount calculation, 
then the party who gave notice seeks mid-market quotes from the 5 leading 
dealers (previously agreed to) at 11 a.m. on the day that is 2 NY Business 
Days before the Break Date.  The confirm describes how the quotes are 
averaged.  A minimum of 3 quotes is essential.  Payment is still made on the 
Break Date.

George:

(1)  Please verify that the Break Date is 3/28/11.  My copy is a little fuzzy 
and the date could actually be 3/26/11.

(2)  I've marked the confirm and faxed it to you.  Please note that:

 (a)  the second paragraph purports to incorporate the 1991 ISDA Definitions 
but the master overrides this language because it incorporates the 1991 
Definitions "as amended, modified, superceded or replaced from time to time" 
(i.e., the 2000 ISDA Definitions).  There is a problem if  WestLB disagrees 
because I've left some language in Paragraph 3 "as is" since it is based upon 
the 2000 ISDA Definitions. 

 (b)  no need to say that the Calculation Agent is "as otherwise stated in 
the Agreement" because WestLB is stated to be the Calculation Agent in the 
Agreement.

Tanya:

After the last meeting, I promised to ask you about the following:

(1)  Nova Scotia Power Inc. - this shows up as "credit review".  Should this 
remain on the list and if so, is there anything that legal needs to do?

(2)  Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. - this is the new "Forest Oil" of the 
list so I say let's forget it.  No, seriously, Carol did revisit the latest 
draft and said it was pared down about as far as it could go.  Further, she 
cannot get anyone at Occidental to return phone calls.

Please let me know what you would like to do.

Sara Shackleton

All:

(1)  Joe and I have reviewed the Termination Agreement for Mercado and it 
looks fine.

(2)  I suggest that the following language be added to the bottom of a 
revised invoice (revised because the comment section which indicates the 
NF1164.Y is an annuity completed on 04/11/01 is inaccurate):

Mercado Gas Services, Inc. acknowledges that payment for Deal No. NF1164.Y is 
made in partial consideration of that certain Assignment and Assumption 
Agreement dated as of April 5, 2001 by and among Mercado Gas Services, Inc., 
MERCADO GAS SERVICES, INC.

By:  _________________________
Name:  ______________________
Title:  ________________________

(3)  Joe and I have the following questions:

 (a)  If the assignment to Williams was effective 4/5/01, why are we looking 
at figures from 4/9/01 and 4/11/01, respectively?

 (b)  In lieu of (a) above, have ENA and Mercado already agreed to the 
numbers appearing on the invoice?

Sara Shackleton

Tracy, how is this:

Regarding the "Transfer" language for Allegheny (Party B), we have the 
following proposal:

"Party B may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in 
whole but not in part, to any Affiliate provided that (1) such transfer will 
not give rise to a Termination Event or an Event of Default, and (2) (i) the 
creditworthiness of the Affiliate is not materially weaker than that of Party 
B immediately prior to such transfer, unless Party B provides a satisfactory 
guaranty or credit support to the Affiliate, or (ii) the proposed Affiliate 
satisfies the criteria that Party A applies in deciding whether to offer or 
make an extension of credit or to enter into transactions similar to the 
Transactions subject to the proposed transfer."

following week.

Tom:

I am not certain that the existing resolution permits repurchase and reverse 
repurchase transactions and securities lending, bonds borrow pledge, etc. as 
the brokerage consent was not written to accommodate these types of 
transactions.  However, if the repo party will accept our existing format, 
then we need not worry.  I'll call Ted Leh and try to find the proper Goldman 
person.

Sara,

Can you please provide your findings on the following items:

1. Determine with Cheryl that ECI is in fact authorized to transact Repos

2. How robust the Goldman Repo agreements are, and their sutability to ECI.

3. An estimate on how long it will take to set up the Goldman Repo Agreements 
in ECI's name.

Can you please also provide any ideas how ECI or ECL could transact a Repo 
trade today using existing documentation.

London has indicated an urgent need to carry out these transactions.

Thanks,

Tom

(London, perhaps?) and from legal, you, Brent and me.

Also, we need to refine the offsite now that we have a date set.  I will be 
on vacation during the week of May 7 - 11.  Were you able to put a list

Number 3 concerns the swap piece of this deal.

Stacy

	04/16/2001 09:44 AM
		 
 I though it might be helpful to review where we stand on the various
agreements:

 1. Enfolio Agreement between NUI Utilities and ENA - The version
(including all Exhibits) that Stacy sent on April 11 (5:23 p.m.) is the
final and is acceptable.  I have asked Terri Sue to forward NUI's Notice
Information (Exhibit A) to Stacy.  Stacy, upon receipt, can you please
generate the final agreement?
 2. Physical Transaction Agreement - I need to review Section 4 with
Bob Lurie who will be back in the office tomorrow.
 3. April Transaction Confirmation Letter - Stacy, this letter should
be addressed to Thomas E. Smith, Director, Energy Planning (who signed the
Confirmation).  Also, please confirm that the Exhibits are NUI Confirmation
Nos. 31060 and 46669.
 3. Swap Transaction Agreements - I am attaching a revised version of
the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for Swap V09140.4 from Enron's review.
As Mark and I discussed, NUI Corporation, not NUI Utilities, will be the
Guarantor. In addition, I have modified the form of Guaranty to make it
clear that it only applies to these two Swaps; this is similar to what Enron
had agreed to when we were contemplating an NUI Corp. Guaranty for the
Enfolio Agreement.  I have made this change to the Guaranty because I am not
satisfied that the discussion within the Confirmation that purports to limit
the scope of the Guaranty is sufficient.  I think the limitations need to be
set forth within the four corners of the Guaranty itself.   If acceptable,
the same changes should be made to the Transaction Agreement and Exhibit for
Swap V09140.5.

(1)  see Tanya's note re:  Occidental

(2)  I think I negotiated either a confirm or Schedule with a Trust (I'll try 
to find).  Of course, there are lots of structured deals with Trusts.

(3)  I don't have strong feelings about the offsite - but I'd vote for the 
a.m. rather than change the legal credit seminar to accommodate the offsite.

Nova Scotia Power  - this was pending a credit wkst from me.  Weather desk 
was pursuing - I have not heard anything out of them regarding this customer 
and have not seen any trades other than the one.  Brent may have heard 
more...If not, I am game with removing until the commercial team resurrects.

Occidental - I agree it has not moved forward.  We can take off the list, but 
I will ask Brant/Jay to pursue on our end.

Tanya:

After the last meeting, I promised to ask you about the following:

(1)  Nova Scotia Power Inc. - this shows up as "credit review".  Should this 
remain on the list and if so, is there anything that legal needs to do?

(2)  Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. - this is the new "Forest Oil" of the 
list so I say let's forget it.  No, seriously, Carol did revisit the latest 
draft and said it was pared down about as far as it could go.  Further, she 
cannot get anyone at Occidental to return phone calls.

Please let me know what you would like to do.

Whenever you decide whether the UCD for ECI is sufficient or not please let 
me know urgently.  Management in London has some aggressive expectations for 
a deliverable on repos.  We will have to push back on them if the UCD has to 
be redrafted.

I would very much like to give management a clear status and a realistic 
time-frame for when we can expect to have the repo capacity in place.

I do recognize the time frame is highly dependent on what the current 
situation actually is.  Therefore I am hopeful we can answer the below 
questions sooner than later.

If I can provide any help in anyway please let me know.

I am assuming that you are saying that if repos go through the Prime Broker

Is our UCD adequate as is for repos?

What is our existing format that you mention below?

Are you able to pursue this with Goldman right now today?

What are our choices to do with trade v34062, a trade not yet confirmed with

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at
least BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side

on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

I apologize, I have been out sick until this afternoon and have not gotten to 
it.  I think, if memory serves me correctly, I think I was generally ok with 
the language except for the proviso at the end because we do not know what

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at
least BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

Dear Sara,

Thanks for your agreement to the Set-Off language.  Do you have some
insights I can pass on to our attorney, who was wondering about the
reason behind the language in Part 5(B), the second Set-Off paragraph?

I had forwarded your comments to our Credit Manager, Andrzej
Kabarowski,
who works with our Corporate Treasury on the Cargill guarantees, but
have yet to receive a response.  I have, however, learned that our
Corporate Treasury has begun implementing a revised guarantee format
(and I am told they are absolutely inflexible about the new language).
We're trying to ascertain whether guarantees are also changing for
Cargill-Alliant, which is a joint venture rather than a subsidiary.
I will advise as soon as I know something definitive in this regard.

Unfortunately, it looks as though this Agreement will need to remain
in the "pending" stack for a little while longer.

Mara:

Attached are blacklined versions based upon Cargill's comments to both
the
Enron Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated which I received from Ed Sacks.
Please note that I added a comma to guarantor's name in the Cargill,
Incorporated guaranty since that is how we executed the Cargill,
Incorporated ISDA Master Agreement.

Also, your change to the setoff language is fine.

Let's try to agree to everything this week.  Thanks.

(See attached file: ENEguarantyCargillR1.doc)(See attached file:

Sara Shackleton

Thanks.  We amended the guaranty yesterday to do just that.  We are trying to 
have the guaranty executed.

Stephanie:  We will ultimately need to attach the "Clement approved" form of 
guaranty to the Confirmation.  Also, we may as well note the new guaranty in 
the amendment to the first transaction.

Looks good to me.  We will need to amend our outgoing gty by increasing the 
amount from $10MM to $20MM and also expand gty coverage to cover all agmts 
which are financially settled w/ ENA.

Ed Sacks

Ed,

Please review the attached revised confirm for Con Ed.  The revision is to 
the Exposure Threshold/Credit Ratings on page 1 of Annex B-1.  As ENA does 
not have a credit rating above BBB+, we have inserted $20 mil. (the BBB+ 
threshold) for those ratings above BBB+.

Please contact either Sara or myself.

Thanks,
Stephanie

I apologize for waiting two months to pick a date in order to consume
some of Sara's excess wine, but I think I found a good place to meet.
There is a restaurant named La Vista at 1936 Fountain View, just North
of the Rice Epicurean. It should be real close to Donna, and they let
you bring your own bottle(s) of wine. If Sara brings the wine, then I
could spring for the dinner and Donna could bring the flowers.

I am tied up next Thursday and Friday, and I know that Sara has the
Enron Law Conference in San Antonio the following Wednesday, Thursday
and Friday. Hopefully, there is a window in there when we can all get
together.

We are trying to do a deal with Valentis Investors LLC (we have an LLC 
agreement for this entity) and CD Holdings (I do not have the LLC agreement 
for them- do you need?).  Valentis is part of Wexford V- a fund owned by 
Wexford Capital.   Paul Radous has all these linkage documents- he originally 
sent them up to Carol.

Valentis and CD Holdings jointly own some oil and gas properties. They would 
like to transact a hedge of these properties- they would like to sell natural 
gas forward for 8 years.

The total notional on the deal is about 34M.. I have discussed this with Paul 
Radous.. he has suggested that we do this deal as a stand alone for the 
Valentis and CD Holding entities.. he is requesting initial margin of 
2million with a cap of 5 million.

They wanted to do this deal today (actually for the last week)... but we need 
to know if there are any legal objections... we will need a deemed ISDA like 
AIG.

Please give Paul and I a call when you have a minute.

Thanks,

Carol:

Regarding a "hedge fund meeting" next week, I have spoken with most of the 
likely participants and everyone is eager to meet next week.  I'll fill you 
in on details in person.  I think the following people should attend:

Fred Lagrasta
Caroline Abramo
Robyn Zivic
Russell Dyk
you 
Brent
me

I believe that we have a mushrooming "process" issue.  I also believe that 
the credit group is part of the problem (we should have a separate discussion 
with Paul to discuss potential hedge fund credit issues - maybe there are 
none and maybe our legal choices are unimportant to credit).  My observations 
are that all hedge funds need not be "last minute" deals, Caroline can be our 
ally and needs to learn our documents and credit needs to advise legal 
sooner.  I have asked Caroline to prepare a list of all funds she is 
currently working with, has already discussed with Paul or is considering.

Afternoon is best.  Shall I schedule or have you already begun?

ENA sent a Notice of Termination letter to Southern on November 1, 1999 and 
set that date as the Early Termination Date.  There is only one existing 
Transaction:  a second quarter 2000 collar.   We have obtained a third party

total notional and days, is equivalent to $25,334.40.  Please let me know if 
you have any comments to the letter.

It was great speaking with you last night!  Hope your dad is home and doing

I have contacted two different offices within Enron.  The first is Human

for the associate/analyst program but they may think of other positions as 
well.  I don't know how quickly that office might respond so let me know.  
The second "office" is directly to London.  There is a woman in London named 
Anna Jansson who is currently leading efforts for the associate/analyst 
program in the Eastern Hemisphere.  I have spoken with Anna and she has asked 
that you visit the website "www.enroncareers.com" and apply through the 
site.  She already knows your name and I am trying to fax your resume 
(business resume) to her as well.  When you visit the site, you may decide to 
use a different resume; just let me know.  Just in case you would like to 
call directly, Anna's number in London (dialed from the U.S.) is 
011-44-20-7783-5912.  The company directory shows her email address as 
"anna_jansson@enron.net" (which looks a little weird to me).

Please keep in touch and let me know if you receive responses (or don't hear 
back) so that I can follow up internally.  By the way, you have an impressive 
resume.

Please feel free to call me at anytime.  I hope we get to meet soon.

I look forward to meeting with you both on Tuesday.  Here's a list of the 
funds we have in the pipeline and the status:

MACRO FUNDS-

(Bermuda)- dealing regularly.. 

3. Catequil (Negotiating) docs with Offshore and Onshore- waiting for 
response from Brent and Paul on their latest comments to the ISDA.  Confirms 
from all the deals we have done have been returned to Carol.  They are set up 
in the system; we hold margin.

4. AIG (Negotiating)- Offshore, Onshore- need to get documents out to them- 
credit work sheet in legal.. still have not gotten out a confirm to them on 
the trades they have done....we have them set up in the system and hold 
margin.

5. Union Spring (Negotiating)- Offshore, Onshore- should be done on this one.

6. SAC Capital - possibly only one vehicle in Anguila- need to get the 
document to them- credit work sheet in legal.

7. Quark Power (Negotiating)- 2 entities- Quark Power and Amaranth.  Held by 
Paloma Partners- waiting for their comments on a few points.

8. Valentis and CD Holdings- Held by Wexford Capital - need to get document

deal Monday.  

9. Global Advisors- trade through Cargill.. Frank Sayre working on POA.. 
waiting for this back.

10. Argonaut- onshore, offshore vehicles- sending documents.. no credit 
assessment yet.

11. SOROS- brought through system by credit derivative group.. but need a 
credit opinion for ENA (to do energy trades).

PROGRAM FUNDS- 
12. Renaissance - credit worksheet in legal- need to get docs to them.
13. Campbell+ Co - will likely want to look at a three way transaction 
between Enron, themselves, and a bank
14. Sunrise Capital - getting documentation.

We will keep the 10 am meeting on Tuesday, April 24, EB 38C2 (legal and 
credit only).
We will also schedule a meeting at 3 pm (same day after legal/credit regular 
meeting) with Fred, Caroline, Russell Dyk and Robyn Zivic.  Fred could not 
meet in the morning and he is an integral part of the process we are trying 
to develop for hedge funds.  I apologize if all of the lawyers cannot meet at 
3 pm but at least one lawyer in attendance should keep us on track.

Just spoke with Mark Russell.  SRP will be in Houston next week on Wednesday 
and Thursday and would like to meet to discuss the ISDA with legal and 
credit.  I told Mark that I was available Wed. and Thurs. morning.  Are you

previously sent them our attachments (in 1999).  Mark Russell of SRP will be 
contacting you to negotiate this agreement.  I hope it is ok that I have him 
your name.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help and

I have attached our standard CSA and Schedule.  Thanks.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

Kim Ward

marussel@srpnet.com on 04/05/2001 08:20:15 AM

I have been trying to get an ISDA going with Enron for several months. Who
is the best contact to call?

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Tanya:

Bob Crane did a deal with the Canadian party identified below.  Sounds like 
he originally told our FX trader that the parties would be EGM (actually ENA) 
and Enron Industrial Markets ("EIM").  In the end, EIM was not the correct 
party but the Canadian party was the correct party.

Is this trade between ENA and Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona authorized by 
credit?  Is the company eligible?

Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Sara Shackleton
Sara,

Are we able to do FX deals with the company shown below?  Also, would this be 
an RMT confirm or an ENA confirm?

Ana,

And the bank accounts should be

Thank you

Caroline:

I am in the midst of preparing these annexes now.
You should take special note of the credit that Paul is insisting upon (seems 
to be similar to AIG).  This is all credit - but note his Additional 
Termination Event if the ISDA is not executed within 60 days.  You must 
discuss all of the items with your counterparty.

Also, if you do the deal(s), give me the name, phone/fax numbers, email 
addresses of all commercial and legal for your counterparties.

Sara Shackleton
	Paul Radous/ENRON@enronXgate
	04/19/2001 05:43 PM
		 
Here are the credit worksheets for Valentis (25% of the trade and Independent 
amount should be allocated here) and CD Holdings (75% allocated here).  This 
will work for the ISDA, and I am hearing from Caroline that they are ok with 
posting this up front amount in cash.  So, for purposes of the Deemed ISDA, 
we may as well include all of the credit provisions, but make the $2MM a 
"Special Independent Amount" applicable to the counterparty, which may be 
increased by Enron up to $5MM. This Special Independent Amount should be 
added to the Independent Amount as that term is used in the ISDA in order to 
give us the ability to demand more collateral at will with respect to the 
long term hedge.  Given the fact that the c/p can post cash instead of LC's I 
see no reason for us to always have the Special Independent Amount in cash.  
That is, if we are $2MM out of the money on the position, I do not have a 
problem returning their cash, so long as it is in increments of the rounding 
amount. 

So I think we should just go ahead and put credit into these Deemed ISDAs, 
and require that the failure of the parties to execute an ISDA within 60 days 
will constitute a termination event.

Caroline, again, the c/p will have to verbally agree to Loss instead of 
market quotation, to the special margining provisions with respect to this 
particular long term trade, etc.  Let's discuss how this will work, since it 
is different from what I proposed on the phone.

Sara, after you have had a chance to look at these, give me a call so we can 
discuss.

Thanks.
Paul

Paul:

  With respect to Valentis:

 (a)  Does the MAC apply to both S&P and Moody's?  (not clear from worksheet)
 (b)  Are the financial covenants Events of Default or Termination Events?  
(looks like these were Termination Events in AIG)
 (c)  Is this deal two-way margining?  You have set 0 Thresholds but 
indicated Return/Delivery for both parties.  Our discussion of last week may 
have changed (we discussed one-way margining for CP only).

I'll have the same questions for CD Holdings.

Sara Shackleton

Paul:

Further to my earlier email:

Do you want to request the language which we have devised for (1) hedge fund 
monthly account statements and (2)  quarterly/annual engineering reserve 
reports?

Please call to discuss.  Caroline says she may be transacting today.

Martin sent this message to London and Michael advised that Sullivan & 
Cromwell be retained.  With respect to interest by the CFTC in  the proposed 
transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as 
well?  Makes sense to me.  Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?  Sara
Martin Rosell
11/09/99 09:47 AM
Sara,

I hope you're doing well.  Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit 
like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by 
Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists 
of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy 
companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My 
understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its 
customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in 
this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited 
people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as 
well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).  Please advise!

Paul, 

The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com 
Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may 
prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting 
activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry 
out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation 
development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity 
ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk 
management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the 
Sweden and Finland.

Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general 
extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition 
of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. 
entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it 
anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic?

the language except for the proviso at the end because we do not know what 
your internal policies are and how you would evaluate the assignee.  It 
basically strips out the right because it still leaves us subject to Enron's 
caprice.  Could you perhaps give me a better sense as to what the criteria 
would be?

Sara, Allegheny would like to be able to assign to affilaites in the same
manner that we are allowing Enron to make an ssignment so long as the Gty
goes along.  In our case, however, there is no gty, hence the stipualtion
that such assignment must be to an entity with an equal or better credit
rating.  If you wish, I can limit such assignment to an entity rated at
least BBB+ or better.  Would that resolve your concerns?

Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.

I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side
letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly
on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.

Merchant has included in the draft.

The consent looks ok from the GS&Co. side.  I will check with GSI to see if
they have any comments.

Gail

Gail:

Is the attached Master Repurchase Agreement used by both GS&Co as well as
GSI?  It looks like both Enron companies (U.S and U.K.) will want repos and
the U.S. company .  What is the difference in the forms used by GS&Co and
GSI?

Any word on the consent?

Thanks.

Sara -

I will look at your consent document today.
Attached please find the standard repo documentation used by Goldman.

Gail

Gail:

The commercial team is pressuring for a fairly quick implementation of a
repo agreement.  If the consent which I sent yesterday is not satisfactory,
please advise as soon as possible so that I can obtain a repo specific
consent.  Also, could you please submit repo documents to me for review.

I do not know who may have contacted you from the London group (Enron
Credit Ltd.) but we can surely coordinate.  That entity should have its own
form of unanimous consent or resolution.

Thanks for your help.

   Michael,

 Attached are our re-drafts of the financial products (collar,
participating swap and swap) that we are contemplating. Note that with
regard to the collar, the Notional Quantity was not put in the chart of the
call and put prices as we discussed, as it was too cumbersome to do so.  It
was set out as a separate line item.  We also provided for copies of certain
notices to be sent notices to be sent to the Con Edison General Counsel.
The draft confirms for the participating swap and the swap also use similar
provisions for Notional Quantity and provide for copies of such notices to
be sent to the Con Edison General Counsel.

Sara,

Have you had a chance to look into this?  Per Stuart, this company is owned 
by Enron.  We bought it outright, with the intent of putting into an 
off-balance sheet company.  I'm not sure if that part has happened yet, but 
we theorize that when we entered into the hedge, it was still fully Enron 
owned.  Bob Crane would really like to get this resolved, so if you could let 
me know your thoughts, I'd appreciate it.  Do I need to check with Rhett 
Jackson in tax as well?  
Laurel Adams

Here are the credit worksheets for Valentis (25% of the trade and Independent 
amount should be allocated here) and CD Holdings (75% allocated here).  This 
will work for the ISDA, and I am hearing from Caroline that they are ok with 
posting this up front amount in cash.  So, for purposes of the Deemed ISDA, 
we may as well include all of the credit provisions, but make the $2MM a 
"Special Independent Amount" applicable to the counterparty, which may be 
increased by Enron up to $5MM. This Special Independent Amount should be 
added to the Independent Amount as that term is used in the ISDA in order to 
give us the ability to demand more collateral at will with respect to the 
long term hedge.  Given the fact that the c/p can post cash instead of LC's I 
see no reason for us to always have the Special Independent Amount in cash.  
That is, if we are $2MM out of the money on the position, I do not have a 
problem returning their cash, so long as it is in increments of the rounding 
amount. 

So I think we should just go ahead and put credit into these Deemed ISDAs, 
and require that the failure of the parties to execute an ISDA within 60 days 
will constitute a termination event.

Caroline, again, the c/p will have to verbally agree to Loss instead of 
market quotation, to the special margining provisions with respect to this 
particular long term trade, etc.  Let's discuss how this will work, since it 
is different from what I proposed on the phone.

Sara, after you have had a chance to look at these, give me a call so we can 
discuss.

Thanks.

Thanks for your help.  I also left a message for Jeff because I was told that 
he worked on the transaction.

The name "Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona" ("Stadacona") does not appear on 
the corporate database so I cannot verify that it is an Enron-owned entity.  

The only question is:  Can we book the FX trade in the names of Stadacona and

Laurel Adams has an FX deal where RMT must be a party.  The counterparty is a 
100% owned Enron sub named "Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona".  When I last 
checked, nothing shows up in the corporate database.  However, I have 
verified the name, ownership, etc.  with Jeff Blumenthal.  I will separately 
email you the counterparty info that I have.

We need a deemed ISDA for the parties.  We should later do the ISDA when the 
information is available on the database (which could be any day, I 
suppose).  I would just use our standard RMT format.

Please assign.  Feel free to call me or Laurel with questions.  Thanks.

"Net Asset Value" means as of the relevant time of determination, an amount 
(expressed in United States Dollars) equal to the sum of Party B's Assets 
minus Liabilities.  "Assets" means all assets and "Liabilities" means all 
liabilities, as would generally be classified as such in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles.

Paul:  There is already a definition of "Liabilities" in the hedge fund 
template.  We will enhance the existing definition to add the last phrase

I am getting calls again from people asking me whetehr to book the NDF's in 
Enron International or ESA.  As I had mentioned, I am indifferent from a tax 
perspective but did not know whether you were ready from an accounting 
perspective to switch these transactions to ESA.  Where do we stand on this 
issue?

These were handled by Samantha.  Maybe Marie could assist; these don't appear 
to be urgent.

Thanks.

Cassandra, Cheryl and David,

Gary has requested that we establish new futures execution and clearing 
agreements with Solomon Smith Barney/Citigroup and Morgan Stanley.  I will 
forward the agreements when we receive them to Cheryl Nelson in Legal for

You should have already seen the two ISDA's (Valentis, CD Holdings) emailed 
yesterday evening per your instructions.  I am still waiting for you to send  
information regarding inhouse/outside legal counsel for both parties.

The Schedule and Paragraph 13 sent to Valentis et al is very much like the 
hedge fund template which legal is refining.  We are reviewing the first 
draft and commenting.

FYI - I will not be in the office on Friday, April 27.  Also, the Enron legal 
conference is next week and the lawyers will be in San Antonio from May 2 
(afternoon) through May 4.  And finally, I will be on vacation during the 
week of May 7 - May 11.  Please try to make plans (conference calls, 
counterparty comments, etc.) accordingly.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Your email is the first I've heard of Arthur Amron as legal counsel.  Do you

Hi, 
I enjoyed meeting with you yesterday. We are certainly grateful for your 
review and approval of 
new language for points which the traders initiate on a frequent basis. 

Let's select a day and time to review the large folder to ensure that the 
inventory process of capturing the
language is in place. I'm confident of our procedures and updating process, 
but will initiate a full review
of our current confirmation language. How about Friday, Nov. 12 or 19th to 
review the large folder and compare it 
to our comprehensive list of pub codes?

From our discussion on Catalytica, it appears that the current arrangement 
regarding
the deal in progress, setup as a spark spread option, was arranged to be an 
off-balance sheet activity. 

During my research yesterday on the Internet regarding Catalytica, I learned 
that their Board of Directors
has two Enron leaders, Tom White and John Urquhart.

David

Mark:

Can you "publish" a list of swap attorneys and their primary/secondary areas 
of responsibility (for at least the lawyers to use)?  I'd like to direct 
random requests to the appropriate people.

For example, is Brent the only "weather attorney"?

Sara Shackleton

Brent:

It's a weather question.  Looks like Carol asked Susan or Stephanie to let 
Celeste know if weather trades were possible (she thought it was).  If 
weather is a commodity, I guess it works but you'd probably need to 
inocorporate ISDA terminology and your definitions, etc.  Check the blue file 
- you'll see Carol's email.

Sara, the weather group is wanting to get Sempra prepared to do weather 
trades, how should we proceed?

Celeste:
I think that we need to execute an ISDA to do weather trades with Sempra as 
the 2/22/96 Agreement appears to only work for commodity trades.  If this 
needs to be pursued further, please have someone contact Sara Shackleton as I 
am moving to the power group.  Thanks.

be the most convenient for both of us, but we will entertain times before 3

Would you please email your response?

Melissa:

I started with Sempra.  It's one of the more unusual masters ( a "Master 
Master"  covering both physical and financial) and it's not the typical "ECT 
Master".  Further, it contains no rounding or correction to published prices 
provisions.

We'll have to review these masters on a case by case basis.

Dick:

That will be fine.  However, you need to attach the trade confirmation (
marked Exhibit "A") to each of your certificates since that is how each
certificate is drafted.

Thus, for the April 12, 2001 transaction, please resend your certificates
with the appropriate attachments as referenced in the certificates.
Please call if you have any questions.

Thanks for ;your assistance.

Sara Shackleton
                    "Dick D VARNER"
From our end, we would like to have the direct reference to the specific
confirm.  I know it is a little more hassle, but it works better for us
politically.

>>> <Sara.Shackleton@enron.com> 05/01/01 01:14PM >>>
Dick:

I never heard back from you regarding my email of 4/18/01.  I had asked if
you would mind revising the forms of certificate which we will attach to
each trade confirmation.

We would appreciate revisions to the April 12, 2001 certificates.  This
will be the format for all future transactions.

Please send revisions to Kimberly Hundl.  Her phone number is (713)
853-1647 and fax if (713) 646-2443.

Thanks.

Sara Shackleton

Dick:

I am suggesting a minor change to the "Power Risk Management Committee"
certificate (to eliminate the reference to the Exhibit "A").  If we leave
the reference in the certificate, you will always have to label the confirm
as Exhibit "A" and resend the completed papers to us.  Please let me know
if you are alright with this change.  If so, we ask that you please resend
the certificate dated April 12, 2001.  If you do not wish to make the
change, please resend the two certificates to which the confirmation
labeled Exhibit "A" is attached.

Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

form of confirmation to be certain that each particular transaction is

On April 25, you and your counterparties were provided with draft 
documentation (including the Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support 
Annex).  Did you read the documents?  Are you asking for ISDA boilerplate?  I 
will be here until noon.

Sara/ Frank-
do you think we can get the draft of the CSA before you leave for your 
offsite.. Frank- want to discuss you coming up to discuss ISDAs.. in the 
interests of time, its probably best to do a video confo.. I am out next 
week.. the following week??

Caroline:

You should have already seen the two ISDA's (Valentis, CD Holdings) emailed 
yesterday evening per your instructions.  I am still waiting for you to send  
information regarding inhouse/outside legal counsel for both parties.

The Schedule and Paragraph 13 sent to Valentis et al is very much like the 
hedge fund template which legal is refining.  We are reviewing the first 
draft and commenting.

FYI - I will not be in the office on Friday, April 27.  Also, the Enron legal 
conference is next week and the lawyers will be in San Antonio from May 2 
(afternoon) through May 4.  And finally, I will be on vacation during the 
week of May 7 - May 11.  Please try to make plans (conference calls, 
counterparty comments, etc.) accordingly.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.

Jeff Fuller of PRM is requesting a conference call with you next Wednesday 
May16th.  just to refreash your memory he represents some NW puds - he wants 
to discuss the ISDA process with you now that they are prepared to move 
forward - I believe he will have the opion letter by then.  If this is 
possble can you schedule a time that works for both of you with him?  His 
number is 425-451-9123.  Thanks

Kristina:

I'm sorry too!
However, I also sent your application through Houston and it may end up with 
a different group.  I'll keep my fingers crossed (not just for Enron) because 
I know you'll find an exciting position with a good company.
Hope all is well.  I just returned from a week in California and I'm having a

Thanks for trying but appears as if they were looking for a technical

I hope you can help Carol out before our phone call in the morning.  I have

early in the morning to resolve, I would be most appreciative.  You can 
discuss with me in the morning.  Thanks.  Sara

Mary:

Remember, this is the swap that you finally decided to go ahead and terminate 
yourself.  There was much confusion about how many S.A. swaps actually 
exsited (only one) and after sorting through the mess, when I asked if you 
had estabished a Raptor "format for termination", you decided to do the 
drafting.  Let me know if there is a problem.

Maricela has requested a copy of the termination notice for the referenced 
swap.  I advised her that you would have done the document in relation to the 
swap (of which I think there was only one).  I cannot remember if it was ever 
terminated.  Can you coordinate this matter with Maricela.  I am covering the 
rest of the Raptor requests.

Mega just called and said they are going to hold off on this deal until later 
in the week. I spoke to Brent Hendry who gave me some good information re: 
the confirm and said we could just work directly with the Confirms Group to 
get the Confirm out if and when the deal is done.   Sorry for the fire 
drill.  

 
Thanks

Hello Carol, I know Sara is on vacation.  Below is a draft confirmation

Did you and Yair finalize the "transfer" language?  It seems that too many 
confirm questions are popping up and different forms are being drafted.  We 
;should be done with the ISDA.

Laurel:

I have a lot of time tomorrow (5/15) to discuss all related issues.
I am attaching my most recent draft of the confirmation provisions for use in 
the EOL FX product confirmations.  The first is for the Apr-Oct product and 
the second for the single day product.  We need to compare the terminology 
against the EOL description.  You will recall that this was based upon 
Stuart's preference for the CIBC format.

What lawyer handles daily financial trading issues?  I need to speak with 
that person about US swap eligibility rules governing US companies, 
specifically, ECTRIC, and who evaluates ECTRIC's counterparties for 
eligibility.  The specific issue has to do with Total as you will see from 
the string of emails attached.  I look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.

Sara,

ECTRI is a UK registered company.  As a subsidiary of ENA, which is 
registered under US law, can my trader sleave deals through ECTRI to get 
around the eligibiilty issue.  We are working with Total to get a 
confidentiality agreement signed but it is taking awhile and we will not be 
receiving financial statements to evidence eligibility for another three 
weeks.

thanks
brant

Brant
For SFA purposes as they are ulitmately owned by a quoted company on a 
recognised stock exchange then this is sufficient to sign them off.   I don't 
really know whether this makes them an elligible swap participant for the US 
though.
Paul

I am not quite sure I understand.  Does SFA requirements mean you have a 
guaranty, financial statements, or other material that establishes them as an 
eligible derivative customer.  One of our marketers continues to try and 
trade with them and I still don't fully understand how they are open in 
London.  Does meeting SFA requirements establish this customer as an eligible 
counterparty under US statutes?

brant

Brant
We have passed them for SFA requirements in London so yes they can trade 
through London no problem at all.  (see Regulatory tab in CAS)
Any problems, let me know.
Paul

Paul,

I have a trader that is trying to trade financially with Total International 
Ltd., but we have asked that he not until we can sort our some eligibility 
issues.  Prior to speaking with Ben Hamida at Total last week, we had never 
approached them for financial statements or a guaranty that would establish 
them as elibible contract parties.  I noticed that we have significant 
financial trading with them in London.  How have you established eligibilty?  
My trader is asking, since he cannot trade under ENA with Total, if he can 
sleave deals through London.

Any ideas or insight would be helpful.

thanks

Sara, some time ago we forwarded Louisiana-Pacific (L-P) an ISDA for their 
review and consideration.  They have responded with the following comments.  
Can you give me a hand in addressing them?  John 

John,
 
Listed  below are several issues we need to have addressed prior to signing 
the  agreement!
 
1)  Curt Stevens name is consistently  misspelled throughout the documents. 
We should also be sure that our new  corporate address is used.  805 SW 
Broadway, Suite 1200,  Portland, Oregon 97205-3303.
 
2)  Enron doesn't like late payments or early termination of their 
agreements.  Interest on amounts owing is compounded daily.  John - this 
needs to be changed.  What other decent  arrangements can be put in here.  (I 
thought only loan sharks compounded  daily?)
 
3)  Part 3 of the Schedule to the Master Agreement should be amended to 
provide that  LP may satisfy its obligation to provide updated financial 
information by  posting it to EDGAR or on the web. Enron now has that  
ability.
 
4) We  don't have the 1991 ISDA Definitions or the 1993 ISDA Commodity 
Derivatives  Definitions cited in Parts 5 and 6 of the Schedule to the Master 
Agreement. I  wasn't able to locate them on the web. We will need these 
provide  to LP.
 
5) The  Credit Support Annex is designed to apply to ISDA Agreements subject 
to New York  law. Our Agreement is subject to Texas law. We may not have  the 
proper form.
 
Let me know at your convenience.
 
Thanks
Roger
 

Cheryl:

I spoke with Clem and he is preparing the amendment for immediate execution 
as the signers will be at an offsite tomorrow.  I'll let Tom know as soon as 
the amendment has been executed.  Anna Meytina is on vacation so I left a 
message with Sharon Chernick.

(1)  assignment of the Securities Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI (or was a 
separate agreement with ECI executed?)

(2) termination of the prior Enron Corp. guaranty on behalf of ENA in the 
amount of  USD25 Million

I didn't have your phone or fax numbers to keep you in the loop so I am

You may recall that Anna Meytina and Cheryl Nelson negotiated one or more 
agreements between the Bear companies and Enron Credit Inc.  These documents 
included the above referenced $25 Million guaranty.  I understand that our 
respective commercial groups have agreed to an increased guaranty cap ($100 
Million).  I have learned that Anna is on vacation.  I don't know which Bear 
lawyer will look into this recent guaranty development so I hope that you 
will advise us in that regard.  

Effective May 15, 2001, Enron Corp.  executed an amendment to the March 29, 
2001 guaranty to increase the guaranty cap.  I have faxed a copy of this 
amendment to both Bill Carik and Cheryl Lewis.  Please provide me with your 
fax number and I will fax the amendment to you.

Hello Elliot, 
Sorry I couldn't get back with you until now.  Either I am out of the office 
or in meetings all day.  Last we spoke you were going to send me a copy of 
the previous agreed upon ISDA between Heinz and Enron.  I believe you wanted 
our legal contact but is there anyway you can send the copy to my attention.  
I would like to have a copy for my files.  
We have not made a decision yet on linerboard swaps.  I have a meeting with 
my General Manager on Monday PM and hope to know more.  
Can you please send me a copy of the ISDA prior to Monday PM?

Spoke with Tom Moore this morning regarding the last outstanding issue 
(assignment clause for cp) and he is on board with my methodology and agrees 
as well.  He and Yair will propose to Enron replacement language to get us 
where we need to be hopefully.

Tracy

Tracy:

Did you and Yair finalize the "transfer" language?  It seems that too many 
confirm questions are popping up and different forms are being drafted.  We 
;should be done with the ISDA.

Sara Shackleton

Darren:

Yes, this confirms that we are booking in an inconsistent manner.  I am 
faxing copies of the confirms to Texaco (in NY and Houston) and we will 
resolve.  I'll keep you posted.

First Union National Bank ("FUNB") entered into a credit derivative trade 
with ENA effective 20 April 2001 (our trader was a London trader).  Although 
ENA has a Master ISDA Agreement  with FUNB (the "ISDA"), this does not appear 
to be the impetus for the booking since the confirm didn't reference the ISDA.

Is ENA alright confirming trades in this manner?

Sara Shackleton

Susan:

John Malowney would like a copy of this ISDA Master Agreement.  Do we usually 
let the traders have copies (hard or electronic)?  If so, we need to make it 
very clear that this is confidential.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

We have received an executed Master Agreement:

Type of Contract:  ISDA Master Agreement (Multicurrency-Cross Border)

Effective Date:   May 1, 2001

Counterparty:   Louisiana-Pacific Corporation

Transactions Covered:  Approved for all products with the exception of: 
Foreign Exchange    

Governing Law:   Texas

Copies will be distributed  

Cordially,
Susan S. Bailey

Karolina and Rod:

This swap has ended up on my desk!  Imagine that.

This transaction ought to be booked between RMT and ETOL.  The existing ISDA 
Is ETOL prohibited from entering into swaps with other parties, such as RMT 
(under the terms of the lending documents)?

Please bring me up to date.  Thanks.

Sara Shackleton

Susan:

Rod or Karolina will prepare a credit worksheet for an ISDA Master Agreement 
between ETOL and RMT.  Jorge has a 3-year rate swap awaiting documentation.

Rod/Karolina:  Is there any reason to not use RMT?  Is an ETOL sell-off 
imminent?  If so, would it be in the near term?

Rhett:  If an ETOL sell-off (in whole or part) is imminent, should the deal 
be booked in ENA rather than RMT?

Jorge:  The transaction confirm should be an ISDA format.  Also, please 
verify whether any ETOL deals are on ENA/RMT books and the remaining terms

Thanks..

Sara Shackleton

Yair:

Tracy and Tom Moore have come to an understanding regarding the "Transfer" 
language for the ISDA Schedule and have agreed that AESC will propse language 
for ENA to review.  We ask that you blackline that language in a final 
blacklined document for us to review.

We need to execute the ISDA Master Agreement (the "ISDA") now.  I understand 
that Joe Limone and Brent Hendry have been discussing contingent call options 
and related documentation.  ENA would like to incorporate these potential 
trades and other transactions under the new ISDA 

If you prefer, ENA would be glad to take over the drafting of the ISDA.  
Please let me hear from you.

Swaps) for ETOL.

It is in the name of RMT.

Please call or e-mail me should you require any additional information.

I am resending this memo to you in light of what I understand is a 3-year 
deal that Craig Breslau has done with MARTA (Metropolitan Area Rapid Transit 
Authority).  I need to advise Mark Haedicke of the details as soon as 
possible since MARTA is a public entity and we do not have an executed Master 
Agreement with MARTA.  We sent a draft document to MARTA on May 11, 2001.  
Until we resolve the "capacity" or "authority" issue, there is significant 
legal risk attached to transactions with governmental entities.

I left a message for Jay Williams to please advise me of trade details.

Not sure how much I can add on this other than a little background, of which 
you may already be aware.

Enron Credit has a trader in Houston.  His name is Seung-Taek Oh.  In respect 
of two of Enron Credit's counterparties, First Union and Swiss Re, Seung-Taek 
trades in the name of ENA, because ENA has ISDAs with these counterparties.  
I had always understood that this was a intended to be a temporary fix while 
Enron Credit Inc was concluding its own ISDAs with these counterparties.  No 
other traders, and in particular no London-based traders, trade with these 
counterparties in the name of ENA.

The particular trade you mention was executed in Houston by Seung-Taek.  I 
had always understood that Seung-Taek had authority to trade in ENA's name.  
It may be worth following up with Jeff Kinneman on this point.

In terms of giving you the full picture, the following may be useful.

Enron Credit is sending a new trader out to Houston.  His name is Nick 
Stephan.  I imagine he will want to trade with First Union and Swiss Re in 
the name of ENA until Enron Credit Inc's ISDAs are concluded.

Denis O'Connell and I have been talking about drafting an ISDA borrowing 
agreement between ENA and Enron Credit Inc.  We'll send a draft through to 
you.

Enron Credit's originator in New York, Bridget Fraser, is talking to a few 
counterparties that want to trade both credit derivatives and commodities.  
The issue we're having to deal with is which Enron entity should face 
counterparties for multi-product ISDAs.  Barrick Gold is the only live one.  
I've been keeping Steve Douglas in the loop on the ENA tax side.  Ed Cooper 
has been involved on the Enron Credit legal side - you may want to contact 
him.

Trust this is of use - feel free to give me a call.

Kind regards

Guenther

Sara, 
I think Guenther may have been involved in this transaction. He is out of the 
office today but back tomorrow and will follow up with you directly. I will 
be in Houston next week so may stop by to say hello.

Hey, I felt like I was in L.A., oh, wow, like, it was really cool ... 
re-ending is my thing, it's soooooo California, yea I'm gonna get re-ended as

(Thanks
again, Sara).   At my soon-to-be-age and with my level of coordination and
grace, I think it may be more likely that I'll slip, fall or wreck than go on 
a
vacation before the "important day."  If I'm lucky, I may even get re-ended
before then!

Thanks for letting me share Sara's wine and half of the meal last night.
After my re-ending experience it was a very welcome evening, indeed. You
both look great and live interesting lives. I hope we can get together
for Donna's important day some time around July 12th. I am saving the
Cakebread reserve for the occasion. Maybe, we will have some more
interesting vacations, wrecks, or slip and falls to discuss by then.

Hi Sara, 

(1) For clarification, my voicemail was not full on Friday - I checked it, 
got several messages including one fromTom Doukas and called him and others 
immediately as I arrived.  My voicemail was full on Monday - when I checked 
in with Keegan on Monday late morningshe advised me of such and I deleted the 
calls periodically.  I do realize that I do get a lot of calls and emails due 
to the 50 or so  brokerage related agreements & the numerous deals I am 
working on so I do try to clear the box daily.

(2) I can be of more assistance in the future if, instead of telling Keegan 
you need a file, that you contact me directly. That way, I can make sure that 
you get what you need.   I took a lot of Enron calls and faxes while on 
vacation so I would not have objected had you contacted me directly.  That 
way we do not have to put the burden on Keegan to locate my files -- although 
I am sure she is more than willing to help, I do not think she knows much 
about where I keep particular files or documents.  

(3) Also with respect to Keegan, I wanted to relay to you that she felt 
uncomfortable being quizzed by you or  passing judgment as to why I have 
chosen to receive orthodontal treatment in New York rather than in Houston.  
(The answer to the question is irrelevant.  If I were getting treatment 
across the street from the office, I still could be here to do any work.  My 
getting the treatment in New York, while I am on vacation, does not affect my 
presence in the office or undermine in any way my ability to do my job).  

Equally important,  apparently these were not fair questions of Keegan, as 
she has informed me that they made her feel uncomfortable and she only 
answered because she sensed or thought she was obligated to do so.  Nor do I 
think they are fair of me.  I do not wish to justify my medical decisions 
with my colleagues, especially provided that I am taking vacation time or 
sick time I rightfully  can take.  It was previously represented to me that 
our department policy is that when out for medical reasons, we should provide 
in an email or otherwise convey a general statement - the details are not 
required.  If that is not the policy then please advise.  In any case, if for 
some justifiable reason you have to know such information and you need to 
rely on it, it is best to ask me directly so that you can be sure that the 
information you are getting is accurate.

(1)  assignment of the Securities Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI (or was a 
separate agreement with ECI executed?)

(2) termination of the prior Enron Corp. guaranty on behalf of ENA in the 
amount of  USD25 Million 

I spoke with Stephanie and she could not locate your Bear/ECI files on Friday 
of last week.  

Thanks.

Latin America Energy Investment:
Battling Economic Volatility with Creative Solutions

Latin America has undergone a difficult year of global and regional economic 
volatility combined with the sharp decline in international oil prices. 
Although international oil prices have returned to double digits, many Latin 
American countries are still struggling to stabilize their economies. In 
addition to their economic turmoil within the region, political and 
regulatory risks have been rising, thus making it difficult to secure project 
financing. In this CERA Latin America Energy Watch, the authors examine how 
several companies and financial managers have risen to the challenge of tight 
financing.

You may want to clarify this with Keegan as 1) your voice mail was full on 
that Friday, 2) Keegan tried to contact you in New York and the number she 
had for you was disconnected, and 3) we tried to locate the documents that 
Friday and were not able to.

Sara, 

Moreover, Keegan represented to me that you requested that she locate for you 
the Securities Loan Agreement for you while I was out and that she went into 
my office and retrieved that document from my Enron Credit Inc. file and gave 
it to you.  So, I am not sure of the source of confusion about not being able 
to find my file but for future reference, the best thing to do is to ask 
Keegan how to contact me immediately and directly - when out the office she 
always knows how to reach me.

voice mail - as I checked my voicemails on Friday (that is how I was able to 
speak with Tom from New York on Friday) or (2) advise Keegan and she will 
contact me immediately by cell phone as she did regarding other matters on 
Friday.

Mark/Sara,

We are attempting to get two amendments to the ISDA with AEP right now.  
Mark, you are working on the Amendment allowing for EOL Transactions to not 
need written Confirmations and Sara is working on an amendment that will 
change the Confirming Party to ENA (for some reason, AEP was allowed to be 
the Confirming Party when the Master was drafted.)   At any rate, is it 
possible that we send both of these amendments to AEP at the same time?  We 
want to make sure that AEP views these amendments together and sign off on 
both.  We think they'll be more comfortable signing them both at once rather 
than a couple of weeks apart.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter

Caroline,
As I have said from the outset, before we send them an ISDA, we need to 
obtain from their Bermuda counsel a legal opinion that gives us the 
assurances that we need that (1) all of the Bermuda transactions have been 
duly authorized and are enforceable by us against AIG and (2) we have a 
perfected security interest in any collateral that has been posted by AIG to 
us.  A form of the legal opinion is attached to the confirm.  As to point #1, 
we have no way of confirming this on our own and I understand from Brent 
Hendry that because of various peculiarities with Bermuda law, our only way 
of gaining comfort on this is through the legal opinion process.  As to point 
#2, we have gotten some comfort from our legal counsel on this but again it 
is appropriate to have AIG's counsel opine as to this.

Please call or e-mail me, Sara or Frank if you have any additional questions.

I am a lawyer with ENA.  I understand that you have been involved with the 
execution of the Goldman Sachs & Co. ("GSC")/ECI Corporate Account Agreement, 
working with both Cheryl Nelson and Stephanie Panus of ENA.

ENA would like to transfer several accounts to ECI.  In connection therewith, 
I am attaching a form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement for that 
purpose.  This document is based upon a similar agreement executed by GSC, 
ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. on January 22, 2001.

I ask that you please advise me of the following:

(1)  What is the effective date of the Corporate Account Agreement between 
ECI and GSC?  Has it been executed by GSC?

(2)  Is the attached form of assignment acceptable?

(3)  Is there anybody else with GSC that needs to be involved with the 
review/execution of the attached assignment?

Please let me hear from you.  Our commercial group is extremely anxious to 
effectuate the transfer.  Thank you for your assistance.

(1)  Re:  the Chase Global Custody Agreemnet

Are you OK with Chase's ability to setoff amounts in any ENA Chase accounts 
against amount which ENA may owe under the Global Custody Agreement?  Does 
ENA have many accounts with Chase?

(2)  Re:  Enron Credit Inc. repo agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. ("GSC")

By way of background, ECT executed a repo with GSC on 4/25/97.
FYI, Enron Corp. issued a guaranty in the amount of $10 million.

Do you have any concerns with respect to a repo agreement between GSC and 
Enron Credit Inc.?

Hi Sara and Stephanie,

 It is my understanding that the paralegals working on the brokerage accounts 
are to (1) send documents to counterparties; (2) track their return and (3) 
keep the fully executed documents received from counterparties in the file 
cabinet next to Stephanie's office.

 In light of our being short-staffed in light of Samantha's absence, I have 
tried to be helpful to our team by assisting in preparing the documents for 
execution & getting some signatures.  I hope that has been helpful.  But once 
Stephanie [or whichever legal assistant assumes her role] notes that the 
documents have gone out, then that person should track the documents and be 
the keeper of records.

Good Afternoon Sara,

I have had an opportunity to review this counterparty and have the following 
information for you. Here is a list of the current trades (Interest Rate 
Swaps) for ETOL.

I am attaching the only confirmation that was created and amended for ETOL. 
It is in the name of RMT.

Please call or e-mail me should you require any additional information.

Regards,

Jorge

Susan:

Rod or Karolina will prepare a credit worksheet for an ISDA Master Agreement 
between ETOL and RMT.  Jorge has a 3-year rate swap awaiting documentation.

Rod/Karolina:  Is there any reason to not use RMT?  Is an ETOL sell-off 
imminent?  If so, would it be in the near term?

Rhett:  If an ETOL sell-off (in whole or part) is imminent, should the deal 
be booked in ENA rather than RMT?

Jorge:  The transaction confirm should be an ISDA format.  Also, please 
verify whether any ETOL deals are on ENA/RMT books and the remaining terms

Thanks..

Sara/Mary,

I very much appologise for taking some time with regards to a reply on the 
credit issues for the ISDA.

With regards to your question on whether ETOL is prohibited from entering 
into Swaps with other parties - I actually do not have the answer to that 
question so I cannot comment on that.

I have looked at the documents and I would like to in as much as possible 
replicate the terms we have with ETOL in the ECT ISDA. I cannot see any 
reason not to go with the same structure as we have in that ISDA. We will 
provide an Enron Corp guarantee in favour of ETOL as well as have a $50M 
collateral threshold (like in the previos ISDA). I further assume that we 
should roll up any outstanding ISDA confirmations with this counterparty 
under this ISDA. With regards to the cap on the Enron guarantee - this is set 
as 10,000,000 for the previous ISDA. Again here I think we can go for the 
same amount.

Please give me a call if you have any questions and we can discuss,

Kind Regards,

karolina

Cheryl:

Attached are Welch's comments.

As you already know, Jennifer is doing the 2-month deal (but no others until 
the ISDA is inked).  We do have to investigate the coop issue under Michigan 
law.  Both the swap CP and the parent have the word "cooperative" in their 
names.  Please see Lotus Notes.  You should send an immediate email to the 
department to see if anyone has used Michigan counsel (I saw a single 
reference in the Jurisdictional Database).  We may be able to obtain an 
opinion from McDermott or even Welch's inhouse counsel.

Sara,

Attached are Welch's comments to the schedule and paragraph 13 proposed by
Enron.  I look forward to discussing the terms of these documents at your
earliest convenience.   The form of the Letter of Credit and the guaranty are
still under review by Welch's and MWE.

Thanks, - Mike

Sara/Mary,

I very much appologise for taking some time with regards to a reply on the 
credit issues for the ISDA.

With regards to your question on whether ETOL is prohibited from entering 
into Swaps with other parties - I actually do not have the answer to that 
question so I cannot comment on that.

I have looked at the documents and I would like to in as much as possible 
replicate the terms we have with ETOL in the ECT ISDA. I cannot see any 
reason not to go with the same structure as we have in that ISDA. We will 
provide an Enron Corp guarantee in favour of ETOL as well as have a $50M 
collateral threshold (like in the previos ISDA). I further assume that we 
should roll up any outstanding ISDA confirmations with this counterparty 
under this ISDA. With regards to the cap on the Enron guarantee - this is set 
as 10,000,000 for the previous ISDA. Again here I think we can go for the 
same amount.

Please give me a call if you have any questions and we can discuss,

Kind Regards,

karolina

Good Afternoon Sara,

I have had an opportunity to review this counterparty and have the following 
information for you. Here is a list of the current trades (Interest Rate 
Swaps) for ETOL.

I am attaching the only confirmation that was created and amended for ETOL. 
It is in the name of RMT.

Please call or e-mail me should you require any additional information.

Regards,

Jorge

Susan:

Rod or Karolina will prepare a credit worksheet for an ISDA Master Agreement 
between ETOL and RMT.  Jorge has a 3-year rate swap awaiting documentation.

Rod/Karolina:  Is there any reason to not use RMT?  Is an ETOL sell-off 
imminent?  If so, would it be in the near term?

Rhett:  If an ETOL sell-off (in whole or part) is imminent, should the deal 
be booked in ENA rather than RMT?

Jorge:  The transaction confirm should be an ISDA format.  Also, please 
verify whether any ETOL deals are on ENA/RMT books and the remaining terms

Thanks..

Sara Shackleton

Nikki:

I am a lawyer with ENA.  I understand that you have been involved with the 
execution of the Goldman Sachs & Co. ("GSC")/ECI Corporate Account Agreement, 
working with both Cheryl Nelson and Stephanie Panus of ENA.

ENA would like to transfer several accounts to ECI.  In connection therewith, 
I am attaching a form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement for that 
purpose.  This document is based upon a similar agreement executed by GSC, 
ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. on January 22, 2001.

I ask that you please advise me of the following:

(1)  What is the effective date of the Corporate Account Agreement between 
ECI and GSC?  Has it been executed by GSC?

(2)  Is the attached form of assignment acceptable?

(3)  Is there anybody else with GSC that needs to be involved with the 
review/execution of the attached assignment?

Please let me hear from you.  Our commercial group is extremely anxious to 
effectuate the transfer.  Thank you for your assistance.

Sara Shackleton

We are sending this out in draft form until Scott Neal (our "Argentina" 
trader) has confirmed the terms of the deal with EDEN.  The trade date will 
probably be set towards  the end of next week.  Sara

Comments:

1. We should not have a threshold for these transactions - only KCS
2. Do we need to reference that the Master has been amended in the opening 
paragraph
3. Is there any way to reference the assignment to Brazos?  I just want to 
make sure everyone understands that there are two outcomes for these deals on 
Jun 15:  1) Termination if VPP not done or 2) assignment of swap to Brazos if 
VPP is done.  There should never be a time where ENA has a trades with KCS 
beyond Jun 15.

FYI, there has been activity regarding the KCS file, in particular, the 
status of the amendment to permit cross-netting of certain agreements and the 
impact of that amendment now that KCS has emerged from bankruptcy.  Two (2) 
new financial transactions have been executed and there is a VPP looming 
ahead for June 15.  The issue which we were trying to isolate is the effect 
of the amendment to the financial/physical agreements post-bankruptcy.  We 
concluded that KCS is bound post-bankruptcy (Carol St. Clair thought you may 
have had some reservations).  I'll keep you apprised of any developments.

Derek:  Gail Shanley (Goldman Sachs & Co. in N.Y.) sent me Enron Credit Inc. 
documents (with Goldman Sachs & Co.).   Enron Credit Limited will be dealing 
with Goldman Sachs International in London.  I'll try to find out who the 
London lawyer is and have the docs sent to Denis O'Connell who is the lawyer 
for Enron Credit Limited.

Sara,
it is between ECL and GS & Co.  but  GS ;s Gail shandley sent over the docs 
to you.

Gail:

My London trader, Derek Lee, tells me that no one has received the GSI Master 
Repurchase Agreement.  The Enron Credit Limited lawyer in London is Denis 
O'Connell.  Can you please check with your London counterpart about having 
the document forwarded to Derek and Denis is our London office?  Thanks so 
much.  Please let me know what you find out.

Can you please let me know if he has received GSI Master Repurchase

Attached are Con Ed's documents.  We need to do an "ISDA comparison" and 
prepare a redline to submit to Con Ed.  Sam worked on the original ConEd

Hi Sara and Ed!
ConEd wants to get going on an ISDA , in parallel to adjusting as necessary 
the long form for the upcoming transaction.  They believe that the ISDA will 
not be negotiated in time for when they want to execute, thus the parallel 
documents.  
Regarding the annex, the uncoming deals could potentially be swaps, collars, 
or participating swaps.
I think they are quite eager to hear our response.
Thanks,
Janelle

I am a lawyer with ENA.  I understand that you have been involved with the 
execution of the Goldman Sachs & Co. ("GSC")/ECI Corporate Account Agreement, 
working with both Cheryl Nelson and Stephanie Panus of ENA.

ENA would like to transfer several accounts to ECI.  In connection therewith, 
I am attaching a form of Assignment and Assumption Agreement for that 
purpose.  This document is based upon a similar agreement executed by GSC, 
ENA and ECT Investments, Inc. on January 22, 2001.

I ask that you please advise me of the following:

(1)  What is the effective date of the Corporate Account Agreement between 
ECI and GSC?  Has it been executed by GSC?

(2)  Is the attached form of assignment acceptable?

(3)  Is there anybody else with GSC that needs to be involved with the 
review/execution of the attached assignment?

Please let me hear from you.  Our commercial group is extremely anxious to 
effectuate the transfer.  Thank you for your assistance.

Martin sent this message to London and Michael advised that Sullivan & 
Cromwell be retained.  With respect to interest by the CFTC in  the proposed 
transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as 
well?  Makes sense to me.  Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?  Sara
Martin Rosell
11/09/99 09:47 AM
Sara,

I hope you're doing well.  Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit 
like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by 
Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists 
of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy 
companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My 
understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its 
customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in 
this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited 
people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as 
well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).  Please advise!

Paul, 

The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com 
Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may 
prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting 
activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry 
out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation 
development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity 
ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk 
management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the 
Sweden and Finland.

Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general 
extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition 
of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. 
entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it 
anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic?

Sara,
I have reviewed this briefly and have a couple of issues/comments.
I am concerned about the references to cash accounts.  I need to discuss
with the group.  ENA is not authorized to operate cash accounts.
Overdrafts and advances should not be permitted (sections 2Ciii and 4A)
I need to discuss FX with Laurel.  Again, ENA should not be operating cash
accounts.
Any verbal or fax instruction must be confirmed with callback or other
security procedures.  We have some sample call back procedures, test keys
are mentioned but are messy.  Need to discuss.  3C-authority to act should
be predicated on following the agreed procedures.  Maybe this is implied.
In 2, it is mentioned that info can be given.  I think it should be only if
required by law.
5A, generally, we don't allow fees to be debited.
5C I agree with you 5C is ugly.  I think this must be limited to the assets
in the specific accounts related to the agreement.
My number is 713 355 3814

As we discussed this morning....

Paul,

I don't mean to dump this on you, but it was part of my old life.  Do you 
know who would cover an ISDA contract with Enron Corp?  I was working on 
these corporate type contracts for a bit before I left.  If you did not 
assume this responsibility, could you forward to the guilty party.  (I would 
ask Bill, but he's out - as you know).

Hope things are going well otherwise.

Later,
Rod

 

Dear Rod:

It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday.  As discussed, I found the 
draft from last July and I have attached it below.  Please let me know whom I 
should contact to follow up and I will do.  I greatly appreciate your help in 
moving this negotiation along.  As per notes from my colleague, Joyce Lim, 
this draft was constructed based on our executed ISDA Master with Enron North

Ltd. in London) whether ECL is currently negotiating with BONY to put another 
"Global Custody Agreement" in place.  He may be negotiating an almost 
identical agreement (not necessary if Enron Corp. is the contracting party or 
perhaps if ENA ).

Sara,
I have reviewed this briefly and have a couple of issues/comments.
I am concerned about the references to cash accounts.  I need to discuss
with the group.  ENA is not authorized to operate cash accounts.
Overdrafts and advances should not be permitted (sections 2Ciii and 4A)
I need to discuss FX with Laurel.  Again, ENA should not be operating cash
accounts.
Any verbal or fax instruction must be confirmed with callback or other
security procedures.  We have some sample call back procedures, test keys
are mentioned but are messy.  Need to discuss.  3C-authority to act should
be predicated on following the agreed procedures.  Maybe this is implied.
In 2, it is mentioned that info can be given.  I think it should be only if
required by law.
5A, generally, we don't allow fees to be debited.
5C I agree with you 5C is ugly.  I think this must be limited to the assets
in the specific accounts related to the agreement.
My number is 713 355 3814

Attached is the latest draft from Chase.    

In particular, please take a look at the following paragraphs:

2.A (the definition of "Securities")
5.B (lien on securities)
5.C (setoff)

The ENA contact is Gennaro Contella.  Please leave me or Sheila a voice mail 
and we can arrange a conference call on Monday with Gennaro, Nancy Callahan, 
if necessary (Chase legal) and anyone that you need to conference in on 
behalf of Enron Corp.  The traders are anxious to have this account in place.

Irrespective of which Enron entity takes ownership of this agreement, we were 
looking to you for information regarding existing Chase accounts (in ENA's 
name).  

Thanks for your help.

As requested, attached is the final Agreement which I believe reflects the
revisions we discussed this morning.  If this is acceptable, please have
the Agreement executed on behalf of Enron and return the necessary
counterparts to me for signature by Chase.  I will then return fully
executed copies to you.

Attached please find the standard repo documentation used by Goldman.

Gail

Gail:

The commercial team is pressuring for a fairly quick implementation of a
repo agreement.  If the consent which I sent yesterday is not satisfactory,
please advise as soon as possible so that I can obtain a repo specific
consent.  Also, could you please submit repo documents to me for review.

I do not know who may have contacted you from the London group (Enron
Credit Ltd.) but we can surely coordinate.  That entity should have its own
form of unanimous consent or resolution.

Thanks for your help.

Mary,
Based upon our recent discussions with you regarding the set up of a Global 
Custody account, you may want to have the same discussions with Enron Credit 
who are pursuing a Global Custody Account with BONY.  Richard Sage is the 
Contoller for the Business unit and Anna is the Settlements person who is 
working to get the account established.

Richard and Anna,
Sara, Laurel and I have been having discussions regarding our requested 
Global Custody account with Mary.  Mary has some specific concerns which she 
may want to make sure are addressed with your set up of the account as well.

Thanks. Sheila

Hey Sam, that has to be one of the "cheeriest" cards I've ever received.  
Please thank Leica for her birthday wishes (and how is the old girl doing?).  
Do you remember my 39th at Andrea's with Pat and Dee (I think) and Ron and 
his wife (I've forgotten her name but I remember what she looks like)?  I 
remember your 40th with Beverly and Helen and the walker (you probably 
remember the stripper).  I need your MAILING address so that Phoebe, Chloe 
and I can send you a holiday card.  Are you a bi-city resident?  Do you still 
own Corky's?  Do you have a different venture(s)?  How is Mr. Casey?  How are 
Helen and Beverly?  Do you see them often?  Do you love Atlanta?  You know 
that at my age (it's actually been any my ages) I write in stream of 
consciousness.  I hope this makes sense.  Sara

P.S.  Ain't life grand?

Mark:

Attached is my current workload report.  I'm beginning to get nervous about 
meeting traders' expectations as I am taking vacation from June 14 - 22 
(seven business days) and I don't know who will be able to pick up my 
emergencies and routine issues.

I have some idea about Mary's and Frank's workload and I have the impression 
that Brent is constantly busy with weather.  I'd like to briefly discuss 
Cheryl's workload  I think it would be a good idea to have everyone submit a 
status report of sorts to you so that you can assess how much is "project" 
oriented vs. routine, specific commodity areas, and volume.

FYI, I am trying to limit Cheryl's activity with Gary's group to brokerage 
agreements only.  The huge volume of activity on the brokerage end was 
apparently the result of a recent audit by AA and effort to "cleanup" the 
agreement status.  It should be winding down.  I have encouraged Cheryl (as 
have Frank and Mary) to provide you  with a workload report since we really 
want her to be trained in the swap basics.

Also, I will try to schedule a conference call with David Mitchell, you and 
me before I leave (topic is online trading of credit derivatives).  
Currently, only ECL is offering the bankruptcy default swap online (and no 
one is hitting the product).

Sara Shackleton

Mark/Rod:

I'll draft the annex without offering up the ENE guaranty (although you may 
have to speak with them since ENA offered up a guaranty for its repo).  
Please let me know how you want to handle defaults.

Can we resolve tomorrow (Wenesday)?  Am I being too pushy?

Thanks.

Sara Shackleton

Martin:  Sorry for the log jam but I always thought that the law firm was the 
best idea.  Call if you need assistance.   Sara

Martin sent this message to London and Michael advised that Sullivan & 
Cromwell be retained.  With respect to interest by the CFTC in  the proposed 
transaction, would you agree that the same law firm advise on that issue as 
well?  Makes sense to me.  Also, what is Energydesk.com LImited?  Sara
Martin Rosell
11/09/99 09:47 AM
Sara,

I hope you're doing well.  Please see my note to Paul below.  It feels a bit 
like an overkill to turn directly to Sullivan & Cromwell (as suggested by 
Micheal) in respect of a USD 1.25 million transaction.  The target consists 
of about a dozen employees and its business is to advise local energy 
companies on appropriate risk management structures and routines.  My 
understanding is that the target never advises on what trading positions its 
customers should take.  Could there possibly be an interest for the CFTC in 
this worth investigating further?!  I believe the Energydesk.com Limited 
people intend to let Japro survive and continue its current operations (as 
well as serving Energydes.com's customers in the future).  Please advise!

Paul, 

The above entity is a Swedish limited liability company which Energydesk.com 
Limited intends to acquire.  According to the company's Articles, it may 
prepare  analyses, give information, and engage in advisory and consulting 
activities with respect to risk management, energy and power trading; carry 
out strategic and other analyses and advise on strategic and organisation 
development; engage in IT based consulting as well as in any other activity 
ancillary with any the foregoing.  Principally, the company acts as a risk 
management consultant for small and medium seized energy companies in the 
Sweden and Finland.

Will the acquisition give rise to any SFA concerns?!  Despite the general 
extraterritorial application of US securities laws, I'd guess an acquisition 
of a minor Swedish-based operation active in the Nordic market by a U.K. 
entity would be too remote to cause attraction over there.  I may check it 
anyhow, but do you have a feel for the topic?

Martin

hearing from you.

I spoke with Kara Saxon and Margo Topman, Goldman Sachs Legal, 212-902-9982.
Per our conversation ....

Foreign Listed Equity Options are considered Unseasoned securities because 
they are issued on the date purchased and not widely held (from U.S. point of 
view).    GS has reviewed our ability to trade Foreign Listed Equity Options  
vis-a-vis REG S.  Goldman says that we can execute from our London Office 
(not from States) Foreign Listed Equity Options.  We can settle and hold with 
our current account, documentation  and legal structure with Goldman Sachs.   

Margo said that there is some risk but they do not think it is large.  She 
suggested we do a follow-up with our Securities counsel.  
Sheila

Sara, 
Can we run this by someone?  Margo offered herself as a contact if we need 
more infomation.
Thanks. Sheila

	
	

Goldman Sachs has given us the go-ahead to do Foreign Listed Equity Options.  
Kara Saxon at Goldman called me today and will follow-up with an e-mail.  
Goldman Sachs legal has said that we can trade as we currently do as ECT 
Investments, Inc.  This includes the whole European market.  I asked her to 
check on Canadian and Australian.

I will forward Kara's e-mail tomorrow.

investment
decisions doe Enron?

Sara or Mary,

Carol asked that I have one of you handle the following request for the 
captioned counterparty with respect to the financial consents.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Carol is handling the consent for EPMI, and set forth below are her 
instructions to Rhonda Denton with EPMI

Rhonda:
Enclosed is a clean and marked version of the MEGA Assignment.  Is the plan 
to confirm these trades under the existing Master with Morgan until a new EEI 
Master is executed?  What is the cutoff date for this assignment?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Set forth below is original message I received from the Counterparty 
requesting such consents.   I originally thought Carol would handle, but she 
said one of you should handle the financial piece for ENA.   So attached 
hereto is that orignal message and the proposed consents:

Carol,

Please review message below from Kristina Drew @ Merchant Energy.  I thought 
you would be the appropriate lawyer to work on this as it involves EPMI as 
well as a derivative piece with ENA.

FYI:  the assignment is not of immediate need, being that FERC approval must 
secured.

If you do not think this to be the case, please advise as to who should work 
on this matter.

Enclosed is a new revised draft of the MEGA Consent marked against the draft 
that they sent to us.  Here is what we have decided to do:

1. As a condition to our execution of this Consent, we will execute an 
amendment to the existing Master with Morgan to (a) insert collateral 
provisions and (b) clean up some of the defined terms in the MEGA confirms.  
I will draft the amendment and Christian will help you and Melissa develop 
the language for the amendment that deals with the confirm clean-up.

2. We need to know from MEGA and Morgan what the transfer effective date is 
that establishes the cutoff date for these trades as between ourselves and 
each of Morgan and MEGA.  My revised draft of the Consent makes it clearer 
how this cutoff date works.

3. We need a contact from Morgan that we can send the form of amendment to.

Call me if you have any questions.

I've been thinking about your query and in the interim, I find that David is 
very conscientious and does not let outstanding issues linger. He also seems 
quite eager to learn.   As I continue to work with him, I am glad to keep you

things are going in general and I know David has been working with you on 
some Financial Power Confirmations.

I am still waiting for my Brazilian visa (another single entry, 
unfortunately).  It should arrive next week.  I was hoping to spend the week 
of Sept. 5-11 in Sao Paolo but that is impossible to plan without the visa.  
Maybe the latter part of that week or the next week will work.

If I arrive on a Sat. or Sun., what do you think about the two of us meeting 
over the weekend to work out a plan?  I can then devote all of my time to 
dealing with Tozzini on the physical and financial issues and working with 
originators to explain financial trading procedures.  I will need to 
determine if Jose Emilio (on the physical issues) and Antonio Felix and 
Renato (on the financial issues) will be available to meet during my trip.  I 
have sent them e-mails to at least pose the question.

I know that you are very busy.  Please let me know what you think about my 
proposal.  Also, I apologize for asking you to give up any of your weekend 
time.  Maybe you have another suggestion that will work better for you.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Sara

You are fantastic!  It looks like the trip is shaping up for a visit to BA 
around 9/12 with a longer stopover in Sao Paulo several days later which 
could last until 9/25 or the end of September.  Will I have the visa before 
then?  SS

Kaye Ellis
09/02/99 10:44 AM
I haven't given up on a multi-entry Visa for Brazil.  I sent over a new 
letter for the Consulate this morning.  This letter states you will be 
visiting Sao Paulo several times during the next 12 months to attend various 
business meetings looking for new trading opportunities and conducting new 
negotiations for a planned trading desk in Enron's Sao Paulo, Brazil office.

Supposedly, the key to a multi-entry Visa is "new" opportunities in Brazil.

We should know by tomorrow if the Consulate approves the multi-entry Visa. 

No, we insist that the trader make credit aware of new counterparties or 
unusual trades or opportunities prior to transacting.  Credit reviews trades 
each morning and they know what's going on.  ss

   

Sara,  Do you usually do guidelines relating to credit approval, size of 
transaction a trader can effectuate and internal approval process?  

Sara Shackleton
09/16/99 02:24 PM
I am forwarding to you guidelines prepared for global products trading.  It's 
a good starting point.  I am currently working on guidelines for Argentina 
which will address both physical and financial trading.  Other "guidelines" 
exist in limited form for the remote offices in Singapore and Australia.  I 
am checking on London.
I'm not exactly certain as to what you are looking for.  Obviously the 
foreign offices have issues that may not apply in the US (although LA. is 
about as close as you can get to a third world country).  One thing that 
doesn't show up in the attachment is the swap eligibility issue.   Let me 
know how I can help further.  Sara

Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:

Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
at Morgan Stanley.
EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
February 20th, 2000.
After the ADR's are transferred into EPCA's accounts, EPCA will need to 
convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
registered accordingly in Argentina.

Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
(corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).

Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.

Best Regards,

RFR

Rafael Rangel
05/24/2000 05:50 PM
Sheila, finally ready to open up the account at Morgan Stanley for EDIDE so 
that EPCA can transfer the correct amount of ADRs.  I have the Corporate 
Resolution from EDIDE.  I understand that the contact at Morgan Stanley has 
changed.  Please advise.

agreement.  Let's talk when you have a chance. I've put this on our 
legal.credit list.  SS
	Tanya Rohauer
	06/05/2000 03:25 PM
		
Sara,

After looking at the list, we are on top of most of it:

aquila risk - we should be assigning all the trades to the new Utilicorp ISDA 
and terminating Aquila Risk master
jaron - we have a new ISDA; Jeff probably just isn't reflecting it yet
el paso - Brant is currently negotiating the new ISDA

The following are in negotiation and are Top 10s:
- idacorp
- wps
-pancanadian
-duke energy mktg ltd (i think this one is all but signed)
- mieco
-dynegy canada

I know you have had initial discussions with the counterparties and have 
discussed the need to put new documentation in place with:
- morgan
- vitol

Lastly, we were waiting on Reliant to give us an updated draft ISDA; however, 
now that Randy Baker has left Reliant, they are not likely to address for 
awhile.  Tracy can ask Kelly about trying to get something in place.

The others can probably wait until we get some of the above executed. Dynegy 
and Sempra are probably the most important of those left.  Dynegy should not 
be too difficult; however, Sempra is a master financial/physical and will be 
more problematic.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

FYI - the following list reflects old ECT master and no master counterparties 
by volume (not necessarily exposure).  Sara

Attached please find a spreadsheet of the top 20 counterparties (by number
of deals) with whom we do not have an ISDA Master Agreement, for the
period Jan-May '00.

Mark:  In connection with Susan F.'s departure, could you please provide a 
copy of her "project list" so that we can follow up on 
finalizing/redistributing her workload?  I have lots of questions which I'm 
sure can't be answered this minute, such as:  Shouldn't we help to prioritize 
her work?  Will she continue day-to-day work?  Who will take confirm desk 
calls?, How will this impact Samantha's training (maybe the lawyers should be 
involved now), etc.  

Please let us know when you'd like to "regroup".  Thanks.  Sara

Sara:

    As promised, this email discusses the securities laws issues involved
with equity derivatives, I
then make a few observations about the relationship between the securities
and commodities laws, and I
then makes some comments on the confirmations you sent me (both securities
laws comments and other
comments.

The principal securities laws issues relate to the fact that the equity
derivative itself is a security and to the
issue of whether and to what extent a counterparty=01,s activities in
establishing or unwinding a hedge are
attributable to the issuer.  When Enron enters into a derivative and the
counterparty goes out into the
market to make a purchase, is that purchase attributable to Enron?  When it
unwinds its hedge by making
a sale, is the counterparty=01,s sale attributable to Enron and therefore
required to be registered?  Here are
the principal issues:

1)  Rule 10b-5.  When Enron enters into a derivative, it must be sure it
does
not have undisclosed
material inside information regarding its affairs.  It is my understanding
that the traders are
supposed to check with Rex Rogers on the issue of whether Enron possesses
such information.
Although it could discharge its obligations under Rule 10b-5 by disclosing
the information to the
counterparty, that would probably be unacceptable since the counterparty
would then be in
possession of material inside information and could not engage in a market
transaction to hedge.
Thus, each time it enters into an equity derivative in its own stock, Enron
must be confident that
the public has available to it all material information regarding Enron.

2)  Rule 10b-18.  This rule permits issuers and persons acting in concert
with issuers to repurchase
the issuer=01,s  shares under a =01&safe harbor=018 that says in effect tha=
t if
purchases are made pursuant
to the rule they won=01,t be deemed to be manipulative by reason of the tim=
ing
and amounts of the
bids or purchases.  It is typical for an issuer to require its counterparty
to make purchases
pursuant to the rule.  Sometimes this is a contractual undertaking in the
confirmation, and in
some cases the issuer will simply obtain an oral commitment from the
counterparty to engage in
its hedges pursuant to the rule.  Obviously, it is better to have it in
writing.

3)  Registration of Sales.  If Enron decides to net share settle and issues
shares to the counterparty,
those are obviously restricted securities that cannot be sold by the
counterparty in the absence of a
registration statement.  But what about the resales by the issuer when it
unwinds its hedge that it
has put on by buying shares in the open market?  Are those sales
attributable
to the issuer so
therefore required to be registered?  I have seen lots of counterparties,
based on advice of their
law firms, take different positions on this:

a)  Some counterparties say that they want registration rights covering
resales of shares
purchased in the open market to hedge a derivative with the issuer.  If the
economics of
the derivative are determined based on the net proceeds from the sales, it=
=01,s

a more
difficult case because the issuer itself is realizing benefits and
detriments
from the sales.
b)  Some counterparties say they want registration rights covering resales
of
shares
purchased in the open market to hedge a derivative with the issuer only if
there is a
strong correlation at the onset of the contract between the terms of the
derivative and the
hedge.  It it=01,s a total return swap, for example, there will be a 1:1
correspondence (i.e.
the economics will tell you that the counterparty will buy 100% of the
shares
covered by
the swap immediately upon entering into the swap); but if it=01,s something
like
a collar
with divergent strike prices and involves dynamic hedging where it=01,s not
clear whether
and to what extent the counterparty will make purchases or sales in the ope=
n

market,
then it=01,s not as easy to attribute the counterparty=01,s actions to the =
issuer.

 In those cases
these counterparties look at the correlation and if it=01,s not that great =
they

don=01,t ask for
registration rights.
c)  Some counterparties say they don=01,t want registration rights for resa=
les
of stock
purchased in the open market to hedge their position.

Credit Suisse First Boston falls in category c) with respect to the May 200=
0

confirmation you sent
me. Even though there is a strong correlation between the deal and the hedg=
e

( i.e. even though
in that case they will no doubt immediately purchase 100% of the shares
covered by the
transaction) they are only asking for registration rights with respect to
the
shares that are
delivered by Enron on net share settlement.

4)  Commodities Laws.  Under the commodities laws there are some risks in
doing equity swaps in
that one has to rely on the swaps policy statement rather than the swaps
exemption, but those
risks are probably minimal enough that Enron is willing to take them.  (The
swaps exemption
does not cover equity swaps.)  With respect to equity options, they are
outside the CFTC=01,s
jurisdiction altogether.  Forward contracts present the most difficult
issues
in that there is a lot of
case law and CFTC lore about the distinction between forwards and futures,
and a key distinction
is that forwards are physical delivery contracts that bind the parties to
make and take delivery.
State bucket shop laws outlaw contracts that purport to be contracts for
sale
of a security that are
to be settled based on market price quotations.  So I would counsel Enron
not
to enter into any
forward contract that has a cash settlement alternative.  Although one can
argue that net share
settlement has the same defects, I don=01,t feel as strongly about that bec=
ause

you could get to where
you want to get by physically delivering the  shares and issuing  new share=
s

in payment; the
theory is that you actually delivered shares and just netted them out; that
is not quite as bad as
flying in the face of the case law and CFTC lore on net cash settlement.

The Bear Stearns Confirmation and Cancellation.  I really don=01,t have any
comments on this; I think the
cancellation was effective to cancel the parties obligations.  The
confirmation did not present any
registration issues.  I guess I would say that if you do something precisel=
y

like this you might get them to
agree to make any hedge purchases pursuant to Rule 10b-18, but that=01,s it=
.

The Credit Suisse First Boston Confirmation.  This is an extremely well
written document.  For the
reasons discussed above, I would counsel against entering into this kind of
transaction with the cash
settlement feature, in light of the risk that it could be characterized as
an
illegal, unenforceable futures
contract.  A few other comments: They say automatic early termination
applies, but I think that is a really
bad idea.  Enron had an agreement with a counterparty that took bankruptcy
and Enron did not find out
about it until a few days later, after the market had moved; since Enron di=
d

not know of the termination it
did not unwind its hedge, yet the ISDA said that the amounts payable on
termination would depend on the
termination date pricing.  So Enron took a loss.  You ought to always have
within your control the right to
terminate.  This is especially true of U.S. parties, but I would think the
same would apply to foreign
parties unless there is something peculiar about the law of the jurisdictio=
n

you are dealing with.

Both Confirmations  Both confirmations have language that says that if the
parties have not entered into
an ISDA Master then the counterparties=01, standard form controls.  I think=
 it
is not a good idea to agree to
such language because you are agreeing to something you know nothing about.

Additional Comment.  I think that whenever a counterparty requests
registration rights Rex should be
involved.  I think the CSFB confirmation=01,s provisions relating to
registration are fine, and of course they
can=01,t force us to register because the choice of net share settling is
purely
our choice.  Nevertheless, I
think that Rex needs to be involved so you and Rex need to get this point
across to the business people that
they shouldn=01,t just sign a confirmation and then send it to you and ask =
if
it
is ok.

But my bottom line is the only change I would make would be eliminating the
net cash settlement feature
in the CSFB confirmation.

Thanks,

Just a follow-up to our conversation of last week to see how you were coming 
along.  When would you like to schedule some time to discuss the ISDA?  
Please let me know if you have any questions and/or whether I can assist you 
in any way.  I understand that our respective traders are discussing a 
transaction.  You may contact me at 713/853-5620 or e-mail.  Thanks.  Sara

I will be on vacation from October 6- 13.  Also, the ENA lawyers will be 
offsite October 5 and 6.
Should you need assistance during my absence, please contact my assistant 
Kaye Ellis at Ext. 35968 who will direct you to a lawyer.
Thanks.  Sara

All:  I will be on vacation until October 16, 2000.  Because I am handling a 
large number of brokerage agreements and electronic trading platforms (for 
ENA and ECT Investments, Inc.), I have asked Jason Peters with Andrews and 
Kurth (713-220-4124) to assist me.  Some of the agreements are for John 
Greene who is currently in London and those agreements may reference English 
law and the Financial Services Acts.  I have given Jason your names IN CASE 
he has any questions.  Thanks for your help.  Sara

Muni's and other public entities (state, local and federal) are the type of 
counterparties for which we require legal opinions and the whole ball of wax, 
so to speak, including background documentation, resolutions, etc.  If we 
cannot prove authority to transact, then the agreement may not be enforceable 
(i.e., if the counterparty owes us money, we may not be able to collect).  We 
definitely need to review certified copies of  the counterparty's charter, 
enabling statutes or legislation creating or authorizing the counterparty, 
its bylaws, charter or constituent docs, investment policies, guidelines or 
restrictions, resolution approving the swap (or other) transactions and 
authorizing a person(s) to transact,etc AND a legal opinion (the format of 
which we always provide to the counterparty).    It's best to execute the 
ISDA but we do have an omnibus drafted for municipalities.  Call if you need 
further help.  Sara

   

Sara:

2 power swaps were done on 11/10/99 with this entity that is a municipality.  

Buying a swap.  30,800MW at a price of $20.00.  7/1/00-9/30/00.  Deal number 
261960.2
Selling a swap.  30,800MW.  4/1/00-6/30/00.  Deal number 261960.3

I want to check this deal with you to see if this entity is allowed to enter 
into financial swaps.
Please let me know if you need any further information.

Regards,

Pat

I spoke with Marsha Greenblatt (Sempra's trading lawyer).  She was unaware of 
any issues with Sempra's dealing with ECTRIC but recognized that (i) this is 
a credit decision and (ii) trading with ECTRIC has occurred.  Sempra does 
have a London trading operation so maybe the London traders for both of our 
respective companies have been transacting.  Of course, all confirms she 
reviewed were with ECT/Sempra (except for one or two ECTRIC confirms).

Based upon our recent ECT/ECTRIC internal conversation, I don't anticipate 
further confusion.  Thanks for everyone's attention to this matter.  Sara 

I thought we sent it but I'll have Marie Heard email a copy right away.  SS

Sara,

Here is my first draft.

Per our conversation.  Sara

Sara, I am attaching some examples of Conditional deals that we have done 
recently. Let me know if you need anymore or have any questions.

The Dial Draft that we discussed Dale has reviewed and revised and forwarded 
a copy to you. I do know that commercial would like to get the Dial Draft out 
today. Please give me a call if you have any questions, I would be more than 
happy to go over it with you.

Thank you,

Jarrod

Yes, I'll get to it today.  I've already spoken with Jared.  SS

   
	
	

Sara,

Dial's Treasurer is scheduled to meet with their CEO on Tuesday to receive 
approval for this deal (not a guarantee but he indicated he wants to finalize 
by Thanksgiving).  If possible, I would like to send him the draft confirm 
today.

I know you are busy.  Please call me at 30418 if you this will be a problem.  
Thanks.

Ed Quinn

Please!  Sara

Can you please give Sara the NYMEX numbers to review while Mark and I are 
out.  Thanks!

Hi Christian!  I wanted to ask you a few questions about the occurrence of 
negative pricing on the west desk.  I'm getting a differenct response on the 
east desk.  Although my interest is financial trading, you may have 
experieced this issue on the physical side (Jeff Hodge has not).  In the past 
on the west desk financial trading, any prices which are negative are deemed 
to be "0" (so an average of hourly prices could include some zeroes).  The 
east desk wants to add in the negative numbers.  Please call me to discuss.  
I'd really appreciate it.  Sara

Can you recall if the trades (west desk) were swaps or puts?  SS

ps  I'm still trying to resolve

ADDENDUM:  I received a phone call from the Sempra lawyer this afternoon.  
She said that Sempra has no problems trading with ECTRIC.

no

   
	
	

Is this something you know anything about?

Michael Brown suggested I contact you on this.  I am SFA registered in the 
UK.  Can that be transferred to the US as a series 7 broker registration or 
something else similar??  I would appreciate your thoughts and help on this.

Thanks

Marie:  Wisconsin's lawyer is out of the office until Nov. 29.  Would you 
please follow up with respect to the ISDA which we sent to him on Nov. 5?  I

Hello AFAC and Marcelo:  Attached is a recent "short list" of possible 
products which our traders may be interested in trading in the near future.  
The list was created by Bruce Harris who resides in Houston but travels 
frequently to Brazil.  Bruce will join us by telephone next week.  
My goal is to discuss in depth the memo which you created on October 19, 
further research (specifically a memo regarding OTC swaps!) and Bruce's 
list.  Lynn Aven (tax) and Brent Hendry (legal in Argentina) will be present, 
as will Andrea Bertone.  We will conference in Bruce and possibly others from 
Houston.  This will be my last message from Houston as Enron will be closed 
later today for the Thanksgiving holiday and will reopen on Monday, November 
29.  I'll be in our Sao Paulo office that day.  I'm looking forward to our 
meeting on Tuesday, November 30 at 2 pm.  See you both soon.  Regards.  Sara

I am not aware of any products that need to be identified prior to 12/31/99.  
Going forward into next year, the following products might be of interest for 
trading.  Our current plan for managing risk is via offshore products through 
Gary's group due to tax and regulatory reasons.

1. Brazil corporate eurobonds
2. Brazil Brady bonds
3. Other country corporate and/or Brady bonds (ie, can a Brazil limitada own 
an Argentine eurobond?)
4. Bovespa index futures
5. R$ currency futures
6. Local Treasury bills (both US$ indexed and R$ rate) such as BBCs, LBCs, 
LTNs, NTNs, NBCs, etc
7. R$ currency forwards
8. Rules/regulations/tax effects on individual stock trades
9. Local company commercial paper (typically trades at 105% to 110% multiple 
to the overnight rate depending on credit).

As discussed, it would be interesting to see what the tax effects are on each 
type of investment, what margin is required, and what offshore alternatives 
are available for items #4-8 (the first 3 are bringing offshore items into 
Brazil, which we might do if there was a tax benefit that could be obtained).

Thanks,  Bruce

Before my next meeting with the Tozzini lawyers this month, I would like to 
create a list of SPECIFIC products for managing Enron's Brazilian risk.  
Bruce Harris is creating a list which he will forward to you shortly.  Please 
review this list, comment and identify any products required for trading 
prior to December 31, 1999.  Please let me hear from you if you would like to 
discuss any issues in particular.  Thanks.  Sara

Re NY Elec & Gas Corp.   - Sara is waiting to hear from them re: threshold.   
She last spoke to them on 5/13/99.

Carol:  Edward and I spoke with this counterparty on Wednesday (see Lotus 
Notes entry).  Edward is pushing this deal for closure next week.  Tanya 
knows the credit issues (A2 short term S&P commercial paper rating is 
unacceptable so CP has a MAC).  We expect their outside counsel to have some 
comments which we haven't yet seen.  Guaranty issues (cap amount, demand 
delay).  Nothing has been scheduled formally but I am sure that Edward will 
call you for assistance on Tuesday (he is out of town on Monday).  Marie has 
the file and is sending CP the 1991 and 1993 definitions.  Our discussion 
today was general.  Thanks for your help.  Sara

It is my understanding that as per Sara's comments on our conference call 
that his type of CA  will be handled by our physical folks.As you can recall 
Sara said there were certain issues that made it preferable to handle this 
type of CA through our physical leagal team.
 I spoke with Debra on Tuesday with respect to this issue. She assured me 
that the legal team was working as fast and as hard as they can to resolve 
the issue. I will follow up with Debra on Monday, (which is when I believe a 
document will be available).

The legal entity is Euromark Design's, Inc. (d/b/a Crate & Barrel). My 
understanding is it is a two year trade for less than 5000 tpy each year. I 
have agreed to confirm this trade on an Omnibus form without a credit annex 
(standard Annex A only required).  The only issue is that the financial 
statements are in the name of both Euromarket Designs, Inc. and Euromarket 
Designs, Inc. II. We will need legal to address how me get both names on the 
confirm.  We can talk about it on Monday.  Hope you had a good holiday.

Could you please prepare a credit review for Mountainview Power Company LLC?  
They are a subsidiary of Thermo Ecotek.  Thermo Ecotek is 50% owned by Thermo 
Electron.  Thermo Ecotek is publicly traded.  I hope you can find enough data 
to do a review.  Please forward credit erms to Sara Shackleton for ISDA 
preparation.  This is for a different power plant than the deal you looked at 
for me with Thermo Ecotek.a second deal.  Also, for that deal, it looks like 
they want to use Thermo Ecotek, and not Thermo Electron, as the 
counterparty.  Unlike the Mountainview deal, there will be no LP subsidiary 
for this deal. Is this OK?  Can Thermo Ecotek support both?

I will call on Monday to discuss.

Sara - Leica is doing extremely well. She will be 11 at the end of this month
and is still as frisky and active as she was 10 years ago. I suppose sooner
or later she will mimic her owner and slow down! I trust Chloe and her
sibling are doing wel also.   I still own my condo in New Orleans but lease
it to the world's best tenant- a fagotski eye surgeon who pays a lot of rent
and is only there about 10 days a month.When I go down in Dec. (I'll be there
from Dec. 7 to the 27th-will you be there?) , I am planning on staying at the
Avenue Plaza on St. Charles. I'll have plenty of room if you'd like to  join
me.
      I still have Corky's in N.O. which is run by Alan Diamond. We are going
to the Beau Rivage Resort at Biloxi on Dec. 6 for our manager's party. Want
to join me? Am I invited on your family's annual Xmas trip?  Where are we
going? How is your family?
 My mother continues to do well. Bev is in Memphis with a boyfriend and Helen
is in Pensacola and a little more stable these days.
      Mr. Casey and I now have 13 Wendy's in Fla. and are trying to buy/build
more. Want to go inspect them? How is work?
      How are you? Do you miss me? I miss you!     Sam

I think that Carol may have looked at this several months ago.  Isn't this 
related to the request of Jean Mhra?

   

Just a note to remind you about something we need to discuss tomorrow, 
Transco Zone 6.

Please revise now.  Thanks. SS
	
	

Sara, pursuant to my voice mail attached is a revised ISDA worksheet for 
Deseret.  In a nutshell, Deseret's collateral threshold level is now $0, and 
they will be required to post an independent LC amount of $500,000 plus the 
applicable amount tied to the $250,000 multiple.  As the MTM value associated 
with the transaction is expected to be less than $250,000, Deseret will be 
required to post a LC of $750,000 at closing.  Please make the appropriate 
changes to the documentation, and e-mail me a full set of the revised 
documents.  Also, please let me know of any of your concerns or outstanding 
issues.  Michael is in the process of firming up the final fixed price and he 
will follow-up with you accordingly.  

Thank you very much for your time and assistance throughout this process.

Prior trades already confirmed last week.  Sorry.

Well, an answer where we thought none existed.  Good result.  Can we confirm 
the trades we spoke of last week as those of ECTRIC?  Best regards.

Pat,

We have submitted a proposal to Petrobras as you will see in the termsheet 
attached.  We pay up-front R$1 million to them, and receive for 1 year (minus 
a certain amount of days) 6 MW per hour and sell them back up power, up to 10 
MW per hour, for a maximum of 37 days.  Please let us know if there is a lot 
to do to update the credit review for Petrobras.  We'll find out this week 
whether we have won this deal.  I'll keep you posted.

Feel free to call me if you have any further question.

Remi

The disappearance of a price index is a "Market Disruption Event" discussed 
in Section 7 of Annex A to the confirmation.  Unless an "Alternative Floating 
Price Source" is described in the confirmation, the Floating Price on the 
first available Trading Day (without a disruption) is utilized if the 
disruption does not exceed three Business Days; otherwise, the price is 
"determined in good faith by Company, by taking the average of two or more 
dealer quotes." 

At the moment, your confirm does not identify alternative pricing.

My comments and thoughts:

1)  CCSI has proposed that they pay the premium in installments and we have 
rejected their proposal.   They are making their case to Enron senior 
management and we not agree unless told to by the appropriate people.

2)  This is a long dated transaction so it doesn't surprise me that they are 
asking for unilateral credit provisions.  Since we expect this to be 
repurchased, I will talk to CCSI and see if they will waive this.

3)  It is not unusual to insert language to address the event that the 
referenced index no longer exists (over the next 14 years).    I assume we 
have standard language on this issue?

Catalytica hit us with extensive comments to the form of spark spread option 
confirmation appended to the Option Repurchase Agreement between ENA and CCSI 
last week in San Francisco. Sara Shackleton is negotiating directly with 
CCSI's counsel with respect to CCSI's requested comments, but there are two 
issues raised by the markup that are not strictly lawyer comments that need 
to be addressed in order to finalize the confirmation. 

One comment CCSI made was to request some type of collateral deposit if ENA's 
credit quality slipped in the future. You will recall that the spark spread 
should be  repurchased by September 30,1999, pursuant to the option 
repurchase agreement, well in advance of the 2003 effective date of the spark 
spread. Nevertheless, to make the spark spread appear arms length ( which it 
most certainly is!), in view of the theoretical effectiveness of the spark 
spread and its 2016 expiration date, CCSI decided it needed credit 
protection. 

In the course of negotiating the changes to the spark spread, we tendered to 
CCSI for its consideration a bilateral collateral deposit agreement, wherein 
each party would be required to deposit collateral if credit quality fell in 
the future. Unless ENA allows CCSI to pay the spark spread premium in 
installments, the credit protection would only apply to ENA since it is the 
only party making payments after the effective date, and if the installment 
payment request by CCSI is rejected successfully, the form will need to be 
amended to apply unilaterally to ENA ( assuming we agree to give CCSI this 
comfort).

The form of collateral deposit provision requires that we define an "Exposure 
Threshold" for ENA that triggers its obligation to provide credit support in 
the form of collateral for CCSI's benefit. Normally, the calculation of an 
appropriate amount would be done by credit. I understand from Sara, however, 
that credit is no longer involved in this deal and that perhaps Randy can 
suggest who might be the appropriate person to determine an appropriate 
"Exposure Threshold" amount for ENA in this context. Of course, if the CCSI 
premium is paid in installments, we would need to calculate an appropriate 
CCSI "Exposure Threshold" as well.

The second issue in the CCSI revisions that the lawyers do not feel 
comfortable unilaterally addressing appears in the "Gas Daily Price" 
definition under Cash Settlement Amount. Here,CCSI's counsel has suggested, 
if the measures for determining Gas Daily Price should change, that vague 
alternative measures be used to define the Gas Daily Price. I'm not sure 
whether we are comfortable with what an alternative measure may yeild, and 
may want an alternative process if the current measures disappear, or may 
have in mind more definite alternatives. Brad, it would be useful if you 
could give us some guidance on this point. 

Thanks for your assistance.

There are a few credit issues here.  I have a 9:30 am call with Cargill.  SS

__________________________________
     Dear Sara,

     The Schedule to the above-referenced Agreement has been forward to me
     for review and comment.  We look forward to completing this Agreement
     with Enron and appreciate your assistance to that end.  I have the
     following comments regarding the Schedule.  In spite of the length of
     this wire, I feel that we do not have many obstacles to bringing this
     Agreement to a mutually agreeable conclusion.

     1. Please confirm the correct legal name of the Enron entity entering
     this Agreement.  Please add a comma to Cargill's name -- Cargill,
     Incorporated.

     2. It is my understanding that we have not received financial info on
     the Enron entity involved in the Agreement.  Can you arrange to have
     those sent to my attention?  We typically establish a Threshold for
     both the entity involved in the Agreement as well as the Credit
     Support Provider.

     3. We will not be providing Quarterly Unaudited financial statements.

     Facsimile No.:  (612) 984-3900
     Telephone No.:  (612) 984-3444

     6. Part 4(h).  We prefer to retain the intent of the ISDA whenever
     possible and, therefore, please delete this clause.

     7. Part 5(b)(j).  Please use the following ISDA-recommended clause in
     place of yours:
     Non-reliance Representation.   The following  shall be added as
     Section 15:
     Relationship Between Parties.

     Each party will be deemed to represent to the other party on the date
     on which it enters into a Transaction that (absent a written agreement
     between the parties that expressly imposes affirmative obligations to
     the contrary for that Transaction):

     (i)   Non-Reliance.  It is acting for its own account, and it has made
     its own independent decisions to enter into that Transaction and as to
     whether that Transaction is appropriate or proper for it based upon
     its own judgment and upon advice from such advisers as it has deemed
     necessary.  It is not relying on any communication (written or oral)
     of the other party as investment advice or as a recommendation to
     enter into that Transaction; it being understood that information and
     explanations related to the terms and conditions of a Transaction
     shall not be considered investment advice or a recommendation to enter
     into that Transaction.  No communication (written  or oral) received
     from the other party shall be deemed to be an assurance or guarantee
     as to the expected results of that Transaction.

     (ii)  Assessment and Understanding.  It is capable of assessing the
     merits of and understanding (on its own behalf or through independent
     professional advice), and understands and accepts, the terms,
     conditions and risks of that Transaction.  It is also capable of
     assuming, and, assumes, the risks of that Transaction.

     (iii)  Status of Parties.  The other party is not acting as a
     fiduciary for or an adviser to it in respect of that Transaction.

     8. Part 5(c).  Please explain your reasoning for this request.  We
     prefer to retain the intent of the ISDA and, therefore, feel it should
     be deleted.

     9. Part 5(f).  Please add the following to this clause:
     Additionally, any such recordings may be submitted in evidence to any
     court or in any proceedings for the purpose of establishing any
     matters pertinent to the Agreement.

     10.Part 5(g).  Please use the following ISDA-recommended clause in place
     of yours:
     Set-off.   The following shall be added as Section 6(f):

     "Any amount (the "Early Termination Amount") payable to one party (the
     Payee) by the other party (the Payer) under Section 6(e), in
     circumstances where there is a Defaulting Party or one Affected Party
     in the case where a Termination Event under Section 5(b)(iv) has
     occurred, will, at the option of the party ('X') other than the
     Defaulting Party or the Affected Party (and without prior notice to the
     Defaulting Party or the Affected Party) be reduced and set-off against
     any amount(s) (the 'Other Agreement Amount') payable (whether at such
     time or in the future or upon the occurrence of a contingency) by the
     Payee to the Payer (irrespective of the currency, place of payment or
     booking office of the obligation) under any other agreement(s) between
     the Payee and the Payer or instrument(s) or undertaking(s) issued or
     executed by one party to, or in favor of, the other party (and the
     Other Agreement Amount will be discharged promptly and in all respects
     to the extent it is so set-off).  X will give notice to the other party
     of any set-off effective under this Section 6(f).

     For this purpose, either the Early Termination Amount or the Other
     Agreement Amount (or the relevant portion of such amounts) may be
     converted by the Non-defaulting Party into the currency in which the
     other is denominated at the rate of exchange at which such party would
     be able, acting in a reasonable manner, in good faith, to purchase the
     relevant amount of such currency.

     If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that
     obligation and set-off in respect of the estimate, subject to the
     relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is
     ascertained.

     Nothing in this Section 6(f) shall be effective to create a charge or
     other security interest.  This Section 6(f) shall be without prejudice
     and in addition to any right of set-off, combination of accounts, lien
     or other right to which any party is at any time otherwise).

     11.Part 6.  Please delete this Section.  We have found it to be more
     common market practice to retain the intent of the 1993 Commodity
     Derivatives Definitions without modification.

     Thank you for your attention to this Agreement, Sara, and we look
     forward to bringing it to completion in the near future.  Have a
     terrific Thanksgiving holiday!

     Best regards,
     Marty Oelmann

El Paso is a "high volume" CP with an existing ECT Master.  Marie, there is a 
9/1/99 note in Lotus Notes that the CP to email its form of Schedule. What 
have we received?  Shouldn't we be pushing this ISDA?  Can someone prepare 
credit?

This is a "high volume" counterparty.  Shouldn't we be pursuing an ISDA to 
replace the existing ECT Master?  Susan, your last entry was 3/9/99.  SS

problems that Willie runs up against.  Can you give me a call and let's 
discuss.  Thanks.  Sara

Did you understand my message?  Please give me a call.  S

The east and west power desks are creating slightly different floating price 
language for some of the power pools.  The west desk wants "negative prices" 
to be averaged in as "zeroes"; the east desk wants to average in all prices 
"positive or negative".  I'm inclined to let the traders do as they wish.  I 
can't seem to get an explanation for the difference in approach (in each 
instance ENA may take either side of the deal).  The confirm desk will have 
to pay attention to the source of the confirms to use the correct pricing 
language.  I don't know if this will create an on-line trading issue.

What do you think?  Sara

to watch the tigers (LSU!) play ball.  Sara

This is FYI only since I'll be out tomorrow.  I have never spoken with 
Bruce.  Nothing will happen tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara  
Here is the update:

1. BONY is getting a legal opinion on the ADR issuance and is in contact with 
Millenium's attorneys.

2. DKB has performed investigations on whether these ADRs must be restricted, 
DKB's view is that they should not restricted.  This is highly arcane US SEC 
law (so my summary is probably missing a lot of finer points), but my 
understanding is that DKB views the sale of the local shares as a real sale, 
with a public notice, a public underwritten auction etc,and there is nothing 
restricted about the shares.  I don't think BONY would dispute that, but I 
think their interpretation (and our legal view) is that the shares are 
restricted because they are shares that were not registered with the SEC 
under the original ADR issuance and, critically, they were sold by the 
"Issuer".   That is, BONY's view is that BNDES is the same as Millenium b/c 
they are both government entities--ie BNDES is the "Issuer".  Therefore, 
regardless of the public nature of sale of the shares (and the fact that the 
shares aren't restricted for trading locally in Brazil), the shares issued as 
ADRs would be restricted per US law.

Now, ultimately we have to go with what BONY says b/c they issue the ADRs.  
However, before we charge back to BONY and argue DKB's case, I would 
appreciate a review by Skadden back to me on whether these shares if issued 
as ADRs would be restricted.  We want unrestricted, NYSE ADRs if possible.

3. When the ADRs are issued, they will be issued to PEP, a Brazil company, 
but deposited in one of the CayCo parents of PEP custody account.  We will 
need to check Brazil law and revise our MS custody account accordingly to se 
eif we can do this.  Sara, again I will try to call tomorrow, I apologize for 
the delay.

4. The plan to move the ADRs out of Brazil is as follows. There will be no 
sale and no cash movement.  There may be a CPMF.  PEP will perform an 
"in-kind" capital reduction of the shares back to its CayCo parent.  This 
will probably require some Brazil government approvals (or may not).  If so, 
what are they and how long will they take?

5. Critically, we have been advised by Brazil legal and by US tax that the 
shares if moved in this manner will move at the ORIGINAL COST BASIS.  IE, 
there is no taxbale event for US or Brazil.  Lynn, please confirm.

6. I don't have a timetable yet, I will call BONY tomorrow for an update on 
timing.

Regards,  Bruce

12/07/99 07:14 AM
The PEP Cayco parent is the appropriate entity to serve as custodian for the 
ADR certificates.  PEP actually has two Cayman shareholders.  All the of the 
certificates can be issued to the 99% shareholder.  I will address via a 
separate message how the accounting entries need to be booked in order to 
reflect the fact that the 1% shareholders received shares in the capital 
reduction.

I spoke w/Theresa at BONY aand we have agreed on a fee of 1.5 cents per ADR.  
That works out to a fee of $231,654.00 on 15,443,600 expected ADRs.  Kent, 
who will handle the invoice from your group?  I emphasized that "time is of 
the essence".

Robert, please call me tomorrow and we can get Gareth involved to help us 
with all the issues.  Sara, I will also call you tomorrow to give you 
background.  

1. We will need to get in touch with our Brazil broker, who I assume is DKB 
(Pedro, who and at what phone number?).  

2. The broker will move our local shares to Banco Itau, the custodian bank. 

3.  BONY will issue ADR certificates to a custodian/location that we 
determine offshore (I think we would use PEP-Cayco parent, Lynn please 
confirm company).

4. I think we will use MS as custodian (assuming account contemplates holding 
physical, restricted securities--Sara, I will speak with you about this).

5. Theresa has calls in to Millenium to get "ok" and also is working to get 
legal opinion issued on issuing restricted ADRs pursuant to original ADR 
documentation (if I udnerstand the issue correctly).

6.  Once the shares are transferred, we will seek to do an "in-kind" capital 
reduction at the PEP level up to its CayCo parent and hopefully avoid any 
CPMF.  Also, we should be able to use original basis for both Brazil and US 
tax and thus no tax impact, at leats this has been indicated to us.

Yes, BONY is getting back to me today with the cost to create the ADRs.  
From  tax standpoint, Lynn has determined that if we move the shares via a 
capital reduction, there will be no Brazil or US tax (other than perhaps a 
CPMF) since we will move the shares at their original basis.  So the price 
doesn't matter too much--but I don't want to take any chances with the Brazil 
tax authorities.  Better to move the shares now when the price is pretty even 
than to move it later when the price has doubled; it would be a tempting tax 
target.

Bruce is working with Robert and Lynn trying to create "special" ADR that 
will not be listed.

Alternatively, specially if we are going to prepay Eletrobr?s' debt, we can 
always trade some portions of the shares, on the stock exchange between Ernon 
companies.  This method would take us some time to do all our position, but 
the advantage is we would be creating listed ADRs.

Bruce:  I'm out of the office tomorrow but will be back Monday.  Let's talk 
then please.  Sara

Here is the update:

1. BONY is getting a legal opinion on the ADR issuance and is in contact with 
Millenium's attorneys.

2. DKB has performed investigations on whether these ADRs must be restricted, 
DKB's view is that they should not restricted.  This is highly arcane US SEC 
law (so my summary is probably missing a lot of finer points), but my 
understanding is that DKB views the sale of the local shares as a real sale, 
with a public notice, a public underwritten auction etc,and there is nothing 
restricted about the shares.  I don't think BONY would dispute that, but I 
think their interpretation (and our legal view) is that the shares are 
restricted because they are shares that were not registered with the SEC 
under the original ADR issuance and, critically, they were sold by the 
"Issuer".   That is, BONY's view is that BNDES is the same as Millenium b/c 
they are both government entities--ie BNDES is the "Issuer".  Therefore, 
regardless of the public nature of sale of the shares (and the fact that the 
shares aren't restricted for trading locally in Brazil), the shares issued as 
ADRs would be restricted per US law.

Now, ultimately we have to go with what BONY says b/c they issue the ADRs.  
However, before we charge back to BONY and argue DKB's case, I would 
appreciate a review by Skadden back to me on whether these shares if issued 
as ADRs would be restricted.  We want unrestricted, NYSE ADRs if possible.

3. When the ADRs are issued, they will be issued to PEP, a Brazil company, 
but deposited in one of the CayCo parents of PEP custody account.  We will 
need to check Brazil law and revise our MS custody account accordingly to se 
eif we can do this.  Sara, again I will try to call tomorrow, I apologize for 
the delay.

4. The plan to move the ADRs out of Brazil is as follows. There will be no 
sale and no cash movement.  There may be a CPMF.  PEP will perform an 
"in-kind" capital reduction of the shares back to its CayCo parent.  This 
will probably require some Brazil government approvals (or may not).  If so, 
what are they and how long will they take?

5. Critically, we have been advised by Brazil legal and by US tax that the 
shares if moved in this manner will move at the ORIGINAL COST BASIS.  IE, 
there is no taxbale event for US or Brazil.  Lynn, please confirm.

6. I don't have a timetable yet, I will call BONY tomorrow for an update on 
timing.

Regards,  Bruce

Lynn Aven

The PEP Cayco parent is the appropriate entity to serve as custodian for the 
ADR certificates.  PEP actually has two Cayman shareholders.  All the of the 
certificates can be issued to the 99% shareholder.  I will address via a 
separate message how the accounting entries need to be booked in order to 
reflect the fact that the 1% shareholders received shares in the capital 
reduction.

I spoke w/Theresa at BONY aand we have agreed on a fee of 1.5 cents per ADR.  
That works out to a fee of $231,654.00 on 15,443,600 expected ADRs.  Kent, 
who will handle the invoice from your group?  I emphasized that "time is of 
the essence".

Robert, please call me tomorrow and we can get Gareth involved to help us 
with all the issues.  Sara, I will also call you tomorrow to give you 
background.  

1. We will need to get in touch with our Brazil broker, who I assume is DKB 
(Pedro, who and at what phone number?).  

2. The broker will move our local shares to Banco Itau, the custodian bank. 

3.  BONY will issue ADR certificates to a custodian/location that we

Doug:  Per our conversation, will you please forward to me and Sami a copy of 
the recent tolling agreement?  Thanks.  Sara

Mark and I met with Mark Haedicke regarding utilities and the need for a 
legal opinion from the utility counterparty.  We have agreed with Mark as 
follows:

1.  Our negotiations with investor owned utilities should be based upon our 
standard ISDA Schedule (ISDA Multicurrency Agreement) AND including the 
"Additional Termination Event".  Neither party should be required to provide 
a legal opinion.

2.  Investor owned utilites will be approved for online trading from a legal 
viewpoint.  The extra "Additional Termination Event" paragraph is not 
currently included in the GTC's but COULD be incorporated if there is a 
revision to the online agreement.

3.  Our position with respect to municipals/municipal owned utilities, 
federal/state/local owned utilities and cooperatives remains unchanged.  We 
should still utilize and update the "municipal ISDA" form, and, require a 
legal opinion from the counterparty.  In that regard, Susan Flynn has been 
working on an "omnibus" format for an electric co-op (Deseret Generation and 
Transmission Co-operative), an earlier version of which could be used as a 
template for a municipal omnibus confirmation.    

FYI - just in case.  SS

expected to be received tomorrow from counsel to CCSI, and I will forward 
them along as soon as they are received.If there are any other comments or 
questions about the documents please let me know. I'm in all day Friday and

Thanks for passing along the below address to me.  The tour guide was very 
nice, but a bit inexperienced and certainly not with a luxury car.  It was 
good for a do it yourself tour if you already have an idea of what you want 
to see.  It actually confirmed for me that, unless you really stay to become 
involved with the people, Sao Paulo is a fairly shallow city historically and 
socially.  I hear, however, that there are many interesting colonial cities 
in Minas Gerais, and Rio is only a 45 minute flight away.

Hope all is well.

 I spoke with John Nassos.  He said that the company just hired a

previosly circulated.

The amendments reflect:

1.  The relevant provisions of the August Citibank Revolver

2.  The fact that Enron Corp. is now the direct swap counterparty.

simplified payment provision is now generally being used in the swap confirm 
(see Section 2)

Please call with any questions or comments.

I think that this transaction is called "Project Moosehead".  I have a 
meeting on it this morning.  Please comment to the draft I sent to you 
yesterday.  I don't know if the structure works.  I couldn't decide upon the 
format; it also looks like a cap.  Thanks.  SS

RECAP:  This is Project Moosehead.  After the meeting, we determined that the 
transaction should be structured as a cap and not a swaption.  The Fixed 
Price is the premium.  The Strike is the Cap Price (remember, strikes are for 
options and strikes are cap/floor in those deals).  We'll need to revise 
today to send in the morning.  CP is "Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.".  
Enron party normally is ENA but we may change to EPMI and create a new ISDA 
Master for the deal.  There must be a zero floor (ie, no negative payments in 
the other direction).  Don't worry about weekend quotes yet because we may 
eliminate weekends and extend the term of the deal. 

Could you begin revising?  Also, do the calculations work?  Please feel free 
to call me as I'm buried in my office today and things change as the day goes 
on.  SS
	
	

Sara,

If it's a Cap, is the Fixed Price then the Strike Price?  I think the format 
looks good.  I would prefer a "Notice of Exercise" provision, but it's not 
necessary.

counsel, can coordinate any further revisions.

Sara, 

As way of background, ENA faxed a revised draft of the proposed ISDA Master 
Agreement to EDEN on December 8th.  EDEN apparently still does not want to 
render an opinion of "outside counsel".  Following-up on the messages from 
Rodolfo Freyre and Jeff Kabel, have you spoken to either Jeff or Rolo 
regarding EDEN's not wanting to sign an opinion of "outside counsel" in 
connection with the ISDA Master Agreement.  Has a decision been made with 
regard to ENA's position on such matter?   

As for Jeff's quiry, ENA does not have an executed ISDA Master Agreement with 
AES Corp.

Let me know if I can be of assistance.   Thanks.

Marie,
I have been talking with Sara concerning Deseret and she indicated that I 
should contact you if I need short term follow-up on this agreement.  
Currently, Phil Tice and David Taylor are in final discussions concerning 
certain language within the Annex of this agreement.  Pending resolution of 
these issues, I will need to have the confirmation letter to this agreement 
modified prior to sending to Deseret.  The current language references a 
price of $33.75 per MWh.  This should be replaced with $34.00 in every case.

Please let me know if you have questions.  When Phil and David have come to 
final agreement, we will need to e-mail a final copy of the agreement to 
Deseret for initial signiture.  We can then follow-up with a Fed Ex copy for 
signitures?  Let me know if this is the normal procedure.  We have a deal 
pending that I would like to close today if possible.

The Schedule calls for the exchange of Tax Certificates, being IRS Form 1001 
(your latest revision).

Please see the attached - can you tell me what this certificate is?

 Except for the mystery regarding a Tax Certificate which Sarah Shackleton
indicates she needs for closing and about which I know nothing, I have
completed by tax review of this round of documents on Project Ghost and
have nothing to add.

This is the deal that Susan F.  worked on on Friday.  I'll forward the 
Schedule to you.  No one is asking for a revised Schedule yet but we should 
make the change and email  the parties on Susan's email so that everyone 
knows the latest changes and then ask if anyone has comments.  ss

In follow up to our conversation earlier today, please take out the Threshold 
Amount applying to the parties of the ISDA.  This would result in the 
Threshold Amount to only be tied to the Credit Support Providers.  This 
provision will then be parallel with the physical contract.

Yes, the deal is currently being negotiated (by Rodney).  I haven't heard any

Dow Industrials               -113.16     -1.01%   11144.27

The Nasdaq surged to another record high while the Dow pulled back from
early gains in moderate trading volume.

Investor focus shifted to Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market
Committee, which is the Fed's interest rate policy-making body.
Although few market watchers expect the Fed to raise rates at the
meeting given uneasiness over the Year 2000 issue, speculation has
grown that the Fed may change its "bias" or predisposition towards
future interest rate hikes.

General Electric (NYSE:GE) shares rose 1 13/16 (+1.19%) to 153 11/16 on
continuing momentum from the company's announcement on Friday of a 3-
for-1 stock split, a 17% increase in its quarterly dividend to 41 cents
per share, and an expansion of its share repurchase program,

In addition to the GE stock split announced on Friday, several
prominent companies announced splits last week and today, including
Oracle Corp. (Nasdaq:ORCL) 2-for-1, Red Hat (Nasdaq:RHAT) 2-for-1,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. (NYSE:MWD) 2-for-1, Check Point
Software (Nasdaq:CHKP) 2-for-1, Novellus Systems (Nasdaq:NVLS) 3-for-1,
and CMGI (Nasdaq:CMGI).  Novellus Systems shareholders were excited
today--the stock closed up 33.36% (up 28 18/32) to 113 9/16!
Our Smart!Splits Report forecasted the GE, Oracle, and CMGI splits.

Merger mania hit the drug sector again today with news that drug giant
Pharmacia & Upjohn (NYSE:PNU) and life sciences company Monsanto
(NYSE:MTC) will combine in a "merger of equals" transaction.  Investors
in both companies reacted negatively to the news, as shares of Monsanto
closed down 5 1/8 (-12.28%) to 36 5/8 and shares of Pharmacia & Upjohn
closed down 3 1/8 (-6.22%) at 47 1/8.  Monsanto shareholders were
particularly disappointed because they have been pushing for an
acquisition involving Monsanto, or at least its agribusiness division,
for some time, but given the merger of equals nature of this
transaction, they will not receive a significant premium for their
shares.  Other drug stocks ended mixed, with Merck (NYSE:MRK) edging up
3/16 (+0.28%) to 66 3/4, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) down 7/16 (-1.32%) to 32
13/16, and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) down 3 (-3.16%) to 91 7/8.

I had a VERY long call with the two lawyers.  I would say for the most part 
that Tiger will reconsider many of our provisions now that the lawyers 
understand our position.  Big issues:  arbitration (I need an explanation in 
order to go to our general counsel)
                                          Limitiation of Liability

All else is negotiable.  SS

Enron Corp. has NOT agreed to:
1.  Credit Event Upon Merger
2.  Added Payer reps (or other tax related changes)
3.  Waiver of Jury Trial

I think Barclays may back down from the Cross Default changes.
Sheryl wants to stet her changes to "Automatic Early Termination."
Sheryl does need to see the other Ghost template changes.

Call if you have any questions.  713-853-5620

With respect to Part 2, Tax Reps and Part 5(l) deletion, the Enron Corp. tax 
group is fine with the changes (although these are not necessary).  Also, 
Enron will deliver forms as Barclays wishes.  Let me know if you have any 
questions. Sara

Attached is the latest draft of the "Daily Call Option" confirmation between 
EPMI and Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc.  This is the same draft that 
Rodney received on Friday, Dec. 17.

 - Christ7.exe

1.  The Enron company is "ENA"
   2.  How many Calculation Periods will there be?  December is a short month 
if the Transaction begins on 12/25/99.  Will the first payment be due  in 
early January?  If you intend three (3) payments to be made, then the Calc. 
Periods are from 12/25-12/31, January, 2/1-2/22.
   3.  Is this a 24-hour index or is it limited to peak hours as defined by 
CAMMESA? 

I left a message for Joe Hunter (confirmation desk - Ext. 33316) to be 
prepared for this Transaction.

Brent:  would you please verify the Floating Price?

Thanks.

Scott,
The attached file includes the general terms of an indicative swap price for 
CMS.
As soon as you are available tomorrow morning, Dec 22nd, let me know and we 
will call CMS here in BA.

Sara: pls. take a look at the following file and add any comments you think 
necessary.

Thank you very much

Julian

Just to be certain that the EES entity that might enter into the swap is 
eligible, you should verify that it (1) has total assets in excess of $10 
million or (2) has a net worth of $1 million and enters into the swap 
agreement in connection with the conduct of its business or to manage the 
risk of an asset or liability owned or incurred in the conduct of its 
business or reasonably likely to be owned or incurred in the conduct of its 
business.

January.  Please review and advise if you have any revisions.  

Thank you.

Since the Master is drafted for ECT/TBS, what does your message mean in terms 
of moving the ISDA, guaranty and side letter along?  As I mentioned to Ted, 
what EI or an EI project company does outside of the ECT swap is not 
something that I can track.  Thanks.  SS

we can expect their opinion of counsel.  I will also explain this to Ana=20

Automatic Termination Provision:

If the legal opinion required to be delivered by Counterparty pursuant to 
Part 3 of the Schedule to the Agreement is not delivered to ENA by December 
29, 1999, then this Transaction shall automatically terminate on December 29,

I'm not sure who needs the information in the attached.  Please make sure it 
gets to the right person.

Once Enron has its account(s) set up, please have them fax funding 
instructions to David Barton at (212) 412-5306, as George will not be in at 
the beginning of next week.

Thanks,

I did speak with Ana Soria.  Her only concern was the legal opinion.  I faxed 
her the format for the legal opinion and attached a cover sheet which 
indicated that ENA must receive the executed opinion by the close of business 
on December 29.  I've attached a copy of the fax cover sheet.  Also, Joe 
Hunter has added the "Automatic Termination" provision into the 
confirmation.  Have a happy holiday.  Sara

Dear Sara:

Further to our meeting of November 30, 1999, please be advised that the 
Central Bank of Brazil and the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission 
are preparing certain new regulations in connection with foreign investments 
in Brazil.

Since it seems that such new regulations may materially change the chart 
discussed during our last meeting, we have not amended the chart yet aiming 
to conclude it after the new regulations are finally released, which is 
supposed to occur early next year.

For the moment, drafts of such new regulations were released to the market 
for discussion purposes a couple of days ago, a translation into English is 
being prepared and will be faxed to your attention shortly.

Should you have any questions in respect of the above matters, please do not 
hesitate to contact us.

Kind regards,

Marcelo Rodrigues

Pending execution of a master agreement, Amoco transactions continue to be 
documented under the omnibus.  Willie has brought to my attention three 
issues which continue to be raised by Amoco:

1.  Procedures for entering into Transactions: deletion of response within 2 
Business Days after receipt of confirmation and failure to respond as 
conclusive evidence of Transaction

2.  Setoff:  there doesn't seem to be an "Affliliate" issue but I'm not 
certain of their comment to setoff applicable against a "derivative amount" 
(are they attempting to prevent setoff against physical amounts owing? or 
only trying to clarify that unpaid "derivative amounts" can be setoff against 
other amounts due?)

3.  Choice of law:  change to NY

I thought you could address these issues in your negotiations and let Willie 
know how to handle.  I've left confirm in your office.  Thanks.  Sara

I should be in immediately after my 8:30 am appointment.  Sara

Attached is the most recent draft of the guidelines.  Please let me have your 
comments.  Sara

Sara:  I probably have them somewhere but if you could forward to me the 
latest guidelines, I will look at them and we can discuss.  All I remember 
looking at was a marked up copy that you had while we were in Sao Paulo.

Lynn:  Weren't you going to take a look at the Trader Guidelines for 
Argentina?  Let me know if you have any questions or if I can help you 
further.  Thanks.  SS

Happy New Year, and, did we ever do a back-to-back (RMT/Enron 
Comercializadora Argentina) deal for this transaction?  

I just received this message from Mark.  Let's talk and I can see what I can 
do.  I'm not aware of any written broker agreements used by ECT for trading 
other than those for futures and equities.  I can check on the physical 
side.  SS
I don't remember if I talked to you about this last month or not.  If not, 
would you mind giving Brent a hand with his broker agreement?  
I am working on preparing a new form of Broker Agreement for Don.  Is there a 
form that ECT has used in the past?  The version we will be drafting will 
have certain non-traditional obligations on the broker such as the obligation 
to find a seller for the buyer's consumption requirements, guarantee to 
seller the buyers payment obligations and so forth.  Do you think Vicky may 
have prepared broker agreements for EES?  If my description is too vague call
me and I can describe it in more detail.  Thanks.

Mark, we should rotate the desk (as per this email).  Shall I speak to the 
group or would you prefer to do it?  SS

Sara, 

With end of 1999 so came the end of my four (4) month rotation as the Legal 
Contact for the Confirmation Desk.  Back in August, Carol, Shari and you had 
determined that a Confirmation Desk Rotation was essential, and had therefore 
designated me to serve the September 1, 1999 - December 31, 1999 rotation.  
It was my understanding, Susan Flynn would begin her rotation commencing on 
January 1, 2000, with Marie Heard following at the expiration of Susan 
Flynn's term.

However, your recollection as to who follows me may be different.  Also, you 
want to discuss this matter with Mark since he was not in attendance at the 
August meeting.

Thanks.

Here's the original blackline.  Leave me a voice mail with the names and I'll 
revise my latest blackline today so that we can satisfy Cargil.  SS

bankruptcy, insolvency, or similar proceeding instituted by or against
the Company, this guarantee shall continue to be fully applicable to
such obligation to the same extent as though the payment so recovered
or repaid had never been originally made on such obligation.  However,
in no event shall this provision be interpreted to allow Counterparty
to recover more from the Guarantor, Company, or any combination of the

*****************************************************************

1.  Wednesday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials               +124.72     +1.13%   11122.65
S&P 500                         +2.69     +0.19%    1402.11
Nasdaq                         -24.15     -0.62%    3877.54
Internet Stock Index           -25.25     -2.95%     831.89

The Dow rebounded from yesterday's steep losses while the Nasdaq came
back late in the day after plummeting earlier on, as markets were
subject to volatile trading.

The Dow's resurgence was sparked by blue chip gains, as IBM (NYSE:IBM)
rose 3 15/16 (+3.51%) to 116, Exxon-Mobil (NYSE:XOM) moved up 4 3/16
(+5.45%) to 81, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) went higher by=20
 (+0.89%) to 56
15/16, and Merck (NYSE:MRK) rose 2 7/16 (+3.74%) to 67 11/16.

Financial stocks, still bracing for a possible raise in interest rates
by the Fed when it meets in early February, came in with mixed results,
with Citigroup (NYSE:C) gaining 7/8 (+1.76%) to 50 5/8, JP Morgan
(NYSE:JPM) rising 2 1/8 (+1.84%) to 117 1/2, while American Express
fell 3 5/8 (-2.40%) to 147 7/16, Chase Manhattan Bank (NYSE:CMB)
dropped 7/16 (-0.62%) 70 7/16, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) edged lower
3 7/8 (-4.68%) to 78 7/8.

Walt Disney's (NYSE:DIS) continued difficulties resulted in no 1999
bonus for company Chairman Michael Eisner.  The owner and operator of
the ABC and ESPN television networks and various theme parks struggled
in 1999 with slumping sales for consumer products and lower product
licensing revenues.  Shares of the world's second-largest entertainment
company and Dow component rose 1 5/16 (+4.15%) to 32 15/16.

In a sign of a continued strong economy as we move into the New Year,
the Commerce Department reported that orders for U.S. manufacturing
goods rose 1.2% in November, which came in above the 0.9% forecast by
economists and represented the first rise since the 1.3% gain in
August.  The manufacturing sector has been emerging steadily from its
slump during 1997 and 1998, which was caused by weakness in Asia and
other foreign economies.

Shares of leading Internet retailer Amazon.com (Nasdaq:AMZN) slipped
14.87% (down 12 3/16) to 69 3/4 and led Internet stocks lower on the
day.  Amazon.com (Nasdaq:AMZN) reported that its fourth-quarter sales
jumped over 150% from the year-earlier period, but shares of the
Internet retailer dropped as the company warned that its losses for the
quarter would not be reduced despite the sales boost.  While Amazon's
fourth-quarter sales of over $650 million exceeded the $610 million in
sales that the company posted for all of 1998, investors were
disappointed to learn that the Amazon's losses would not decline as a
result.

Ebay (Nasdaq:EBAY) rallied to close up 8 9/16 (+6.69%) to 136 9/16,
while investor disappointment spilled over to other Internet stocks, as
barnesandnoble.com (Nasdaq:BNBN) dropped 5/16 (-2.16%) to 14 3/16, and
CMGI (Nasdaq:CMGI) fell 10 3/4 (-3.66%) to 14 3/16.

In other Internet news, Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO) announced an extension of
its agreement with RealNetworks (Nasdaq:RNWK) under which Yahoo! can
utilize the latest version of RealNetworks' streaming software, which
enables the creation and delivery of audio, video and other media
content over the Internet.  Shares of Yahoo! fell 32 1/2 (-7.34%) to
410 1/2, while shares of RealNetworks gained 11/16 (+0.59%) to 118 1/8.

America Online (NYSE:AOL) shares fell 2 (-2.60%) to 75 despite
announcements by the Internet giant that it reached agreements with
Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HWP) and Compaq (NYSE:CPQ) to allow AOL members
to access, send and receive their e-mail via HP and Compaq palm size
PCs, including the HP Jornada and Compaq Aero.  Hewlett-Packard shares
edged lower 11/16 (-0.63%) to 107 7/8 and Compaq shares slipped 3/8 (-
1.29%) to 28 5/8.

In other computer-related news, Compaq said it will launch a new line
of personal computers, called Presario EZ2000, that are slick looking
and have easy-to-use features, including 1-touch Internet access.  The
move comes roughly one month after its lead competitor, Dell Computer
(Nasdaq:DELL), introduced a similar line of stylish and user-friendly
computers.  Computer manufacturers are trying to catch up to Apple
Computer (Nasdaq:AAPL), which has led the way with its introduction of
cutting-edge computers.  Separately, Apple shares closed up 1 1/2
(+1.46%) to 104 on news that company founder and interim CEO Steve Jobs
will now become the permanent CEO and on news that Apple will invest
$200 million in EarthLink Network (Nasdaq:ELNK), which will become the
Internet service provider (ISP) for Apple's Macintosh computers.

After the markets closed today, Gateway (NYSE:GTW) issued a profit
warning saying it expects to report earnings 7 cents below estimates
due to lower revenues resulting from weaker processor supply issues and
a sales slowdown due to Year 2000 concerns.  Beyond.com (Nasdaq:BYND)
also announced after the markets closed that fourth quarter revenues
will come in below expectations and that the company will post a loss
between 65 cents and 68 cents per share.  Shares of Gateway closed down
5 15/16 (-9.42%) to 57 1/16, while shares of Beyond.com edged lower
11/32 (-4.37%) to 7 17/32.

MicroStrategy (Nasdaq:MSTR) moved higher by 12=20
 (+6.38%) to 208 1/2
after generating some positive momentum from its 2-for-1 stock split
announcement on January 4.  The record date for the split is January 20
and the new shares will be issued on January 26, 1999.  The most recent
issue of the Smart!Splits Report forecasted the MicroStrategy split.

1.  Friday's Market Action

                        $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Jones Industrials     +269.30     +2.39%   11522.56
S&P 500                    +32.43     +2.31%    1435.88
Nasdaq                    +155.39     +4.17%    3882.52
Internet Stock Index       +52.41     +6.76%     827.88

The Dow climbed to another record high while the Nasdaq racked up its
biggest point gain ever to rebound at the end of a week characterized
by extreme volatility.

Lucent Technologies (NYSE:LU) sparked today's Nasdaq rally and
simultaneously made history, becoming the most heavily traded stock in
a single session ever on the NYSE.  Shares of Lucent gained 1 3/4
(+3.37%) from Thursday's after-hours plunge following the warning
issued by the company after Thursday's markets closed that profits for
the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker would not meet
analyst expectations.  The announcement by Lucent, which was considered
a company-specific issue, propelled the stocks of its rivals in the
competitive telecommunications equipment market.  Shares of Nortel
Networks (NYSE:NT), a leading global supplier of telephone network
services, jumped 26.30% (up 20 1/4) to 97 1/4, while shares of
networking leader Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO) closed up 5 7/8 (+5.88%)
to 105 7/8.  Other telecom equipment stocks also advanced, with JDS
Uniphase (Nasdaq:JDSU) jumping 20.16% (up 30 1/16) to 179 15/16 , Ciena
Corp. (Nasdaq:CIEN) closing up 25.89% (up 11 7/8) to 57 3/4, and
Tellabs (Nasdaq:TLAB) rising 2 1/4 (+3.53%) to 66 1/16.

Today's market rebounds were bolstered by positive economic news, as
the Labor Department reported that the December jobless rate held firm
at 4.1% and that December's growth of U.S. jobs outside the farm sector
was the largest in five months.  While the announcement was a sign of
the continued strong economy, it also set the stage for increased fear
among investors that the Fed will raise interest rates when it meets in
early February.  The Fed has indicated that it is closely monitoring
the job market as it considers whether to raise interest rates in an
effort to cool the booming economy.

Contributing to today's market gains was a resurgent drug sector, with
Dow component Merck (NYSE:MRK) up 6 9/16 (+9.60%) to 74 15/16, Eli
Lilly (NYSE:LLY) gaining 4 13/16 (+7.27%) to 71, Schering Plough
(NYSE:SGP) moving up 5 1/16 (+11.79%) to 48, and Pharmacia & Upjohn
(NYSE:PNU) rising 2 11/16 (+5.69%) to 49 15/16.

Biotechs also performed well today with Amgen (Nasdaq:AMGN) gaining 6
7/8 (+11.25%) to 68, Biogen (Nasdaq:BGEN) rising 1 7/16 (+1.92%) to 76
3/8, Genentech (NYSE:DNA) up 8 7/8 (+6.93%) to 136 7/8, Immunex
(Nasdaq:IMNX) rising 9 7/16 (+10.42%) to 100.

Wal-Mart Stores (NYSE:WMT), the world's largest retailer, announced
that it will team up with Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Accel
Partners to form an Internet company, to be called Wal-Mart.com, which
is expected to enhance the giant retailer's Web site and bring more of
its shoppers online.  The partnership is also seen as a larger sign of
the move by leading retailers worldwide to become major players in the
competitive e-tail (online retail) market.  Investors reacted favorably
to the news, anticipating a major IPO of Wal-Mart.com in the future,
which sent shares of the Dow component rose 4 13/16 (+7.56%) to 68 1/2.
Meanwhile, shares of e-tailers performed well, with Amazon.com
(Nasdaq:AMZN) rising 4 (+6.10%) to 69 9/16, barnesandnoble.com
(Nasdaq:BNBN) gaining 1 9/16 (+10.55%) to 16 3/8, and CDnow
(Nasdaq:CDNW) edging up 9/16 (+5.81%) to 10 1/4, although E-toys
(Nasdaq:ETYS) dropped 1 15/16 (-8.24%) to 21 9/16.

Other big movers on the Dow helped drive the markets upward, with
Proctor & Gamble (NYSE:PG) rising 8 5/8 (+8.00%) to 116 1/2, General
Electric (NYSE:GE) closing up 5 21/64 (+3.66%) to 151, Johnson &
Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) gaining 3 3/16 (+3.44%) to 95 3/4, Coca-Cola
(NYSE:KO) rising 3 3/4 (+6.58%) to 60 3/4, and Honeywell (NYSE:HON)
closing up 3 (+5.36%) to 59.

While telecom stocks helped drive the Nasdaq higher, telecom investors
were buzzing over the threat by Federal Communications Commission
Chairman William Kennard that regulatory action would be forthcoming if
the cable television industry and consumer electronics manufacturers
fail to resolve a standards dispute that is holding up the availability
of digital TV sets.  The parties have yet to reach an agreement over an
interface that would allow cable shows to appear on sets while
protecting the programs from being illegally copied.  Telecom stocks
came in with mixed results, as #1 U.S. long-distance carrier AT&T
(NYSE:T) rose 1 (+2.08%) to 49, Sprint Group (NYSE:FON) gained 9/16
(+0.89%) to 63 15/16, Winstar Communications (Nasdaq:WCII) closed up 1
1/2 (+2.21%) to 69 1/4, while Covad Communications (Nasdaq:COVD) fell 1
21/32 (-2.75%) to 58 1/2, Sprint PCS (Nasdaq:PCS) dropped 2 5/8 (-
2.78%) to 91 13/16.

In other telecom news, McLeodUSA (Nasdaq:MCLD), a leading provider of
local and long-distance telephone services, announced its intent to buy
Splitrock Services (Nasdaq:SPLT), the operator of a nationwide, high-
speed data network carrying over 2 billion minutes per month of
Internet traffic, for approximately $1.75 billion in stock in its
effort to expand its menu of offerings beyond voice telephone services.
Shares of McLeodUSA edged up 11/16 (+1.31%) to 53 1/4, while shares of
Splitrock jumped 21.75% (up 4 13/16) to 26 15/16.

Today's tech stock action also saw RealNetworks (Nasdaq:RNWK)
announcing its creation of an alliance with Universal Music Group, the
world's biggest recording company, which will allow consumers to use
RealNetwork's software to listen to music from Universal's wide array
of artists.  Under the agreement, Universal, a unit of Seagram Company
(NYSE:VO), will distribute RealJukebox, the digital music player
software developed by RealNetworks that lets users record and organize
songs on a computer.  Shares of RealNetworks rose 18 7/8 (+16.68%) to
132 1/16, while shares of Seagram edged lower 1/16 (-0.13%) to 48 5/8.

MicroStrategy (Nasdaq:MSTR) closed up 10 1/8 (+5.06%) to 210 3/8,
continuing its upward momentum gained from its 2-for-1 stock split
announcement on January 4.  The record date for the split is January 20
and the new shares will be issued on January 26, 1999.  The most recent
issue of the Smart!Splits Report forecasted the MicroStrategy split.

6. IPO Commentary

While the IPO market will kick into high gear in the coming weeks, it
is currently still in hibernation as only a handful of IPOs are
expected to come to market.  Insurance and investment services giant
John Hancock Financial Services (NYSE:JHF), one such upcoming IPO,
announced that is has lowered the expected price range for its proposed
IPO to $16 to $18 per share, from its $15 to $25 per share range that
the company set in mid-December.  The company expects that the IPO,
which will be underwritten by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co.
(NYSE:MWD), will net $1.65 billion and, based on an initial price of
$17 per share, John Hancock's initial market capitalization would total
about $5.64 billion.  Shares of other leading insurance and investment
services companies performed well, with American International Group
(NYSE:AIG) up 7 5/8 (+7.48%) to 109 1/2, Chubb (NYSE:CB) rising 3 1/4
(+6.07%) to 56 13/16, Aetna (NYSE:AET) gaining 3 9/16 (+6.56%) to 57
7/8, and Hartford Financial Services (NYSE:HIG) closing up 2 (+4.67%)
to 44 13/16.

Sara,
Here are the indicative terms we are looking to get three price quotes for 
from CMS.  Julian will need to get you the contact information for the 
counterparty.  We would like a letter from ENA requesting the quotes for the 
trade information specified below and an attached confirm format with the 
price, term and volumes left blank since those terms are not yet set.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions or if you need any additional 
information.  We would like to have this letter sent in the next few days and 
would like to request a response from CMS by the middle or end of next week.  
Julian can give you a more exact time frame for a response.   Please send 
Julian the draft for review and copy me.  Thanks for your help on this.  
Julian, have you spoke with Pat about the potential deal yet?

Sara,

Here is the info. on Portugese lessons.

On site lessons from Be Bilingual, 713-789-6338

45 minute lessons.  Must take 2 lessons at a time.  Total of 1 1/2 hr. 
sessions.

Individual - $38 per lesson = $56 per session
2 people -  $48 per lession = $96 per session
3 people -  $60 per lesson = $120 per session

Lesson materials cost approx. $175 per person.

Let me know if you need any additional information.

ENA has been negotiating an ISDA with Statoil.  I was advised by Chuck 
O'Brien this morning that Statoil also trades with ECTRIC and that he 
received an omnibus confirm from ECTRIC this morning.  Statoil will not sign 
the omnibus but would like to put an ISDA in place with ECTRIC and have the 
trade subject to that ISDA.  ENA should finalize its ISDA soon.  Would ECTRIC 
like to duplicate?  

Happy New Year!

Please let me know which company needs to open a brokerage account in 
connection with the CIESA transaction.  Once you tell me which company it 
should be, we can start the corporate authorization process and I will 
coordinate with Marie Heard of ENA concerning other information she'll need 
in connection with opening the account.

Please bear in mind that it will take some time (I'm not certain exactly how 
long--I will find out) to get all of the proper authorizations and other 
paper work into place, once you have decided on the company.

I do not know who should buy the shares.  Rick and Glenn, how do you want the 
shares to be purchased and where do you want them owned?  Keep in mind that 
if EPCA buys the shares and then sells them same day EDIDE (for example), we 
will I believe need to open 2 accounts.  In addition, if the shares trade 
over the exchange, I am not sure exactly how we will execute a private sale 
between those 2 companies.  It seems to me that you may want to have the 
ultimate owner actually make the purchase and then try to structure your 
cashflows to accomplish your tax goals, rather than to accomplish those goals 
by moving around the shares.  We can talk about this tomorrow but the sooner 
we have the structure in place the sooner the account(s) can be opened.  We 
will need to coordinate this structure with Corp. Treasury (Cathy Moehlmann 
and Robin Veariel).

Sara,

I hope you have now received instructions from your commercial swaps team to 
put together an ISDA  currency swap and confirm which ECT Corp will be 
providing to either Enron Europe Power 3 Limited or a subsidiary of that 
company. The subsidiary will be receiving dollars under a bond issue and 
paying pounds out (a spot transaction I believe) but will then receive pounds 
income which it will need to convert to dollars to pay interest on the bonds.

The precedent document is the Sutton Bridge currency swap.

Can you please confirm you have been instructed and let us know your timing 
for issuing a document.  The sooner we can see this next week the better.

The bond trustee will as usual require the swap to be backed with legal 
opinions from Enron in-house counsel (Mark Haedicke) re due execution and 
from V&E (Terry Yates) re enforceability. My understanding is that the swap 
will not be guaranteed by Corp (correct Julian?).

Linklaters are representing Enron - Julian Davies and Fran Xavier (tel: 171 
456 2000). Could you please send them your fax, telephone and email details. 
Linklaters have kindly agreed to prepare a first draft of the Mark Haedicke 
opinion and to send it out to you Sara.

Thank  you. I look forward to hearing from you.

     Mark

Marie is not in the office today; your direct contact should be Susan Bailey 
(X 34737).
I spoke earlier with Rick Hopkinson who indicated that the account will 
probably be for the benefit of EPCA.  
We need to verify a few details (account party, purpose, resolutions, 
authorized trader list, etc.).  Also, will the broker be Morgan?
Nancy, since you will be working on the authorizations, please keep in mind 
that Ted Murphy will limit authorized traders to the Houston equity 
traders(and perhaps Bruce) for control purposes.  I believe we had to change 
the Enron Brazil Power Holding XII Ltd. resolutions in that regard.  I'll 
verify.

Susan and I will wait to hear from one of you in Sao Paulo.  I called about 
10 minutes ago and no one was available.

I just wanted to touch base with you about efforts to keep good lines of 
communication between B.A. and Houston about trading activity in Argentina 
and Brazil (both financial and physical).  I participate in Randy's weekly 
conference calls and Brent tells me that you have now undertaken that role in 
B.A.  As you know, sometimes proposals and deals "slip through the cracks" 
and Houston is taken by surprise.  We want to remain current and proactive.   
Please feel free to leave me an email or voice mail when you learn of any 
relevant activitiy.  I , in turn, communicate directly with credit in Houston 
(Pat Cini or Rod Nelson) and tax in Houston (Lynn Aven or Rick Hopkinson or 
Michael Herman).  If you ever feel the need for a conference call, I'm always 
available and I'm sure credit and tax would be glad to join.  Also, I hold a 
weekly Friday conference call with Brent and Lynn to discuss current trading 
issues in Argentina and Brazil.  Thanks.  Sara

Julian and I only have one change.  We would like to have the full text to 
the second paragraph of the Floating Price difinition included so the 
customer sees it up front.  This is the language which I pulled from the 
Central Puerto confirm:

The parties agree that the Floating Amounts payable under this Transaction 
shall be made in US Dollars, and the rate of exchange of Argentine Pesos to 
US Dollars shall be of one (1) Argentine Peso per US Dollar as set forth 
under Law 23,928, as amended, while there is free convertibility of the 
Argentine Peso and the rate of exchange therein set forth is of one (1) 
Argentine Peso per US Dollar. Otherwise, the rate of exchange between 
Argentine Pesos and US Dollars shall be calculated using the exchange rate, 
sell, for transfers abroad established by Banco Naci?n Argentina at the 
closing of the Business Day prior to that on which payment is effected. 
Argentine Peso means the lawful currency of the Republic of Argentina.

Julian is traveling to Houston tonight and will call you tomorrow to discuss 
the sending of the document to CMS.  Thanks for your help.

Attached is a draft list of items for review.  Some of the items require 
immediate document  revisions; others require policy decisions before 
revising the documents.  Please edit and refine.  Mark suggested that we 
confer and come up with specific recommendations.  Once we create a list, 
let's try to meet on one or more occasions to discuss.  SS 

I am trying to distinguish these two types of entities both practically (what 
are we able to negotiate) and legally (what do we really need in our 
Schedule).  I am also interested in your experiences in dealing with these 
parties.

 ENA's form of "municipal" Schedule ("the ENA Schedule") was essentially 
taken from the 1992 ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule ("the ISDA 
Schedule").  In addition to other provisions, the ISDA Schedule (1) adds reps 
designed to avoid "an Orange County" type meltdown and (2) incorporates the 
concept of "Incipient Illegality" (which occurs before the Termination Event 
of  Illegality).  The "Incipient Illegality" concept is used  in Section 
2(a)(iii) (obligations) as well as the Section 3 (reps) of the ISDA 
Schedule:   the concept is added to the Section 3(b) rep ("..absence of Event 
of Default, Potential Event of Default, Incipient Illegality...), and for 
purposes of notifying the other party of its occurrence.  Interestingly 
enough, the ENA Schedule does not include the Section 3(b) rep change.  I 
think we need to add this change to ENA's Schedule.

With respect to IOUs, we need to clarify our position on "Regulatory 
Development" (which is actually a watered-down "Incipient Illegality" 
concept).  If such an event occurs, ENA should be advised of the event 
(Notice).  But, does ENA really want the ability to terminate trades at 
mid-market ("Additional Termination Event") or simply to have this event 
included as part of a Section 3(b) rep such that the occurrence of the event 
merely triggers an Event of Default at ENA's side of the curve (for breach of 
the Section 3(b) rep)? 

I have found that negotiating with IOUs for the "Notice" provision can be 
difficult.  Extracting the Additional Termination Event is tough.  Arguing 
for a Section 3(b) change may be easier (and would mirror the municipal 
format).  I think ENA really needs the ability to decide when to halt trading 
with a counterparty experiencing a Regulatory Development (which we may only 
learn about through notice from the counterparty).  Thus, I recommend that 
for IOUs, we add a notice provision and Section 3(b) rep change incorporating 
our latest definition of "Regulatory Development."  But we really have to 
negotiate for this protection.  Otherwise, why bother to include this 
additional language?

What do you think?

I have reviewed Tana's list of North American utilities and have the 
following comments:

(1)  I have tried to eliminate all governmentals and regulated entities.  
However, I suggest that we ask Kevin Leitao to take a quick review for 
obvious errors.  (However, I don't want Kevin to prepare unlimited research 
on our behalf.  I'll discuss with him).

(2)  I suggest that we ask Canadian counsel to review Canadian utilities on 
authority/regulatory issues.  In my experience, Canadian outside counsel was 
reluctant to even comment on utilities located in provinces other than 
outside counsel's domicile.

(3)  The online omnibus does not contain the ISDA Section 3(c) rep as to 
absence of litigation.  This rep drags in governmental bodies and all 
agencies (hence, a state PUC).  Thus, online parties will rep as to authority 
to transact each time they trade but we will not know about potential PUC 
issues.  (Under the ISDA, a party would have to notifiy us of a "Regulatory 
Development" and we may have an Event of Default for failure to notify; we 
may also have a Termination Event under our current format).

Would someone please provide me with an explanation of the purpose of this 
account.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara,

Ted Murphy has executed the documents relating to the opening of a brokerage 
account for EPCA @ Morgan Stanley.  Ted has asked that you send him an e:mail 
message as to the purpose of the EPCA brokerage account.

Thanks.

The financial trading group has a recurring request by our conterparties to 
add a provision addressing the admissability of trader tapes into evidence in 
court or other proceedings.  Our current language merely states:  "Each party 
consents to the recording, at any time and from time to time, by the other 
party of any and all communications between officers or empoyees of the 
parties, and waives any further notice of such recording."  Here are the 
facts and issues:

1.  Our agreements provide for arbitration (most likely) or jurisdiction in 
specific courts or are silent as to jurisdiction.

2.  ENA policy is to destroy trader tapes after 6 months.

3.  If we are doing our job, a written and signed confirmation should exist 
in our files for each and every financial transaction.  On occasion, we have 
not confirmation signed by ENA's counterparty.

By agreeing to add "admissability" language, are we waiving the parol 
evidence rule?  Do we always want the ability to introduce existing 
recordings?

Can you provide us with language acceptable to ENA that we might propose to a 
counterparty (when asked)?

Here's an example of a recent request:  "Any such recordings may be submitted 
in evidence to any court or in any proceedings for the prupose of 
extablishing any matters pertinent to the [ISDA] Agreement."

Please see attached.  Thanks.  Sara

I don't know if you have spoken with Susan Flynn about her schedule 
before/after her surgery, but I have some questions that you may have already 
addressed, such as:

Has Susan prepared a matrix reflecting the status of documentation (i.e., 
existing masters, agreements to use ENA master/terminate counterparty 
master,etc.) with the various CES counterparties?  Carol mentioned that she 
could finalize this project.

Will someone receive be checking Susan's email and voice mail and physical 
mail each day?

What efforts (if any) are ongoing with respect to PGE?

What about existing files?  Top Tens (Swiss Re)?  Any ISDA comparisons could 
be accelerated by giving directly to attorneys.

Who will prepare reports for legal/credit meeting?

Who is entering year-end deals onto Lotus Notes?  Should Susan Bailey handle 
per Carol's suggestion?

I'm sure that everyone in the group would appreciate a better understanding 
of how to handle the situation.  Thanks.  Sara

Can you email a copy of the "Loan and Security Agreement" to me at 
sshackl@enron.com?  I can then redline suggested changes to your agreement.  
Thanks.  If you need to call, I'm at (713) 853-5620.  Thanks.  Sara

I am following up with MS but I haven't received your answer.  Will advise 
when I hear back.  SS

Do you have any reason to think that Morgan Stanley would not be willing to 
hold physical Millenium securities as part of their brokerage services they 
provide for trading in the Millenium stock or do you know if Enron actually 
prefers to hold physical securities in some particular place?
Bruce Harris
01/18/2000 08:05 AM
If MS can do it thats great.  Is there any problem per MS with the parent 
CayCo receiving the ADRs and holding them in its sub-account on behalf of 
PEP?  Perhaps Sara could inquire.  These are physical certifciates (if issued 
as restricted) so I don't know if the MS account is set up for physical 
custody or whether we need to prepare some additional documentation.

BONY has asked us to send them a letter instructing them to issue the ADR(s) 
and specifying where and to whom to deliver the certificates.  I will prepare 
the instruction letter, but I am assuming that we want someone at Morgan 
Stanley to take actual possession of the certificates.  In any event, I need 
someone to tell me where the certificates should land and give me a physical 
address for  the certificates.

Maria x35586

Are the certificate(s) to be issued by BONY restricted or common?  (sounds 
like restricted and to be issued in the name of PEP)  I think that we can 
lodge the physical securities at MS (in the vault) for the account of 
Enron....Holdings XII with a stock power from PEP.  Are we headed in the same 
direction here?  SS
Bruce Harris@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
01/18/2000 11:19 AM
What you are suggesting after your discussion with Sara is what I am 
suggesting.  The parent has the account; it holds the securities on behalf of 
its Brazil sub.  I would very much like to remove SPE from the chain quickly 
if possible so that if there is a CPMF assessed on the in-kind capital 
reduction, we don't have to pay it twice.  I think that would also simplify 
Robert's legal request.  Any objections?

Regards,  Bruce

Lynn Aven
01/18/2000 10:31 AM
The ADR's will be legally owned by PEP until we make a decision to move them 
out and go through the process of having a capital reduction to move the 
shares out of PEP.  Per discussions with Sara, we need to ascertain whether 
MS will hold the ADR's in a security account in the name of the Enron  Brazil 
Power Holding XII on behalf of PEP. 

I just looked at the legal ownership of PEP and noted that there is another 
Brazilian limitada, SPE between Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII and PEP.  I 
assume that we will have filings for two capital reductions, one for PEP and 
one for SPE unless SPE was removed from the ownership chain and that 
transaction has not been reflected in the Corporate Secretary data base.  SPE 
was placed in the chain of owenrship for the Comgas bid and I am not sure 
whether it got removed when we recycled the entity.

 - EnronLoan and Security Agreement draft.doc

Morgan Stanley has advised me this morning of the following with respect to 
accounts:

1.  The name of the account must be identical to the name of the certificate 
holder.
2.  An account holding only a certificate(s) is subject to a minimum equity 
requirement of USD 500,000.

As the certificate holder is the Brazilian company PEP, the broker will 
require additonal equity.  I am still awaiting a broker response as to 
whether the certificate holder can execute a stock power in favor of the 
account holder thereby enabling us to lodge the certificate(s) in the 
existing (Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII) account.   Alternatively, the 
certificate(s) can be held in the Enron Corp. vault. 

Robert, when do you need to respond to BONY?

Attached is a proposed form of letter requested by BONY to issue the ADRS.  I 
am missing (i) the number of shares being placed on deposit with Itau, (ii) 
the location to deliver our ADRs and (iii) Itau's title as local custodian of 
the Brazilian shares.  I will find out the official title for Itau.  In 
addition, I am contacting Itau and getting contact information to provide our 
Brazilian brokers so that they can transfer the Brazilian shares to Itau.  
Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.

McISDA is sprouting Golden Arches.  Although we have a serious legal issue, I 
think the CP really wants to develop a long term relationship with Enron and 
will overcome the problem.  Also, CP is interested in eliminating a Credit

I'll give you the scoop.  Sara

These include agreements that ECTRIC has with Fimat Futures UK Limited and

please advise and send copies to Houston.  Ted will now keep a duplicate set 
of agreements. Also, would any other European locations have executed 
brokerage or futures agreements?  If you have any questions, please call.

ENA can confirm the transaction on our "omnibus confirmation" with one or two 
minor changes (Joe:  please call me).  
Also, ENA sent a draft ISDA Master Agreement to Puget Sound Energy on

I'm in the need of informing the whole team that Argentina through the 
Argentine Association of Derivatives has developed a document that's 
circulating in the market and will surely be optimised to the extent that 
Argentine companies will use it in the near future if not inmediately. This 
document has been prepared by experienced groups of professionals with 
foreign support on terms of credit and legal issues. 

My impression is that will be competing against that document in a great deal 
of disadvantage. This disadvantage will be a "cultural" disadvantage from the 
moment that latin american countries tend to have "shorter" documents written 
in the local language where the transaction is taking place. 
If the ISDA was at least written in Spanish (rather than French or German) it 
would be of great help. This is an issue that really "tickles" me: Why isn't 
the ISDA document translated into Spanish being that it is after English 
probably the language most spoken through out the globe and second that 
there's much more opportunity of selling Risk Management Products to Latin 
American countries rather than French companies through my more than 
disappointing experience in trying to close a deal with French Total.

I believe Sara's visit would be more that important. I'll try to forward 
everybody a copy of the document that was drafted in Argentina for 
everybody's info.

I strongly believe in the matters of evolution and I'm sure that in the 
future ESA's market will mature in such a way that will just like Enron 
Europe a document to match market's needs.

Have you and Mark ever discussed this?  Have you spoken with Marval?  I'd 
really like some more information.  Thanks.  SS

P.S.  Is tomorrow a holdiay in BA?
Brent Hendry@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
01/24/2000 06:22 AM
John, I would be very interested to see what the local derivatives market is 
developing.  My guess is that the document is probably being prepared for 
transactions between two Argentine companies.  If this is the case I would 
also like to know what is being done on the tax side by the association to 
fix the tax problems caused by doing swaps in Argentina.  If the Argentine 
Association of Derivatives has a draft we would like to study it.  Also, are 
we going to become a member of this association and are we going to send 
someone to the meetings regularly?  Do we have any brochures or other 
information regarding the makeup of the association?  

From my conversations with Mark Taylor I do not think that ISDA has any plans 
to implement a Spanish language ISDA master.  The translation process of the 
master, the schedules, and all of the various definition books would be a 
serious undertaking (there are literally hundreds of pages of documentation 
that would have to be legally translated).  And most US companies that make a 
market in derivatives products would not have the legal and back-office 
personnel to negotiate and process masters and transactions in Spanish.  I 
know that ENA does not have the capacity to do this at the moment.  I think 
the only other language ISDA is published in is Japanese and that is a 
restricted format used only between two Japanese companies for a limited 
number of types of trades specific to the Japanese market.  English will 
likely remain the language of choice in international transactions such as 
what we are doing now between ENA and Argentine counterparties.  If the tax 
situation in Argentina were to change and ESA sets up its own trading entity 
in Argentina with front, back and middle offices, then the language issue 
could be assessed locally.  

I wish there were a simple answer to the current situation.  Please keep me 
updated in any local market information you come across.  

Thanks,
Brent

1.  Monday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials               -243.54     -2.16%   11008.17

Markets gave up early gains and spiraled downward today on heavy
volume, as investor fears that the upcoming Fed meeting may lead to an
increase in interest rates contributed to a broad-based sell off in
stocks.

**ALERT:  After the markets closed, Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) announced
fiscal first quarter earnings of 25 cents per share, which beat analyst
estimates of 20 cents, and also announced that it has named Robert Iger
as President & Chief Operating Officer of the entertainment giant, a
move that was expected.

The music industry was rattled by the announcement of a joint venture
between EMI Group plc and Time Warner (NYSE:TWX).  The two companies
will combine their recorded music and music publishing businesses in a
separate company to be called Warner EMI Music.  That company will be
one of the world's leading music companies, with some of the biggest
performing artists on its roster, such as the Rolling Stones, Beatles,
Madonna, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins and Spice Girls.  Although the
roughly $20 billion company will be owned equally by Time Warner and
EMI Group, Time Warner will control the entity, which means that
America Online (NYSE:AOL) will ultimately run the company if the
proposed AOL-Time Warner merger is consummated.  Time Warner shares
finished lower by 3 1/4 (-3.57%) to 87 7/8, while stocks of other
companies that are viewed as possible music industry alliance partners
also finished lower, with Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) off 1/4 (-0.76%) to 32
1/2, News Corp. (NYSE:NWS) down 1 5/8 (-3.74%) to 41 7/8, and Sony
Corp. (NYSE:SNE), parent of Sony Music, declining 1 5/8 (-0.69%) to 233
3/8.  The stock of another potential partner, Germany's Bertelsmann
(BMG), does not trade in the U.S.

In another music industry deal, Liquid Audio (Nasdaq:LQID) shares
surged 31.64% (up 8 3/16) to 34 1/16 on news the online digital music
provider has joined with Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT) to add support
for the distribution of Liquid Audio's extensive catalog of songs and
music previews in Windows Media (WMA) format.  The WMA format, which
Microsoft hopes will become the industry standard, is used to encode
digital music so it can be sent more quickly over the Internet and take
up less space on a hard drive.  Microsoft shares closed down 2 1/2 (-
2.41%) today.

Recent speculation that Dow component Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) was
pursuing a takeover of both Warner-Lambert (NYSE:WLA) and American Home
Products (NYSE:AHP) came to an end today when the consumer products
giant announced it has ended its discussions with the drug companies.
Warner-Lambert then issued a statement saying it was continuing to
explore options, including talks with Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), which has made
a $78 billion unsolicited bid for Warner-Lambert, that could lead to a
takeover.  Shares of Procter & Gamble, which have plummeted since it
began pursuing a possible deal with the drug companies, bounced back
7/16 (+0.43%) to 103 1/8 today, which was a positive force on the
mostly negative Dow today.  Warner-Lambert shares slipped 4 1/4 (-
4.62%) to 87 3/4 and AHP shares sank 5 3/8 (-11.20%) to 42 5/8, while
other leading drug companies finished lower, with Merck (NYSE:MRK) down
2 3/16 (-3.02%) to 70 1/4, Schering-Plough (NYSE:SGP) off 2 3/4 (-
6.49%) to 39 5/8, and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) falling 6 3/16 (-
6.88%) to 83 11/16.

In other Dow news:

-- Intel Corp. (Nasdaq:INTC) shares were sharply higher during the day
but then closed up 7/8 (+0.89%) to 98 13/16 on the heels of positive
comments from respected computer systems analyst Dan Niles of Robertson
Stephens.  Niles reiterated his buy rating and $125 price target on
Intel, saying the world's leading semiconductor company is performing
well in January and should benefit from the expected rebound in PC
demand following the recent Year 2000 slowdown.

-- General Electric (NYSE:GE) shares were a major catalyst for today's
steep decline in the Dow, dropping 6 1/16 (-4.21%) to 138 1/16 after an
article in Barrons over the weekend expressed some concerns regarding
GE's most recent quarterly financial results.

-- AT&T (NYSE:T) shares fell 1 9/16 (-3.00%) to 50 1/2 despite reports
that the telecom giant may cut up to 25% of its executive staff.

Shares of both Healtheon/WebMD (Nasdaq:HLTH) and Quintiles
Transnational (Nasdaq:QTRN) posted big gains today after the two
health-related companies announced an acquisition and strategic
alliance.  First, Healtheon/WebMD will acquire Quintiles' electronic
data interchange unit, ENVOY Corporation, for $2.5 billion, which will

for its healthcare customers.  Second, under terms of the strategic
alliance, Quintiles will invest up to $100 million in Healtheon/WebMD

shopping "tab" on Amazon.com's site in exchange for $105 million over 3
years.  In addition, Amazon.com will invest another $30 million in
drugstore.com, which raises its stake in the online drugstore to
roughly 28%.  Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon.com, said in a
statement: "We're working to make Amazon.com the only place where you
can find anything and everything you might want to buy online -- what
you're seeing today is a completely new component of that strategy."

tender offer.  Grupo Sanborns said in a statement that it expected
Telefonos de Mexico (NYSE:TMX), Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT) and SBC

global fiber-optic networks.  Level 3 shares closed up 2 3/8 (+2.15%)
to 112 7/8.

In a strange trading pattern, shares of Enzo Biochem (NYSE:ENZ) were
all over the map today, rising as high as 139 before ending the day

Can we schedule a conference call?  Sara
Jeff Kabel@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
01/25/2000 06:40 AM
I suggest we all get into a room and discuss this.  I agree with John that we 
need to start tailoring our documents to the local market but as Brent says 
within the confines of what is legally acceptable.  Instead of just using 
Europe as an example and then rebutting with "this is Enron Policy" let's 
analyze the issue in detail.  Though we are the only players now, this will 
not last for long as the Brazilian/Argentine economies recover.

I do not understand why we have to work in English.

John, I would be very interested to see what the local derivatives market is 
developing.  My guess is that the document is probably being prepared for 
transactions between two Argentine companies.  If this is the case I would 
also like to know what is being done on the tax side by the association to 
fix the tax problems caused by doing swaps in Argentina.  If the Argentine 
Association of Derivatives has a draft we would like to study it.  Also, are 
we going to become a member of this association and are we going to send 
someone to the meetings regularly?  Do we have any brochures or other 
information regarding the makeup of the association?  

From my conversations with Mark Taylor I do not think that ISDA has any plans 
to implement a Spanish language ISDA master.  The translation process of the 
master, the schedules, and all of the various definition books would be a 
serious undertaking (there are literally hundreds of pages of documentation 
that would have to be legally translated).  And most US companies that make a 
market in derivatives products would not have the legal and back-office 
personnel to negotiate and process masters and transactions in Spanish.  I 
know that ENA does not have the capacity to do this at the moment.  I think 
the only other language ISDA is published in is Japanese and that is a 
restricted format used only between two Japanese companies for a limited 
number of types of trades specific to the Japanese market.  English will 
likely remain the language of choice in international transactions such as 
what we are doing now between ENA and Argentine counterparties.  If the tax 
situation in Argentina were to change and ESA sets up its own trading entity 
in Argentina with front, back and middle offices, then the language issue 
could be assessed locally.  

I wish there were a simple answer to the current situation.  Please keep me 
updated in any local market information you come across.  

Thanks,
Brent

I'm in the need of informing the whole team that Argentina through the 
Argentine Association of Derivatives has developed a document that's 
circulating in the market and will surely be optimised to the extent that 
Argentine companies will use it in the near future if not inmediately. This 
document has been prepared by experienced groups of professionals with 
foreign support on terms of credit and legal issues. 

My impression is that will be competing against that document in a great deal 
of disadvantage. This disadvantage will be a "cultural" disadvantage from the 
moment that latin american countries tend to have "shorter" documents written 
in the local language where the transaction is taking place. 
If the ISDA was at least written in Spanish (rather than French or German) it 
would be of great help. This is an issue that really "tickles" me: Why isn't 
the ISDA document translated into Spanish being that it is after English 
probably the language most spoken through out the globe and second that 
there's much more opportunity of selling Risk Management Products to Latin 
American countries rather than French companies through my more than 
disappointing experience in trying to close a deal with French Total.

I believe Sara's visit would be more that important. I'll try to forward 
everybody a copy of the document that was drafted in Argentina for 
everybody's info.

I strongly believe in the matters of evolution and I'm sure that in the 
future ESA's market will mature in such a way that will just like Enron 
Europe a document to match market's needs.

I have two (2) tickets for "Wit" playing at the Alley Theatre for Friday, 
Feb. 11 (8 pm, Sec. 4, Row G).  Let me know if you are interested.  No 
charge.  Sara

FYI

Got your voicemail and have confirmed our meeting for tomorrow (Friday) at 
2:30pm.  I have reserved conf. room EB 2719

Please let me know about how many will be attending and if we can provide 
Phil with a copy of an actual Contract and Confirmation from one of the 
counterparties on our list prior to the meeting.

Thx,

David

Let's enter into the database.  I'll meet with you shortly to discuss 
further.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara,
In response to your request to Michael Brown et al for a copy of all 
brokerage agreements I attach the only other brokerage agreement that our 
archive department could find.  The other recipients of your email have let 
me know that they do not have any brokerage agreements. 

Let me know if you need anything else.
Many thanks
Lorna

Attached is a redline based upon the document generated by you.  I'm sure 
there will be many items for discussion and I look forward to hearing from 
you.   Regards.  Sara

Happy New Year!

I was hoping you could respond to some issues raised by Enron's Argentine 
commercial group.  They have told me the following:

(1)  An association known as the "Argentine Association of Derivatives" has 
developed a document currently being circulated in the Argentine market for 
use in the near term.  It is in Spanish and it is not an ISDA.  It is a 
"short" document (i.e., much shorter than a standard ISDA Master Agreement 
and ISDA Credit Support Annex).

(2)  This document is being prepared by experienced professionals.  Are you 
involved in this effort?  Is ISDA involved?

Perhaps we could schedule a conference call and/or you could provide me with 
an accurate account of any local activity in connection with the foregoing.  
If ISDA is not being used in Argentina for commodity swaps and derivatives, 
Enron needs to understand the issues and current discussions about 
derivatives transactions.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara

Let's verify that this is an IOU.  The Master should be sent to the attention 
of Dave Brown and you should advise Cary of when it was sent to the 
customer.  He may want a copy.

ps  Remind me to give you both copies of Tana's utility analysis.  Also, 
Marie, let's talk about the utility language and circulate for comment.

note that the legal name for Nicor Gas is Northern Illinois Gas Company.  
Please call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Happy New Year!  Just wondering if you had an opportunity to review the CSA 
and comment.  Drop me a line or call 713/853-5620.  Thanks.  Sara

I would like to pursue with Marval.  Should we meet to discuss?  Sara
Dear Sara:

The people behind the Argentine Association of Derivatives are mainly the
big international banks.  I know them well.  The Firm has been invited to
join ADA but has not yet done so.  No specific reason.I knew that they were
working on a standard text but have not seen it.  I can easily obtain it
because the chairman of ADA is the Treasurer of Citibank and a good friend
of mine.  I worked extensively for a team that he led last year trying to
set up the legal framework of a futures and options markets.

As far as I know, they were focused on financial derivatives and not on
commodities but I can inquire.

ISDA can be used for international transactions but not for transactions
where both parties are domiciled in Argentina since in this case the
transaction cannot be subject to foreign law.

Let me try and investigate where they stand and I will give you a call.

Best regards and happy new year to you also.

terms of what our position is for this office.  Let me know what works for 
the two of you.  I do not know if Lynn is interested in the issues the 
commercial group has been raising lately other than his advice means that we

Conference with Julian, S. Jackleton and L. Evans: You've probably talked to 
Mike about this meeting, but anyway, it's OK for him on the 27th at 12p.   He 
would like to be briefed before this meeting.  
Thanks,
Mariana

The draft is ready to go but we need one (1) item from credit.  Hopefully, 
this should be resolved within the hour!  Do you want a copy?  SS

Are we any closer to having a draft ready?  The business guys lost an 
opportunity to trade a couple of weeks ago when power prices shot upward. 
Prices are now coming back down and they would like to be able to transact 
soon.

Lynn will come to my office at 9 am.  Julian will try to be here too but he 
has an 8am meeting and may be late.  I can call you if you like, but just let 
me know which number.  SS

P.S.  Shall I just schedule a call with you and Mark?

Sorry to keep sending emails BUT my assistant just walked in and said that 
you were expecting a presentation by Mark Taylor on the phone call.  To my 
knowledge, Mark doesn't know anything about this call (your email of 1/17 
doesn't mention Mark).  So, I'm totally confused.  If we are going to discuss 
the term sheet process and related tax issues, let's do it.  If you want to 
cancel because you are expecting something different, please let me know (and 
advise Lynn and Julian).  Thanks.

Let me know if you have comments or want to discuss further.
P.S. to Rod:  We need to talk about Basin
Andrea Bertone@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
01/27/2000 07:26 AM
Sara: As requested, attached is the English translation of the 10-year PPA 
that Enron Comercializadora entered into with Moema. The Agreement is signed, 
and Moema is supposed to start delivery in May 2000. However, performance by 
both parties is subject to Moema requesting and obtaining from ANEEL the 
status of independent producer. I don't know who else should get a copy of 
this agreement. I am assuming that credit has been already involved.

I spoke briefly with Gary Perlmutter who now represents the parent Sempra 
Energy but who told me that restrictions on the regulated utility have been 
lifted by the CA PUC.  I will verify (or I'll give you his name, etc. and you 
can speak with him directly) when the SDG&E lawyer returns my call.  Thus I 
am not sure that your online efforts require limitation.  I will also inquire 
about SDG&E's online objectives.  SS  

I'm available as well.  Sara

asap.

Would it be possible to include some text proposing a deadline for them to

I am finalizing the docs and we should coordinate with Julian.  You may want 
to let Scott Neal know that we will need his signature.  SS

Phone #: 517-768-2003
Fax #: 517-787-4606

How shall we proceed now? I guess we need Scott Neal's signature.

I'll be in a couple of meetings today, but we will definitely send this out 
today.

Thanks, Julian

That will be fine.  Sara

We are on for the 9th @ 9:30 am.  Does that still work for you?  Can we meet 
at your office?

Holly Krebbs just did a deal with these guys (short form) but they want to 
negotiate an ISDA.  We need to send an updated form to them.  Will there be 
any credit changes?  

Central Puerto has been unresponsive to Marie's requests for original 
documents.  Can someone please contact Marie and help us speak with the 
counterparty?  Thanks.  Sara

See attached letter

We will need to update this ISDA on our new, revised, fantastic format!!!  
I'll have to find out who to send it to.  SS
The original credit is fine.  Pugent is still rated BBB+.

Sara:

I have a copy of the draft of the Argentine Master Derivative Agreement.
The person who gave it to me mentioned that they are still working on the
definitive draft.

What do you want me to do?  Shall I review the text and/or get more involved
in its drafting?
Can you inquiry what exactly was what they said to your people down here
about the use of the draft?

The text is in Spanish, are you interested in an English translation or
shall we wait?

I look forward to your instructions.

Could this be an alternative to our recording issue?
Richard B Sanders
01/31/2000 04:59 AM
In theory, there may be some jurisdictions that do not allow tapes to be 
admissable because of issues other than relevance--such as authenticity. It 
is hard to know the Evidence Rules of every jurisdiction. I would suggest the 
following language:

The parties to this Agreement agree that any such recording are admissable in 
any legal proceeding for any matters relevant to the Agreement, except for 
those recordings that violate the Parole Evidence Rule of the applicable 
jurisdiction.

Thanks.  SS

Attached is a short letter advising subs/affiliates of ENA of existing 
brokerage and futures accounts.  I thought these should be sent to the 
general counsel and CFO/Treasurer of each company.  Please let me know your 
comments, frequency of review, whether any other group should monitor, etc.  
Each attached Exhibit will contain only a list of accounts.  I have not 
included account numbers but we can do so and include any other information 
you consider relevant.  Remember, the only other "brokerage account matrix" 
which we have produced is a quick view of brokerage firms and Enron 
companies.   Thanks.

In discussing the Omnibus with outside counsel on a deal, I am not clear that 
the definition of "Loss" picks up the concept of "Unpaid Amounts."  Arguably 
it does (although the concept of "Unpaid Amounts" is built into the ECT 
Master upon which the Omnibus was based for Early Termination for Events of 
Default but not followed through entirely for Accelerated Termination Date).  
My guess is that we decided that Omnibus "Loss" pv of economic loss includes 
both past amounts owed/subsequent valuation.  Can you recall?

Per our conversation with Dan F., ENA needs to understand issues related to 
the distinction between "investor owned utilities" (or "IOUs") and municipal 
utilities (or "municipals") in connection with derivatives activity.  In the 
U.S., this distinction enables us to treat IOUs as general corporates.  Thus, 
we negotiate our standard ISDA Master with an IOU, except that we add an 
Additional Termination Event to prevent the IOU from taking an adverse stance 
in its state public utility commission proceedings.  A copy of that 
Additional Termination Event is attached for your review.  Our approach with 
respect to municipals is dramatically different.  When negotiating an ISDA 
Master with municipals, we use a Schedule modeled after the 1992 U.S. 
Municipal Counterparty Schedule, having additional reps, the added concept of 
"Incipient Illegality" and an enforceability opinion.  A copy of that 
Schedule is also attached for your reference.

We would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in Canada, 
and if so, in all Canadian provinces, and whether there is a distinction when 
a municipal is an investor in an IOU (as we understand that the government 
may assist a utility to emerge from bankruptcy).  In that regard, would you 
recommend that ENA use distinct ISDA Schedules for these types of entities 
and/or would you recommend specific changes to our format?  

 

Should we be entrenched in this type of activity?  I'm not even sure that we 
find out about all of ESA's ideas.  Sara
This is what has been discussed so far.  We looked at this once last year, 
but decided that we were not getting quotes that justified the transaction.  
This time it looks like we would "sort of" cover our exposure by both selling 
and buying and hopefully making money off of the difference.
	Enron International
	     Structuring Group
	

The trade is the following.   Enron would buy Lender's insurance from the 
insurance market on "to be named later" intercompany loans.  Enron would pay 
a fee each year for this protection.  At the same time, Enron would sell 
convertibility protection via the capital markets' so-called "credit 
derivative" products.  Enron would earn income from selling this protection.  
If there was a convertibility event, the bank would deliver to us Reais and a 
crossborder intercompany loan in Brazil.  Offshore, we would buy the 
crossborder loan and pay the bank in USD.  Enron now has an intercompany loan 
and associated R$ which it can't convert into USD.  So we would give the loan 
and R$ to the insurance company and 180 days later we would get paid in USD 
(no deval. risk).  

The arbitrage is basically that the insurance market charges less for 
protection than the capital markets.  No cash is required (but we probably 
need Corp. to stand behind it all).  Martin has priced out Lender's insurance 
at around 2% per annum for 5 years.   Convertibility protection in the credit 
derivative market might earn as much as between 3- 4% per annum (we need to 
negotiate with some of the US inv. banks).  They are essentially the same 
type of protection, so I am not sure why the differential is so large other 
than the waiting period and/or the markets sell to different customer sets.

Martin has requested docs. from AIG and I have requested docs. from CSFB.  
Assuming that legal/tax does not see any major issue (there is always some 
residual risk), we may need to move on this fast as apparently AIG has about 
$150M available right now.  So this is an FYI email that once Martin and I 
have completed an initial review, if all looks good we will want to move fast 
through due diligence/approval process.

Regards,  Bruce       

What is the issue?  I have no idea if anyone is looking at this.  Sara

It sure sounds like you have your hands full with the restructuring!  I have 
been trying to get a better grasp of the deal flow in Brazil through some 
type of "Deal Report".  In Houston and Argentina, the business groups 
circulate a transaction listing.  Also, legal in both Houston and Argentina 
circulate a listing from Legal's perspective. Is a commercial team deal 
report circulated weekly in Brazil, and if so, can I be added to the 
circulation?  I will ask Randy if he can circulate his list.  It would be 
helpful for me when we have our weekly conference call.  In that regard, what 
is "Alcan", the PPA which may eventually serve as a template?  I am glad to 
prepare some type of module as Randy suggested which sets forth basic Enron 
Corp. and/or trading policy as to certain issues (force majeure, governing 
law, dispute resolution, damages, etc.),  Let's coordinate for the seminar 
which you are organizing for March.  Thanks.  Sara

Felix came by to do the replication on your think pad.  He said it will take 
at least 1 1/2 hr. to do it.  Is it OK if he does it Thurs or Fri?  Your 
schedule is pretty busy tomorrow.  The only time I see available tomorrow is 
maybe 9:30a - 11a.  I'm sure it will be hard for you to talk on the phone 
even for 30 min. with Felix in your office.

All he needs is your passwords.

Just wondering if you had a chance to comment on the "advisory memo" to be 
sent to the Enron subs/affiliates regarding brokerage agreements.  I have no 
real deadlines, only a self-imposed deadline so that we can get this thing 
organized and running on a regular basis.  I would appreciate your input.  
I'll be out of the office Feb. 3 7&4; maybe we can chat early next week.  
Thanks.  Sara

Susan should have already checked with the counterparty.  SS

   

Hi there - any updates with these folks?

How is the IDSA negotiations going with these guys.  And while I'm at it - 
have you heard anything from PSE&G??

Marce

Jeff Nogid has called about putting some ENE masters in place.  I have 
already spoken with Clement about this.  ENE will be trading FX, interest 
rate and equities through Gary's group.  Jeff mentioned names such as Merrill 
Lynch Cap. Services, Credit Suisse and Sumitomo.  He will obtain specific 
names and contacts at the various firms and forward that information to me 
and/or Shari.  We'll let you know.  Sara

Under separate cover, I will fax to you a copy of the February 6, 1998 legal 
opinion which, from my research, created the "issue"  between SG&E and Enron 

I am negotiating an ISDA on behalf of ENA with an Australian corporate 
insisting upon a legal opinion (enforceability) with respect to the Enron 
Corp. guaranty.  Is this a customary request by Australian corporates that 
you would normally grant?  If so, who has issued the opinion?  I look forward 
to your reply.  Regards.  Sara

I'll be out of the office Feb. 3 & 4.
Carol is attending a class on Feb. 3.
Please direct inquiries to lawyers present on those two days.
Kaye Ellis knows how to reach me in Baton Rouge.

I just finished neogtiating Annex A with this CP and its lawyer for the 
8-month financial deal effective 2/1/00.  The CP is anxious to receive an 
ISDA so that the ISDA will govern this transaction and future transactions.  
Please let me know who will prepare credit (since the CP knows my phone 
number and is awaiting receipt of a draft!).  Thanks.  Sara

negotiate!). Please keep me updated.  Sara

Sara, US legal opinions on guaranties is a hot issue for us. We needed to get 
one when we were first granted our licence to trade electricity derivatives 
in 1998 from Cadwalader Wickersham and Taft. It advises on the enforcability 
of a guaranty under NY law in NY. I will fax it to you. I was planning on 
getting an updated opinion as our guaranty form has developed. Also there are 
several counterparties who are insisting on an individual opinion, which to 
date we have not been willing give.      

I am also working through Clement Abrams to get a legal opinion From Vincent 
and Elkins on the enforceability of judgment in Australian court in respect 
of a Guaranty  in NY. That is a more complicated exercise.

Anyway to answer your question it is customary to an extent. A number of law 
firms advise their clients to get to cover themselves. Who is the 
counterparty?

I am negotiating an ISDA on behalf of ENA with an Australian corporate 
insisting upon a legal opinion (enforceability) with respect to the Enron 
Corp. guaranty.  Is this a customary request by Australian corporates that 
you would normally grant?  If so, who has issued the opinion?  I look forward 
to your reply.  Regards.  Sara

Absolutely!

I just finished neogtiating Annex A with this CP and its lawyer for the 
8-month financial deal effective 2/1/00.  The CP is anxious to receive an 
ISDA so that the ISDA will govern this transaction and future transactions.  
Please let me know who will prepare credit (since the CP knows my phone 
number and is awaiting receipt of a draft!).  Thanks.  Sara   

Tracy Ngo will be preparing credit for an ISDA.  The draft should be sent to 
(Steve) Morus at the CP (check the green file because we've done an 
omnibus).  You can insert NY law but no other omnibus changes need to be 
made.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara, US legal opinions on guaranties is a hot issue for us. We needed to get 
one when we were first granted our licence to trade electricity derivatives 
in 1998 from Cadwalader Wickersham and Taft. It advises on the enforcability 
of a guaranty under NY law in NY. I will fax it to you. I was planning on 
getting an updated opinion as our guaranty form has developed. Also there are 
several counterparties who are insisting on an individual opinion, which to 
date we have not been willing give.      

I am also working through Clement Abrams to get a legal opinion From Vincent 
and Elkins on the enforceability of judgment in Australian court in respect 
of a Guaranty  in NY. That is a more complicated exercise.

Anyway to answer your question it is customary to an extent. A number of law 
firms advise their clients to get to cover themselves. Who is the 
counterparty?

Drop by.  We've been trading financial power for over a year.  Not many 
deals, though.

   

Just a reminder to talk to me Monday about the utilities.  I was not aware we 
were not currently trading financial power, which they are getting ready to 
open up.  I figure the utilities will start squealing loudly when they cannot 
trade.  So, I've go to start opening up my utilities...

We need a new ISDA using our current form changes.  Sara
I created this w/s for Marci Youngerman and sent it to the paralegals in 
March-99.  Lotus notes says that a draft went out in that month.  I'm still 
okay with the credit in that draft.

Rod-

This is my last e-mail from Julian on the Central Puerto power swap.  He 
should be back in Argentina this week from being on vacation.  

You will need to follow up with him and Sara concerning the ISDA,  The main 
credit issue was the BB MAC trigger that does not cover when a counterparty 
is no longer rated by S&P.  As of July 1999, C. Puerto is no longer being 
rated by S&P and was last rated BB-.

The ISDA does have the CSA with a 1MM threshold, but this is an older ISDA 
so, you may want to review.

Regards,

Pat

I am looking at a financial swap with C. Puerto for 50/70 MW for maybe 2/3 
years.
Does this volume & term trigger any posting of LC from Puerto's behalf?

Thanks, Julian

1.  Monday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Industrials                -58.01     -0.53%   10905.79
S&P 500                         -0.16     -0.01%    1424.21

Internet Stock Index           +10.86     +1.22%     902.75

The Nasdaq broke out this afternoon to surge to another record high
while the Dow closed lower on little news concerning Dow components.

The 3-month takeover drama surrounding drug company Warner-Lambert
(NYSE:WLA) has finally come to an end on news that Pfizer (NYSE:PFE)
will buy Warner-Lambert for roughly $90 billion in stock.  The deal
will create the #1 U.S. drug company and the second largest in the
world, with annual revenues of $28 billion and a research and
development budget of $4.7 billion in 2000.  Pfizer's Chairman and CEO,
William C. Steere, said in a statement: "By combining two world-class
organizations to create the fastest-growing major pharmaceutical
company in the world, we are positioned for global leadership in the
discovery of new medicines that will benefit millions of patients
around the world."

The deal officially kills Warner-Lambert's previous plans to combine
with American Home Products (NYSE:AHP) in a $58 billion merger, but AHP
will receive a $1.8 billion "break-up" fee as a result.  A "break-up"
fee is often used in the merger context to solidify a deal by making it
more expensive for a rival suitor to "break-up" the deal.  In this
case, that is exactly what happened as Pfizer came in to bust the AHP-
Warner-Lambert deal, but as a result Pfizer will have to pay the
largest break-up fee in history.

Pfizer shares rose 15/16 (+2.62%) to 36 11/16 on the news, while
Warner-Lambert shares climbed 2 9/16 (+2.71%) to 97 1/8 and AHP shares
moved up 2 1/2 (+5.49%) to 48.  Other drug stocks finished mixed, with
Merck (NYSE:MRK) edging up 3/16 (+0.25%) to 75 1/4, Johnson & Johnson
(NYSE:JNJ) slipping 11/16 (-0.84%) to 81 7/16, and Schering-Plough
(NYSE:SGP) losing 1/2 (-1.08%) to 45 7/8.

There was also a major deal in the chemicals sector today, with two oil
giants, Phillips Petroleum Company (NYSE:P) and Chevron Corp.
(NYSE:CHV), saying they intend to form a 50-50 joint venture combining
their worldwide chemicals businesses, with assets totaling more than $6
billion.  Phillips shares added 1 (+2.56%) to 40 and Chevron shares
edged up 1/2 (+0.64%) to 79 1/16.

In other large cap action, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HWP) surged 8.79% (up
10 3/8) to an all-time high of 128 3/8, Intel Corp. (Nasdaq:INTC) rose
3 1/8 (+2.98%) to 107 7/8, Philip Morris (NYSE:MO) ended lower by 1/16
(-0.30%) to 20 9/16, IBM (NYSE:IBM) was off 1 1/2 (-1.30%) to 114 1/8,
Eastman Kodak (NYSE:EK) dropped 1 1/4 (-1.98%) to 62, and Tyco Intl.
(NYSE:TYC) lost 7/8 (-2.19%) to 39 1/8.  In addition, Cisco Systems
(Nasdaq:CSCO), which is set to announce earnings tomorrow, closed up 4
1/16 (+3.35%) to 125 3/16.

Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO) shares closed up 1/2 (+0.14%) to 354, reversing
earlier dips after the online portal's Web site went down starting in
the early afternoon EST today.  Meanwhile, shares of Charles Schwab
(NYSE:SCH), which also reported some problems with its Web site today,
also ended higher, up 7/8 (+2.31%) to 38 13/16.

Lucent Technologies (NYSE:LU) made a move to enhance its optical
networking business by announcing it will acquire Ortel Corp.
(Nasdaq:ORTL), a developer of opto-electronic components that help
increase the bandwidth (or distribution capacity) of cable television
networks, in a stock deal valued at $2.95 billion.  Shares of the
world's biggest telephone equipment maker fell 1/2 (-0.88%) to 56 1/2
while Ortel shares sank 9 1/16 (-5.12%) to 168 1/16.  In other telecom
news, AT&T (NYSE:T) and Wireless One Network, L.P. today announced they
have reached an agreement for AT&T to buy Wireless One's assets in
Florida for an undisclosed amount.  AT&T said it expects the assets to
fill a strategic gap in its Florida operations.  AT&T shares rose 3/4
(+1.48%) to 51 3/8.

A major deal was announced in the e-business sector, as Kana
Communications (Nasdaq:KANA) said it would acquire Silknet Software
(Nasdaq:SILK) in a $4.2 billion deal.  Kana is a leading provider of
online marketing, sales and service solutions while Silknet provides
customer-focused e-business applications and systems.  Michael
McCloskey, the CEO of Kana, said in a statement: "This combination
enables Kana to expand our leadership by providing a web-architected e-
business platform and a comprehensive suite of customer-facing
applications for marketing, sales and service communications."  Kana
shares lost 18 3/8 (-7.10%) to 240 1/2 while Silknet Software shares
soared 44 13/16 (+32.36%) to 183 5/16.

Shares of Corel Corp. (Nasdaq:CORL) fell 11/16 (-3.44%) to 19 5/16
after the software company, which has recently expanded into the Linux
sector, said it will acquire Inprise/Borland Corporation (Nasdaq:INPR)
in a deal valued at roughly $2.44 billion.  Inprise/Borland provides
Internet access infrastructure and application development tools and
services.  Corel's President Michael Cowpland said in a statement:
"This merger enables us to offer end-to-end product solutions and
global support to all of our shared customers."  Inprise/Borland shares
gained 5/16 (+2.42%) to 13 1/4.

The merger between EarthLink Networks (Nasdaq:ELNKD) and MindSpring
Enterprises took effect today after shareholders of both companies
approved the planned combination.  The merged entity, which retains the
EarthLink name, is the country's 2nd-largest Internet access provider
with close to 3 million subscribers.  EarthLink shares (*Note: new
ticker above) were unchanged at 31 7/16.

The biotech sector had a strong showing on Wall Street today.  Amgen
(Nasdaq:AMGN) rose 7.06% (up 4 9/16) to 69 3/16, Human Genome Sciences
(Nasdaq:HGSI) surged 26 15/16 (+23.40%) to 142 1/16, Medimmune
(Nasdaq:MEDI) gained 12 5/8 (+9.75%) to 142 1/16, Affymetrix
(Nasdaq:AFFX) climbed 17 3/4 (+6.52%) to 289 7/8, and Genentech
(NYSE:DNA) increased 6 1/2 (+4.51%) to 150 1/2.  Biogen (Nasdaq:BGEN)
was the exception, however, as its shares fell 7/8 (-0.88%) to 98 1/4.

Other big movers in the tech sector included:

-- TCSI Corp. (Nasdaq:TCSI), a provider of telecommunications software
and services, skyrocketed 124% (up 3 7/8) to 7 on news that 3Com Corp.

application and engineering services for its new CommWorks 5000
networking system.

announced plans to acquire Avesta Technologies.

-- InterVu (Nasdaq:ITVU) shares rose 10.58% (up 12 3/8) to 129 3/8
after Akamai Technologies (Nasdaq:AKAM) announced plans to acquire the

Akami shares lost 6 3/8 (-2.71%) to 228 5/8.

Sara,

Please advise the status of this deal.  

Rod Nelson did confirm that deal should not reference a Master Agreement 
since we do not have one with this entity.   I think I did give you a copy 
last week.  Let's discuss when you have time.

Bernice

Trying to set up conference call with Tiger (will advise).  Enron Corp. 
lawyer out of town until tomorrow afternoon; trying to find another Corp. 
lawyer to review the guaranty.  Also, received e-mail from Harvard asking 
when I'd respond.  Is this just a routine request?  SS

Was the meeting this morning cancelled?  Rick Hopkinson and I waited for 
about fifteen minutes.   Sara

Does this sound familiar?

Jarrod,

Please prepare a draft ISDA swap agreement with the attached terms.  Our 
lumber group is needing this for their negotiations with Stora as soon as 
possible.
It is my understanding the two companies are getting close to finalizing the 
ISDA.
As we discussed, a template for settling lumber swaps using the CME Lumber 
contract average last 3 trading day settle will be required.
If you need anything further or need clarification of anything, please call 
me to discuss.

JH.

Hi!  I'm the ENA lawyer with whom you will be speaking with respect to this 
Master Agreement.  I know that Marie Heard has called you regarding your 
review of this document and I was hoping to facilitate that discussion.  
Please let me know if you have specific questions and/or if we can schedule a 
conference call.  You can reach me via email of (713) 853-5620.  Thanks.  
Sara

per my voice mail

Are we also trying to put an ISDA in place?

Tanya Rohauer

Just do it without any credit terms for now.

JH.

Sounds like an interesting meeting.  SS

   
	
	

The meeting with these guys will be on the 17th in Houston.  The agenda will 
be:

1)  Matching physical and financial:  what are the benefits and risks of 
separating the physical and financial components of a transaction?  What 
happens when your physical output volume differs from the swap volume?  Chris 
will handle this.

2)  Unit contingency insurance:  What is ENA doing with respect to offering 
this product to its clients?  How does thisreduce risk when a generator's 
physical volumes do not match the swap volumes?  Gaurav will be handling this.

3)  Review of the swap contract language with special focus on focusing on 
credit and how the Thermo Ecotek (or Thermo Electron) credit amount will be 
allocated to their individual generation subsidiaries.  Tracy and Sara will 
handle this.

I plan to start at 9:30 and be done at 12:00 noon.  Feel free to attend the 
entire meeting or just your part..  Also, we will go out to lunch thereafter 
and you are invited if you'd like.

Tracy has graciously volunteered to get us a conference room.

Sara/Guarav:  we will let you know the conference room number.

Thanks again!  Let's hope they don't cancel this time.

Chris

I received a call from Jay Boudreaux (CTG group working with paper & pulp) 
about presenting "agreements" to the lender (Paribas) for review in 
connection with the loan for construction of the mill.  I know that Jarrod 
has prepared "draft confirms" for these companies but I don't know if anyone 
has raised the ISDA issue.  Sounds like too many hands in the pot but the 
bank may really need to see Master Swap Agreements.  Let me know if this has 
already been addressed.  Thanks.  Sara

(1)  I have to leave early this evening to pick up pets (about 5:45)

(2)  Just a thought after seeing Shari's email:  would the paralegals and/or 
lawyers benefit from the two seminars "Successful Working Relationships" 
(valuing differences; creating understanding)?  Should this be mandatory with 
some type of follow up to help improve group communication skills?

I am in the process of finalizing the ISDA and need for you to provide me 
with a definition of the "Cross Border Lease"  for insertion into Paragraph 
12 of the Credit Support Annex.  I will need to refer to the lease in several 
places.  Thanks.  Sara

Cisco Systems Hits All-Time High After Announcing Stock Split!

The world's leading networking equipment maker, Cisco Systems
(Nasdaq:CSCO), announced a 2-for-1 stock split after reporting
better than expected earnings yesterday.  The news propelled
Cisco shares to an all-time high today.

Readers of the Smart!Splits Report were told that Cisco might

update on our web site at http://www.smartportfolio.com/update
The update is posted at approximately 6:00 PM EST every day.

1.  Wednesday's Market Action

                             $ Change   % Change      Close
Dow Jones Industrials         -258.44     -2.36%   10699.16
S&P 500                        -30.03     -2.08%    1411.69
Nasdaq                         -64.26     -1.45%    4363.24
Internet Stock Index            -2.00     -0.22%     922.33

The Dow sold off this afternoon while the Nasdaq reversed strong gains
from earlier in the day, as investors chose to take a portion of their
profits and run amid increasing investor concern surrounding Internet
security (see "Tech and Internet Stocks" below for more information).

The bond markets reacted strongly to comments from U.S. Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers, who said the U.S. government would buy
back securities on all parts of the yield curve (both short-term and
long-term), not just the 30-year bond, to pay down government debt.
The statements caused long bond rates to jump considerably, which
contributed to a sell off in stocks.  The financial sector was
particularly weak, with American Express (NYSE:AXP) off 6 7/16 (-
3.95%) to 156 9/16, Citigroup (NYSE:C) down 1 13/16 (-3.24%) to 54
3/16, JP Morgan (NYSE:JPM) lower by 2 15/16 (-2.46%) to 116 9/16,
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter (NYSE:MWD) declining 5/8 (-0.92%) to 67
3/16.

Shares of Cisco Systems (Nasdaq:CSCO) bolted early in the day but then
gave up some of its gains, closing up 3 (+2.38%) to 128 13/16.  The
networking equipment giant announced fourth quarter earnings of 25
cents per share late yesterday, beating First Call consensus estimates
of 24 cents per share.  The company also set a 2-for-1 stock split,
its ninth split since Cisco first became a public company in February
1990.  The jump in Cisco's stock price catapulted the company to the
second-largest market capitalization position, ahead of General
Electric (NYSE:GE) and behind only Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq:MSFT).
Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Paul Weinstein speculated that
Cisco could become the first trillion-dollar company.

stock split.  To read about anticipated and announced stock splits for

In leading Dow action, Boeing (NYSE:BA) shares fell 1 13/16 (-4.44%)
to 39 after thousands of the aerospace giant's engineers and technical
workers struck on Wednesday, IBM (NYSE:IBM) shares gave in to tech
sector profit taking, falling 1 7/16 (-1.21%) to 117 3/8; and
International Paper (NYSE:IP) shares sank 1 7/8 (-4.17%) to 43 1/8.
On the positive side, Philip Morris (NYSE:MO) shares bounced back 1/8
(+0.64%) to 19 5/8 today and SBC Communications (NYSE:SBC) shares
edged up 3/4 (+1.78%) to 42 13/16.

The tech sector succumbed to profit taking, with Intel Corp.
(Nasdaq:INTC) down 4 3/16 (-3.85%) to 104 5/8, Motorola (NYSE:MOT) off
6 7/8 (-4.30%) to 153, Hewlett-Packard (NYSE:HWP) edging lower by 3/16
(-0.15%) to 124, and Lucent Technologies (NYSE:LU) down 1 3/8 (-2.54%)
to 52 13/16.  However, several big tech names bucked the downward
trend.  One notable exception was Cisco Systems (discussed above), but
another strong performer was Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq:SUNW), whose
shares climbed 4 9/16 (+5.24%) to 91 9/16 after the company's Chief
Financial Officer told an analyst meeting that Sun is looking to
bolster is revenues substantially.

The Internet world was rattled again today by continued attacks from
hackers on leading Web sites.  In recent days, the Web sites of Yahoo!
(Nasdaq:YHOO), Amazon.com (Nasdaq:AMZN), and eBay (Nasdaq:EBAY) were
disrupted by hackers, who were apparently also the culprits for the
embarrassing outage on Buy.com's (Nasdaq:BUYX) site on the day of its
initial public offering.  Today, online brokers were the targets, as
the sites of Etrade (Nasdaq:EGRP), the #2 U.S. online broker, and
Datek Online, the #4 U.S. online broker, were impacted for a period of
time.  The companies involved were victims of "denial of service
attacks", whereby their sites became overwhelmed by traffic.  Yahoo's
site, for instance, was flooded when it received one gigabit, or one
million bits of information, per second.  The Federal Bureau of
Investigation, along with U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, held a
press conference to calm the public and announce a criminal
investigation.

Investors did not react well to news of continued hacker activity,
with Amazon.com shares falling 2 7/8 (-3.46%) to 80 1/4, Yahoo! shares
losing 10 13/16 (-2.90%) to 362 5/16, eBay shares off 5 3/4 (-3.39%)
to 164, and Etrade shares losing 1 1/8 (-4.89%) to 21 7/8.  Meanwhile,
stocks of companies that provide Internet security services benefited
from the news, as Check Point Software Technologies (Nasdaq:CHKP) rose
7 15/16 (+5.67%) to 148, ISS Group (Nasdaq:ISSX) gained 7 7/8
(+10.66%) to 81 3/4, Watchguard Technologies (Nasdaq:WGRD) surged
46.10% (up 15 1/2) to 49 1/8, AXENT Technologies (Nasdaq:AXNT) bolted
21.51% (up 5) to 28 1/4, and Sonic WALL (Nasdaq:SNWL) jumped 16.87%
(up 10 1/2) to 72 3/4.

Shares of SoftNet Systems (Nasdaq:SOFN) fell 2 5/16 (-5.20%) to 42
3/16 despite the company's announcement of a major alliance with
several leading Internet companies.  SoftNet, which is a leading
broadband services provider, said it has joined forces with CMGI
(Nasdaq:CMGI), Compaq Computer (NYSE:CPQ), Nokia (NYSE:NOK) and Cisco
Systems to create SoftNet Zone, which is aimed at providing fast, easy
and secure mobile computing and Internet services to business
travelers.

Other big movers in the tech sector included AT&T (NYSE:T), down 1
9/16 (-3.10%) to 48 13/16, Informix Corp. (Nasdaq:IFMX), up 8.62% (up
1 1/4) to 15 3/4, Juniper Networks (Nasdaq:JNPR), up 10.83% (up 18
3/8) to 188, and Nortel Networks (NYSE:NT), up 3/4 (+0.62%) to 121 3/4
on heavy volume.

Leading Internet and tech stocks performed as follows:

Company                      $ Change   % Change      Close
Amazon (Nasdaq:AMZN)           -2 7/8     -3.46%     80 1/4

I have not heard from you in a while. No news here. Just finishing up
some work. I imagine that you are still busy. Any interesting vacations
in the works? Maybe we can have lunch next week if you are in town. Let
me know if you are available. I need to get downtown more often, and it
would be nice to see you again.

I generally don't forward this kind of stuff but this seemed interesting -

Why not?  I offered him the opportunity to choose his "investment Bar Mitzvah 
gift"!!!!  (or else I make the selection in his behalf)

Yes, but I don't know if he'll answer it.

What is a cardio cath?  Was she having problems.  Zach is not a little guy.  
I'm going for an allergy shot.  I'm so tired that I'm getting to be boring.  
I wish Mother had email.  We could have 3-way discussions.  Sas

You just never know with him.  I'll tell him to write you back, but I can't
force the little guy.
Shirley had a cardiac cath today, and she's fine.
Don't forget about Mother's cataract surgery next Monday.

Love and Kisses

Ed,

Sara asked me to forward this agreement to you.  She said you can send it to 
ABN AMRO Bank.

Kaye

fyi
	
	

Thanks for your time yesterday.

I am working with General Mills to resolve: 1) cross default provision and 2) 
credit matrix.  

Can you fax them today the revised ISDA schedule and credit support annex and 
Enron and General Mills' parent guarantees?  

General Mills will likely present ISDA and draft confirmation to senior 
executives next week for final approval.  Please let me know when documents 
will go out.  Thanks.

The markets ended a volatile week with an afternoon sell off due
to some inflationary economic news and a weak tech sector led
downward by shares of software giant Microsoft Corp.
(Nasdaq:MSFT).  Meanwhile, traders shrugged off news of an
explosion that occurred early this morning only a few blocks from
the New York Stock Exchange.

Investors absorbed some mixed economic data that renewed fears
that the Fed may raise interest rates at its next meeting as a
means of combating inflation.  The Commerce Department revised
upward its U.S. retail sales figures for December, saying retail
sales rose 1.7%, significantly greater than the previously
announced 1.2% increase.  This inflationary news was tempered
somewhat by the Commerce Department's report that retail sales
increased only 0.3% in January, which is lower than the 0.6% gain
expected by economists.  Nonetheless, investors were concerned
because when the Fed raised interest rates at its last meeting,
the members of the FOMC, the Fed's interest rate policy
committee, indicated that they would consider acting again if
inflation pressure continued.

Retail stocks were mixed on the day, with Wal-Mart Stores
(NYSE:WMT) off 13/16 (-1.43%) to 56 3/16, Home Depot (NYSE:HD) up
1/2 (+0.84%) to 60 1/16, JC Penney (NYSE:JCP) down 1/4 (-1.40%)
to 17 5/8, Staples (Nasdaq:SPLS) edging up 1/4 (+0.90%) to 28
1/16, and Costco Wholesale Corp. (Nasdaq:COST) declining 7/16 (-
0.84%) to 51 11/16.

Dell Computer (Nasdaq:DELL) shares slipped 4.95% (down 1 59/64)
to 36 7/8 after the computer maker announced quarterly earnings
late Thursday.  Profits came in at 16 cents per share, beating
revised downward Wall Street estimates of 15 cents per share.
Dell's revenues grew at 31%, which is a slower pace than in
previous periods due to chip supply problems and sales slowdowns
due to Year 2000 concerns of buyers.  Shares of other computer
makers ended with mixed results, with Compaq Computer (NYSE:CPQ)
up 5/8 (+2.50%) to 25 5/8, Apple Computer (Nasdaq:AAPL) down 4
3/4 (-4.19%) to 108 3/4, and Gateway (NYSE:GTW) lower by 2 3/8 (-
4.08%) to 55 7/8.

Despite Dell's strong showing, the tech sector led today's market
decline.  Microsoft Corp. shares were a catalyst for the sell
off, dropping 6 1/16 (-5.72%) to 99 15/16 after a study from
technology consulting firm Gartner Group raised questions about
the compatibility of the soon-to-be-launched Microsoft 2000 with
existing software programs.  Microsoft shares were also hurt by
comments from Michael Dell, CEO of Dell Computer (see above),
suggesting that the Linux operating system, which competes with
Microsoft Windows, was gaining popularity and that business
customers were not showing extraordinary demand for upgrading
hardware systems for Windows 2000.

Other tech sector losers today included International Business
Machines (NYSE:IBM), down 3 13/16 (-3.20%) to 115 5/16, Hewlett-
Packard (NYSE:HWP), down 4 5/8 (-3.67%) to 121 3/8, Motorola
(NYSE:MOT), down 4 1/32 (-2.60%) to 151 1/4, and America Online
(NYSE:AOL), down 1 11/16 (-2.90%) to 56 9/16.

In other large cap news, Dow Chemical (NYSE:DOW) shares edged
lower by 3/16 (-0.18%) to 105 3/4 after the company announced
that its Chairman, Frank Popoff, will retire in November after he
turns 65 and will be succeeded by William Stavropoulos, who
currently serves as President and CEO of the chemical company.

The Internet sector had another break today from the recent spate
of site outages from online hackers.  As the FBI's criminal
investigation continues, the White House said today that
President Clinton will meet with senior government officials and
Internet business leaders to discuss the attacks and online
security issues.  A host of leading Web sites -- including those
of Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO), Amazon.com (Nasdaq:AMZN), eBay
(Nasdaq:EBAY), Buy.com (Nasdaq:BUYX), and CNN, a division of Time
Warner (NYSE:TWX) -=0F- were the targets of the attacks this week.

Competition in the chip sector heated up today after Advanced Micro
Devices (NYSE:AMD) launched a new and faster chip, an 850MHz version of
its AMD Athlon processor, in a challenge to Intel Corp. (Nasdaq:INTC),
the world's leading semiconductor company.  AMD shares were also
impacted after the company's Chairman, W.J. Sanders III, said at a tech
conference that AMD expects its first quarter sales to be consistent
with or slightly higher than those in the seasonally strong fourth
quarter.  AMD shares ended higher by 2 1/2 (+5.88%) to 45 and Intel
shares were off 1 3/4 (-1.63%) to 105 7/8, while Applied Materials
(Nasdaq:AMAT) shares sank 9 3/4 (-5.58%) to 165, Micron Technology
(NYSE:MU) shares were off 1 1/4 (-1.73%) to 71 1/8, Altera
(Nasdaq:ALTR) shares dropped 2 15/16 (-3.85%) to 73 5/16, and Novellus
Systems (Nasdaq:NVLS) shares declined 9.21% (down 5 1/2) to 54 1/4.

Knight/Trimark Group (Nasdaq:NITE) announced that it acquired the
institutional stock business from troubled New York investment
firm D.E. Shaw & Co.  Knight/Trimark said the move is aimed at
growing its business with large institutional investors.  Shares
of the #1 market maker on the Nasdaq stock market fell 3/8 (-
1.14%) to 32 7/16.  Other stocks in the e-finance sector ended
mixed, with Schwab (NYSE:SCH) up 1/2 (+1.30%) to 39, Ameritrade
(Nasdaq:AMTD) down 1/4 (-1.55%) to 15 7/8, DLJ Direct (NYSE:DIR)
jumping 9.32% (up 15/16) to 11, and TD Waterhouse Group
(NYSE:TWE) rising 11/16 (+4.58%) to 15 11/16.

Several stocks in the networking sector succumbed to profit
taking today after the sector received a boost from Cisco
Systems' (Nasdaq:CSCO) earlier this week of better than expected
quarterly earnings and a 2-for-1 stock split.  Today, Cisco
shares gave back 5 (-3.68%) to 130 15/16, while certain other
networking stocks followed suit, including Redback (Nasdaq:RBAK),
down 7 1/2 (-3.36%) to 215 1/2, Nortel Networks (NYSE:NT), down 4
137/256 (-3.69%) to 118 55/256, RealNetworks (Nasdaq:RNWK), down
9 3/8 (-5.02%) to 177 1/2.   Two exceptions were Foundry Networks
(Nasdaq:FDRY), up 1 5/16 (+1.06%) to 124 13/16, and Juniper
Networks (Nasdaq:JNPR), up 7 3/8 (+3.54%) to 215 7/8.

Other big movers in the Internet and technology sectors included:

<> Winstar Communications (Nasdaq:WCII), down 5 (-5.97%) to 78
3/4 despite its announcement yesterday of a lower than expected
quarterly loss of $3.28 a share, compared to analyst estimates of
a $3.38 a share loss.

<> Cognizant Technology Solutions (Nasdaq:CTSH), jumping 6 1/4
(+5.05%) to 130 after the software services company announced a
2-for-1 stock split.

1/4) to 9 9/16 on analyst concerns regarding the company's
financial results.

<> SunGuarda Data Systems (NYSE:SDS), rising 16.23% (up 4 5/8) to
33 1/8 after the computer service and application software
company reported better than expected earnings and was upgraded

6. IPO Commentary

IPO Commentary - http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo
<A HREF=3D"http://www.smartportfolio.com/ipo">AOL users click
here.</A>

The IPO market continues to stand out as an oasis for investors
amid declines in major market indices, even in the tech-heavy
Nasdaq.  Several companies made their public debut and any
worries that investor enthusiasm for IPOs has dried up quickly
evaporated.  Leading the way was webMethods Inc. (Nasdaq:WEBM), a
provider of business-to-business (B2B) services for the e-
commerce sector, whose shares soared 507.50%.  Another strong
performer today was Internet services company Lante Corp.
(Nasdaq:LNTE), which bolted 174.69% on its debut.

One notable exception to the IPO frenzy was Pets.com
(Nasdaq:IPET), which closed unchanged at its offer price of 11 on
the day.  The disappointing performance of Pets.com reinforces
that a company's brand name is less important to investors than
the growth opportunities of the market in which the company
operates.  That is why we continue to see unknown names in the
B2B sector, like webMethods, soar while prominent companies in
slower growth industries, like Pets.com, stagnate.

 Here is the address for the newest most exciting site on the Internet
(Well, we hope it will become exciting)  It all depends on You All.  I've
registered the domain name "Thats-nice.com"  I tried to get "Thatsnice.com"
but it was already taken.  It leads to a non-public page so be careful when
typing the URL (Universal Resource Locater). Type it as
http://www.thats-nice.com and you should get there OK.  Ronnie had trouble
getting it right through her aol browser.  It finally worked by launching
Explorer and entering the URL there.  How's that for a novice (only had
computer three days)?
 It's now up to all of you to send me information and pictures to put on the
page.  We need to keep it a "World Class" psite, so I reserve the right to
discard objectionable material.  Objectional may be defined as anti-white,
anti-black, anti-asian, anti-male, anti-female, anti-pro-life,
anti-pro-choice, anti-gay, anti semitic, anti-yankee, anti-rebel,
anti-blonde, anti-brunette, anti-redhead, anti-democrat, anti republican..
or obscene materials. (well maybe not anti-republican).  You get the idea.
 Lets just not put anything on here that may be offensive to others in the
group.
 I just checked to seewhat happens when mail is sent to anyone
@thats-nice.com.  The result.. it gets returned to sender.  I'm going to get
that fixed so it will ultimately get to me at abarnett@mapus.com.  For now,
please send any e-mail to me at abarnett@mapus.com.  I'll try to get the
stuff up on the site within a few days.

Ms. Shackleton:

I did receive your note the other day, as well as a more recent phone call
from Mr. Brant Reeves.  I apologize for not getting back to you sooner.

As I explained to Ms. Heard a while back, I had placed this in the "going
nowhere" file, given all the work we had put in over here which had
apparently been rejected wholesale by Enron.  If you recall, we had sent
over our so-called "base form" to which Enron responded with a vast array of
comments.  Many of those were incorporated in a redraft, but that effort
went nowhere.

I'll be glad to exhume this file and see where we are, and what our
prospects are for making progress vis-.-vis the others we are working on
over here.

How about 9 am tomorrow morning in my office?

This was the "explanation" that I forwarded to Shari for dealing with 
Canadian utilities, munis, etc.  I'll follow up with her when you have 
identified specific  Canadian counterparties or provinces which are needed 
for EOL.  Sara 
Sara Shackleton
02/01/2000 11:08 AM
Per our conversation with Dan F., ENA needs to understand issues related to 
the distinction between "investor owned utilities" (or "IOUs") and municipal 
utilities (or "municipals") in connection with derivatives activity.  In the 
U.S., this distinction enables us to treat IOUs as general corporates.  Thus, 
we negotiate our standard ISDA Master with an IOU, except that we add an 
Additional Termination Event to prevent the IOU from taking an adverse stance 
in its state public utility commission proceedings.  A copy of that 
Additional Termination Event is attached for your review.  Our approach with 
respect to municipals is dramatically different.  When negotiating an ISDA 
Master with municipals, we use a Schedule modeled after the 1992 U.S. 
Municipal Counterparty Schedule, having additional reps, the added concept of 
"Incipient Illegality" and an enforceability opinion.  A copy of that 
Schedule is also attached for your reference.

We would like to understand whether this distinction also exists in Canada, 
and if so, in all Canadian provinces, and whether there is a distinction when 
a municipal is an investor in an IOU (as we understand that the government 
may assist a utility to emerge from bankruptcy).  In that regard, would you 
recommend that ENA use distinct ISDA Schedules for these types of entities 
and/or would you recommend specific changes to our format?  

 

Is 9 am OK?

As per our previous telephone conversation with respect to a legal seminar in 
Brazil, I would like to discuss with you the most appropriate way to meet the 
expectations of both ESA lawyers and Direct Sales business people.  My idea 
is to organize a 1 or 2 day seminar in S?o Paulo, having Nancy Wodka (B&P) 
and Jos, Em?lio (Tozzini, Freire) talking about international and Brazilian 
legal issues of "Contracting" (focusing on PPAs and equity participation).  I 
would also very much like to have you talking about "Derivatives".  
Additionaly, it would be interesting to have someone from EES (or V&E) to 
talk about "Outsourcing".  I'd like to hear your opinions before contacting 
Nancy and Jose Emilio.  Please be advised that Nancy has indicated to us that 
the Seminar must take place in March.

Thanks for your cooperation.

I will have the letter executed.  I changed references in third to last 
paragraph to read "ECT" rather than "Enron" and replaced Bill Coffman's name 
wtih Robert Loughran, ext. 142.  Do you assume responsibility to transmitting 
to Canadian immigration or do we?  Please explain the process.  Thanks.  Sara

Patricia:  I was wondering if you had an opportunity to speak with any 
persons associated with the Argentine Derivatives Association in connection 
with our discussion of last week.  I can't recall if you were going to try to 
speak with the lawyers for Citibank and/or Morgan to determine whether the 
ADA might welcome our participation in the association, and specifically, 
with respect to the template currently in circulation.  I think you were also 
going to attempt to locate a current membership list for the association.  
Please advise when you have further information.

I am trying to plan several trips to Argentina and Brazil.  I am considering 
a trip to BA during the week of February 28.  Will you be in town that week?  
During my visit, my tax colleague from Houston and I will try to meet with 
local tax consultants and organizations lobbying for tax reformation.  
Regards.  Sara

Dear Sara:

I learned that the proposed draft was up for signature by members of the
association shortly.  The vicechairman of ADA indicated that he thought that
it was late to make suggestions for this round but Enron's participation
would be welcome for future developments.  He confirmed that the model
agreement is aimed at transactions between residents of Argentina where one
of the parties is a local financial entity, and basically at financial
derivatives.  While commodities are mentioned in the draft they are not
aiming at covering commodities derivaties at this stage.  Note that only
banks were backing the project.  I have to confirm all this with the
secretary of the association who I could not reach last week. My list of ADA
members is slightly outdated but I count on obtaining a new from him when I
reach him.

We could arrange meetings with some of this people when you visit.  Maybe we
could organize an informal lunch at the firm One of my colleagues has been
very much involved in lobbying for derivatives tax legislation.  You could
meet with him when you come.

Other news is that they have resubmitted the draft law on netting to
Congress.

Best regards

Patricia

changing tax laws, legislation, and "local" derivatives trading, and sitting 
down with Mike Guerriero to establish an "action plan".  The monthly swap 
calendar does not indicate other lawyers out of the office during that week.  
Please note this on the group calendar.  Thanks.  Sara

addressed.

Patricia:  Thanks very much for your quick response.  I would very much like 
to solicit your help in arranging some meetings when Lynn Aven (tax) and I 
visit BA in two weeks.  We definitely want to meet with one or more members 
of the ADA who are responsible for drafting and implementing the new 
agreement.  And your suggestion to meet with your colleague who has been 
lobbying for derivatives tax legislation is one we readily accept.  Could you 
possible try to schedule these for convenient times on Tuesday and Wednesday, 
February 29 and March 1, respectively?  I will be out of the office tomorrow 
but in next week.  Enron is closed on Monday,  February 21 for President's 
Day.  Let me know if you would like to speak directly of if I can assist in 
any way.  Looking forward to our visit.  Sara

FROM:  Anita and Steve

On Sunday, February 20, 2000, just before the start of the Daytona 500, in
front of Mark Martin's car (#6, of course), Allison Sher and Adam Feinberg
were engaged.  The future bride had no idea beforehand but read her proposal
in the Winston Times, a NASCAR newspaper.  No wedding date has been set,
since the future bride is still in shock!

Note also that Allison's e-mail address should be changed to albsher@juno com
(home instead of work).

I will not be able to attend this afternoon's meeting as I have a doctor's 
appointment.  Also, I am looking forward to hearing details of Friday's 
luncheon.  Thanks.  Sara

Please see attahed.  Let me know if you have questions about the  option

In connection with the trip to BA next week, I am having some problems 
scheduling meetings with other consultants and would like to know whether you 
have been able to schedule a meeting on Tuesday (Feb. 29) or Wednesday (March 
1) with your colleagues and/or the ADA.  I would appreciate hearing from you

call me tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara

I'm receiving mine!!!  But I'll be in Buenos Aires next week so I'll keep my 
fingers crossed that my computer is working (in the event any further earth 
shattering Lehrer family announcements occur).  My mom does not know how to 
turn the computer on but she does have an email address.  We better wait 
until she "gets comfortable" with the concept of email before handing out her 
address.  At this very minute, my dad is returning from a convention in 
Atlantic City.  He called me from the airport on his CELL PHONE.  You see, it 
took me some time to get him to carry his cell phone with him.  I'VE 
SUCCEEDED!  Talk to you soon, Mr. Webmaster.  Sara

I met with Gary today and he said he was not getting any of my e-mails.  I'm
sending this to the group to verify addresses.  Please reply to confirm
receipt.

Tracy:

We reached basic agreement with Arco Products Company on a 1 year deal as 
summarized on the attached draft contract (this contract needs some work, but 
you can get the gist of it). It is like the Delano deal, but with no 
Ancillary Sercvices.  Could you please do a credit review for preparation of 
a Master and send it to Christian?  We have told them they would have a draft 
master by Monday of next week.  I am working on wrapping the Confirm into 
shape.

The counterparty will be Atlantic Richield Company.  They will not give us a 
corporate guaranty, but they want a guaranty from us.  We have a swap deal 
with them in place.  It was done as a one-off transaction (not a master).  
Sara Shackleton was our attorney repsonsible for that deal.  Enron Corp. 
posted a guaranty on that deal that I think has some negotiated terms and 
conditions.  They want to use the exact same pro forma.  Culd you find that 
and begin the process of getting one for this new deal?

Arco is concerned about set offs amongst various Arco facilities.  They want 
to limit this transaction to a single generation facility.  Is this OK?

PS  What is Enron Credit.com?  Do you have any options on the equity offering?

That will work just fine!  Just let me know where to meet.  SS

1.  Do you and Andrea want to be included?  Any commercial people?

We do not have the answer for you at this time.  It must be researched.  Sara

   

Please forward a legal opinion regarding the below attached request by Cabot

All,

Cabot Oil and Gas Corporation has requested that all Derivative Confirmations 
be handled via e-mail rather than fax.  Is this ok with Legal?  I have faxed 
the letter to x3490 to Susan Bailey's attention.

Thanks,
Joe

Whatever you can do is most welcome.  We are only limited by time.  We have 
set aside the entire day of Wednesday, March 1 for you to schedule.  We can 
also be available late Monday afternoon, February 28.  I will advise shortly 
with respect to local invitees.  Thanks very much.  Sara

 Sara:  Trucco from Citi just confirmed.  I wondered wheter you would
be interested in meeting with one of the directors of the CNV who is in
charge of derivatives issues.  I could try to arrange a meeting if he is in
BA.  Please confirm.

 Who should we invite to the lunch from your local office?

Do any of you guys know about this deal?
Scott Sefton
02/24/2000 11:32 AM
Mark,

I finally got to speak with Mike yesterday. The short answer is that Nora 
Dobin in Global Finance legal will be your contact person on everything other 
than the swap. Mark Taylor (or his designee) will handle the swap.

We will rely heavily on Ron Astin and Trena Chandler of V&E to assist us on 
the Whitewing issues. In case you didn't know, Ron and Trena represented us 
in the creation of Whitewing (and its holding company Condor) and have been 
involved in all the subsequent Condor/Whitewing transactions. Because Jeff 
Eldredge has a significant role in Margaux, I hope having V&E involved here 
and in London will facilitate coordination on these issues.

Cheers
Scott

Mark Evans
02/24/2000 08:55 AM
Scott,

in Cynthia's absence, can you allocate someone else from your group to 
oversee this? As you can see, we are in need of some immediate assistance on 
Whitewing.

Did you get the chance to speak to Mike Jakubik about Margaux? Can you help 
out with Houston coordination or shall I just get on with it with Mark Taylor 
and Jeff Hodge?

Thanks.

         Mark

Stuart Schardin
24/02/2000 11:52
Ron/Trina/Ben,

I wanted to touch base with you on some Margaux-related issues for Whitewing 
and determine what the appropriate course of action is.  

As a brief description of the Margaux transaction, in case you have not been 
updated recently, the Margaux transaction will now occur through the 
synthetic transfer of risk to the Noteholders/Margaux equity.  The method by 
which this occurs is as follows.  Whitewing continues to hold the equity 
interests in the assets (excluding 56% of Trakya, ETOL, approx. 31.25% of 
Sutton Bridge, 50% of Nowa Sarzyna, and approx. 50% of Teesside, all of which 
are held by Enron).  Whitewing enters into a fixed for floating swap with 
ENA, with Whitewing making a fixed annual payment to ENA in an amount 
representing the base case cash flows of the underlying assets and ENA making 
a floating payment to Whitewing that is initially equal to the fixed payment 
from Whitewing but is adjusted downward if certain identified negative things 
happen at the various projects (thereby transferring certain of the risks of 
the projects through the floating leg).  Concurrently, Margaux (the Issuer) 
raises approx. $511 mm of capital and, through a whollly-owned subsidiary, 
purchases the floating leg (receiveable) from Whitewing for $511 MM.  In 
other words, Whitewing enters into the swap and immediately monetizes its 
receiveable to Margaux.  The net result is that Whitewing receives cash 
proceeds up front, and has a fixed payment obligation to ENA, and ENA has a 
floating payment obligation to Margaux.  I've attached a structure diagram 
below.

With this in mind, the following issues related to Whitewing have arisen.  
The tax group would like to characterize the payment ENA receives from 
Whitewing as a preferred partnership distribution (see attached note from 
Donette Dewar below).  My question is how do we achieve this result.  First, 
is Whitewing LP able to enter into this transaction itself, or does it need 
to occur at a subsidiary level?  In other words, does the swap fall under the 
definition of "Indebtedness" (clause (viii) perhaps?) in the Whitewing LP 
Agreement, which is prohibited at the Whitewing level?  If it cannot, is SE 
Acquisition the best candidate to be ENA's counterparty, or do we run into 
issues with the Natwest facility (although they'd likely consent since they 
will get repaid out of the proceeds of the transaction)?  Once the issue of 
who is the appropriate counterparty has been determined, we need to discuss 
the mechanics by which we effect the transaction.  If we are indeed going to 
open up the Whitewing LP Agreement, I suspect that AnnMarie will need to 
revisit the Allocation and Distribution sections, which is probably no easy 
task.  If not, and the transaction will occur at a subsidiary level, we need 
to determine where.  Also, I'm sure this transaction will require 
Certificateholder approval as it is in excess of the $40mm threshold.  A 
final logistical issue that Donette raises in her note is who will be 
responsible for the legal work required at the Whitewing level.

More generally, are there any other legal or other issues that you see with 
respect to this transaction from a Whitewing perspective?

If you'd like to discuss the transaction further, please let me know.  I'll 
be in Houston the early part of next week, so perhaps we can spend some time 
discussing these issues then.  Thanks, and I look forward to seeing you next 
week.

Best regards,

Stuart

finalyzing Margaux!  Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can help you 
with anything in the future!  All the best!

these questions need to be directed to the Whitewing legal team. I believe 
this is Cynthia Harkness. I will then work with Cynthia to ensure her efforts 
are coordinated with ours.

Donette Dewar
23/02/2000 17:19
As you may recall, the tax comments to the debt term sheet reflected a need 
for an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement to admit ENA as a 
partner. You also may recall that we briefly discussed the potential for 
legal/accounting/other issues that may arise as a result of any such 
amendment.  So that the Whitewing process can be moved forward, would you 
please consider the following:

1. Have any legal/accounting/other issues been identified as resulting from 
an amendment to the Whitewing partnership agreement?

2. If so, what are the potential solutions to any such issues?

3. Have definite conclusions been reached regarding the economics of ENA's 
preferred return on the Whitewing interest, such that a draft of the 
necessary partnership allocations can be undertaken?

4. Has a decision been made regarding who will be charged with drafting the 
amendments?  Will it be the Margaux legal team?  The Houston Global Finance 
legal group?  Other??

Thanks, in advance, for your consideration of these issues.

Kindest Regards,

DMD

Do I need to put the "Sample Contract" disclaimer at the top of the document 
you sent me when we send it to counterparties for review?

It's OK this time.  The Determination Period in this confirm is confusing; 
exchange-based price sources should be tied to the delivery 
month/Determination Period.

Sara, 

Sharon at Cargill called in regards to deal EW5791.1.  She wants to see if we 
can delete the Effective Date and Termination Date on the confirmation.

(Since the term is defined in the Determination Period, she thought it would 
be less confusing.)

Let me know what you think....

Bernice

Patricia:  Thanks for putting the meetings together.  In addition to Lynn 
Aven and me, both Andrea Calo and Brent Hendry would like to attend.  I'm 
looking forward to visiting with you next week.  Regards.  Sara

I received a message from Augustin David to return his call to discuss the 
master.  The number he left rings but does not answer.  I have tried calling 
several times.  Maybe we can talk to him next week when I am in BA.  Sara

I'll let them know. It's very possible that one or both will be unable to 
attend due to the office activity but they both want to be available.  Thanks 
again.  Sara

OK, with pleasure.  Do you convene them or shall I call them?

Sami and Sara,
As i've promised, here is a draft of the report we present every week during 
the Origination staff meeting. I will send you a more updated version as soon 
as i get all the updates. Any doubts, fell free to contact me. Sincerely,
Marcelo Rassekh

FYI - Shari Stack is negotiating the brokerage agreement with Banc One and 
there seems to be an issue over the interest rate.  Needless to say, I have 
never had any conversations with Banc One over this issue.  SS
Shari Stack
02/25/2000 06:52 PM
Just to let you know that I checked with Sara Shackleton and she said that no 
interest rate has been agreed in her documents. In fact I was just copied on 
some documents sent to her by Ken Fatur. I think they have been going back & 
forth for some time over whose form to use.

Anyway, Sara is out of town on business all of next week. Even when she gets 
back - I do not know when this doc. will get finalized. 

If you would like to have the Brokerage Agreement signed in the near future,  
I would suggest we agree to the Fed Funds O'night Rate in the Brokerage 
Document and then replicate that in the document you (or Ken) will negotiate 
with Sara to avoid the mismatch problem you mentioned on the phone.  My 
Credit Dep't was not too keen to use the "Call Money Rate". In most if not 
all of our Brokerage Agreements - we use the Fed Funds O'night Rate. 

If that is OK - pls let me know and I will arrange for the doc's to be 
executed. 

Kind regards, 

Shari  

Carol:  I'm glad you've identified these specific line items.  I think credit 
should have a "separate worksheet" and make a determination for each question 
you've listed.  For exampe, I think the GP should be a Specified Entity.  One 
issue I've experienced with credit is the existence of several LPs in a given 
structure, only one of which owns any operating assets, and there are no 
financials for that LP, but only financials on a consolidated basis at a 
different level.  How does credit identify the counterparty, much less 
determine if that counterparty is an ESP?

I also wonder how many partnerships we have agreements with which may be 
inadequate.  And, when credit approves omnibus Transactions with a 
partnership, is it making a sufficient analysis?  A separate list would help 
in the evaluation.

Are we going to have another credit lunch?  Hope all is going well.  Sara   

Carol St Clair
02/28/2000 12:11 PM
Although we didn't get to discuss this at our credit luncheon, particularly 
we some of the less-experienced credit folks, when we receive a worksheet 
from them where the counterparty is a limited partnership, it may be 
advisable to ask them the following questions:

1. Should the GP be designated as a Specified Entity?  The alternative may be 
to require the GP to sign a Guaranty and then they would become a credit 
support provider.  By making the GP a Specified Entity, they get picked up in 
the cross default, bankruptcy and credit event upon merger provisions.

2. Should there be an additional termination event or event of default that 
gets triggered if the GP fails to be the GP of the limited partnership?

3. Whose financials are they expecting to receive, the GP's or the LP's?

4. If there are financial tests, who do they pertain to, the GP or the LP?

5. How does the LP qualify as an ESP?  Particularly with some of the less 
experienced credit folks who have not had to deal with this issue on the 
physical side, maybe this question should always be asked for every 
counterparty just to be safe.

Let me know what you think.

Carol 

Brent, Andrea and I were hoping you might be available for a 30-minute call 
on Tuesday after 5pm (BA time) or 2pm (Houston time) on Tuesday, Feb. 29.  
The BA office had a meeting last Friday afternoon and has apparently set some 
rather lofty goals, such as online trading for Q3, etc.  Please let me or 
Brent know if you are available and/or alternative times.  

Tomorrow we meet with the American Chamber of Commerce, Wed. with Marval and 
the ADA and the Securities Commission, and Thursday with tax consultants.  
Also, I need to talk with you about Brazil when I return.  Sami has been 
diligent about forwarding deal flow information and there are a ton of 
references to PPA's and SWAPS.  We are still trying to get our arms around 
all the business units in Brazil to track their activity.  Have you heard 
from Yao?  This international position may be right up his alley. Sara 

Attached is the origination list from Brazil. SS

we received on Friday.  There are multiple references to swaps.  We need to 
talk. I'm in Argentina and may not make the call tomorrow because I have 
meeting outside the office.  I'll try to call you tomorrow.  sara

With respect to this counterparty, you may continue to agree to these 
IDENTICAL early termination provisions until otherwise notified by credit.  SS

All,

Attached is the lastest version of the captioned Schedule (dated 3/1/2000).   
In order to keep everyone abreast of the financial master agreement 
developments in Argentina, this Schedule will be issued monthly on the first 
day of every month -- beginning March 1st.

     

I think that the reference may be in the setoff clause and the CP was trying 
to exclude "other Transactions" and limit setoff to derivatives only.  
Unfortunately, I don't have the form with me.  SS

I have forwarded to Marie Heard by interoffice mail a copy of deal NA1573.1.  
Whomever is available to review this confirm please check   Annex  A , page 
2, paragraph #5, line #5;  c/p added the word "derivatives" between the words 
"such - amount".  Back on 3/3/1999  legal  did  not  approve  this  same 
request  by these same counterparties.  Has  there been any  change in this 
opinion?  I  am  currently  holding every executed confirm received from 
these counterparties because  of  this  discrepancy.  Please advise asap.  
Thanks,  Willie, 3-9226

Just kidding!  I'm fine.  I've been cut off twice on telephone calls to the 
states so I may have problems calling you in the next hour or so when I leave 
the office.  FYI:
NTAP closed at 188-3/4 and CISCO closed at 132-3/16.  It's too early for the 
mutual fund reports.  The weather is again gorgeous; we had empanadas for 
lunch and they were much better than tamales.  I read the tamale article in 
the Oxford American and it talked about the tamale man in Greenville, MS 
(whose name was Six Sixty-Six, being the sign of the devil so the tamales 
were really HOT).  Tomorrow we meet with another law firm.  Thursday and 
Friday I meet with the commercial people about ISDA agreements and one 
business customer is flying in from the province of Mendoza to discuss an 
agreement.  I'll call you later and I'm going to try to go to bed earlier 
tonight (I'll try to call after 9pm BA time).  Love, the DG

Would you please add me to th distribution list for clippings.  Thanks.  Sara

BRAZIL: MEETING OF MAE ON FEBRUARY 29TH
Gazeta Mercantil, 29 Feb 2000, p. A-15:-
 Companies which are part of the MAE (Electricity Wholesale Market) will hold 
a general meeting on February 29th 2000 with the intention to discuss the new 
rules for the operations of the sector.
The companies will discuss, for example, one resolution taken on February 
25th which concedes credits for the companies and other which increases the 
number of available plants to operate in peak periods.

BRAZIL: RURAL ELECTRIFICATION IN RIO DE JANEIRO
Gazeta Mercantil, 29 Feb 2000, p. a-13:-
 According to the president of the Brazilian electricity company Cerj, 
Alejandro Danus, the company has already informed the Brazilian Ministry of 
Mining and Energy that it will join the rural electrification program 'Luz no 
Campo' of the ministry, expecting to sign the contract in 15 days.
The two other electricity concessionaires which operate in the state of Rio 
de Janeiro had already agreed to join the program, but Cerj took longer to 
reach the same decision because it was analysing which technology should be 
used in its concession area. Cerj is expected to invest R$ 60mn in the area, 
mainly in the north of the state, benefiting 30,000 families which still do 
not have access to electricity.

BRAZIL ANGRA-2 TO START OPERATIONS 
Folha de S.Paulo, 27 Feb 2000, p. 1-14:-
 The Brazilian National Nuclear Energy Commission (Cnen) established the 
deadline of March 15th 2000 to release an authorisation for the operation of 
the nuclear power station Angra 2 of the Brazilian state-owned nuclear 
electricity company Eletronuclear in the Brazilian city of Angra dos Reis 
(state of Rio de Janeiro).
With the authorisation, Angra 2 can begin to charge its reactor, testing and 
inspecting safety after that. If everything is successful, the power station 
ill begin to generate electricity in the end of April 2000 and generating 
1,245 MW 3 months after that. But this time may be much longer, considering 
that the previous nuclear power station Angra 1 took more than 3 years to 
operate commercially after the charging. 

BRAZIL: ELETROSUL IN POWER TRANSMISSION LINE
Gazeta Mercantil, 29 Feb 2000, p. a-13:-
 Groups which want to compete in the tender for the construction of a power 
transmission line between the Brazilian cities of Campos Novos and Blumenau 
(state of Santa Catarina) must be qualified until March 15th 2000.
The company Eletrosul, a subsidiary of the Brazilian state-owned electricity 
company Eletrobras, will compete in the tender alone (not participating in 
any consortium).
Eletrosul signed pre-contracts with the companies ABB (Asea Brown Boveri) and 
Siemens which will conduct works and supply equipment (Eletrosul will operate 
the lines).

ARGENTINA: IMPACT OF POWERGEN'S ACQUISITION
El Cronista Comercial, 29 Feb 2000, p. 15:-
 With the acquisition of US-based LG&E Energy for US$ 5.4bn, UK-based 
PowerGen will become the owner of stakes in Argentina's gas distribution 
companies Gas Natural BAN, Distribuidora de Gas del Centro and Cuyana. LG&E 
has 1mn clients in Kentucky, Virginia, Spain and Argentina. 

BRAZIL: FREE IMPORT OF FUEL POSTPONEMENT
O Estado de S.Paulo, 26 Feb 2000, p. b-1:-
 The Brazilian executive-secretary of the Ministry of Treasury, Amaury Bier, 
declared on February 25th 2000 that the Brazilian market of oil and 
derivatives will be opened only in January 2001, and not in August 2000, as 
predicted in the Oil Law.
The federal government will propose the change of this date to the Congress 
through a draft law.
The reason for this measure, according to Bier, is that the oil sector is 
currently too confused. He also informed that the government did not create a 
substitute for the Specific Price Parcel (PPE) yet. The PPE is the part of 
the fuel price which maintains the oil account.

BRAZIL: INCREASE OF FUELS PRICES
O Estado de S.Paulo, 26 Feb 2000, p. B-1:-
 The executive-secretary of the Brazilian Ministry of Treasury, Amaury Bier, 
announced on February 25th 2000 that the following fuels will have their 
prices increased on March 1st 2000:
- gasoline and diesel oil by 7% in the refineries and
- kerosene for aircraft by 23%. 
According to government estimations, this increase of gasoline prices in 
refineries will result in an increase by 5% in gas stations, for final 
consumers. The increase of the kerosene will result in an increase by 3% in 
flights tickets prices.

BRAZIL: OIL SPILLAGE IN PARA
Folha de S.Paulo, 29 Feb 2000, p. 3-8:-
 The Brazilian subsidiary of the American oil company Texaco will keep 
cleaning the river Para probably by the first weekend of March 2000.
The company already removed 25% of the total 1.9 tonnes of fuel BPF spilled 
in the river.

ARGENTINA: LOWERING TAXES, IMPOSSIBLE FOR NOW
El Cronista Comercial, 29 Feb 2000, p.2:-
 Officials at the Argentine Revenue Service warn that it would be impossible 
to lower taxes for now. Many are requesting that fuel and value added taxes 
be lowered but this would mean US$ 2bn less in government revenues. When 
considering the government fiscal deficit, it is easy to understand why the 
government must look toward solutions that would increase tax collection and 
not reduce it.

ECUADOR: EDC PLANS TO EXPLOIT GAS
El Comercio (Ecuador), 29 Feb 2000, p. 1:-
 The firm, Energy Development Corporation (EDC) announced that it will invest 
some US$ 100mn in a project to exploit natural gas in the coastal zone of 
Ecuador. Drilling is scheduled to begin in May 2000 with production entering 
the first phase in the 3rd quarter of 2001 with 32mn cubic feet daily, enough 
to generate 204 megawatts of electrical energy.

SPAIN: REPSOL YPF'S STRATEGIC PLANS
Cinco Dias, 29 Feb 2000, p.5:-
 Spanish oil operator Respsol YPF, which has broken its agreement with 
Spanish electricity operator Iberdrola, intends to operate in the electricity 
market in countries where it is active in gas business, particularly 
Argentina, Brazil and Spain.
On the other hand, negotiations between Repsol YPF and Italian oil operator 
ENI (Ente Nazionale d'Idrocarburi) are taking place.  In any case, eventual 
agreements will be implemented when ENI's privatisation process will conclude.
Additionally, the Spanish group expects to reduce nearly Euro 520mn costs by 
2002, mainly through workforce reduction.

ARGENTINA: SALE OF CGC
La Nacion (Argentina), 29 Feb 2000, p. 2/1:-
 The investment banks Dresdner Kleinwort Benson and Dresdner Bank are close 
to a contract to take charge of the sale of a 51% stake in the Argentine oil 
company Compania General de Combustibles (CGC), owned by Sociedad Comercial 
del Plata (Soldati group).

BOLIVIA: CHACO SEEKS NEW CLIENTS
Los Tiempos (Bolivia), 29 Feb 2000, p. on line:-
 Bolivia's oil and gas firm Chaco announced it is concentrating its efforts 
on gaining new clients for the gas it plans to trade from Bolivia to Brazil. 
The firm will place in Brazil 30mn cubic metres of gas per day during a 
20-year term, according to the contract it signed with the Brazilian 
government. Early in 1999, Chaco was negotiating a contract with Pan American 
Energy which failed due to the opposition of YPF, the Argentine oil company.

BOLIVIA/BRAZIL: COMPANIES TO TRADE GAS 
El Diario (Bolivia), 29 Feb 2000, p. on line:-
 Bolivia's oil and gas company YPFB informed eight firms will export some 
9.1mn cubic metres of gas per day from Bolivia to Brazil during the year 
2000, according to the terms fixed in the contract signed between both 
countries. The amount to be traded per company is as follows:

Firm     Cubic metres per day

Andina     1.86mn

Chaco     1.52mn

Tesoro (British Gas)   1.43mn

Vintage     1.36mn

Perez Companc   1.21mn

Petrobras    0.8mn

Maxus     0.67mn

Dong Won    0.25mn

TOTAL     9.1mn

Dow Industrials                  +89.66     +0.89%   10128.31

Internet Stock Index             +32.33     +3.37%     991.92

Blue chips powered forward and sent the Dow higher on Tuesday,
while Internet and tech stocks thrust the Nasdaq to another
record high as investors put away their fears about market
volatility and potential interest rate hikes by the Fed.

Several sectors that had been suffering from beaten-down stocks
rallied back today, including the financial services sector, as

The Nasdaq's surge resulted in several record highs during the
day's trading for a broad range of Internet and tech stocks,
including Brocade Communications (Nasdaq:BRCD), which gained 6

which rose 19 5/8 (+7.68%) to 275 1/16, PMC-Sierra

Chip stocks were a driving force behind the Nasdaq's strong
performance, as analysts and investors anticipate a huge demand
for computer memory chips to run wireless products such as hand-
held organizers and cellular telephones.  Altera (Nasdaq:ALTR)
closed up 8 1/4 (+11.54%) to 79 3/4, Lam Research (Nasdaq:LRCX)
jumped 13.08% (up 18 1/16) to 156 1/8, Xilinx (Nasdaq:XLNX)

Leading Tuesday's telecom news was the announcement by TeleCorp
PCS (Nasdaq:TLCP), AT&T Corp.'s (NYSE:T) largest wireless
telephone partner, that it will acquire Tritel Inc.
(Nasdaq:TTEL), AT&T's #2 wireless affiliate, in a transaction
valued at $5 billion.  The deal would result in a combined
company having a contiguous wireless network running from the
Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.  Pursuant to the agreement,
AT&T will obtain TeleCorp's existing wireless operations in the
Boston area in exchange for $100 million in cash, as well as

announced on Tuesday that the companies will open up their cable
television systems to other Internet service providers upon the
completion of their blockbuster merger.  The move was seen by
analysts as a potential catalyst for the rest of the industry to
follow suit.  Specifically, the pledge to give customers greater
choices could put tremendous pressure on long-distance phone and
cable television operators, including telecom giant AT&T, to
further open their systems to rival Web-access providers.
Shares of AOL, the #1 Internet service provider, fell 1 11/16 (-
2.78%) to 58 15/16, while shares of Time Warner, the world's

per share from $14-$16 per share.  The public offering of 23
million shares could now generate as much as $736 million.

<> SpeedUs.com (Nasdaq:SPDE), which skyrocketed 136.69% (up 11
7/8) to 20 9/16, riding on the wave of popularity among

to 298 1/2 following yesterday's positive remarks from Lehman

I hope you are doing well.  I finally have my laptop so I can at least read 
email during the day.  The weather here is gorgeous.  It's about 72 during 
the day and cooler at night.  We went to a restaurant that had a "tunnel of 
fudge" por d'creme.  Someone at the table said there is a similar recipe in 
the Charlie Trotter cookbook.  Do you have that cookbook?  I know you have a 
lot of them.  I fly hime Friday night and arrive in Houston on Saturday 
morning at 6:30 am.  Mike should be waiting for me at my house and I can't 
wait to see the Phoebe and sports dog a/k/a Chloe.  How's mother and daddy?  
I can't send mother email because she may pick it up on her voice mail. Love, 
sas

PS  Are you working on Friday?

When do I get to see you?  What are you doing for the fourth?  When are you 
going to visit Miami?  When do you want to eat sushi?  SS

Hi Beautiful,
Top of the morning to you.

Continental Airlines and PACE Theatrical Group are pleased to offer OnePass 
members a 20% ticket discount on all ticket levels for the preview 
performances of the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical masterpiece, 
Ragtime.  The show is coming to Houston's Jones Hall, with the special 
preview performances showing July 31 and August 1.  Ragtime tells the 
remarkable story of three American families at the beginning of the Twentieth 
Century whose lives become dramatically intertwined as they are caught up in 
the events of a young, turbulent country.

To redeem this special discount opportunity, OnePass members should call 
Ticketmaster at 713-629-3700 and mention ticket type code "L-type". 
Continental is the official and exclusive airline of the Houston MasterCard 
Broadway Series.

I have meetings this morning with the Marval firm but was hoping you could 
help out here.
1.  Could you please check with the Alley Theatre Box Office and find out if 
I have tickets for a performance this Friday night (March 3).  They will 
check under the name "McKeogh" and my local phone number "713 664-3207".  
Just let me know so that I can figure out what to do.

2.  Could you please change my McDonald's phone call presently scheduled for 
1pm (BA time) tomorrow.  I would need to reschedule through Mike Irgang(info 
in lotus notes) at McDonald's and let Ed Quinn know.  My BA schedule is on my 
calendar.

3.  I am tentatively planning a trip to Sao Paulo.  I will stay from 3/17 
through 3/27.  However, I need to arrive on 3/16 and depart on 3/28.  Could 
you please check flight availability?  I first need to clear through Mark 
Taylor and I will copy you on that message.

Thanks. for now.

Mark:  I have been in touch with Sami Arap who is now Andrea Bertone's boss.  
There are currently two seminars scheduled in Sao Paulo aimed for the 
commercial group and the lawyers as follows:

1.  March 17 - Milbank Tweed  (Securitization)
2.  March 27 - Bracewell (legal issues for contracts)

I think I should attend these and was considering a trip to arrive before the 
start and after the termination of the seminars (approx March 15 - March 
28).  In the interim I could (hopefully) wrap up financial issues with 
Tozzini and address at length physical issues with Tozzini.  Also, I can 
speak with commercial groups and plan a "swap"seminar for the commercial and 
legal groups (date TBD but probably after the legal seminar in San Antonio).  
Please let me know if the timing works for our group in Houston and if you 
have other thoughts.   Hope all is well.  Sara

You are brilliant!  Thanks for your help.  Sara

I called the theatre again (713-228-8421).  He ran a profile on McKeogh and 
said the next performance you have tickets for is March 24 for Hay Fever.

Sara Shackleton
03/01/2000 01:27 PM
The Alley is NOT holding any tickets for me.  All I want to know is whether 
"McKeogh" at "713-664-3207" has a ticket for a performance on Friday, March 3 
since I do not have the tickets in front of me.  They should be able to tell 
you or just email the Box Office phone number to me. Also, I can't do 
anything about flights until I return to Houston on Monday.  Thanks.  SS

Kaye Ellis
03/01/2000 11:17 AM
I've called the Alley Theatre.  They wanted to know when the tickets were 
purchased, if they were purchased with a credit card, was a confirmation 
number given at the end of the transaction and were they for Hay Fever?  
Since I didn't know the answer to any of his questions, I said "Can you just 
check to see if there are any tickets waiting to be picked up for McKeogh".  
He said there were not any tickets to be picked up for McKeogh for Hay Fever 
on March 3.  He acted like there is more than one production being done.

Hi Felix!  I return from Argentina this weekend.  I am having some problems 
with the laptop which I'll need you to adjust upon my return. I am traveling 
with an ESA person from Houston who has a laptop and never experiences any of 
the daily problems which I have.  The problems are:

1.  Immediately upon logging in each day, I receive the following message:  
"This install. will install CITRIX ICA Client  - YES or NO"

2.  "Unable to load workspace file destop.dsk.  File is in use by another 
program.  Delete the file and create a new workspace?"

Also, the screen freezes frequently and I'm not sure what this is related 
to.  I can't use the laptop offline to even get into word.  
When can we review these problems?  Thanks.  Sara

Rod and Susan:  I met with the counterparty and lawyer last week.  Following 
are the results:
Rod:  CP would like a phone call to discuss the Schedule and CSA.  They 
mainly want explanations as to why ENA made the elections in the docs for:
 1.  p.1 Cross Default Threshold
 2.  p. 2 Additional Event of Default, part (xi)
 3.  p. 4  issue providing Quarterly Unaudited Consolidated financials
 4.  CSA p.2:  How was Collateral Threshold determined

Susan:  CP would like the following:
1.  Schedule p. 3:  sample certificates per third entry for docs to be 
delivered
 2,   "                p. 5:  need to get address
 3.   "                p. 6:  Process Agent.  Need to provide CP into on CT 
Corp.

You will need to speak with Julian Poole because the CP has fairly good 
English (the lawyer does not speak English) and Julian may want to schedule 
the call.  I don't know how quickly the CP will want to act because there is 
a Stamp Tax issue to be resolved.  Thanks.  Sara 

Lynn:  I would like to standardize procedures for Argentina as much as 
possible (this week while fresh in my mind).  Attached is Julian's message to 
Houston.  Is this OK to put into email?  Let me know when you have time to 
breathe.  Also, in terms of an updated memo on Argentina issues, should I add 
to what you write or vice-versa?  My thought is to essentially update/modify 
the legal memo written in Dec., 1997 that Brent gave to us.  Let me know.  
Thanks.  Sara

Sheetal,
As per our prior conversation, I would need you to put this confirm I've 
attached into a proper draft format. I've based the confirm on a prior draft 
that Joe Hunter sent me. Make sure to include the language "For discussion 
purposes only". You can contact Susan Bailey for any questions on the current 
ISDA in place with Duke.
Rod, I'll need you to sign off on the credit side, although I believe it will 
not be a problem. Pls. let us know asap.

The status of this deal is urgent. We are aiming at closing it on Monday.
Thanks for your support and give me a call if you have any question.

Regards, Julian

Per my email, you will need Julian on the phone due to the language problem.  
All else is in Lotus Notes.  Sara

   
	
	

I am ready to call the cp to discuss credit issues.  Will you be on the

Won't you carve your deal out of the Threshold for your "Deemed ISDA"?

So long as they adopt 10a as well--that is what we are doing.  We will need to be careful as and when this is finalized to segregate threshold etc. for the prepay deal.  
Also, talk to Musch re tax rep.
Mary:  FYI , just spoke with Anita Khosla.  The ENA ISDA with CSFB will be with the head banking office in Zurich and we will identify the branches with which we anticipate business, including at the moment, NY, London, Cayman Islands.  I have received comments to our Schedule and CSA.

Sara,

Attached is the initial draft of the term sheet prepared by Bear Stearns for use in connection with Project Bruin. I hope that the e-mails I am forwarding to you are sufficient to give you an idea of the nature and intended accomplishments of the exercise.

Now that I am re-reading the message from Tom Blair of Bear Stearns, I see that he intended to follow up with additional detailed term sheets. I will ask whether those have been provided to us and forward them to you in the event we have them.

Paul

fyi.

Kevin,

Please find following an indicative term-sheet for your/team's review.
While there are three simultaneous trades occuring at the same time, Davis
wanted one term-sheet to use for your internal conversations for simlplicity
sake.  We will have additional term-sheets available for all three
components of the trade tomorrow.  I will make sure you have a summary pitch
book available to discuss the merits/risks of the trade by Friday.  

Speak with you in the am.

Best.

Tom,

Tanya:  Enron Corp. wants to transact with FTU.  I sent FTU a "blank" Paragraph 13 subject to ENA's credit review.  Can you give me a call about this one?  The FTU lawyer is calling me and already has comments to our draft Paragraph 13.  Thanks.  Sara

Tanya:  FTU has asked to resume negotiations on the ISDA.  We originally sent our draft without a Paragraph 13 and FTU wants a Paragraph 13 (similar to the one FTU negotiated with ENA).  If you are agreeable to credit, can you please propose a credit worksheet?

FYI - this impacts EOL trades; didn't know if you were aware of these issues.

I think it would be a good idea for us all to get together and discuss this isssue from a legal and credit perspective.

Regards,

Wendi LeBrocq

Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to "train" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.

Bill--

Russell

My view would be to follow the novation route, i.e. 

1.	C/P trades via EOL with ECTRIC
2.	Each trade is novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and treated as concluded under ENA ISDA Master
3.	ENA enters into back-to-back trade with ECTRIC

This does mean that the C/P must initially accept the European EOL GTCs, though if we set up a mechanism whereby EOL trades are automatically novated to ENA and treated as concluded under the ENA ISDA Master, this effectively cancels out the EOL GTCs.

Justin

Everyone -

Our hedge fund group needs clarification on the issue of doing Brent and other European product deals w/ our hedge fund counterparties and booking them back to ENA, the entity with which all the funds have ISDAs. We just did two WTI/Brent crude oil spreads today, one w/ very large volume, and expect to be doing more such deals. 

This is more than just a legal issue; it's going to impact credit and our strategy to get the funds trading on EOL as well.

As we understand it, the main legal issue is that all the funds have an ISDA only w/ ENA and not w/ ECTRIC, so they (and I assume we) want all deals and legal exposure to be w/ ENA. To satisfy both parties' desires, all European product deals must be booked from ECTRIC to ENA. Sara, from speaking to you and from Justin's response below, it seems to me that the only legal hurdle we, the funds, and our traders might face is if no trader w/ ENA in Houston okays w/ the counterparty on ENA's behalf. However, there seem to be 2 other solutions (a netting agreement and novating) that get around this. As Sara knows, dealing on legal agreements w/ the funds can be onerous and time-consuming; negotiating more paperwork is not a viable option.

From the credit side, as we understand it, the issue w/ not back-to-backing the trades w/ ENA is that the credit exposure will not be aggregated to the funds' net position in Houston and, therefore, not monitored. In other words, any exposure not sitting w/ ENA will be invisible to credit. so daily margining, etc. will  be incorrect. 

From the EnronOnline side, as we see it there are a couple of issues. EOL wants the funds to trade online; an increasing number of funds also want to trade online. However, they do not want to be restricted to trading products that are only US based. Also, they would like to see more arb spread products like a WTI/Brent crude oil spread online. If neither desire can be easily met b/c we need a separate ISDA w/ ECTRIC (which potentially means, as above, more onerous and time-consuming negotiation), then it will certainly be detrimental for volume and also foresake a certain momentum that we are gaining now. 

The point has been raised that the funds could trade European products if credit in London cleared them and if they were willing then to accept the general terms and conditions that pop up on EOL. We can assure you that they will not accept this.

These are the issues as we see them from the origination side. There may be other issues that we're missing from the sides that I've mentioned as well as the trading/back office side. 
Regards,
Russ
 

This is what we have heard from Legal and Tax so far.  We're trying to get a list of couterparties that currently will not trade with ECTRIC and only with ENA.

i agree - assuming you follow janine's approach, then no adverse UK regulatory issues will ensue

justin
I assume that these are financial transactions. The current approach is the right one in the circumstances - i.e trade between ECTRIC and ENA, trade between ENA and third party (eg Bank of America). It is important that the trader agreeing to the deal with the third party in the name of ENA is located in Houston (they cannot agree deals in the name of ENA when located in London).  The pricing should be such that ENA is compensated for taking the credit risk with respect to the third party but otherwise all the economics should be with ECTRIC. 

To avoid booking the back to back trades, a possibility would be an agreement on netting to be entered into by ECTRIC, ENA and Bank of America if all parties can get comfortable with the legal position.

Another alternative sometimes put forward is that ECTRIC does the deal with Bank of America, the contract is then novated from ECTRIC to ENA, and ENA enters into a back to back swap on the same financial terms with ECTRIC.

Note that we are currently working on a project to enter into financials through EFET LLC (arranged by EEFT) instead of ECTRIC (effective 1 November).

Regards
Janine

Hi

I am currently working in the London Risk group for Global Markets.

At the moment we have a number of counterparties who do not want to transact with ECTRIC but would like to do deals only with ENA (e.g. Bank of America). As a result, if a London trader wants to carry out a trade with Bank of America, he will do an internal trade with a trader in Houston and then book a trade between the Houston trader (who trades under ENA) and Bank Of America. The trades are then confirmed from the Houston office.

We were wondering about a couple of things:

Are there any tax/legal implications we should be aware of as a result of booking the trades as we do
Is there a way to approach these counterparties to get them to trade with ECTRIC (as this currently creates a lot of paperwork and administration)?

Thanks for your help
Maya

I can wait; just didn't want it to slip through the cracks.  Thanks.  Sara

he is out until thursday due to death in the family. if urgent, let me know and I will reassign

Hi, Rudwell.  Can you  please resond to me email.  Thanks.  Sara

Rudwell:

You are handling this counterparty from a credit perspective.  Rich Friedman from Global Markets has called to inquire about the status of this ISDA request.  Please refer to Lotus Notes to review the last action taken by Russell in February, 2001.  Please determine whether we can eliminate the Credit Support Annex from this agreement before we send another version.  You will note that this counterparty wants to rely entirely on the form used by Aron.  Russell has a copy of this agreement.

Do you want to put this on the legal credit list for follow up? 

Thanks.

Here it is.  I'm fairly certain that Annabel said the assignment was fine and we'd execute when we got the Securities Lending Agreement done.  SS

Annabel:

I sent a fax to you regarding the assignment referenced in the attached email on February 2, 2001 and May 30, 2001.  I never received a response from you.  

Please put me in touch with the appropriate person for resolving this assignment issue.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Pamela:

On May 22, 2001, I sent an email to you regarding the aforementioned account assignment.  I also copied Nikki Kroll on that email.  ENA and ECI are anxious to have this assignment executed but we have not had any response.  I am reattaching a copy of the assignment for your convenience.  I will need your assistance in identifying the ECI account with Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("GS").  Stephanie Panus sent Nikki Kroll the ECI account documentation via overnight delivery on May 18, 2001.

Please direct your attention to the following:

(1)  Please execute and return to ECI an original Corporate Account Agreement with GS.  Also, please provide ECI with the account number.

(2)  Please review the attached Assignment and Assumption Agreement and advise if we can execute and forward to GS for execution.

Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

FYI only

Dear All,

Thank you to everyone who has helped out today with the hopeful transfer of Anker positions from Enron Credit Inc. to ECT Europe Investments Inc. for quarter end.

We are still working on an effective means to move the positions over.  

David Wall and Edmund Cooper in London will be working on this in the am for us.

From many discussions here today our options right now appear to be:

1.Transfer via stock power to ECTEI Inc.
Positions must be in certificate form first
Will take over a week to obtain certificates from DTC
NOT PLAUSIBLE

2. Set up prime broker account for ECTEI Inc. and transfer via DTC 
Must fill out paperwork and set up account before transfering position
Highly unlikely to accomplish in one day considering amount of paperwork and signatures required

3. Find a merchant account with a prime account already set up 
May not satify audit requirements, but many US entities have accounts
Possibly can find a Europe account with a custody or prime account that can accept DTC positions
Potential Cayman entities that roll to Europe with accounts

4. Internal structures
Suggestions Please

All:  We sent this ISDA for execution and now the lawyer has come back with MORE CHANGES.
The primary issue is SETOFF.  AESC originally accepted our standard setoff language and has now rejected affiliate setoff due to "regulatory" issues.  
Who is currently responsible for this counterparty?
Please respond.  Thanks for your help.

Laurel and Sara.  UBS has an Internet Module that they are going to start using for "Verbal Confims" on FX trades.  You can see a little of what it contains, but they have informed me that we have to be set up with ID's and passwords, sign a contract etc.  The contact at UBS is Max Squire and he will provide me with more info when needed.  Max has explained to me that as the trades are entered into the system we will go in and mark confirmed when we agree.  It sounds very interesting to me.  Let me know what you think.  I can ask Max to send me the paperwork for your review.

Thank you.

Sara -

As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline incorporating
the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
(modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is the
last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would suggest
that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
since it is the final version.

 <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at which
point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature page)
via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
Schedule with your revised Schedule.

Thank you for your patience.

Regards,
Michelle

I don't usually forward these but I've been waiting for the updated Barbie!  Sas
Just in case you had not seen this one!!!!  TOO FUNNY!   We need some laughs and here they are!
 
 

  
  
                           READ ALL THE WAY TO THE END-THERE'S A TRICK TO IT. 

                           Finally a Barbie I can relate to.    At long last, here are some NEW 
                           Barbie dolls to coincide with her and OUR aging gracefully. These 
                           are a bit more realistic... 

                           1. Bifocals Barbie.     Comes with her own set of blended-lens 
                           fashion frames 
                           in six wild colors (half-frames too!), neck chain, and large-print 
                           editions   of  Vogue and Martha Stewart Living. 

                           2. Hot Flash Barbie.      Press Barbie's bellybutton and watch her 
                           face  turn 
                           beet red while tiny drops of perspiration appear on her forehead. 
                           Comes with handheld fan and tiny tissues. 

                           3. Facial Hair Barbie.     As Barbie's hormone levels shift, see her 
                           whiskers 
                           grow.   Available with teensy tweezers and magnifying mirror. 

                           4. Flabby Arms Barbie.     Hide Barbie's droopy triceps with these 
                           new,roomier-sleeved gowns.   Good news on the tummy front, 
                           two-MuMus with tummy-support panels are included. 

                           5. Bunion Barbie.    Years of disco dancing in stiletto heels have 
                           definitely 
                           taken their toll on Barbie's dainty arched feet. Soothe her sores with 
                           the 
                           pumice stone and plasters, then slip on soft terry mules. 

                           6. No-More-Wrinkles Barbie.     Erase those pesky crow's-feet and 
                           lip lines 
                           with a tube of Skin Sparkle-Spackle, from Barbie's own line of 
                           exclusive 
                           age-blasting cosmetics. 

                           7. Soccer Mom Barbie.     All that experience as a cheerleader is 
                           really paying 
                           off as Barbie dusts off her old high school megaphone to root for 
                           Babs and 
                           Ken, Jr.    Comes with minivan in robin-egg blue or white and cooler 
                           filled with 
                           doughnut holes and fruit punch. 

                           8. Mid-life Crisis Barbie.      It's time to ditch Ken. Barbie needs a 
                           change, 
                           and Alonzo (her personal trainer) is just what the doctor ordered, 
                           along with 
                           Prozac. They're hopping in her new red Miata and heading for the 
                           Napa 
                           Valley to open a B&B.     Includes a real tape of "Breaking Up Is 
                           Hard to Do." 

                           9. Divorced Barbie.     Sells for$ 199.99.   Comes with Ken's house, 
                           Ken's car, 
                           and Ken's boat. 

                           10. Recovery Barbie.     Too many parties have finally caught up 
                           with the 
                           ultimate party girl.    Now she does Twelve Steps instead of dance 
                           steps.   Clean 
                           and  sober, she's going to meetings religiously.   Comes with a little 
                           copy of 
                           The Big Book and a six-pack of Diet Coke. 

                           11. Post-Menopausal Barbie.     This Barbie wets her pants when 
                           she sneezes, 
                           forgets where she puts things, and cries a lot.     She is sick and 
                           tired of Ken 
                           sitting on the couch watching the tube, clicking through the 
                           channels.     Comes 
                           with Depends and Kleenex. As a bonus this year, the book "Getting 
                           In Touch with Your Inner Self" is included. 
  

                          The one I got said that if you forward to 11 people a very funny; video comes on your screen.   Who knows?  I just thought it was cute.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Sara 

Thank you for your input into the ISDA statement prepared over the past two
years.  The statement has now been finalized and has been sent to various

Sara,
	I was just following up on what the status of our review of the "Three-way" agreement and referral agreement contracts that we are pursuing with Plains Resources, in order to facilitate small producer hedging.  If you could give me a call or reply with where we stand, I would appreciate it.  Thanks

Mark D. Smith
Manager

Mark:  Can you please reply to (1) below?
Also, any ideas for help with brokerage agreements?
Thanks.  Sara

Mark:  Please read the attached message.

(1)  Are there any issues with following the "custom" in countries not requiring an executed "executing brokerage agreement"?  Do we need to contact outside counsel in each country?

(2)  I anticipate that I will really need help on the brokerage agreement side.  I cannot keep up now on a "timely" basis.

Gary's world occupies about 50% of my time.
Enron Corp. occupies about 25% of my time.

Thanks.  Sara

To all,
	We have expanded equity trading into the European Markets.  Along with that, you will see an increase of executing broker agreements that specialize in foreign equities.  We plan on executing a broker agreement with Metzler Capital Markets for the purposes of order flow and specialty in Italian equities.  Currently no documentation is required and we would still clear all transactions with our existing Primebrokers, Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns.  In addition, Metzler clears their transactions through Paribas Milan.  

Thanks,
Theresa

Lehman called to discuss the two (2) forwards on 9/28/01 (2,245,761 shares at $56.7925 and 2,434,339 shares at $67.5243, respectively) and roll of the 9/18/01 400,000 share forward into the new forwards.  It appears that you also rolled all of the five (5) remaining forwards which terminated on 10/3/01 into the two new forwards.

Lehman is sending three new confirmations for the foregoing transactions.

Please verify with deal tickets.  I have the ticket for the 400,000 share trade.

Also, can you please verify final confirm format (i.e., blackline sent noon on 9/26/01).  I have Jim's comment for "material information".

I have another one for you guys.  I do not anticipate any urgency on this, but would still like it out of the way.

Mr. Doukas:

On September 27, we opened a prime brokerage account in the name Enron
Credit Inc. Bear Stearns is acting as Prime Broker on this account, and
First Union Securities, Inc. is executing your securities. The SEC requires
the Clearing Broker (us) to have the attached agreement on file for our
prime brokerage clients.

If you would be so kind as to have this agreement signed, I would greatly
appreciate it. If you have any questions, you can call me at 704-593-7024.
Once it is completed, it can be faxed back to my attention at 704-593-7032.

Mark:

I'm getting calls from different people with AA requesting copies of all "legally approved" confirmation templates.  I've had requests today from two different people with respect to power and rate/FX.  Do we have a formal process for  approving templates?  Where are the templates kept and how does legal know if they have been changed?   Have similar requests been made for other products?  There does not seem to be any sort of AA uniform deadline for submitting the templates.

I've asked AA to advise you so that we can all be consistent in our responses.  

Thanks.  Sara

Yes, I've been contacted by Paul Puchot in Global Finance.  There is some type of meeting this afternoon.  It is not clear to anyone which Enron company is involved.  FYI - I was in  the midst of negotiating an ISDA with BSIL for Enron Corp. with respect to potential forward deals.

Sara 

Are you working on Bruin?  Davis Thames told me Kristina Mordaunt is leading, but if involves ENA ISDA makes sense for you to be working with them on that portion.

Thanks,

My review of our Lotus Notes database did not reveal that Enron Credit Limited has a Master Agreement with Bear Stearns.  If this Master Agreement has been executed, please make an entry for it in Lotus Notes.  Also, please e-mail me a copy of the execution version of the Enron Credit Limited and Bear Stearns Master Agreement for legal and credit in Houston to review.  Since time is of the essence, your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

All:  We sent this ISDA for execution and now the lawyer has come back with MORE CHANGES.
The primary issue is SETOFF.  AESC originally accepted our standard setoff language and has now rejected affiliate setoff due to "regulatory" issues.  
Who is currently responsible for this counterparty?
Please respond.  Thanks for your help.

Mark:

I'll be brief.  We received an objection from Nuevo (wants to use Monday, Sept. 10 price).  David Andrews (Treasurer) sent the letter and I left him a voice mail.  The ENA trader is Bill Berkeland and Bill suggested that Fred handle this customer (since it's Fred's customer).  Nuevo neglected to read our ISDA (all standard language) and we actually fall into the "ENA averages two quotes" scenario.  Fred should try to negotiate this one.  I left Fred a voice mail and Bill will contact Fred in the a.m.  Kim is aware of this situation.

Brent:  I assume you reviewed.  Sara

I have received the email below and have only two minor comments concerning
the Confirmation.

1.  In the "Cash Settlement Amount" paragraph, "Notional Amount" should be
changed to "Notional Quantity" to be consistent.

2.  For sake of avoiding doubt that the payment date is the fifth business
day following the date on which the product is priced for the last pricing
day of the prior month, I would amend the existing language of the Payment
Date(s) to add the following at the end of the sentence:  "for the
applicable Determination Period."

Melissa:  I am waiting for a "package" from Kim Hundle of all power financial templates for a complete review.  Sara

Sara,

It has been brought to my attention that the payment language we are using for financial power trades that are less than one month in duration does not mention that payment is due 5 business days after the floating price is determinable.  It basically says 5 business days after the last day of the month.

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the date on which the Floating Price is determinable (this language is in all confirms with a calculation period of one month or longer).

The fifth (5th) Business Day following the last day of the month that includes the Calculation Period (this language is in all confirms with a calculation period less than one month).

Can you draft payment language for trades less than one month that states payment is due five business days after the floating price is determinable?

Call me if you would like to discuss.

Thanks,
Melissa

I need the city's bond counsel (outside counsel).

Glendale's City Attorney is Steve Lins.  His phone number is 818-548-2080 and his email is slins@ci.glendale.ca.us.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  I will be in their offices on Wednesday.

Thanks,  Kim

Kim:  Can you obtain the name of Glendale's bond counsel (lawyer's name, phone number, email, etc.)?  Thanks.  SS

Sara,

Believe it or not, we are very close getting our signed ISDA from the City of Glendale.  Steve Lins, the City attorney had a couple of questions which I will attempt to relay without having a copy of the documents.

1)  I am assuming that he obtained a for legal opinion letter or document of some sort.  This document references a confirmation and we are not sure what this references.  Typically, it references a transaction, which in this case, there are no transactions yet.  He feels this reference should be deleted.  What is your opinion regarding this? [Shackleton, Sara]    If we have no transaction on the books, then he can delete the reference.  Marie:  Have we received an opinion from Glendale? 

2)  We sent him a couple of form documents to facilitate the documents required under the ISDA.  One form ws a form resolution.  They have already received City Council approval to enter into financial tranactions and to enter into an ISDA with us.  Steve is going to get a certified copy of this Resolution.  Will this suffice? [Shackleton, Sara]    I'll review their resolution again.  If it references our ISDA and all transactions, it should be fine.  (This is part of the reason why we need a legal opinion) 

When you return, I may try to do one last conference call to alleviate any unanswered questions.  I think we will have an executed ISDA with the City of Glendale by the end of next week.  I am going to be out there meeting with them on Wednesday.

Thanks for your help,

Kim

Stephanie -

Where do we stand with respect to getting a document into National Energy Group, Inc.?  I need to push this forward, as this is a critical document.  Please let me know how we are proceeding on this.  

As a reminder, I want to have the ability to call for margin if NEGI's positions are any less than $4 million dollars in their favor.  I had put $3 million dollars in my prior email, but this figure should actually be $4 MM. 

I will be out Monday and Tuesday, but please contact Max Sonnonstine with any questions.

Thanks,

JRW

Stephanie and Sara -

We currently have several deals on the books with National Energy Group, Inc. that we confirmed under omnibus confirms.  The initial two deals that we did with them, TAGG numbers QY8453 and QY9133, required independent amounts and had the credit language attached.  I have attached those annexes below.  We have since executed the following trades:

VH0606
VH0931
VH0969
VH0982
VT5854
VT5861

Our positions with this counterparty have gone deep in the money to them, and they have asked us to send them back the collateral.  While I am not thrilled about doing this, I understand that this is a commercial issue and we probably need to do this to be responsive to the customer.  If you hadn't guessed by now, this is a Lagrasta customer, so I am getting the requisite incentive from Fred to get this done.

In concert with the return of their collateral, I want to send them a document that allows us to call for margin again if their positions start moving back in ENA's favor.  I want to be able to call them if their position moves any less than $3 million in their favor.  Right now, the positions are over $6 MM in National Energy Group's favor; I want to call them if that exposure changes to anything less than $3 MM in their favor.  This would still give us some "cushion".  

What do we need to do to make this happen?

JRW

Hi, Rudwell.  Can you  please resond to me email.  Thanks.  Sara

Rudwell:

You are handling this counterparty from a credit perspective.  Rich Friedman from Global Markets has called to inquire about the status of this ISDA request.  Please refer to Lotus Notes to review the last action taken by Russell in February, 2001.  Please determine whether we can eliminate the Credit Support Annex from this agreement before we send another version.  You will note that this counterparty wants to rely entirely on the form used by Aron.  Russell has a copy of this agreement.

Do you want to put this on the legal credit list for follow up?

We are going to do this at our own expense.  But we would like to hire Glendale's bond counsel.  I don't know the name of Glendale's bond counsel or how to get in touch with them.

can you fax me the schedule and csa for the ena isda (853-9476) and I will decide if similar terms are appropriate

Tanya:  Enron Corp. wants to transact with FTU.  I sent FTU a "blank" Paragraph 13 subject to ENA's credit review.  Can you give me a call about this one?  The FTU lawyer is calling me and already has comments to our draft Paragraph 13.  Thanks.  Sara

Tanya:  FTU has asked to resume negotiations on the ISDA.  We originally sent our draft without a Paragraph 13 and FTU wants a Paragraph 13 (similar to the one FTU negotiated with ENA).  If you are agreeable to credit, can you please propose a credit worksheet?

You never assigned this one.  Attached is the EOL list.  Chase merged with JP Morgan and we need to upgrade/select existing master.

 

Both of you are listed in Lotus Notes on this one.  Not sure who has had most recent contact.  I someone working on a no-confirms agreement for Chase already?

Mark,

Following a discrepancy with an incorrect confirm generated and executed for an EOL deal between ENA and Chase, Dutch Quigley on the Enron Gas desk has spoken with Greg Crowley, a Chase trader, and Cecile Taylor-Simpson (their confirms Manager) - and agreed that they would all like Enron to be the confirming party for EOL deals between us.  (Presently Chase is the Confirming Party for financial commodity confirms).

Can we, and do we want to, revise their Master Agreement to reflect this?  I thought perhaps this would be a good opportunity to try to get Chase to execute the EOL Amendment.  

Please advise.
Thanks,

Please forward your email requests to the RAC group for opening this account.  Thanks.  Sara

We urgently need to have a new prime account set up at Bear Stearns to facilitate moving the Anker Coal positions from ECI into a fair value entity.

I had forwarded this to Frank Sayre as both of you were out on Friday.  This is background information on why we need to set up the prime account for ECT Europe Investments Inc.

We have been given until the 12th to move the Anker positions to the ECT Entity.  The account will need to be fully open and funded before the positions can move.

As this is of the highest priority please let me know immediately if there will be any issue with completing paperwork by tomorrow.

Thanks,

Tom

FYI

Dear Tom,

As we discussed, here are the stipulations we talked about regarding the entity to which Enron Credit Inc. can transfer the Anker stock and bonds. Those stipulations regarding the transferee entity are that it:

1. must be a US company (this is for tax reasons)
2. must be a "fair value" entity under US GAAP (accounting reasons)
3. must by an entity whose results roll up to Enron Europe Limited (account reporting purposes)
4. must be able to hold stocks and bonds viz. have a brokerage account

Of existing Enron entities, the only entity that meets 1. to 3. is ECT Europe Investments Inc. Therefore, this entity would need a brokerage account. This would appear to be the easiest (!) way in which to meet all four conditions.

As we discussed, even if we gave Bear Stearns a global Enron Corp. guaranty I do not think that ECT Europe Investments Inc. would be able to take advantage of Enron Credit Inc.'s funding arrangements unless it had further 0% risk weighted transactions held in the account.

Thanks and regards,

Edmund

Tanya:

EOL is asking for the Chase master to be amended to eliminate the need for confirms on EOL trades.  Do we need to meet to determine which Chase master (i.e., Chase or JP Morgan) should be amended (or both)?  Do we want to begin the upgrade process?   Please call.

Also, are you available for the 9:30 Hanover call?

I do have comments to this confirm.  I have never seen your ISDA Master Agreement ("Master") so you need to have your lawyer review some portions of it to eliminate the possibility of conflict.  

(1)	Is SunTrust the Calc Agent under your Master? Should they be agent for this deal?

(2)	Need to upgrade definitions to 2000 Definitions (the 1991 and 1998 Definitions have been superseded!)

(3)	Are you in agreement with the optional early termination language and all calculations being performed by SunTrust in the manner set out? There is no valuation or payment time/date for this termination or details for giving notice of intent to exercise the termination option.  This language is extremely vague but perhaps you do not mind.

(4)	Do you have existing transactions with SunTrust on your books in addition to this one?

(5)	Are there any Additional Termination Events under the Master?  You don't want to necessarily eliminate such events from occurring.  Also, it is not clear to me if this transaction or any other derivative transaction with SunTrust is "related to the Loan Agreement" for purposes of giving SunTrust the right to terminate.  Is it?

(6)	Defining an "event" as either an "Event of Default" or a "Termination Event" has different settlement consequences.  It looks like you're not concerned as to how SunTrust values terminated Transactions if this deal is "related" to the Loan Agreement. I think part 2(d) would be clearer if stated as:

"Additional Termination Event will apply.  The following shall constitute an Additional Termination Event with respect to the Counterparty: (cite events (i) and (ii) if accurate) .  For the purpose of the foregoing Termination Event, the Affected Party shall be the Counterparty."

This means SunTrust will calculate as if you were in default.  Or do you want to calculate at mid?

(6)	You should delete Par. 2(a).  I don't believe you have agreed to do this in the past (but perhaps you do not mind).  Your lawyer should review the impact of stating "This provision shall constitute an additional Agreement for the purpose of Section 4 of the Swap Agreement."

(7)	Are the economics of the deal stated correctly?

(8)	What Transaction(s) are being superseded?  Has anything from the initial deal been left out that should be retained?

John, FYI
Nora, If you could review the other provisions to make sure that they picked up our changes.
Sara, Could you please give a general review?  If you are not the correct party (Jeff Nogid gave me your name), could you give me guidance as to who could assist?

Thanks to everyone.

Maggie -

Attached is another revision of the swap confirm.  Ken wanted to make some
clarifying changes to the copy we sent to you last week.  Sorry for the
confusion and please feel free to give me a call to discuss.  If this is
acceptable let me know and I will send a clean copy.  Thanks.

David:  Actually, Jeff and I have eliminated the "agency" issue.  Jeff proposed that ENA transact directly with Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company (the A rated utility).  Sara

Forwarded, as discussed.  I put a new call into Cinergy attorney Jeff Gollomp on this Friday Oct 5th.  Marcus Nettelton is assisting Woody on the specific ICAP term deal.  I understand that swaps attorney Sara Shackleton is currently trying to complete an ISDA with Cinergy as well, and is delving into agency issues wth them.

Dear Jeff,

Per David Portz's voice message to you yesterday, attached please find the Cover Sheet and Collateral Support Annex for the above referenced Agreement for your review.  Please don't hesitate to call either David at (713) 853-9239 or me at (713) 853-6389 if you have any questions.

Ed:  Do you want legal to do anything at this point? Sara

Please review the following proposed outline of the credit lines for the proposed ISDA.

Collateral Threshold (tied to S&P and Moody ratings, lower of):	

	
					ConEd		Enron
	A+/A1 and above		$75,000,000	$60,000,000
	A, A-, A2, or A3			$60,000,000	$55,000,000
	BBB+, BBB, Baa1 or Baa2	$25,000,000	$50,000,000
	BBB- or Baa3			$5,000,000	$15,000,000
	Below BBB- or Baa3		$0		$0

I am trying to set parameters which give ConEd the credit that it deserves as an A+ regulated utility and Enron the credit it warrants as a BBB+ energy marketer.  Given the different business profiles of our companies, I don't believe that the application of parity should be practiced with regards to setting credit lines.  I think you would agree to this approach when looking at other market players, such as banks, municipalities, etc.  I hope we can come to agreement on the proposed credit lines, so that we can proceed with the negotiations of the ISDA.  Please call or reply with any comments or questions.

Just wanted to chat quickly about the amendment we're sending to Merced.  The major changes are credit related:  raising our Threshold to $40million and their's to $8million and giving giving us a "regulatory out" for Merced's legal inability to collect rates to cover O&M.

Whenever we prepare an amendment, we usually add other document "upgrades" (i.e., our form changes).  We have made some important changes since 1999.  I just wanted to alert you to these so that we don't "surprise" your customer.

As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline incorporating
the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
(modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is the
last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would suggest
that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
since it is the final version.

 <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at which
point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature page)
via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
Schedule with your revised Schedule.

Thank you for your patience.

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

         Arbitration - we will agree to English courts as per the language
         amending
         the osla. I will prepare an amendment side letter.

         Limitation of Liability - this is our standard position. I propose
      the
         language agreeed to by you for the PB agreement.

         I trust this will now close the open issues.

         Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding
   issues
         relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate
   policy.
         If
         you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
      and
         we
         can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International
   Chamber
      of
         Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be
   non-prime
         brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and,
   therefore,
         are
         not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.  We do
   have
         other
         business relationships with GSI and again request inclusion of
         limitation
         of liability language in the terms of business letter.  I propose:

         "Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter
   or
      from
         any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect,
      special,
         punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage."

         Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out
   of
      the
         office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

         All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
         executed
         together with the terms of business letter.

            The terms of business are GSI's general terms and span your
         relationship
            with GSI generally. There may be non-prime brokerage issues
   that
         relate
            to
            the terms of business. Not everything in the TOBs intersects
   with
      the
         PB
            relationship, certainly if you do other business with GSI.

            Re the liability provision, I think your concerns are
   adequately
            addressed
            in the documentation as drafted.

            I would be grateful if you would come back to me as soon as
      possible
         so
            we
            can try to get this wrapped up today.

            Kind regards

            Thanks for the message.  It seems to me that the terms of the
   PB
            conflict
            because J14 conflicts with A3, that is, (i)  J14 conflicts with
      Par.8
            requiring the conclusion that English courts will not apply to
   the
         Terms
            of
            Business agreement and (ii) A3 requires that English courts
      prevail.
            Are
            you agreeing with this analysis?

            Also, there is nothing in the Terms of Business agreement to
      conflict
            with
            the limitation of liability language of the PB applicable to
   the
      PB
            (except
            for silence on the matter).  You didn't address this point.  It
   is
         Enron
            Corp. policy to include such language and I would like to limit
      the
            Terms
            of Business in the same manner.

            Can you call me at 9 am Houston time on Tuesday, Sept. 11?  or
         suggest a
            different time?  I am not trying to belabor execution of the
   the

               Actually, I believe we resolved these when we spoke.
      Arbitration -
            more
               appropriate to general terms of business which principally
            contemplate
               the

      event
         of
               inconsistency, the terms of the PB agreement govern (clause
      A3).

               I also amended the OSLA by side letter, which I sent over.

               Daniel:

               Thanks for finalizing the Prime Brokerage Agreement (the
         "Agreement")
               with my colleague Angela Davis.

               I have two points with respect to the Terms of Business
   Letter
            relating
               to the changes made to the Agreement which I believe we
      discussed
         but
               were not in a position to resolve at the time.  These are:

               (1)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should conform to Clause J,
   Par.
      14
         of
               the Agreement).  I recall that we were discussing the
   possible
      use
         of
               arbitration in the Agreement (and existence of arbitration
   in
      the
            OSLA)
               so that we would not need to amend this particular paragraph
   of
         the
               Terms of Business Letter.  Since we ultimately agreed to
      English
            courts,
               I think we need to conform the Terms of Business Letter
   which
      will
               prevail if in conflict with the Agreement.

               (2)  Par. 8 Arbitration (which should be limited in the same
         manner
            as
               Clause J, Par. 11 as to limitation of liability).  I believe
      that
         you
               and Angela agreed to the revisions in the Agreement.  Why
         shouldn't
               these be mirrored in the Terms of Business Letter?

               I look forward to hearing from you and completing the rest
   of
      the
               account documentation.  Regards.

 - Amendment to TOBs.doc 

Kathryn:

The customers appearing on Kim's list have been assigned to various lawyers in the swap group.  There are 22 parties on the list and 16 of these parties have ISDA Master Agreements with ENA.  We will focus on the ISDA customers first.  We will use the template developed by Brent for Entergy-Koch as a basis for the 16 parties.  The template will be customized for each of the 16 parties.  Brent has a preliminary template underway and it should be further refined by October 19.  Using that  template, our goal is to produce six (6) new amendments each week.  We should finish the ISDA customers in about three weeks (first drafts).  The remaining customers have no master agreement in place or an ECT Master Agreement.  Those six (6) customers include:

	Sempra Energy Trading Corp. (old master)
	Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. (old master)
	Dynegy Marketing and Trade (old master)
	Ameren Energy (none)
	American Electric Service Power Corporation (none)
	PacificCorp Power Marketing Inc. (under negotiation with ECC)

The physical power group can coordinate the amendments with the members of the swap group listed above by forwarding drafts to us.

Please let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara:

I have followed up with Brent and he is working on the Entergy-Koch amendment for CommodityLogic.  He cannot commit to a completion date at this time since he has some other priorities.  I've asked for Friday and he has indicated that may be aggressive.  The sales team is presenting Entergy-Koch the CommodityLogic legal agreements today (ESA, Password application, Subscription Agreement).  In light of this, can you provide a status of where the other 18 customer amendments are (excluding Sempra and Entergy-Koch) ?  The Sales process is moving along and we will need to have these amendments ready to present to the customer soon.  Could you go through the list and provide an estimate date of when a draft of the amendment would be available by client.  We need to provide a status to management on Monday 10/8.  

Per our conversation today, if there is a way to focus on the creation of a template that addresses the confirmation exchange via electronic systems (e.g. ConfirmLogic) that can be shared earlier with the clients.  The additional language that is deemed necessary can be added to this form as needed per counterparty.  This will allow us to achieve getting something to the client so they can start the process from their side while we continue to shore up what language needs to be added.  We still need to be thinking of how to keep this process simple to allow quick turnaround yet satisfy the legal requirements for confirmations.  I ask that you and Leslie continue to help define a better process for us and I will continue to work with Kim and the sales team to implement this process.

Thanks for your help

Sara,

Kim:

I am reviewing the list of 20 target customers dated 9/14/01 in an effort to set up a document drafting timetable.  

For financial trading purposes, I need an accurate list of trading counterparties reflecting the complete name of each legal entity.  Also, if a company is split into more than one legal entity (such as power and gas) for financial trading purposes, I need the names of both entities.

Thanks.

Sara,
	We are looking to restart the process of  establishing an executing broker agreement with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.  We had temporarily put this on hold due to the WTC attack.  We have been given a new contact.  Sheila had previously already sent the memo to authorize going forward with the process.  Below are their requirements for account set up:

1.  Corporate Resolution
2.  Trading Authorization
3.  Settlement Instructions.

I am trying to get them to fax me their broker agreement.  As soon as I receive some documentation, I will forward to you.  

Thanks,

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the
   last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
   page)
   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

Sara,

Can we get together for an hour or so to discuss:

1.  Multi Branch counterparties--we need to be certain we are covered by Master's for all of this trading.

2.  Training on the ISDA definitions.  I've pulled some confirms together for a group review.  I'd like to get together with you to go over where I see our weaknesses.  

Hope the legal conference was fun.  Give me a call and let's set up a time.  thanks!!

FYI - I have not received any forwards or puts from CSFB.  Have you heard anything further?  Sara

We provided CSFB puts just like Lehman.  We did that the last time we had to move the trigger price since our stock price was declining.  As a result of us giving them puts, they took the trigger price out which means that we don't have to renegotiate the confirms every time our stock heads south.  Jeff, would you please get the details of the puts to Sara.  Thanks.
CF

Per my voice mail

Sara-

We will prepare execution copies of the confirmations for the various
transactions and send them to you.  Before we do that, though, do you know
the status of the puts [Shackleton, Sara]   I never heard mention of the puts ?

Regards,

Mike

Maria and Michael:

The form of confirmation of fine.  How would you like to handle
execution of this transaction?  of remaining transactions?  Scheduling
the VE discussion for later this week is also acceptable.  We look
forward to hearing from you.  Regards.

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

I would like to begin working on an ISDA, I have attached our standard form
schedule and CSA for your review.  I think this is a good window of
opportunity.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

I have been trying to get an ISDA going with Enron for several months. Who
is the best contact to call?

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Tammy:

Your redraft is fine with two exceptions:

(1)  We need to define "business day"  which is used throughout the agreement and is never defined.  I propose capitalizing the term throughtout your document and using the ISDA definiton or one which recognizes those days on which banks are open in NY and Houston.

(2)  ENA cannot agree to arbitrate before the National Futures Association and you are no longer required to use that forum for arbitration. The situs is fine. I would like to again suggest the language which I originally proposed.  If we cannot agree, can we be silent as to jurisdiction?

Please let me hear form you.

Sara,

I'm attaching a draft of the futures agreement to "get the ball rolling"
again.  I believe I have included the terms you indicated were most
important.  One item I would like to bring to your attention is the
arbitration clause.  Morgan Stanley prefers to litigate disputes, but I
can agree to NFA arbitration rather than litigation.  I know New York is
our preferred location, and Texas is yours, so I thought that holding
the arbitration in Chicago might equally inconvenience us.   Please let
me know if this works for you.

Gil:  I left you a voice mail earlier.  I'm concerned about the definition of "Specified Transaction".  As drafted, I read this as cross defaulting to all other derivative trades between ENA and BSIL, as well as ENE and BSIL.  I don't know if we have any on the books or will enter into any prior to termination of your trades, but the same will be impacted unless you limit the Section 14 definition to your trades only.

Attached is the close to final documentation evidencing the 2 trades we've just made with Bear Stearns International. We anticipate signing these either later today or tomorrow.

The forwards and puts should be signed and faxed back to Lehman.  Please note the template for these trades (with respect to the definition of "material") left out the word "into".  I didn't find it necessary to impede Enron Corp.'s signature; just let Phil know for the next deal.  Thanks.  Sara

Here it is, Sara.

Tim - we are comfortable with the changes to the definition of "material"
given that Lehman is not entering the market as a result of "rolling" the
transaction.  Should we amend the transaction in or enter in any future
transaction where we enter the market on behalf of ENE, we would require the
"standard" definition of "material.

 Dear Sara,

I am attaching the long form confirm re a deal which we did yesterday  - small, but our office's first yen based crude transaction!  

The yen-USD forex however was done through ENA and needs to be documented.  ENA will also be providing these services to EJ (through our metals desk) moving forward so we need a master agreement in place.  

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

Dear Sheila,

I left you a voice mail this afternoon with regards to establishing an execution and clearing relationship for exchange traded futures and options. At the request of Shane Dallman and Aaron Armstrong in London, I have quoted rates for all relevant exchange traded products. They have expressed an interest in using Deutsche Bank for their futures trading so that we are arranging to have documentation drafted and sent to Houston as soon as possible.

I have asked one of my colleagues, Rob Manders, to contact you to establish the names of the legal entities that should be on the contracts, and the name and address of the person/people to whom all documentation should be sent. Rob will be coordinating all the documentation and will assure that your operations department is happy with the service that Deutsche Bank will offer. To that end, he has organised a video conference with Kimberley Hopley in London and Jason Fisher in Houston for the week of 8th October.

I hope that these arrangements meet with your approval. Should you have any questions, please feel free to call me on 44 207 547 3486. Equally, you can reach Rob Manders on 44 207 545 2005.

Just a few notes from the Agreement:

(1)	Par. 2(d) - DBAB will use its "reasonable judgment" to value securities or other assets posted as margin
(2)	Par. 2(e) - DBAB will use its then current rates of exchange for any currency conversions (probably not applicable to ENA)
(3)	Par. 3     - Have we agreed to commissions and brokerage charges?  These are to be agreed "from time to time"
(4)	Par. 5     - Position Limits:  ENA must promptly notify DBAB if ENA is required to file position reports.  Can you explain, please?
(5)	Par. 7(b) - Not sure why we're being asked to make this rep.  What is ENA's relationship to the Enron FCM these days?
(6)	Par. 9(a) - Trader changes binding on DBAB upon receipt of written confirmation
(7)	Par. 9(d) - verify binding nature of trades

Alan suggested you may be able to assist with a form of document that would work in this situation.  The only requirement from EJ's perspective is that it be effective from yesterday, Oct 11, 2001.  

If you need more information about the forex arrangements we have with ENA, Sheila / Jan Erland may be able to assist.

Otherwise, if you were able to get a draft together, I will run it by Susan Musch and Jan-Erland, and get it signed up.

Thanks Sara.

Tracy:

Let me know what you think.  I'll check with a lawyer from the physical power group.  Also, we should at a minimum, preserve setoff with respect to ENA's affiliates.  Sara

Sara -

I have spoken with our in-house regulatory specialist and she has informed
me that we cannot agree to include our regulated or non-regulated Affiliates
in Set Off under the Public Utility Holding Company Act without getting
approval from the SEC.

Please advise if we can proceed on the ISDA with carving out Affiliates in
Set Off, as per our original request.

Sara,

I called Scott with no answer.  My contact does not know who he is, but suggested you could send the ECI and ENA agreements to her and she would ensure both were put in place with her legal and compliance people.

You can send the completed agreements to:

Phone: 212/538-5581
Fax: 212/538-4057

Thanks,

Tom:

We would like to use the same format which was agreed to by ENA and CSFB.  That agreement was sent for execution on July 6, 2001 and we have never received an executed version.

Please feel free to contact Scott Kreuzinger (phone is 617-556-5730 or fax is 617-542-1814) to ensure that ENA has executed docs which can also be duplicated for ECI.  Perhaps your contact at CSFB can assist.  Scott Kreuzinger was ENA's contact for having docs executed.

We have been unable to extract any response from Scott Kreuzinger.

Thanks.

I wanted to give you the benefit of some of my thoughts before I considered your Annex A which I would like to compare to the ENA current version.  We are currently considering more revisions so your Annex A will help me to think a bit.

I have attached a redline of the actual confirm (without Annex A).  A couple of thoughts:
(1)	for purposes of creating a "template", I gave a choice for Termination Date
(2)	I collapsed Payment Date/Invoice because I'm concerned that EJC may forget to send a timely invoice so we need to ensure that there is no issue about whether or not a payment is owed
(3)	We need to "fix" the Floating Price language.  I don't know where the reference to "North Sea, West Africa, Mediterranean" comes from.  I didn't see it in Marketwire and London doesn't use it.  Also, the conversion language is vague (i.e., TTM, TTB and TTS are not defined but I suspect they refer to bid/mid/sell?  Are they references on the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, Ltd. screen?).  Also, it may be better to create a conversion reference to your Central Bank and not a particular banking institution (you could get caught later dealing with that bank, using the conversion language and then giving the bank an unfair advantage).
(4)	I didn't see your Schedule 1 guarantee but I assume that it is the normal ENE format. 

Regarding Annex A, I quickly noticed an issue with the "TIBOR" definition (which uses quite a bit of ISDA language) which can be easily fixed with an appropriate ISDA reference.  Give me another day or so to comment.

Let me know if you'd like to talk.  My home number is 713-664-3207 if you'd like to call.

Jeff:  fyi the CSFB foul up

Unfortunately CSFB claims to be unable to locate the ENA document.  If we can use our copy they will accept our changes to the ECI document.  We should send both the ENA and the ECI docs so they can compare quickly and avoid additional delays.

This account should be opened asap.  Tom, I assume as per our conversation, that you have obtained the account documentation required and it matches the agreements that have been previously signed, only changing the name of the entity and tax ID number.  All accounts that are used for trading by the debt traders should be changed to Enron Credit Inc.  If I can provide any assistance, please advise.  Donna Lowry, RAC Compliance

Please also approve the account below.  This is top urgent

Please forward your email to the RAC group requesting the opening of this account.  Thanks.  Sara

This is the primebroker agreement that we need to fill out for CSFB.  They are holding two trades hostage so this is a priority for us.  Please let me know if you require any further information.

Thanks for the quick response.  Your "business day" suggestion is fine.  With respect to your second comment, ENA agrees to AAA arbitration in all phases of its physical and financial business.  We are not a clearing member of any exchange so we do not seek arbitration before a regulatory board.  Hope this helps.  Sara

Sara,

For the purposes of margin, defining a business day as those days on which banks are open in NY and Houston will work.  For the purposes of error notification, we should remove "business day" and insert something along the lines of "market day" and define "market day" as any day that the market on which the contract traded is open.  There are a few days the markets are open but the banks are closed.   Will that work for you?

Both Morgan Stanley and Enron are registered with the NFA.  Is there a specific reason you can't agree to NFA arbitration?

Regards,

Tammy

Attached is a "recap" of outstanding issues with the utility.  I have not had any conversations with anyone at ConEd.

FYI, I did receive a call this afternoon from Sylvia Dooley asking that I call her about one of the unregulated affiliates.  I left a voice mail.

Let me know how you want to proceed.  Ed asked that we prepare a blackline and not change items to which the parties have not agreed.  Thanks.  Sara

I had a long conversation with Sylvia Dooley this afternoon.  She contacted me about finalizing the Con Ed ISDA Master Agreement and the "related" Consolidated Edison Energy (same lawyer, different commercial) master.  Sylvia is preparing a new version.

We have a lot of open issues, most appearing on the open issue list that I just circulated to you both.  However, Sylvia and I identified some significant credit issues which we should address now.

Ed:  In addition to finalizing the credit matrix, the big ticket issues include the following items and (according to Sylvia) you should probably call Triche Douglas right away to resolve as she is being moved to another project and may not be available for ISDA negotiations much longer:

(1)	credit event upon merger:  Con Ed coming back with newer definition of "materially weaker". Con Ed rejects ENA's proposal

(2)	Con Ed is still rejecting our setoff language.  I will send our newer language but the substance is the same as before.

(3)	will not agree to our transfer language (i.e., always want to consent for purposes of transfer and no carve out for guaranteed affiliates)

(4)	want an extra day for delivering L/C's

(5)	issue about notification time for requesting collateral.  Con Ed wants 1 pm NY time; we countered with 11 am NY time.

(6)	are insisting that parties obtain consent for substitution of collateral

(7)	major issue with respect to holding/using collateral.  Con Ed will propose that with respect to ENA, only Enron Corp. can hold collateral and Enron Corp.'s eligibility to hold collateral will be tied to credit rating of BBB

(8)	major issue defining MAC: no one has come up with a MAC

Given my conversation of this afternoon, please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Rob, will you be handling both Con Ed entities?

At the point the language was agreed to in the below agreement we may not
have been aware of the regulatory contraints under PUHCA that does not allow
for the inclusion of Affiliates under Set-Off (we may actually have to amend

With respect to the our ISDA, I will make sure to forward to Anthony the

   With respect to your setoff request, we cannot agree to eliminate setoff
   for your non-regulated affiliates.  Perhaps you could provide us with
   the
   regulated affiliate(s) for a carve out.  I look forward to hearing from
   you.  Regards.

      As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
      incorporating
      the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of
   ISDA
      (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached
   is
      the
      last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
      suggest
      that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of
   agreement
      since it is the final version.

       <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

      Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
      which
      point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
      page)
      via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
      Schedule with your revised Schedule.

      Thank you for your patience.

Please review for accuracy.  Thanks.  Sara

Sara-thank you for looking into this issue for us.  Here is a brief
summary of what occured.

UBS and Enron entered into a Sterling-UBS spot transaction on 11-19-01,
which both parties confirmed and settled on 11-21. (UBS pays USD
7,083,500 and receives 5 mio sterling).

On 11-21 UBS and Enron erroneously confirmed the same trade again for
settlement on 11-21. UBS made a second USD 7,083,500 payment to Enron's
account at BA-Dallas on 11-21 (payment reference: FED IMA
1121B1Q8052C001081).

UBS did not receive the Sterling it was expecting and for the next few
days Enron and UBS tried to resolve the non-payment based on a mistaken
assumption that Enron owed 5 mio Sterling to UBS.

On 11-28, UBS realized that the trade was duped and on 11-29 informed
Enron of the nature of the error and requested that the USD payment be
returned. Enron agreed to return the USD payment on 11-29. The returned
payment was never received.

If you need additional information please contact me at 203-719-1141 or
Bryan Murtagh 203-719-8955.  Here are our contacts at Enron who are
aware of this issue.

Legal and credit have never responded on this one since there was no activity.  We will have to do a comparison of the CP form.  We also need credit since nothing has happened since 1999.

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.

I would like to begin working on an ISDA, I have attached our standard form
schedule and CSA for your review.  I think this is a good window of
opportunity.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

I have been trying to get an ISDA going with Enron for several months. Who
is the best contact to call?

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Do you guys want to meet early next week?

Thanks a million!  Sara

Sara, try the instructions below in Lotusnotes.  The name of the database is New Power Contracts.  If you can't open it, you will need to go through eRequest to get access.

How to open the database in Notes:
Go to File...Database...Open
Server = ECTHOU_LN1
FileName = North_America\Swap.nsf
Click [Open]

I may have mentioned this a long time ago and then forgotten about it but I'd like to coordinate with the group that administers eRequest so that this becomes a requestable app on eRequest. Someone would then be able to make a request for access to the db and you'd have to approve it. The eRequest group would then be responsible for giving them access. That way, you don't have to wait on me.

Scott

Thanks, can you tell me where to tell them to go to add the database to their desktop in Lotusnotes?

Sorry for the delay. I just added the individuals below. They may have to wait 30 mins for the change to take effect.

Please add Travis McCullough (Houston) and Steve Hall (Portland) to the list of users for the New Power Contracts Database.  Please let me know when complete.  Thank you.
Rhonda,

I just checked Harlan's computer and he still does not have the icon for our much beloved database.   Can you advise me on what to do and please don't call the database police on me.  Also, Travis McCullough should also get access as well as Steve Hall in Portland.

Thanks for your help,

Please call me in the morning.  I need to verify:

1.	Was this an ENA transaction?

2.	What is the actual account number?

3. 	What happened to the money when it hit the BofA account?  I think you said it was swept into a Citibank account.  Was this an ENA or ENE account?

4.  	Where is the money today?

A very general question:  shouldn't all of the financial power templates provide for corrections to published prices and rounding to four places for commodities quoted in MMBtus?  Your template does not contain either of these.

Per our discussion this morning I have attached the new form for our confirms.  Please let me know if further changes are necessary.   
 << File: sampledoc.doc >> 
Thank you for your help!
Kimberly Hundl x31647

Kim:  I need to verify that the EOL amendment changes conform to the general financial power template changes.

(1)  The EOL amendment provides that the rounding convention for calculating power Floating Prices relating to MMBtus is rounding to four places; the current financial power template provides for rounding to three decimal places.  Which is the correct convention?

(2)  With respect to corrections to published prices, changes will be required to both the ISDA and GTC formats since the latest EOL amendment does not conform to standard ISDA terminology.  There is no corresponding GTC terminology.

Please let me know about (1) above.  Thanks.  Sara

 

Yes, all templates should include language covering corrections to published prices.  On October 9th, I forwarded an email to you requesting your review of that language that we received from Brent Hendry.  I had not heard back yet, but was planning to add that to our templates after I got your approval.  If you would like that email re-sent, please let me know.
The only rounding language that I am aware of, is in the second to last paragraph of this template.
Please let me know what changes are necessary.

Carol:

As the log is continually updated, we should be clear as to which entities we are reviewing for purposes of informing the book ad mins.
To date, we have only focused on:

	ENA 
	EPMI
	ENE
	ENA Upstream Company LLC
`	EPMI

We have consciously excluded EES and the London entities or US entities trading through EEFT in London (such as ECTRIC).

Since Enron Global Markets (and presumably EIM next) is under a mandate for liquidation, don't we need to liase with Alan (for his US products) and London (for products such as weather) which are EGM products?  Since ENA includes FX/rate, we have included that global product in our original review.  This is needed to understand the process of liquidation of the FX/rate book (as netted against other ENA outstanding positions). 

Or is our focus still only gas and power? I just don't want to miss anything or slow down the process.

I didn't save the email verison of the "corrections to published prices" so I'll state the changes below and you can revise:

(1)  You will need two different versions:  one for GTC's and the other for ISDA confirmations	

(2)  Don't capitalize the word "party" in either version

(3)  Use the capitalized term "Interest Rate" for the GTC version

(4)  Use the capitalized term "Applicable Rate" for the ISDA version

When I hear back from Kim T., we can finalize the rounding convention for online and offline confirmations.

The only rounding language that I am aware of, is in the second to last paragraph of this template.
Please let me know what changes are necessary.

Kim: 

A very general question:  shouldn't all of the financial power templates provide for corrections to published prices and rounding to four places for commodities quoted in MMBtus?  Your template does not contain either of these.

Per our discussion this morning I have attached the new form for our confirms.  Please let me know if further changes are necessary.

Re:    Proposed Fourth Amendment to the Master Energy Price Swap
Dear Susan:

Pursuant to the discussions between Anthony Lupiano of our Credit
Department and Bill Bradford of your Credit Department yesterday,
attached you will find a proposed Fourth Amendment to the Master Energy
Price Swap Agreement.  The purpose of this Fourth Amendment is to amend
the Exposure Threshold definition.    It is my understanding that Mr.
Bradford has agreed to these terms.   Our Credit Department is expecting
that we bring this document to a closure quickly.

Please contact me with any questions or comments you may have.

Rex, Jim and Clint:

You may recall that ENE has been in the process of documenting two forwards, effective 10/3/01, and two puts, effective 10/1/01.  The forwards consisted of rolls of outstanding forwards with Lehman.  These transaction confirmations were signed by Tim DeSpain on Friday, October 19, 2001. 

In that regard, I have faxed to your attention the two (2) REVISED put confirmations prepared by Lehman per the email attached below.  I received the confirmations by fax today.  The confirmations were revised to provide for physical settlement on the Expiration Date.  There are two different Expiration Dates; one is October 30, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.5246) and the other is December 28, 2001 (Strike Price of USD15.6947).  You will see the details on the confirmations.  As Seller of the options, ENE will be obliged to pay Lehman upon delivery of the shares if the options are automatically exercised on the Expiration Date(s).  Please note that there are also changes to the confirmations with respect to "Regulation M/Tender Offer Event" appearing on page 4 (i.e., Cash Settlement will apply instead).

Clint:  please verify that the confirmation changes conform to your discussions with Russ.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.  Sara

Mark Russell of Salt River Project sent me their ISDA documents last week.  Can we take a look at them and make the changes we would like to incorporate?  He called this morning and they are considering financial transactions with us.  Please give me a call and let me know where we stand with this when you get a chance.  If I should send it on to some one else.  Please let me know that as well.

Thanks,

I would like to begin working on an ISDA, I have attached our standard form
schedule and CSA for your review.  I think this is a good window of
opportunity.

Mark,

The best person to talk to about the ISDA is me.  I discussed an ISDA with
Tim Roberts when I was in the Salt River offices on March 23rd.  A draft
ISDA was sent to Bill Abraham on November 17, 1999.  I requested for a new
legal review on 3/28/01.  Let me know if you need a new draft and I can
send you or Tim a copy.  My number is 713-853-0685.

Thanks for your inquiry -

I have been trying to get an ISDA going with Enron for several months. Who
is the best contact to call?

Kent,

Attached is a draft copy of our Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical
natural gas transactions.  As I mentioned before, we can enter into
transactions for less that one year out.  However, for those outside of a
year and for longer terms, we need to have a master in place.  Hopefully,
we can get this one in place so that we will be prepared when/if we get
ready to transact.

Let me know if you have any questions.  I will have our legal guys standing
by to help, too.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Tom:  Please forward your requisite email request to Donna Lowry, Rick Carson and Bill Bradford with your request and reasons.

This will entail new account application, board resolution and authorized trader list.

Thanks.  Sara

OK for tax.

Tom - I will try and get a USD accounting entity set up in SAP that rolls up to 
ECTEF Inc for legal purposes 

I'm fairly sure we can do this as 54R (ECTRL Global Divisions) is a $ accounting entity of 
138 (ECTRL), a ? entity

Raj - do you have a problem from a tax perspective of having this set up?

It will mean doing the paperwork all over again and closing the old account assuming ECTEF does not want an account.  This is not a name change but actually a transfer from one entity to another.  It will likely require resolutions to open brokerage accounts for ECTMI if they don't already have them in place.

Aside from looking foolish to Bear I anticipate no hassles from them.  As far as our side it would be wise to have legal give their estimation of the effort and time frame needed to duplicate the effort that was made for ECTMI.

Sara how feasible would it be to prepare account paperwork for the ECTMI company to obtain a Bear account?

Thanks,

Tom

I will investigate getting an accounting entity set up for ECTMI - does anyone know the number?

in the meantime (and don't shout at me Tom) how easy would it be to change the ECTEF
broker account to have a new name - see company below

We must move Anker as a matter of urgency.  Let's discuss.

Thanks

After speaking with David Wall about which entity the Anker debt and equity should be moved to, I placed a few quick phone calls.  I understand that there may be some confusion about what is an investment company, and which ones are available.

I hope this helps you identify where to move the investments.  Please keep me updated on the completion of that move.  AA will be sensitive to us making that transfer into the investment company in the quarter that we have booked earnings on the investment(s) as merchant investments.  As discussed with David Wall, that is consistent with Enron's corporate policy on merchant investments and with the Investment Company Audit Guide which governs our merchant investment accounting.

If you have any further questions or if I can be of further assistance, please contact me at ext. 35882.

I think London is now saying they merely need to set up an accounting entity within ECTEF.  Should we need to move forward with the new account afterall I will happily send out the request.

Enron Liquids
Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp. (oil option)
EOTT (I think EOTT documents its financial deals separately)

Also, there have been trades for physical settlement, such as, an "oil forward" and a "gas TBP forward".  Maybe Jeff knows the answer to this one.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

Larry Anderson with Carr has called to inquire about ENA financials and an Enron Corp. guaranty.  From an historical perspective, it has always been my understanding that Enron Corp. did not wish to provide guaranties to brokers and we have been successful in that regard with several recent exceptions.  In particular, Enron Corp. provided Carr with a "comfort letter" reciting the corporate "policy of general financial responsibility and interest in seeing that subsidiaries act responsibly."  [letter dated February 16, 1999]  Such letter is no longer sufficient to satisfy Credit Agricole which owns Carr.  

Joe, I believe that Larry may have already spoken with you.  I don't know if your conversation included discussion of a guaranty.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  Thanks.

(2) Equity Swap on 400,000 shares ENE
(3)  Two (2) Equity Forwards on 1,025,000 shares and 1,672,000 shares ENE, respectively

The forwards contain $40 price triggers which will be adjusted through either an amendment or put.  This will be documented after the swap and forwards are signed.

Please review the trade details for the swap and forwards, including share caps, floating amounts payable by ENE, spreads, etc.  You have an email version of the CSFBI documents.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

(2)  I need someone to walk me through the numbers appearing on the charts which you sent me.

(3)  I don't understand what happened with the Anker Coal position.  I know that London used that entity for the purpose of transferring this position to ECTEF Inc.

Sara 

 << File: ENA ECI ECTEF at 30 Nov 01.xls >> 

Edmund:

I have not received anything from anyone in London or anywhere else regarding positions, etc.

I did speak with a Weil bankruptcy lawyer and there were many issues especially with respect to ENA positions (and I don't know where the high value credit positions are booked).  They believe that we may have structuring issues working through London and not directly with a purchaser.

Can you send the information over here?

Spoke with Phil Levy regarding several issues.  He is immediately emailing FX amendment for the existing master and will simultaneously review the existing ISDA for FX coverage.  The executed amendment will resolve the margining issues ASAP.  ENA will produce a draft Schedule/CSA to begin negotiations for an upgraded master which will include multibranch parties.

Sara,

The attached shows our balances at GS and Bear Stearns.

1) Bear Stearns owes us $3.9 million to ECT Investments, Inc.
	Ena is owed 159,022
	Enron Credit Inc has positive liquidating equity at BS of $14,013,523 which includes cash and positions.

2) Goldman Sachs ENA account grouping includes a positive cash balance of 1,493,288 which belongs to Enron Credit Inc.  As discussed, GS will not touch any monies relating to ENA.

3)  Enron Credit Inc. has a positive cash balance of 132,680 at MSDW.  It is segregated from any other entity's balances.

Adding up all three pieces of Enron Credit is $15.6 million, which includes positions and cash balances and presumes that the market value used by the prime broker is correct for some of these illiquid positions.

Please call so we can discuss.

Thanks.

Sheila:  attached is the markup I am preparing to send to FIMAT Canada.  Some of the redlining reflects ENA's prior agreement with FIMAT USA, Inc.  A few things for you to note and we can chat quickly:

(1)  Par. 5 - will we agree to a fee schedule now or "as agreed to from time to time"?

(2)  Par. 7 - I have requested the interest rate schedule. Alternatively, I have "borrowed" language from the FIMAT USA, Inc. agreement.  Which do you think is best?

(3)  Par. 8 - is the reference to CAD50,000 for speculative accounts alright?  Or will this be simply a hedge account and that particular language is extraneous?

(4)  Par. 14 - will you need to object by phone (or is fax sufficient)?

Per our conversation, attached is a short "recap" of the companies and amounts involved.

With respect to prime brokerage accounts, the following approximate cash balances are held by Bear Stearns & Co. ("Bear") in accounts for the following companies:

ECT Investments, Inc.		$3,923,970.84		[has not filed]

Enron Credit Inc.		$10,500,000		[has not filed]

I understand that one of our U.K. companies, Enron Credit Limited, has been in touch with one of your employees with respect to the return of the Enron Credit Inc. cash and was told that Bear wished to offset that amount against the amount owed by Enron Credit Limited to Bear under OTC trades, approx. $1,500,000, for a net balance of approx. $9,000,000.

ECT Investments Inc. sent a demand letter to you via facsimile on November 30, 2001 requesting return of its cash balance.  I do not believe that ECT Investments, Inc.has any OTC trades with Bear but I will need to verify.

We would like to resolve the return of cash issues.  Please feel free to contact me.

Thanks for your assistance.

I believe the Goldman account (for ERMT Corp.) was funded on 11/6/01.

Still separate and still be invested.

Cathy

Cathy and Greg,

Would you confirm whether the $250 MM was swept back by Enron Corp.?

Best regards,
Susan

I'm not so sure of that because we couldn't see all of the wire transfers.  There was a credit to the new entity's account in the amount of $250 million on November 5th and then there was a debit of $249,900,000 on the 6th.  It looks like that money went into a Goldman Sachs account.

I assume this means that the payment was made and not swept back by Enron Corp.?

FYI.

Best regards,
Susan

sounds ok to me.

Donna and Sara,

Rather that calling the SEC, a easier and a cost effective approach may be to prepare the March 31, 2002 SEC 13F filing which is due on May 15, 2002 now.

I have confirmed with Art Boos, Bowne, 713-869-9181, that we can submit and approve now and they will hold unitl the release date in May.  

Please advise if you are okay with this approach.  At Sara's suggestion, I have discussed with Robert George who agrees with the the efficacy of this approach.

Regards,
Sheila

Donna and Sara,

Executed hard copy to be sent to you today.

I will call the SEC because once you drop below the 100 million you are supposed to file for three quarters.  June 30th was the last time we were over $100 milllion so by rule we should file one more time.  I am not sure how they treat a company that is no longer in business.

Sheila

Approved for submission as due on February 14, 2002.

These are financial "out of the money" swaps between ENA and various SPV's have been sent to me with the request for "termination" from Jesus Melendrez who is managing the ECR portfolio.

Should this be reviewed by the "Intercompany Contract" group?

Sara 

Sara,

Nancy asked me to send this summary to you.

Call if you have any questions.

Eric

Brian,

I aploligize for the delay in getting you this info.

 

Is all this being worked with Nora Dobin?  I think some of these are in the volumetric production payment vehicles.  we need to be careful.  Nancy, will you call Nora Dobin?

Eric:  are any of these tied to the production payment deals?  Please advise us all.

Sara,

Looks like one of yours.

Jesus Melendrez, who is managing the ECR portfolio, has asked that the subject swaps be terminated. None of them is in the money for ENA. I have put together a small file folder for each and Eric Boyt has been asked to provide updated values. These are in l purple folders on my desk should I not be available . I am happy to liase with Jesus but seems to me that one of the swap attorneys who is more conversant with the ISDAs, T&Cs, swaps and ENA's current position re same should weigh in. Basic question is what approval is required to terminate.  The relevant interests are as follows :

Cresendo Energy LLC - 50 % JEDI ll , 50 % Trutta
Juniper - 75 % JEDI ll, 25 % Trutta
CGAS -  100% McGarret
East Sour Lake -100 % Trutta

         

Sam:

Please see me in the a.m.  We are going to use this party as a test case for valuation and will need to organize a binder now.  Thanks.

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya

How about 9:30 on the 30th floor?  Sara

Can we get together on Thursday morning to discuss ?

Tom:

Further to my voice mail, attached is a "short list" of FX/rate desk financial counterparties.  We will need an aggregate ENA exposure before attempting to negotiate ENA's in-the-money positions on a commodity by commodity basis (i.e., the FX/rate exposure, in particular).  I will speak with Clara Carrington about segregation of the terminated trades from their books.
 
I'd like to sit down with you and Sheila Glover as soon as possible to strategize.
 
Thanks.  Sara

Call me.  Enron MW LLC will be treated like any third party.  Since we do not have our trading order, there are no unwinds or terminations and we do not have special preference for dealing with affiliates.  If this is in the money to ENA, we may be able to expedite the process but we are still dealing with a debtor.  I'm not sure that the relationship to ENA bears different treatment.

Richard Tomaski (Chicago office) tells me that Enron Midwest (wholly owned sub of ENA) has certain hedges in place with RMT and perhaps ENA, relating to physical positions we had.  The gas is being sold on Tuesday, so they want to close out these hedges, by unwinding or terminating.

Do you have any suggestions on how to handle this?

Kay

Thanks for your help.

A few questions:

(1)  Where does the NYMEX amount come from (I understand that ENA has no open futures positions)?  Is it margin?  Also, what is that number today?

(2)  Why are there entries for both "JPMorgan Chase Bank" and "The Chase Manhattan Bank"?  What is the difference?  For example, we have a termination notice from Chase but not JPMorgan Chase.

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

Enron Benefits Department

Cheryl:

Gordon Heaney tells me that you have received information about non-terminated, defaulting P&P counterparties (on the financial side).  We are developing a strategy for handling these types of entities and I want to ensure that ENA responds/acts consistently.  Many of the P&P parties misinterpret the ISDA documents and I observe that many are in the money to ENA, have not terminated and may be in default for failures to pay or post collateral.  Can you let me know if you actively pursued these parties for Bob Crane?

Thanks.  Sara

Can you please handle for EIM?  Susan has a lot of information.  Also, it is my understanding that any information going out the door must be logged in by Raz.  Thanks.  Sara

I have attached a file which shows the information we would like to send to International Paper regarding counterparties.  It includes a description of the company (but not the name), the % of total tons traded and the credit rating of the counterparty.  Can you let me know if you think this information can be given to a third party under the confidentiality provisions mentioned below?  Please let me know.

Thanks,
Jennifer

 

Jennifer,

Conclusion:  Whether the trading relationship was established under a Master Agreement or under the Confirmation(s) -- the "Confidentiality" language employed by ENA and ECC prohibits the public disclosure relating to the Master Agreement or to the Confirmation(s).   Therefore, if ENA and/or ECC desire to public disclose "the existence of a Master Agreement" or "the existence of a transaction under a Confirmation" -- ENA and/ECC must first secure the prior consent of any counterparty before public disclosure to third party can be made.

For your convenience, attached are my findings as set forth in the following:

1.	Master Agreement List for the Forest Products Trading Counterparties, along with the forms of "Confidentiality" provisions:

 << File: master agreement list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                 << File: confidentiality - master (standard provision).doc >>                    << File: confidentiality-master (non-standard provision).doc >> 
2.	Forest Products Trading Counterparties without a Master Agreement, along with the "Confidentiality" provision:
	
 << File: non master agreement  list (forest products counterparty).doc >>                  << File: confidentiality - confirms (standard provision).doc >> 

If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

Cordially, 
Susan S. Bailey
Susan,

Sorry about the previous attempt.  This is the list of counterparties.  We need to know if we can disclose to third parties that we have traded with them and the volumes associated with the trades.  Thanks for your help.  Call me if you need clarification.

Hopefully, there will be a beneficial match on both sides.

Regards,
Sheila

fyi..sg

Sheila,

At this time, there are no updates to report on deferred compensation since the bankruptcy filing.  As you know, the assets of the plan(s) are subject to the claims of the Company's creditors.  Thus, no distributions (current or future) can be made.  We sent a letter to you on December 10th with your 11/30/01 balance in the event that you wished to file a claim with the bankruptcy court for your deferral benefit.  We also indicated that the Company would explore options with its creditors to seek approval to restart the deferral plan(s).  To my knowledge, these talks have not begun.  However, I will see if I can find out any additional information to pass on to you.

On the December 10, 2001 letter we indicated that we would forward your "Life to Date Deferrals" at a later date.  This follow-up letter should be sent out to you next week.

Renee

Pam or Renee,

Please respond to Sheila regarding her deferred compensation.

Thanks,

Robert

Bob,

Beth Perlman suggested that you may be able to provide me with an update regarding the status of Deferred Compensation.  	

Regards,
Sheila Glover

Ed:  I think this answers the question.  I know to research outstanding broker claims (e.g.,  BNP Paribas is witholding USD 80,000,000 to setoff against other claims).

Here's the file showing which brokers owe us cash as of close of business 1/24/02.  Look at the "0124" tab and under the "Wire Day Cash In/Out" column.  The $95.6MM represents the amount each of these brokers owes to us (We owe HSBC $2,132).  Also, I sent figures to Steve Van Hooser and Mark Taylor on 12/5/01 for the exchange amounts that were due as of 11/30 and 12/4 for $58.4MM and $87.3MM respectively.  Currently all of our exchange positions are closed.

 

Thanks,
Todd

Also, you have an entry for "Enron MW LLC" as party wtih Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co.  

Was your list intended to capture any other Enron affiliates other than Enron MW LLC?
Are there any other EPMI parties?

Thanks.  Sara

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Also, I sent figures to Steve Van Hooser and Mark Taylor on 12/5/01 for the exchange amounts that were due as of 11/30 and 12/4 for $58.4MM and $87.3MM respectively.  Currently all of our exchange positions are closed.

is this the file I sent last week?  NYMEX - I would talk to Elaine Schield or Greg Whiting; however, this data is as of 11/30 before terminations and the like - so we may well have had open positions on the nymex.  I suspect it is made up of the forward value to the contracts, accrued interest, etc. I have no idea what the number is today - again Elaine or Leslie Reeves would be the best contact.  I suspect there are entries for both JPM and Chase Man because our back office was booking to both places even though that was not correct.  If the back office doesn't move the deals over, the data will be in both places.  It is all about data integrity - there will be many issues like this, I suspect.

A few questions:

(1)  Where does the NYMEX amount come from (I understand that ENA has no open futures positions)?  Is it margin?  Also, what is that number today?

(2)  Why are there entries for both "JPMorgan Chase Bank" and "The Chase Manhattan Bank"?  What is the difference?  For example, we have a termination notice from Chase but not JPMorgan Chase.

Thanks.

Not from the credit side as all financial exposure is netted together for our queries.  The details can be found by tracing the exposure through TAGG, ERMS or Enpower to the deal level detail. 

Thanks,

Any way to break this out by commodity, with a summary column?

Don

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya

 << File: ALL EXP COB 11 30 011_fmtm.xls >> 

Good Morning!

Can you please print?  thanks.

See '1130' tab.  We were due net $58.4MM on this day.  Call if you have questions.

 

Thanks,
Todd

Francisco tells me that all of the Mexican ISDA Master Agreements provide for automatic early termination (as of the day prior to filing).  Valuation would have occurred as of Friday, Nov. 30, 2001.

The valuation info. that I had (for the parties below) must have come from the commercial people and incorrect.

Have they been terminated?  Our file is as of 11/30, but if they have not terminated, the value could be vastly different from that file.

I just wanted to verify that the following parties are out of the money (as of 11/30/01):

Compania Minera Autlan
Copamex
Galvak

I was told that these are now in the money to ENA.

Jaime:

As I told you before, Sara Shackleton is the lawyer of the Estate in charge of all financial trading matters.  I prepared a memo to her that included the MTM you gave me and also the status of the contract with each counterparty.  One question Sara had was about the date of the MTM valuation you sent me.  I know it is a bit old but cannot recall the exact date.  Could you please let Sara know the date and who exactly prepared the valuation (I am talking about the MTM you sent me).

Also, please let Sara know all your contact info.

I had a conversation with Ted Murphy and Mary Nell Browning this morning re: ECTRIC and the London process.

Ted has generated both an in and out -of-the-money list which he will forward so that Houston can review for counterparty termination accuracy.  I think that London can use our newly established processes as a template.  Ted and others will participate in the 9:30 a.m. conference call Feb. 6.

Tom and Bjorn:  Can you provide a Ted with a copy of the "Star Gas Propane, L.P." template, or if this has been replaced, a copy of the most recent template?  Also, the "Liquidation of Price Risk Management Book" template?

Alan:  Can you provide Ted and Mary Nell with a copy of the decision tree and settlement process flowchart?

If the handouts for tomorrow will be ready and incorporate the above, the handouts are all that London will need.

Mark Ellenberg is the N.Y. Cadwalader lawyer who is assisting Houston on a regular basis (he has an office on our floor and is available through our email system).  Mark has asked Michelle Duncan with Cadwalader's U.K. office to contact you to explore the possibility of assisting you with ECTRIC and other trading/bankruptcy issues.  I was thinking that the U.S. process for trade termination/evaluation could be replicated in London and a Cadwalader lawyer (with trading experience) could make use of Mark's experience with pre- and post-filing "Enron" issues.

RE:		EFP/EFS PROCEDURES FOR NYMEX ACCESS
 CONTRACTS

Please be advised that the following procedures should be followed when
executing an EFP or EFS trade for any futures contract that trades
exclusively on NYMEX ACCESS
.

Orders should be sent to the floor and pitcards should be submitted to the
Late Pit-Card submission area.

Pitcards should be marked appropriately indicating that the trade is an EFP
(marked with and E) or an EFS (marked with an F).

It has come to our attention that a group of employees missed their January 15th 401-K deduction.  This was due to an incorrect employment status being fed by ENRON's SAP system to our 401-K vendor which resulted in your contribution amounts being defaulted to zero.

Your 401-K contribution amounts were restored for the January 31, 2002 payroll.  If you would like to have your contribution for the January 15, 2002 pay date taken on the February 28, 2002 pay date please respond by February 14, 2002.   If we do not receive a response by February 14, 2002 we will assume that you have decided not to have a make up 401-K contribution for the one missed on January 15, 2002.  We are trying to be sensitive to the possible hardship a double deduction could have on your personal financial situation.   If you are not contributing the maximum percentage you could make an adjustment to your contribution percentage going forward to accomodate the missed January 15, 2002 contribution.

As always we encourage all employees to review your investment elections to ensure they are consistent with your investment goals.

In case we don't hook up, the update on TXU is as follows:

As you know, TXU would like to settle and pay what they owe us.  

I met with Jeff Shorter, my counterparty at TXU last week and presented him with our list of contracts and termination dates.  They sent us preliminary numbers, which appear to be pretty close to what we're showing.  Ball is currently in their court - they are to come back to us with their values as of the termination dates we specified, and back-up for amounts that are essentially their estimates of LDs.  We have questions on their numbers for EPMI and EES, but these only represent around $2mm.  The bulk of the value is in the financial gas position.  The ISDA has not been formally terminated, and we need to agree on a date to do this.  Next step is for them to come with their version of settlement amounts for each contract - we will then provide them with ours, then go to reconciliation process.  

 	 

The first file is Harlan's list of contracts and termination dates.  The second is TXU's estimates of settlement amounts.  We discussed both in our meeting and TXU is to come back with back up for their numbers so we can agree on dates and reconcile.  I have call into Jeff Shorter to follow up - they should be getting back to us shortly.  Assuming they agree with our termination dates, and come back with their back up info, the next step will be for us to meet and reconcile numbers.  This should take place in the next week or so.  If you have any questions please call me.  If I'm not at my desk my cell is 713 826-1439.  Home number is 713 781-2966.

Tony Soter is one of the most respected winemakers in the business. His consulting clients have included such elite California labels as Araujo Estate, Niebaum-Coppola, Dalla Valle, Moraga Vineyards, Spottswoode, and Viader Vineyard-not to mention his own Pinot noir-focused creation, Etude Winery (recently sold to Beringer Blass).

 NW Wine of the Week from Andy Perdue: Powers Parallel 46
 This affordable red blend was ranked No. 1 last week at the annual Pacific Northwest Wine Fair in Toronto. Other wines in the judging included 97 Ridge Montebello, 1998 Hedges Red Mountain Reserve, Gordon Brothers Tradition, and pepper Bridge Cabernet Sauvignon. At $30, the Powers wine was the least expensive of the entrants! Gorgeous bottle, too.

=====================================
Highlights:
 Andrew Will 2000 Merlots- Pepper Bridge, Seven Hills, Klipsun, Ciel du Cheval, Sheridan
 Chris Camarda's delicious and hard to get Merlots- 2000 vintage is  made from "his best fruit ever".
Robert Parker says of Chris's wines: "Andrew Will's wines have virtually perfect tannins. They are present but buffered by the loads of dominating sweet fruit. Furthermore, what is amazing about Chris Camarda's wines is that they are concentrated yet grateful. Camarda's (wines) blend power with elegance, concentration with finesse, and supersweet fruit with definition. Chris Camarda is a brilliant winemaker."

I left a lengthy voice mail for you last Friday (2/1/02) in response to your voice mail.  Have you proceeded with the filing for ECT Investments, Inc.?  Sheila Glover is currently available to assist on the commercial side.  Please bring me up to date.  Thanks.

Sure; I think we can do that now.  I thought we might approach it as we organize each file on a counterparty basis but we certainly do not need to wait.  However, we will not be able to reconcile trades, etc. until we have the credit review for each counterparty and I expect that this may be a hindrance.

Sara

Sara:

FYI.

Do you think we should begin the process of sending letters asking for back-up from the counterparties who have sent us termination payment notices, but where we believe we are in-the-money?

Attached is a list of the counterparties who have provided termination payment calculations.  I have identified whether or not such counterparty provided backup to its calculation, but obviously cannot determine if such backup is sufficient.  For all new notices, backup will be identified when the notice is recorded on the termination log.  I did not look at the ECC or London entities.  For the US entities, we have begun to make files for those counterparties who submitted a calculation, but the files only contain the termination notices at this time.  As I understand, we will be focusing on the non-terminated in-the-money, then the terminated in-the-money.  Therefore, we have not begun pulling the contracts for these counterparties.

 << File: Counterparty Calculations.xls >> 

We have been concentrating on the non-terminated in-the-money financial contracts.  For each counterparty, we are pulling 1) the financial agreement, 2) all financial confirmations live as of November 30, 2001, 3) any physical agreements for that counterparty, and 4) any physical confirmations live as of November 30.

Scotie:

Here are three ideas.  He does need a DVD player.  Also, you might consider a black belt (to wear with suits) and a combination money clip/credit card holder (I saw them advertised by Tumi and other labels).  I always have to guess as to what he needs.

See ya soon.  Sara

Hi Sara
How are you doing? I am so sorry to hear about all the stress happening over there. I am thinking about and hope you can take a vacation soon! Things here are fine. Just getting ready for the holidays. I was hoping to talk to you about gifts for my dad. I am not sure what to get him. I got him a subscription to Sports Illustrated and was thinking about getting him  DVD player. What are your suggestions?
Anythign would be a huge help! And I am excited to see you in New Orleans too. I am there for a week and hoping to spend some time with you all. Have a good day.
Oh and Park's friend is Nick Barnard and he is in the financial dept.

Sara,

Have you been able to get any information on the corporate ownership of EFET.  ABN/AMRO requries this information to make decisions on the disposition of their trades with us.  Ideally, they would like a corporate org. chart and balance sheet.  

I am also going to contact Ted Murphy and Eric Shaw.

We need to research now

As we build the matrix of data discussed yesterday in our meeting we are encountering some missing data.  Below is a list of counterparties which are listed as terminated (in at least one of the various lists of counterparties we have) but which don't have termination dates.

BP Corporation North America Inc.	
ConAgra Trade Group, Inc.	
Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch	
Hallwood Energy Corporation	
IGI Resources, Inc.	
NJR Energy Corp.	

Can you please reply with termination dates for these counterparties.  Let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks

PS: I have a few more requests coming shortly.

Dear Mr. Taylor-Brill:

I believe that the best direct jet service between Houston and Charlotte is via US AIr.  Continental has fewer flights and uses other carriers (unfamiliar to me).

For example:

USAIR #586 departs Houston at 7:50 am and arrives in Charlotte at 11:10 am
[USAIR#1620 departs Houston at 6:30 pm and arrives in Charlotte at 9:46 pm]
USAIR #897 departs Charlotte at 5:10 pm and arrives in Houston at 6:59 pm

I am certainly open to other options.  Please advise if there is anything further that I can do.

Regards.  Sara

ENA has ITM terminated positions with six bank counterparties (identified below).  Settlement is part of the ongoing EGM liquidation.

We have an approximate $70 million ITM position with Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P.  I have collected all confirms for rate/currency and weather. We need the MTM values and confirm list now because we cannot have PWC validate or pursue negotiations with Goldman.  This is the most urgent matter.

With respect to the remaining five bank counterparties, I have collected rate/currency confirms.  I need nat gas and liquids confirms, MTM values, etc.to proceed.

Can you please identify Goldman confirm numbers and MTM values now?  PWC will also need.

Also, can we establish a priority for the remaining bank counterparties?

I know you guys are busy so let's talk soon.  Thanks.  Sara

The following parties have terminated their financial masters with ENA and we need the list of outstanding trades generated by credit:

Goldman Sachs Capital Markets LP
Royal Bank of Canada
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB
West LB
J. Aron
CIBC

Of these positions, where the counterparty has not terminated, and there is only FX/rate activity, I find only:

Goldman Sachs & Co.

Laurel and Clara are reviewing this one - it may be repo activity.

I am still trying to clarify what we can be doing for in-the-money terminated positions.

We can discuss further at 2:30.

Beth
Beth, here are the confirms you requested.  Only one of the deals, YD1782.1, was unexecuted because the deal was revised after originally confirmed.

      

can you pull these -- don't send them to these guys  -- they are with UBS  -- we need to control documents going to them

these should be fairly old

Beth:

I spoke with Louis Dicarlo this morning and he referred me to you as the contact for estate confirmations.  Is it possible to get copies of the confirmations for the Enervest deal numbers listed below?  George needs them for a meeting with the estate lawyers.

Please let me know.

I don't know what your schedule is this week but I want to discuss ENA's response to counterparties who do not respond to our request for settlement calculations and methodology (e.g., Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P., J.Aron, etc.).  I understand that you may not be the lawyer to handle a response; this is a "protocol" issue.

Also, on the financial trading side, I have another "protocol" issue with respect to nonpayment by non-terminated counterparties (under the ISDA, GTC's or Master Energy Price Swap Agreement).  Specifically, let's discuss ENA's approach and use of a possible "test case" in this area.

Thanks.

I am not familiar with Enron Re but on the offset side I'd be concerned about (1) different creditors for ENA and Enron Re and (2)  ENA's offset position (with respect to the Creditor's Committee).  I am not certain that we have clarified the estate's setoff position.  Also, are the receivable and trades related?  Sara

Alan,

There is an outstanding $4m receivable due from Enron Re to ENA and various premiums in a lesser amount due from ENA to Enron Re (in relation to cover for the AIG puts). The EGM people are talking about offsetting one against the other. The rationale behind this "internal" settlement is not obvious to me but I am likely not in possession of all the facts. Do you know anything about this? How do you propose we handle? Thanks in advance. DEC

Ed:

The top ten ITM non-terminated ENA MTM positions in financial gas:

Louis Dicarlo is assisting the effort in active financial gas (commercially).  Due to the large number of open gas and power positions, the immediate focus is open gas (financial)/power (physical) positions.  Due to the huge volume of information to be retrieved for each counterparty on a global basis, it is difficult if not impossible for Bob Hall/Beth Apollo to complete the data collection if the counterparty is not in this immediate focus group (I don't have the latest electronic version of the counterparty status produced by Beth).  By copy of this email, I will ask Bob Sevitz to determine if the top ten ENA ITM financial gas files have been completed (probably very close to completion).  The MTM numbers will then be validated by PWC.

The top 90-150 non-terminated ENA ITM financial gas parties have had their contracts reviewed and we are awaiting Bob/Beth to collect and validate data. Advise if you need an exact count.  We are in the process of notifying the parties in this group of possible payment defaults.

Hope this helps.  Please let me know if you need further assistance.

Bob:  Please advise of status of top ten financial gas ENA ITM files.

Sara

Sara,

Can you give me a status on this request?  I have your name as the contact person to accomplish this.

Thanks!

As mentioned, we would like to review gas financial transactions.  As a start, we would like to obtain confirmations, and individual transaction MTM's, for the transactions associated with the 10 largest In the Money counterparties (as measured by positive net MTM)

That's always been an issue.  I don't think that Angelo handles all commodities.  ENA also books financial weather, paper/pulp, rate/currency, crude, steel, plastics, etc.  Credit Ag can pick up all products so Beth Apollo should be able to verify.  Sara

Ed made the point that we need to make sure we have picked up all commodities associated with the contracts we send demand letter for.  I'll talk to Angelo to see if he picked up all commodities.  If not we may need to slow down (unfortunately) in order to sweep the landscape for other commodity unpaid invoices (besides gas).  

See you in the morning.

I haven't spoken with Frank in several days.  You may want to ask Holly (his former assistant) for a number to just say hello.  He seems to be doing a little better each day.  Can we set up a call later today and I'll try to fill you in as much as I can?  There is a developing process and I'll tell you how it is supposed to work.  I have a meeting in at 2:30 Houston time so I'll call you in a few minutes or afterwards.

Sara

Sara- I am sorry to hear Frank has left.. have you spoken to him, is he OK? How are you doing?

Can you please tell me how you are dealing with counterparties who still have exposure to Enron?

I know all contracts are null and void.. what is the process for them to take off deals.

The only counterparties I have with any exposure are:
tudor
wexford

I am asking for them specifically.

Also, on monies we owe counterparties.. like tudor and catequil, what is the process they must go through?

Thanks very much,

Hi guys,

This is an article that ran yesterday in the L.A. Times, and I believe on
Sunday in the New York Times by Rod Smith on Chardonnay.  D-G gets a nice
mention so I thought I'd try to pass it along.

Let me know if this comes through since it's the first time I've attempted
to forward an aritcle.

I used to be a staunch ABC man. "Anything But Chardonnay" (and Cabernet) was
my motto. I was simply bored with the sameness of the oak-flavored grape
syrups so many California vintners were producing from the state's two
predominant varieties.

I sent you an invitiation to a meeting earlier today and noticed that I scheduled it for last Saturday; my apologies.  Anyway, Louis and I are trying to get together with you and Alan Aronowitz to get up to speed on the status of Live CP's that were sent Demand Letters and to begin determining a process for moving ahead with terminated CP's.

We are able to meet in your building at whatever time works best for yours and Alan's schedules.

financial contracts are 1-way

you can obtain global contract numbers

As we move forward with CPs we need to know weather there is 1-way or 2-way termination payment methodology in the contract.  (Plan is to add a column to our spreadsheet to track this.)  You have mentioned that almost all CPs are 2-way.  What is the best approach to determining which CPs are 1-way versus 2-way?  

Additionally, there is other data we need to complete our spreadsheet, such as:
Contract type (ISDA, GTC, other)
Global contract number
What are your thoughts on getting this information?

I thought you've been saying Financial are largely 2-way but a few are 1-way and we would need to check for those.  Now "financial contracts are 1-way."  I'm confused.

We need to revise the Master Log to specifically identify ALL of the parties to the Master Netting Agreement between the Dynegy group and the Enron group because all contracts subject to that Master Netting Agreement were terminated effective as of December 20, 2001.

This should pick up Dynegy Canada Inc. and ENA pursuant to the Mster Agreement dated as of 6/16/95 and cause our recent default notice to become moot.

This appears to be an open position since neither party has terminated on the Master Log.

(1)  Any reason why one party cannot terminate?
(2)  Is this a single swap or several?
(3)  I think PWC ought to reveiw our "valuation" (and Bob's curve) since it becomes a matter of public record when the claim is filed in the bankruptcy.  Any valuation ought to be documented.

Carlos Ruiz is asking for the value of the ENA/Garden State Paper (GSP) swap to be included as a creditor in the GSP bankruptcy.  GSP is a bankrupt affiliate and the purpose of the valuation is not to settle but merely to show the claim that ENA has against GSP.  Can I provide him a MTM on the position?  

The internal attorney involved is Cheryl Lindeman.

Jim:

Are you looking solely for Enron Corp. executory contracts?

We can identify the Enron Corp. ISDA Master Agreements (which are safe harbor contracts under the Code) as well as securities contracts (also safe harbor contracts).  Please be a bit more specific.

Thanks.  Sara

In rereading my original email, which is below, I see that I misspoke---please delete in your mind the words I have put in bold letters below and ignore them.  Thanks again.

There is a requirement to identify all executory contracts--that is all contracts that are currently active and still have performance required by one party or the other(s).  You each have probably already been asked to list those for somebody as part of the gathering effort.  If you have not, I am asking that.

Would you please let me know whether you have already engaged in this effort and provided the information or, if that is not the case, give me a list of those types of contracts that you know of [or tell me where I can go---maybe I shouldn't have started that way (joke)--to get such a list]?

Thanks.  I appreciate it.

Louis:

Just a reminder that ENA received a letter from Tri-State last month and you are going to verify that Deal Nos. YB 5708.1 and 5833.1 are the only active financial deals with ENA.  If you can confirm, then we can indicate on the Master Log that Tri-State has actually terminated all outstanding trades effective as of 2/27/02.

Scottie:

I heard about your new job and, what can I say except "Congratulations!".  I'm really excited for you.  I'm also glad you stuck it out at Entertainment Weekly because that job will look good on your resume, especially because you had the gumption to remain for a full year.  

Believe it or not, your dad is very "with it" and knows what goes on in the real world.  I think that he would probably appreciate a candid discussion with you.  The reality is that he cannot control what you decide to do with your life, he wants you to be happy and he wants to protect you from all of the bad things that can happen in life (if he had that power).  Since you have decided to tell your dad about your decision, I think you should talk to him like you always do and listen to him the same way he will listen to you.  You guys have a terrific relationship and you should keep it that way forever (you know fathers and daughters are really special).  He may or may not be happy with what he hears but he would rather hear it from you than from someone else.

I'm looking forward to seeing you (briefly).  Tell Park hi.

Sara

Hi Sara
How are you? hope you are doing well. I just got off the phone with my dad so i was thinking about you and wanted to say hi. I am comign home next weekend (March 22) and will be happyy to see you that saturday. I am only in town for like 40 hours so it is a short visit but i am looking forward to it. 
So I am sure my dad told you but i am taking another job. Starting Monday, I am the new Merchandising asst for Old Navy women's division and i am really excited about this. So Friday is my last day at Entertainment Weekly so this is a huge change.
I also have some other news but this is just btw you and me for now. I am working on ways to tell my dad so I wanted to see what you would suggest and advise. Park has asked me to move in with him and so I have decided that I want to do that. He and I are not ready to get engaged at all and not ready to get married but we are so in love and pratically live together now so this just makes sense. But i do not want to make my dad upset and am not sure how he would feel about this..... and so I was hoping you could give my any advice or suggest a way to tell this to him.... I hope that this does not put you in an awkward position and if so, then pelase tel me and I will not ask you anyhtign about it again. 
 
Thanks Sara. I hope you have a nice Monday and I am excited to see you in two weeks. Talk to you soon

fine with me

fine w/ me but I can't speak to Sara and Aaron's availability -- Bob

Can we reschedule to 4:30?  There is a conference call with Weil I need to sit in on at 4 pm.  

Daniel:

ECT received a default notice from GSI dated December 3, 2001.  The signature is illegible. There is a path in the upper right hand margin which reads "Draft: (GWN/MJR)

The letter terminates the Prime Brokerage Agreement between ECT and GSI dated "20 August 2000".  As you know, our agreement was dated August 24, 2001.  Can you direct this email to the appropriate GSI person for termination of the appropriate agreement?

Thanks.

Spoke with Dale Ginter (bankruptcy lawyer).  Problem is that Merced wants to cut a deal and terminate if they can pay over 18 months.  I explained that we would terminate if he didn't.  I agreed to not act today and advise him of our decision.  

Louis, we should talk about this one.

You should show "Hallwood" as the terminated party (see Louis's email below).  I don't know when the acquisition took place but we would normally hear from Global Contracts about name changes, acquisitions, etc.

What exactly do you need?  I believe the new entity is "HEP Pure" and the termination was effective 12/3/01.  You should follow up with Susan Bailey or Blake Estes.

Sara

As we build the matrix of data discussed yesterday in our meeting we are encountering some missing data.  Below is a list of counterparties which are listed as terminated (in at least one of the various lists of counterparties we have) but which don't have termination dates.

BP Corporation North America Inc.	
ConAgra Trade Group, Inc.	
Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch	
Hallwood Energy Corporation	
IGI Resources, Inc.	
NJR Energy Corp.	

Can you please reply with termination dates for these counterparties.  Let me know if you need additional information.

Thanks

PS: I have a few more requests coming shortly.

Even though we have already terminated this counterparty, I received a voice mail today (caller did not leave name ) for a commercial person to contact the company to discuss a settlement proposal.  The phone number is 303-978-4965.  The termination was not mentioned.

In a letter dtd 3/13/02 Ormet said they wired to ENA $14,645.03 (plus interest) to cure a contract default.  I've been watching the cash inflow spreadsheet that gets published daily but haven't seen these funds on that report.  

Can you let me know whether you see any such payment from Ormet?

We have a bid on the 91,674 MLMG shares held in account # 102-25786-USD-27 at Bear Stearns.
.
Paul Voigt from Jefferies (00 1 203 708 5800) showed us a bid of $2.25 several days ago. The bid now
may be $1.50 only due to size of the holding & illiquidity in the name.

We've discussed selling this position with Mike Breughel & Alexander Sheers at Bear Stearns, and 
Alexander has asked for you to talk to Bears directly.

Can you call Alex & ask if one of the Bears prime brokers can contact Jefferies to execute the trade,
and also to arrange for the proceeds to be paid back to our Citibank account in London.

The only current deal that EIM/ENA has with Enterprise News is deal # V02450.2

Craig

ENA executed an "Assignment and Novation of Transactions" effective 9/1/01 as to certain derivative transactions appearing on the attached Exhibit A reflecting that the HESC position would be assumed by Energy Marketing, a division of Amerada Hess Corporation.  ENA was never provided with an executed version of this instrument by the two Hess parties.  The assignment does not state that the transactions will be subject to the ENA ISDA with Amerada Hess Corporation.

Amerada Hess Corporation terminated its ISDA with ENA on 12/3/01.

(1)  Louis/Mike:

	(i)  We need a copy of the fully executed assignment document.  Please forward to Samantha.
	(ii)  You need to verify that all outstanding transactions appear on the attached Exhibit A to that assignment.

(2)  Samantha:

When we receive the fully executed assignment document, we need to insert into the Amerada Hess Corporation file and conduct a contract review.  If all outstanding transactions were assigned, we need to note in the Hess Energy Services Company, LLC file that no further action is required in that file.

(3)  Angelo:

If all of the above occurs, then we will conclude that the invoices should actually be paid by Amerada Hess Corporation which has terminated.

I spoke w/ Johnny Nor at Navajo today.  I told him that ENA could not wait any longer for Navajo's decision.  They have until 4PM Houston time TODAY, 3/20/02 to get a termination to ENA (via Stephanie Panus' fax: 713-646-4818).  He understands that if they do not terminate today ENA will terminate Navajo TODAY.  He gave me his fax number, 505-748-6742 (note that this is different from the fax number used for the demand letter).

Susan: Notes for the DDL.

Stephanie: Please watch the fax for a document from Navajo.

Sara: Based on the conversation w/ Nor I think we should be prepared to send a termination.  (Don't think Navajo will terminate.)  Call if you have questions.

We will not "accept" Kern's termination letter.

I agree that the deals that the list of open transactions that Kern provided is all inclusive.  I have left a message for Alan Kornicks, Kern, to call me back to discuss the settlement process they have proposed.  Additionally, I will speak with Ed McMichael regarding our ability to settle and what steps need to occur prior to accepting Kern's termination letter.

Do not proceed with any action relating to a potential auction of financial trading contracts.  You will need to have the process approved internally, with the creditors' committee and by our bankruptcy lawyers.

I have copies of "processes" which were implemented by the physical power group which you may want to see and use as a template.

Mike:  the "teaser letter" has not been approved by Weil and we will need approvals before we can go forward.

My assistant Becky Spencer will have copies made for you both.

Thanks for the notice.

Do you have the referenced process in electronic format?  If so, please forward.  Otherwise, can you have a hardcopies made and forward to Mike and I?

Do not proceed with any action relating to a potential auction of financial trading contracts.  You will need to have the process approved internally, with the creditors' committee and by our bankruptcy lawyers.

I have copies of "processes" which were implemented by the physical power group which you may want to see and use as a template.

Mike:  the "teaser letter" has not been approved by Weil and we will need approvals before we can go forward.

I have verified that ECI, although a non-debtor entity, must have all proposed dispositions of assets or liquidation of positions approved by Ernst & Young ("E&Y").  Brent Hendry's memo of December 20, 2001 contains the phone/fax numbers for Cindy Ma who is our contact person.  Cindy's email address is:   cindy.ma@ey.com and her cell phone number is 917-680-7810.

Cindy Ma is currently in transit back to New York.  Although she doesn't know who I am, I will leave her an email and voice mail detailing who you are and the urgency of your situation.  You should do the same by email, voice mail and fax.  I suggest a deadline for E&Y to respond to you since I was told in a voice mail from Tony Buggs that any delay whatsoever will frustrate your process for a sale on Friday, December 21.  I am not at all familiar with the details of your proposed transaction but I would alert E&Y to the reasons why you need their "approval" (for which there is no written procedure) immediately or else your "value" evaporates.  There is nothing that I can do if E&Y is slow to respond.  In that situation, I suppose I would keep calling the E&Y New York office to request immediate attention to your situation.  By the way, I was unable to return Tony's message since I received it about 10 minutes ago and it's very late in the U.K.

Just copy me in case I receive a call.

Here are drafts of the Certificates and Sight Drafts for Niagara Mohawk, El Paso electric, LG&E Energy Marketing and Energy Production Corp. (just in case it wasn't renewed).  I have put together files for each of these that include copies of the LC, the underlying trading docs and any correspondence that has been sent.    Except for Niagara Mohawk which requires copies of the invoices and that the certificate be on "letterhead" there don't appear to be any other special requirements.  Leslie Reeves will be faxing the invoices to us.  I will be in tomorrow until around 11.  Thanks for your help on this.

The trades have already been pulled from the system.  I'll have to check with Debbie on the file of terminated trades.  Didn't I discuss this one with Brent before the holdiay?

We tried to call them before Christmas but they were going to call Alex Shears and then he was 
going to call you

thanks

sara is back today so you may want to remind her what she needed to do.... I gave her a copy of the statement showing the position.
sg

will do - I asked Sara re. Metal Management because Bears didn't really want to talk to Markus & I

Simon,
You can take the Metal Management issue.  

Why don't we fill out a wire request for the 66,307.44?  Bryan can sign and then fax to me for gary and my signature.  Lets try and see what happens. What do you think?

 Sheila

 << File: BEST Cash Transfer Enron Credit Inc 2 Jan 02.doc >> 

thanks - looks like what we are expecting, plus $x for the Metal Management shares

we've got 91,000 worth about $1 a share

Simon,
I just faxed to you BS reports as of 12/28/01.  It appears total equity is 66,367.44 USD for Enron Credit.  The  metals position is still there.  

The quality of the reports is not good.

Please verify equity you think we should be able to withdraw.

TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan

Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the "Personal Data" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

ENA has received a second written request from a financial counterparty (Union Spring Fund Ltd.) for the return of $150,000 cash collateral plus interest.  The cash was posted as initial margin on trade date of the swaps.  We have confirmed that all trades were terminated as of mid-December, 2001.  The counterparty has not sent a "termination letter" as there was nothing to terminate, but has sent a letter requesting return of the collateral.

Although we may not want to return the cash, aren't we obligated to do so?

ENA received a termination notice dated December 11, 2001 from Tribune of the 8/21/97 ISDA Master Agreement and all outstanding transactions.  The Early Termination Date is December 12, 2001.

The Tribune claims it owes no payment but is seeking return of $34,000,000 in "damages."

We need to identify all trades and identify the Settlement Amount for our response to them.  Are we holding any margin? 

Please call to discuss.

sara -- to bring you up to speed, BNP Paribas decided they could not go forward with the transaction.  We were able to get GenRe back into the trade late Friday night and are attempting to complete the novation/assignement over the next couple of days.  In order to reduce concerns over potential clawbacks, I think it is best to take this transaction through the Houston process.

Can you let me know exactly what needs to be done and I will start working on our side.  Thanks.

Thank you for meeting with myself and John Malowney today to discuss the opportunities for Enron and Tri-Met to work together.  As we discussed, in order for Enron to provide either physical or financial products as an Oregon Direct Access ESS provider, the EEI and ISDA contracts that we left with you today will need to be executed.

      Dear Sara & Cheryl,

      I have been asked by our affiliate in Geneva, Cargill
      International, S.A. ("CISA"), to begin negotiations for
      them on an ISDA Master Agreement with Enron.

      There had been some question as to which Enron entity
      was to enter into an ISDA with CISA, but the latest
      information they had (possibly from someone in an Enron
      Could you kindly advise whom I should be contacting to
      confirm this is indeed the proper Enron entity and with
      whom I should be speaking to begin negotiations?  Please
      also let me know if there is anything that needs to be
      done from a Credit or Trading perspective in order to
      get this ISDA started on Enron's part.

      Thanks and Regards,

Tthanks for the heads-up.  What is the full name of this party?  Exactly what "ISDA" did you  leave for them to review (i.e., was this a customized agreement with credit?)?  Can I please have a copy in case someone calls me.

Thanks.  Sara  

Brian:

Thank you for meeting with myself and John Malowney today to discuss the opportunities for Enron and Tri-Met to work together.  As we discussed, in order for Enron to provide either physical or financial products as an Oregon Direct Access ESS provider, the EEI and ISDA contracts that we left with you today will need to be executed.  

Please feel free to contact the following individuals in our legal department at Enron to discuss the documents in more detail.

Per my vague voice mail, please open the attached document (Terms of Business) and look at page 12, Paragraph 20 (Jurisdiction).  This is the paragraph I am inquiring about.

Thanks, as usual.

Jonathan:

The attached document is governed by English law and subject to SFA rules and regulations.  Could you please take a quick look at the SFA provisions and let me know if you have any comments?  The SFA references appear in the following paragraphs of the Terms of Business:

page 2	-	2.2
page 4	-	4.2
page 5	-	7.3
page 10	-	12.5
page 16	-	5.1 (of Part III)
Page 18-	7.9

Also, I'm uncertain of the following:

page 13-	1.2 	Is this "best execution" language alright?
page 17-	7.3	Is the "further assurance" language appropriate for perfection of a security interest in Collateral (in England)?
page 28-	Schedule 3	Are these "LIFFE" terms fairly standard?
Appendix	This Appendix contains provisions for documenting CFD's.  Can't these be documented under an ISDA?

Please let me know if you have any questions.  And, thanks for your generous assistance.

Sheila:

A few points:

(1)  I've sent a request to London to review the SFA reps and LIFFE provisions; Jonathan Marsh is out of the office until Nov. 5.  Jonathan is the regulatory expert.

(2)  Page 5 -	7.1 (MDL and CLR fees/charges) and 7.2 (direct payment by CLR of MDL costs).  Do you already have a fee schedule?  Since ECT will be clearing through GSI and MC&Co., should we delete references to CLR? or shoudl we markup the CLR references as if we would be clearing through CLR?  I suppose you may decide to clear throug CLR.

(3)  Page 6 -	7.5 (account debit for fees)

(4)  Page 11-	15.2.  I don't think we would object if CLR had the right to assign to Credit Lyonnais, but does ECT need to right to assign to another entity (without first obtaining consent)?

(5)  Page 16-	4 and 5.2.  Also, will we be settling outside the U.K. per 6.2?  I didn't know if this could be an issue.

(6)  Page 19-	8.1.  Have you agreed to alternative interest arrangements?

(7) What exchanges will you be trading on through MDL?  This terms of business contains a Schedule 3 (LIFFE terms) and 7.3 of that Schedule will apply to all other exchanges per 3.3 on page 3 of the terms of business.

Thanks.

On May 22, 2001, I sent an email to you regarding the aforementioned account assignment.  I also copied Nikki Kroll on that email.  ENA and ECI are anxious to have this assignment executed but we have not had any response.  I am reattaching a copy of the assignment for your convenience.  I will need your assistance in identifying the ECI account with Goldman, Sachs & Co. ("GS").  Stephanie Panus sent Nikki Kroll the ECI account documentation via overnight delivery on May 18, 2001.

Please direct your attention to the following:

(1)  Please execute and return to ECI an original Corporate Account Agreement with GS.  Also, please provide ECI with the account number.

(2)  Please review the attached Assignment and Assumption Agreement and advise if we can execute and forward to GS for execution.

Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

I spoke with Beth Ng (who is not a lawyer!).  Beth would like for Enron Gas Liquids Inc. and ERAC to sign the "mini-netting" agreements she has already negotiated with EEFT through Paul Simons.  Morgan does not need to execute this "mini-netting" agreement with ENA.  Morgan would be interested, however, in seeing the ENA form of Master Netting Agreement which they may also agree to sign.  But for the immediate future, the EEFT version is their primary goal.

ENA will execute an assignment with ELFI and Morgan to accept ELFI's positions in the four financial trades.

Hope this helps.

Dear John:

As discussed, we have exposures under Enron Reserve Acquisition Corp.
and Enron Gas Liquids, Inc.   We would like to enter into a netting
agreement with each of the Enron entities.

Today, we executed a netting agreement with your London entity, Enron

Read the message.  I think we can help.  My question is, who is this
opinion going to be given on behalf of.  If it is from the City of
Glendale to Enron, the logical firm to give it is Glendale's "bond
counsel" since that is the outside law firm which 1) knows municipal
finance, 2) has an existing relationship with the City and 3) isn't
going to get into conflicts issues (which we probably would if we were
going to deliver an opinion on behalf of Glendale to Enron).

We think the Jones, Hall firm in San Francisco may be bond counsel to
Glendale, but perhaps not.  Let me know how we can help.

I would first talk to Pat Boylston at Stoel Rives 503-294-9116.  Stoel
Rives has recently opened a San Francisco office and Pat, who will know
about 90% of the stuff to give the opinion, can probably find a
California attorney from their office to finish it off. ----cgy

In the meantime, for your transactions on the Montreal Exchange, Fimat
Canada will execute them and give-up the clearing to BMO Nesbitt Burns.
For this purpose, we need to have a give-up agreement in place.

Attached is a give-up agreement.

Sara,

Further to my voicemail message of this afternoon, attached is the "merger
letter".  As it happens, both Chase and Morgan had ISDA agreements in
place.  The letter selects the Chase agreement (which, as you know, we
amended earlier this week), as the preferred agreement, and terminates the
Morgan agreement.

Please review and call me (212-270-2673) if you have any questions.  If the
letter is acceptable, please call me and I'll arrange for execution copies
to be sent to your attention.

Thankyou again for you help.

Attached is a give-up agreement.

Let's try to not duplicate work efforts.  I just sent a copy of the BMO repo agreement to Laurel Adams who requested this for the AA audit.  Who's in control of the AA process?  Just give me a call.  Thanks.  Sara

 << File: Contract Request 103101.xls >> 

Sara,

I've been working with Carrie Richardson (Andersen auditor) regarding master contracts covering interest rate and foreign currency transactions.  The Global Contracts group has been able to find almost all the contracts with a few exceptions.  

The first, between ENA and HSBC Futures Inc., was set up in the Legal tracking database but we never did receive the actual documents.  The record in Global Contracts was finally trade suspended (as a result of a previous audit) until we can locate that documentation.  We do have an agreement between the CP and RMT. [Shackleton, Sara]  This agreement is a Futures Agreement [Shackleton, Sara]  ; I'm confused about RMT's arrangement with HSBC (we only use RMT for ISDA agreements with ENA) 

We also cannot locate a master agreement between ENA and BMO Nesbitt Burns Corp.  Georgi Landau has checked the Legal tracking database and didn't find anything there either.  Carrie has requested two transactions for this CP. [Shackleton, Sara]    This agreement is a repo agreement. 

Can you please try to locate master agreements for these counterparties?  If you are not the person I need to speak to, can you please direct me to someone else?  I'd like to give Carrie an answer as soon as I can.

Thanks,
SBR x30569

Jay and Tanya:

Legal would like to speak with one of you about the "Chase" and "Morgan" issues surrounding the Master Netting Agreement requests.  There seems to be some confusion.  I think the Chase request came from credit and the Morgan request came directly from Morgan.  The items below summarize what I know about the two different counterparties.

(1)  At the request of Chase and with Jay's approval, ENA terminated the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company of New York Master Energy Price Swap Agreement.  All outstanding trades have been transferred to the April 5, 1994 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange Agreement between The Chase Manhattan Bank and ENA ("the Chase Master).  When the merger is complete (anticipated around November 10, 2001), the survivor JP Morgan Chase Bank will be ENA's counterparty under the Chase Master. [See Letter Agreement dated October 24, 2001]

(2)  The Chase Master has been amended several times, most recently to provide for FX forward trades and resolve multibranch issues.

(3)  Chase recently agreed that ENA propose a new ISDA Schedule/CSA.  Legal has requested a credit worksheet.

(4)  Among other things, it appears that the Chase Master currently provides for First Method.  This has never been amended.

(5)  The Chase Master is used for FX/rate and commodity trades.

On a different note,

(5)  Morgan Stanley Capital Group, Inc. has signed "mini-netting" agreements with ECTRIC.  Morgan now wants to sign similar "mini-netting" agreements with ERAC and EGLI.  I believe that John Viverito is working on these agreements.  Morgan is currently satisfied with its status with ENA but would like to see our Master Netting Agreement and may decide to execute.  Three outstanding ELFI financial trades will be reconfirmed under ENA and I am waiting for Morgan to forward that documentation.

(6)  Both ENA and Enron Corp. have been in the process of negotiating ISDA agreements with Morgan Stanley Capital Services, Inc.  Nothing has been executed.  ECTRIC has an executed ISDA with that entity.

(7)  The names "Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc." and "Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited" also appear in our database but you can check that out if necessary.

QUESTION:  The Master Netting Agreement assignment list contains the name "J.P.Morgan".  Legal is waiting for direction from credit for preparation of the JP Morgan Chase Master Netting Agreement.  

QUESTION:  Does credit also want to send a Master Netting Agreement to Morgan?  Or should legal merely send Morgan a blank template to see if Morgan has any interest in executing such an agreement?

Sorry for the length of this message but the word "Morgan" raises all kinds of questions.  I hope this explanation helps to identify some of the issues for anyone involved.

Is master netting appropriate here?  Sara

Dear Sara: please kindly forward your response to my email of 15 March which
attached the "marked-up" Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement. Your prompt
response would be greatly appreciated as our credit department is extremely

I thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Just spoke with Harvard's lawyer Kim Noble who appreciated speaking with Bill earlier this week.

ENE has triggered an Additional Termination Event under the ISDA (commercial paper rating at A-2 and ENE placed on "watch" status) but Harvard does not want to terminate. 

Harvard will propose an amendment to the effect that our Threshold will drop to 0 as long as a short term rating is at A-3.

Gil:

Will you be handling the documentation?  Does JSB Asset, LLC have an authorized trader list? a resolution to open the account?

 Yesterday we entered into a trade with CSFB for the block sale of our shares of common stock of Catalytica, a public company.  The shares are held in JSB Asset LLC. We now have to set up an account with CSFB on behalf of JSB Asset, LLC to consummate  the sale of our shares in Catalytica.  PLease note that the trade occurred yesterday so we are now in documentation stage.  We will most likely terminate the account immediately upon conclusion of the transaction.

 Brenda and Joel--any problems with us setting up an account with CSFB for JSB Asset LLC?

Also note that I ran this by our internal and external counsel handling the investigations and these transactions in Catalytica do not create any issues relevant to the investigation.
Hey,

We have decided that it would be best to set up an account at CSFB.  I think you guys are already working on everything else, but we will need to additionally complete the customer account agreement and W-9.  Once everything is complete, can you please send me copies for our records.  

Also, we are still pending an okay from Donna Lowry.

Thanks!

ENA received a letter 10/30/01 stating that Man would begin margining on a risk-weighted basis rather than using the NYMEX SPAN calculation.  This is prohibited under our futures agreement.  Man has not formally called for additional margin (which they have the right to do) but rather is withholding about $25M based upon a misunderstanding between traders about moving option positions (I'm not entirely clear about the circumstances).  Man has never claimed that the $25M was "additional margin".  ENA faxed a letter this morning to Man demanding the return of margin in excess of the SPAN calculation, basically a response to the letter.

ENA acounting does not have the software to execute SPAN calculations.  A recommendation to purchase the software was made by Sarah Wesner (who then reported to Joe Deffner) to accounting last year. 

I understand that John Arnold intends to move most positions (including options) from Man to Paribas.  However, this information changes frequently.

Joe Deffner signed the letter and a copy was delivered to Louise Kitchen.  Let me know if you need further information.

Tracy:  Just spoke with Michelle Sternberg.  Allegheny does not want to carve out setoff benefit for ENA because it cannot take advantage of the setoff benefit.  I told her that we still wanted the provision for ENA and could continue business under the old Merrill "deemed arrangement" which has whatever setoff provision we negotiated.  She'll speak with Yair.

please let me know what the physical power attorney advises...this is news to me.  yes, we need to at minimum setoff our affiliates with the cp.  -Tracy

Tracy:

Let me know what you think.  I'll check with a lawyer from the physical power group.  Also, we should at a minimum, preserve setoff with respect to ENA's affiliates.  Sara

Sara -

I have spoken with our in-house regulatory specialist and she has informed
me that we cannot agree to include our regulated or non-regulated Affiliates
in Set Off under the Public Utility Holding Company Act without getting
approval from the SEC.

Please advise if we can proceed on the ISDA with carving out Affiliates in
Set Off, as per our original request.

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline

   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is

   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at

Rod:  London legal should coordinate with you.  Sara

rod's the man....don't think we need a master unless they ask for it

Steve Kessler (212-469-8202) with DB legal has called to request an ISDA Master Agreement with ECTRIC.  Who is the appropriate legal contact in London to initiate this process?

DB has an ISDA with ENA.  Steve told me that DB also has an ISDA with Enron Credit Limited.  Is a master netting arrangement appropriate here?

London:  Please let me know on Monday which lawyer will handle this ISDA request.

Jay:  Please let legal know if this arrangement requires a master netting agreement.

Thanks.   Sara

Read the message.  I think we can help.  My question is, who is this
opinion going to be given on behalf of.  If it is from the City of
Glendale to Enron, the logical firm to give it is Glendale's "bond
counsel" since that is the outside law firm which 1) knows municipal
finance, 2) has an existing relationship with the City and 3) isn't
going to get into conflicts issues (which we probably would if we were
going to deliver an opinion on behalf of Glendale to Enron).

We think the Jones, Hall firm in San Francisco may be bond counsel to
Glendale, but perhaps not.  Let me know how we can help.

I would first talk to Pat Boylston at Stoel Rives 503-294-9116.  Stoel
Rives has recently opened a San Francisco office and Pat, who will know
about 90% of the stuff to give the opinion, can probably find a
California attorney from their office to finish it off. ----cgy

yes, please.  At that point, how do you want to execute?  Sara

Sara:

Our Operations Group has reviewed the modifications.   Your proposed changes are correct.  Please advise if you need us to make the changes to the other two Confirmations.

Jerry,

please see the attached:

JMF   

I have relocated from the West Desk in Portland Oregon and have been advised by our Legal Dept.   that I should not delete any e-mails until further notice.   

Please advise.

JMForney

Kim,
I'm sorry I did not get to come to your open house.    I got the message on the day of the party and I forgot to RSVP that I couldnt attend.
I am a jackass,  but you knew that already......................
Hope all went well.    How's the new job?

JMF

Frank,
I am interested in speaking with you further concerning investment opportunities.     Although you mentioned that  the $1,800  (the amount in my account) is a small sum,  I have been reluctant to invest more money with your firm,   given to performance of the suggestions provided previously.   
I have been a market maker in the electricity business and I realize that no one is right all of the time;    I dont expect this.      However,   I do expect some consistent contact from a broker  who has been successful in his own trading, not just success in brokering trades.      My view will be that the more success we have,  the more money I will be willing to invest.

I am interested in discussing my specific financial situation with you  and learning more about you, your track record and your abilities.
I do wish to talk about covered calls on specific options that I have expiring in January.    I would also like to discuss any other profitable ideas that fit my profile.

I will not use your suggestions to trade at  discount brokerage or otherwise abuse our potential relationship.   

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks for listening  on last week's phone call.       I have been asked to help Doug Gilbert-Smith get Ercot off of the ground as far as Services and Hourly trading is concerned.     If you have not  heard,   the Entergy and TVA cash trading positions will now be manned by one trader who will also trade the term markets.        This will give the traders the leverage needed to create value in these  respective regions.      My inexperience in the term  is the reason given for my implied demotion,   although these moves opened up cash trading opportunities for  other players.          This had been the first month that I've had  access to the prompt month and I am up nearly $500k;     there is no doubt in my mind that I was going to beat this region into a profitable proposition.

I have notified Presto that I would be joining Doug in Ercot,   but would be considering other options in Houston,  or even Portland.     I mentioned that I might call you and he has no problem with that.         The job in Houston may be a good opportunity,  however,   the environment here is not compatible with my personal and professional  goals.

I am looking for other opportunities,  preferably within the company.     If there are areas that you think might be a good match for my skill set,  let me know -   I would appreciate your consideration or suggestions.       You certainly are under no obligation to do this,   but I am confident that my track record will generate some interest within the company,   possibly on the retail side.       

Thanks for your time,

J Forney

i have notified Presto that I will be looking internally.    i am talking to portland,   as they want me back.      i have been moved to the Texas region to supply the Texas Choice and EES customers on an hourly basis.     I would manage this desk and, once again ,   have an hourly crew,  much the same as I did in California.      That is not the job I signed up for when I moved 3,000 miles to Houston.      I have already been there,  done that and I am not  pleased about it so far,   but it will be allright.      If I did this job,   it would become a big success and then I would have to hear about how lucky I was.

I'll keep you posted......it's shit like this that keeps work interesting.

JMF

Thanks for checking -  very unhappy with the situation here.    Very unprofessional and juvenile atmosphere.     Looking to leave the company if something doesnt open up internally.     

JMF

Joan,
I left a message for you today concerning your e-mail.      Do you still need someone?     I would like to ask you some specific questions again,  so give me a call.      I am at 3-7160.      

Thanks,
JMF

Elizabeth,
My name is John Forney and I am the new Electricity  Cash trader in the Entergy region,  reporting to Kevin Presto.         I received a letter agreement from Entergy that seeks to clarify the Entergy  "Into"  definition.   Rogers Herndon has relayed that we have tried to get them to transact under an EEI agreement,  where they have been willing to only operate under WSPP.    They are trying to get us to agree to use the WSPP contract with EEI  liquidated damages language.
I need to meet with you on this issue.   Rogers is available to anwer questions on the background of this ,   if necessary.

Thanks,
JMF

Things are going pretty well -  balance of month trading $43.75 in Entergy and it is going to be 90 degrees all of next week!
I heard that PV is down and its 1,000 degrees in the desert -  you guys must be busy.
Dave Ryan called for mild in the Northeast next week when Earthsat was preaching hot ........   did really well on that deal as I was short balmo  the Cinergy.
He's the man (this week).

I saw Swerzbee and Motley at the K-derby.    That was a good time,  but it was bright sun and hot,  while we were wearing the traditional suit and tie.
There was a trader at the party that weighed about 320.   He was wearing a black wool sportcoat and a khaki colored shirt.    He tried to take his coat off but strangers were dogging him about his sweat rings,  so he put it back on..........poor bastard.

Louisville Slugger factory and museum kicked ass.    They had all the original bats from Ty Cobb,  Babe Ruth, etc to current players.
The have been custom making bats since like 1847.    Good trip -  see you there next year!

JMF

Chuck,
Lee Dean with Primrose Oil called our West Desk to inquire about electricity service to their field in Texas.         His number is 940-322-1077.
If you could pass this along to the appropriate salesperson,  I would appreciate it.

Thanks,
JMF

Thanks for asking -   things are still pretty tough here, but  I determined to make it work.         I am a Director now - would your management be concerned about that?-  just curious.

JMF

Bill,
I talked with Hans at the Autohaus and he relayed that the car was in good shape,  but did probably need a valve adjustment,  as you relayed.   Maybe also an oil leak fixed.     Also,   I asked him about the oil light and he seemed to think that the oil sensor needed replacing.
The Porsche certainly requires more attention than most cars,  the clutch being a common and costly repair. 

The exterior of the car is in fair condition.     Maybe a detail shop could tell me whether some of the scratches could be buffed out.
I'm not sure if you have checked into painting while you had the car,  but you cant get it done inexpensively.

I am still interested in the car and I would like my wife to be able to take a look at it.     However,   I am leaving town tomorrow and wont be back until   Sunday.    Maybe we can meet then.   
If our discussions progress and you havent already sold or traded in the car,   I would like to have it checked out mechanically (at my cost)  and would like a detail shop to give me an assessment of what they could do with the finish.
I realize the car is not perfect and it is eleven years old,  but it is a large investment.....

Thanks,  Bill for your time.   
  My cell number is 713-412-7529.

JForney

Thanks for keeping me updated,  jackie! 
Seriously,   how are things going in the homeland?   Are you glad to be back?   Let me know what 's happening.
I havent talked to brother Jimmy lately.   He is not answering his phone here.
Say hello to the wife -  we never hear from anyone in Portland.  

Knock em dead in your new job!

JMF

Bobby -
How's it going in PDX?     Things very different here in this "market."    It is difficult to trade against monopoly power.      Book currently melting down,  however,  things are turning around.       Here;   nuke goes down,  very hot weather............. prices tank.     The transmission is controlled by utility rednecks who load up the capacity,   driving up prices,  and they release the capacity in mid trading,  crushing the dailies.    We cant buy transmission and hold it in this manner.       Pig forkers!     
Anyway,  I havent been accepted into the bubba club yet,   but I'm still trying.    Presto and the other traders call my region "Jimmy land,"  as most of the players are rednecks named Jimmy.

Hope the wife and Floyd are doing well.     Lot's of bad golf being played here!

Let me know when you are coming down - we will drink tequila at the Cadillac Bar.

JMF   

John - 
How is business?   Things not as fun here as PDX.
I am still in the market for a car and I have a strong candidate:    1990 Carrera 2 cabriolet.    It has 64k and the interior is flawless.
The exterior has a couple of dings and some rock chips,  etc in the front.    The paint has some waterspots on the hood as well.
The guy that owns it is a geek and never has waxed the car.     It may be possible to get these out by a detail shop.

Heres the kicker:   the guy is asking $27,500 negotiable.     I think I can get this for $24,500 or 25k.         It needs tires and one of the headlight lenses has a rock chip.   The car drives great.

Do you know of anything that I need to look out for with this particular model?   The engine is a 3.6 litre and it runs great.    Can a detail shop get out smudges and waterspots?   The blue book trade in on this vehicle in good condition is $24,000.   The retail is supposedly $33k.
What am I missing here?

Thanks,
JMF

Mikey,   
Please see the attached and tell me if I am smoking crack.      This calc would show me eating the difference between the purchase and sale prices,  although I have no position on this day.    You can go into the tab marked "May1."

Thanks,
JMF

 

TJ,
I need tickets to an Astros game  on May 18th.     We will be entertaining 7 people from Entergy and approx.   5 Enron people.
Is there access to a box or,  at least,  blocks of seats together?

Thanks,
JMF

I have purchased from Duke   100 mw's at $51  for flow into Entergy (see deal#591863) .       Duke is  transmitting this power through their capacity through SOCO.     In the event of TLR's,   we have the option of cutting this supply,   without booking out (deal was negotiated with Amar).
If this happens,  of course  you need to fill the demand side and cut the purchase from Duke in enpower - see deal no. above.   The purchases  go in the ST SPP book.

Once again,  If RT has to intervene,  please make sure that Enpower is balanced with respect to ST SPP.     Also,   let me know immediately if there are problems with this or any other schedule that I have.

You guys are doing a good job.

JMF

We have purchased 65 mw's from Teco for hour ending 6 on Monday for $5.    This is scheduled into the North Zone.
If prices dictate,   sell to another counterparty.      See deal no.  767454

Thanks,
JMF

F.Y.I.
As we briefly discussed at the end of last week, I  will be out of town on previously scheduled vacation from July 14th through July  20th.  This time was allocated  as vacation as per the original shift  schedules drafted by Kayne Coulter while he was Real Time Manager.  Travel  plans have already been made at this point.  Thanks for your  understanding.

Hey,
looks like I will be returning to Portland.    They want me back and it is a much better place to work.       HR is wanting me to consider other opportunities in Houston,  however.     They have one week to come up with something,  otherwise I'm outta here.  Other companies are paying ridiculous sums to experienced West traders (California experience).
Thanks for considering me for your group and I'll keep you updated.

JMF

Kim,
Thanks for spending time with me yesterday.   I have spoken with Tom May concerning what my status was.   I mentioned that my preference would be to return to Portland,  however,  I would be considering other options within the company for one week.
My thought was that I need to relay this same message to Presto,  Doug and Lloyd.     I will communicate this today,  unless you have other ideas.

As discussed,  I have attached a copy of my resume.   It is getting kind of long,  but I havent really gotten a chance to "abbreviate."

Thanks again for helping,  
JMF

 

It looks like we will be moving back to Portland before summer starts.     The job didnt turn out as promised and I was put into a role that I didnt want.
Oh well.    The Portland team still wants me and has offered 4 different roles to choose from.   
You cant beat that.

Anyway,  I will let you know how it turns out.

JMF

I will come by sometime after 8:30 am if that is okay.

Thanks!
JMF

I have asked Charles Taylor to give you a call.  You can reach him at x53365.  Based on our discussion, I think he has some things that may be interesting to you.  Stop by my desk if you want further detail.  

Congrats to you and your wife on your new arrival.     Hope she's a good sleeper.      Now at least you can field some different questions,  "how is the baby?"   versus "where is the baby?"
But,  as Kim used to say,  "enough about you,   let's talk about me."   I spoke with Tim B again and he is agreeable to the idea of my return.    He mentioned that West has needs in Services,  Middle Mkt - SW and even Structuring.    I think that I would be a good fit in Mid Mkt,  as I could build upon my experience  and also learn as much of the structuring side as  possible.     Wherever I go,  I am ready to make an impact.

 The HR department here in Houston wants me to entertain other opportunities within Houston and they have brought some things before me today.    I had also considered staying and building the Ercot business here,  as there is a huge need for leadership in this area.    However,   Real Time roles are very hard to shed around here and I am apprehensive about being a Commercial Director managing Real Time.   I have no doubt that I could make a huge difference here,  but a lot of time would have to be wasted defending the group and myself.   

Anyway,  I wish we could sit down, have a beer and discuss,  but that's probably not practical.     Belden says to talk with you about the needs of the floor and get some idea where the ideal fit might be.      

 I know that you are out of the office,  but give me an e-mail when you get a chance.

Thanks,
JMF

Amy,
Hope everything is going well with you.   I dont know if Tim has talked with you, but I am considering returning to Portland.  
I am talking with Wolfe and Tim,  but I would like to keep things low key.    I know this all seems pretty weird,   but my situation has changed so drastically that I have some major,  immediate decisions to make.    Basically,   the East Desk wants me to build a team in Real Time,  similar to how we did it in Portland.
Unfortunately,  that was not the job I agreed to take (always get it in writing - I never could).     Had I known that it was a similar position to what I had,  I never would have left.

Anyway,  Kim Melodick wants me to consider opportunities within Enron Houston and I have agreed to give her a week to see if a fit exists.   She is easy to work with and is being very helpful.    However,  I have expressed  to Kevin and Kim that my first preference would be to return to Portland.

I have given this some thought and believe that taking the Real Time position would not be a good move for me, given the atmosphere here.   
 I would like to have a new perspective on this if you have time to converse.     I would appreciate any feedback that you can give me.

Thanks,
JMF

I

correct

John,

Frank Busot asked me to give him a summary of who is responsible for what in the trading function at Enron.  The reason is that he wanted to be more comfortable than he is with the separation of EPMI and Services.

Currently, I see:

Jeff King - Long - Term ERCOT
Paul Schivone - Short Term ERCOT
John Forney - Services Trading, EPMI ERCOT Hourly, Services ERCOT Hourly

Correct?

Bart,
que paso,   juaro?    
Jeff passed on your e-mail.   Too bad about the beetles.   Is that the Taylor High School Mascot?   "Taylor,  home of the fighting beetles,"....  Go beetles!
I think you are right about Ercot being difficult to set up,  but it just reemphasizes the need for you;    they need an organizer and this situation fits your strengths.
Well,  enough about you,  let's talk about me..............
the Entergy gig was made more difficult,  as I received NO training in cash trading.     After a couple of months,  a coworker took me in and gave me some pointers on hedging,  which is especially important in my region.   The month of May was very profitable,  finally,  and things were coming together until..........

(Please keep this confidential)
Presto called me in to tell me that I was moving to Ercot as Manager of the Real Time group,  his decision being final,  no negotiations.  (thanks for your understanding, bunghole).
I had previously turned down several attempts to bring me back to Texas in this capacity and I expressed that I was less than happy with his decision.
I think that Ercot will be busy and a worthwhile region to be involved with,  given that we have retail load to service,  etc.   However,   thats not the job that I agreed to move 3000 miles for.   I suspect other changes would ensue,  once I established this region.

So.     It looks like I will be returning to Portland.    We bought a new house here and are very happy with everything,  except my job (which is a huge thing).
I may be working West Mid Mkt SW or doing something with the Service Desk.    I dont mind doing anything as long as it's productive.     
Anyway,  I was pissed in the beginning,  but I had to take time to digest this,  analyze the opportunity and make an informed unemotional decision.   
I am too deep in the (out of the money)   options to cut and run,  so it now boils down to where do I want to live.   There is interest outside of the company  in me,  but I am under contract.    I miss Portland and I think about it all the time.     I must be a mountain man at heart.

Well,  let me know if you have any thoughts on the above.   Once again,   I dont wish to have this get out to anyone on the West desk,  just yet.
I heard that you did really well on your home sale.    That's awesome.    Maybe I can buy back my house and my boat.  (just kidding).
I am actually more concerned about buying another boat than I am a house.   How is your housing in Taylor?
I miss the beer in PDX, boating and the winter bowling.   It is freaking hot here in Texas!

Anyway,  keep kicking butt and keep those Texans in line!   

JMF

Kim,
	My relo expenses have not been turned in as yet.    Do I turn those in to you?     I am due the closing costs, etc.  due to my move from Portland.
Also,   Johnny Palmer was very pleasant to speak with.    I appreciate the effort that you have made in trying to generate interest in me from the inside.
Johnny, however,   was not optimistic that he had anything available for a Director level position. 
	  I have been talking with Portland (Greg Wolfe,  Tim Belden,  and Amy Fitzpatrick)    If nothing opens up here by Wednesday,   I need to get out to the West and start training so that I can make some money for the company.
I am still building,  staffing, & trading for the Ercot region,  but I am eager to go quickly if no one wants me in Houston.    

Thanks!

JMF

Brett,
Have heard that Platter was given trading responsibility on EOL for offpeak California and other markets.   I heard he has done an awesome job and Richter & the gang are really happy with him.    He is motivated and challenged,  which is what he needed.  
As far as timing,  I dont know yet.     Could be next week or next month.    I kind of wanted to work on the Ercot desk,  but not for Presto.

Anyway,  keep in touch you wino.

JMF

Actually, it's the Taylor Ducks!!!!  I don't think Ducks like to be called Beetles.  As far as mascots go, I personally don't see any difference.
What's been up mgt's butt?  Isn't it in their, and Uncle E's, best interest to give you all the tools and knowledge needed to be successful?  
What changes do you see happening once ERCOT real-time is established? 
I'm a little cornfused (speaking of Platter, have you heard how he's doing?).  Are you going back to Portland before, during or after you've done the ERCOT gig?  Services desk in Houston or Portland? I'm not a smart man.  I'm actually envious of your potential move back to the Pacific NW.  It's cool to have you and Debbie down here and all, but my vote is for a return back to Portland.  The more connections we have up there, the better.  But don't get me wrong - I'm keeping your best interest in mind.  It's all about you!
By the way, we've found a few places that sell MacTarnahan's, and even some Sokol Blosser wine.  Speaking of wine, I am now an official of both white AND red wines.  We spent the Memorial holiday at my buddy's place just outside of Galveston.  It was a lot of our friends we've known since Jr. High.  I drank more red wine than beer that weekend.  Took a lot of crap about it, and got called "West Coast", but the wine was gooooooood. 
Anyway, it's 20:07, so I need to get my fat butt home.  Keep me posted on any new developments.  I'm sure it will work out for the best, whatever that may be.  Tell "Wifey" I said hey.  
Best Regards, 
Brett  

Kim,
I spoke with Cammi Mursch with the outside relo company.   She said she is handling my account and I should send her my expenses for reimbursement.
I think that this will take care of me.

Thanks,
JMF

I am checking on your question.  I have left a message for Debra Kallus in the relocation department to acertain who is managing your account.  When she responds I will let you know immediately in order to expedite your expenses.

Linus,

check this out:

Go under Texas City and you can get some good webcam action, wind speed and direction.    Also,  you can call one of the bait camps and get directions.

JMF

The opportunity here has been enhanced;   in addition to Managing RT,   I would be managing all of the Service Assets in Texas.   This includes trading around a 500 mw plant,   serving EES and New Power Company loads,  and also the potential for managing a new 1500 mw full requirements deal. 
Of course,  I would have to have all of this in writing.      I would be working with the Texas Term trader to enhance my trading skills in order to effectively manage this position.
This makes the offer more attractive,  but still I would be in Houston.      I am still apprehensive of the bait & switch exposure.
What do you think?
JMF
Anything new going on w/ your current hunt for opportunities.

			Chris

Please note that when you start/stop a schedule to or from the following control areas,  the listed static scheduling fee applies.   

Reliant/HLP  - $49
TNMP  - $55
COA   -  $40
BEC  - $25

For example,  if we schedule for one hour from BEC>COA,   the one-time charge for scheduling alone would be a flat  $65.      Also applicable would be the per mw  line losses and the wheeling fee of $.22  .    
Please account for all such charges in the P&L report.

Thanks,
JMF	

Andrea,  

Please see the attached spreadsheet for Friday.   All of the deals listed  have been moved to Teco Services for this day only.      We entered a buy (which is an estimate of the cost of gen)  and the appropriate sales.  We need to talk about how this gets reconciled.    I would like to know the detail of this transaction.    
I know that not everything has been discussed with this account,  so I would like to discuss it.

I am positive that I need to change all deals for over the weekend.   We had some length for this customer that was sold hourly.     I assume that everything from now on will be entered under Teco Services for this account.
Can you think of any exceptions?  

I will let you know when the weekend is complete.

Thanks,
JMF

It includes a screen print of the xml price curve and the deployment message.

In my conversation with Pat Moast this weekend, I am concerned that we are getting deployed when we should not be.
Today, (i.e. - 9/1/ 2001) the market clearing prices have been approximately $14 (1300HE) to $24 (1200HE) and we have been 
getting deployed.  According to Allgowed at the Real-Time Desk at Ercot, we are getting the MCP when we are deployed.
This brings up two questions.

First, should we be getting deployed based on our Price Curve (see attachment for an example)?

Secondly, are we getting the MCP or the Bid price within the Price Curve?

Please contact us asap to rectify the problem.

Sincerely,
Joe Capassso

John Forney - TECO (Day-Ahead, Bal-Month, Front-Month, etc.) Trading, TECO ERCOT Hourly

As the manager of the ERCOT hourly desk, John "wears both hats" for TECO and Enron and is responsible for maximizing opportunities for TECO and Enron.

Clinton,
Due to the flood,  our phones rolled over to the Portland office on Saturday.    Geir Solberg sold hours 13-15,   230 mw's each hour to CSCS for $25.
I have entered the deals today and they are as follows:

Frontera,  deal no.  644515,  entered under Teco Services book
AEP deal no.  644529, also entered under Teco Services.

I dont know how the reconciliation of this Services book takes place.   I am working on some procedures and need some input.

Lets party,

JMF

Lloyd,
Do I need to input security requests for this guy to get Enpower,  telephone,  etc?

JMF

IM SURE GLAD THAT THE CONCERT WAS CANCELLED BECAUSE I HAD THE WORST HANGOVER EVER.
CHECK THESE ;PHOTOS OUT!

This is CRAZY!!!  Looks like something straight out of Titanic...

Whats up?

JMF

Juanster,
Can I get a copy of your group's expectations?    I need to also discuss with you the duties of all the night guys.    As I understand it,     they  all pitch in to do confirms and they unofficially cross-train in other regions.     What about reconciliation reports - what is required?   What other reports need to be tied out -  the Sched Activity report vs. the P&L sheet?

JMF

Michael,
we checked with Reliant personnel and they dont know anything abuot the fees that we discussed.     That's not suprising,  however.
Does Reliant bill this directly or does the Ercot ISO bill this to us?     What is the reason for this fee?

Thanks,
JMF

Hey Lloyd,
As you know,  Joe and Steve spent a considerable amount of time here last weekend due to the flood.     I would think that some recognition would be in order.

How about a personal best of $500,  or a gift certificate,  etc.?     

What do you think?

JMF

cool

JF-

I believe we discussed the 'static sch fees' that they (HL&P) apply to schedules coming in and out of their system.  These fees are separate from the ERCOT fees and actually ERCOT itself does not have anything to do with them (meaning they do not track the fees at all, the fees are handle at the counterparty level).  I will try to track down the last invoice that Reliant sent to us for these fees, it is a separate invoice from the regular invoice, so that we can review it.

  John,

I had a mismatch problem in the portal that I think you and the group should know about.

I completed a trade with Calpine tonight (09/08/01), I purchased 50mw for HE 3 & 4 and 
quickly input it in the portal.  At approximately 1:50am, Calpine still did not have their side 
of the trade input, so I gave Scott at Calpine a quick call.  He was in the process
of inputting the information in the system and I could see the Calpine entries turning from 
red to black.

All of the entries matched up correctly except for the 300 interval and this is where
the problem begins.  Scott confirmed the trade verbally and I, also, had the same information
(i.e. - 50mw, South Zone, etc...).  Even though, everything was the same in both portals, it remained red
and unmatched.  

Scott called Jake at Ercot and confirmed that both sides of the trade were correct, 
but he did not know why it did not match up.  He said it was a system problem and 
that he would have it looked at on Monday.

Jake at Ercot mentioned that we should contact our customer service rep. to make sure that we 
are not incurred any penalties.

Please keep an eye on this as it could become a chronic problem.
I have documented this in the QSE Mismatch log book.

I hope this has been helpful.

Thank you

Joy,

We spoke with John at your office about a proposed idea where EPMI and
COB book both sides of the parking agreements and then any power COB
keeps is sold to COB  at a price plus $4 to zero out the parking.  This
is acceptable for us, and I have tried to get in touch with John several
times so that he can instruct whoever to make the changes in your system
and to confirm that this is ok so we can change our system.  However, I
am not getting any response.  Do you know if any changes have been made
to your numbers?  If you could get with him and give me a call, we could
try to close out May!  Thanks.

Stewie:
I agreed to stay through the end of the year (February)  to get this project off of the ground.   What I get in return is the responsibilty of trading around our assets in Texas,  a 500 mw unit,  Frontera,  and a 100 mw heat rate call from the City of Austin.   I have asked that these responsibilities be officially committed to writing.
It is too late in the year for me to move to Portland,  get out and make a contribution for the summer.    These guys are in terrible shape here,  and I am needed.
I report to Lloyd Will,  who is a great guy.    I am working with Doug Gilbert-Smith,  who is the Ercot Term trader.   He has agreed to share some of his knowledge with me and I am spending time with the gen group to learn more about the steel.  I will be working with Miller and Smith (weeeeeelllll?)   
This was the best option for me at this time,  and also for the company. 

I will be leaving the main office in February,  whether it is with Enron or not.   I would prefer to stay with the company,  as my options are worth zero at the moment.
We still want to return to Portland,   but right now I am needed here.   

Thanks for checking.    Let me know when you are coming down,   but dont bring your sweater.    Hope things are going well for you and your group.
I'll give you a call later and tell you what's what.    (hey,  I never used to say  that - you were stereotyping).

The turrrets are programmed in the order of personal preference.   However,  you can use someone's while they are gone.  
I will get you access to Watt's or Eric's.

Thanks,
JMF

 << File: ERCOT SpeedDial.xls >> 

I've spoken w/ TJae....

My turret ID is gone...But there is a temporary turret number that is normally used for visiting personnel that I may be able to use.  To get around all this, why don't you just have a list of the guys working under you & have these numbers programmed into each turret..When you need my help, I can just use their turret IDs & we'll have the problem solved. 

TJae will be getting back to me on the turret status but what about this solution?

We have four direct lines to the Ercot ISO that have been installed on each of your turrets.    As an ISO participant,  we are required to be staffed 24-7 to handle any request from the ISO concerning our generation, or to handle contingencies related to our preschedules.

If any of these lines should ring,  we need to be sure to pick it up.    Ercot  may just be testing our responsiveness,  or ,  they may have a specific question about the mock market that is taking place now.      Any questions that cannot be immediately answered should be relayed to Smith Day or myself.

We will be installing hardware soon that will receive generation instructions from the ISO.   For RT purposes,  this will be used for billing purposes.    Any action ordered by the ISO will also be communicated to the Control room simultaneously.   They will be responsible for the actual dispatch of the unit.

We will be announcing a meeting soon to describe our new Ercot world and to exchange ideas.    I would also like to have a session with the group to explain the logic behind the reports we are responsible and to explain how the whole floor works.    This can be a broad overview,  or we can drill down to specifics at your request.

  

Thanks for your attention.

JMF

 

Remember how bad T.A. reported that we all were on putting cuts into the system, enpower work,  reconciliation,  etc. ? 

THESE GUYS DO NONE OF THAT - NO ONE EVEN KNOWS HOW.   

Settlements is working hard,  but TA doesnt say a word to the RT traders here,  as it would be political suicide.     That's why she turned toward us.
She is supposed to be our rep to the ISO,   and I talked to her,   explaining my expectations.   She was squirming  about saying that she or Rebecca wouldnt know the answers.   Im cool with that,  but cant you find out?   Everything is such a big struggle here.

Im not coming until February at the earliest.    I am an Oregonian.
The freaking mosquitos are terrible now that the floodwaters have subsided.  I forgot about that bit of joy.

Just a quick note to acknowledge the great job that Geir Solberg did in helping our office out during Tropical storm Allison.
Our phone lines, computers and cell phones were down.    Additionally,   we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown.

One of our service customers,  Teco,  wanted to sell some test power in South Texas.   Geir was contacted via satellite phone.
He sold 230 megawatts each hour to AEP.   He used the proper terminology unique to Ercot and sold the energy at a decent price.
He maintained good,  detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday.    
Most importantly,  this was a seamless transaction to the customer.

Again,  thanks for the help.

JMF

Whoa,  that is way too high for yesterday.   Please hold the presses before this gets billed to us.

Amy,
I have elected to stay in Houston until at least February.  It is so late in the year,  that I may not be immediately effective in the West and I would have "lost" the first part of this year,  as I was training (myself).
There is a huge need for me here and I am trying to do what's right for both E and myself.    To that end,   Lloyd Will has offered me an opportunity to trade around Enron's assets in Texas,   learning the term trading side of the business from Doug Gilbert-Smith.
Both Doug and Lloyd know my circumstances and their proposal gets me the experience that I need,  while they get my experience in Services,  training & managing a team and making money in a pool type market, as exists in Texas.

These opportunities were presented to me only after I stated emphatically that I was returning to Portland.   I would still like to live in Portland as early as February.    I realize that a seat wont be held open for anyone,  and I will revisit this issue in Feb.

This compromise seems reasonable.   I have asked that this be committed to writing,  so I am editing what Lloyd has created concerning job responsibilities.

Additionally, most junior people are dissatisfied here and the bottom line reason:    they dont know how their job relates to the entire floor making money.
This explanation to them and an acknowledement of their contribution will bring the ideas forth from the "back corner."
The senior traders say aloud that they dont need anyone, and they will make their money with or without help.

A particular trader antagonizes until someone stands up to him,  then he has them sent home.     I think that there are three Real Timers at home at full pay right now.     One or two will be paid for two years, or so I'm told.   This type behavior is allowed as the trader makes a great amount of money for the company.   This is not an unusual occurence on trade floors,  but I will not be any part of it.

I am going to spend this time to try to make some difference in this culture.    If we dont get buy in from the top,  I will also be at risk of going home.    Some of these guys just dont get it.

There are, however,  many positives to staying here:  the guys I report to are like-minded concerning the above.   They are very competent and have a lot to teach & they are willing to teach.   I am excited about learning something new and also being able to lead a team.

Well,  thanks for listening to my sermon, sister Amy.   My wife and I miss Portland and will probably be back next year.
Hopefully there will still be opportunity for me at that time.    If you have any thoughts or advice,  please share,  as I have alot of exposure this year, due to the move and subsequent reorg.   

Later,
JMF

Always up for coffee!

JMF

Thanks for getting back to me - I can certainly understand why you made this decision and I really hope that it works out!  I would love to have you back in Portland but you need to do what is best for you and Deb.  

Sounds like you will have a busy year trying to turns things around - but I know that you can definitely make a difference once you put your mind to it.  Also, the training piece of it sounds great too - what a great way to learn and not necessarily have the book responsibility right off.....

I am in Houston next week - would you be able to catch up for a coffee?

Thanks!

 << File: personalbest.doc >> 

Chris,  I think we already discussed this issue but let me summarize what I think happened:

we were parking 50 mw's with COB.   We sold 50 to Reliant/HLP,  but the transmission got cut.    3 mw's flowed on Oasis 9337 to Reliant.    We show in the system that we are purchasing 50 mw's from COB and selling them 47.
So,  I dont think that we needed to bookout 3 mw's with HLP.    They received 3 mw's from City of Bryan on deal #625291. 
You entered a bookout purchase on deal #625352.

Oasis also  shows that 3 mw's flowed on #9337.   So once again,  we have an extra purchase from HLP that we didnt need.
Did you negotiate this with HLP?   
Is this what happened?

I'll talk to you about this tonight.

Thanks,  MW

JMF

que paso,  pawpaw

JMF

Jeff,
If you've rec'd a deployment instruction that is a Category 2,3  or 4, it implies the deployment is to relieve operational, or local, CONG.   The Security Constrained Economic Dispatch algorithm has determined your unit is  located such that its movement per the instructions will help to alleviate the  local congestion.  Following is copied from the document, "Market  Bulletin-Thursday August 8, 2001".  This is the last paragraph on page 2 of  that document.
"Therefore, when Operational  Congestion exists, the solution found in STEP 1 may be augmented in STEP 2 with  both resource specific and modified portfolio awards. The result of STEP 2 is  always a set of final portfolio based and resource specific dispatch  instructions to be issued to the QSEs to solve the operational congestion.  Because the final portfolio based dispatch instruction equals the net result of  the preliminary STEP 1 portfolio based balancing energy awards and any STEP 2  portfolio adjustments, the QSE's bid curve may not match the MCPE  determined in STEP 1. This may be causing the appearance of being incorrectly  "struck". Whenever a QSE receives unit specific deployments, it will  also receive a Category 1 portfolio based deployment. ERCOT expects that the  portfolio-based instruction will be followed."
So, even though your customer is determining your bids, your  unit could be called upon to relieve any local Cong that results from "Step 1"  (per the referenced bulletin) deployments to resolve load/gen imbalances and  zonal cong, if that unit is deemed to have an effect (the shift factor) on  the constrained line.  
 
Clear as mud?  Hope this  helps.  
 
I'm leaving here in about five minutes to go to an appt with  Holly, but will be back in on Monday.

Folks,

Please let Lance and myself know if any of you are interested in attending the Power World training.  Power World provides visual representation of an optimal power flow model that can help make decisions regarding potential TLR's and price impacts of congestion.  We have the program now and the intent is to make more use of it over the next few months and as RTO's and congestion pricing becomes more prevalent.  

Thanks,

Tom.

Power World will be in next week to conduct training.

We plan to begin at 11:00 AM on Wednesday (6/27) and end about 6:00 PM, to accommodate the trading floor's schedule.  

On Thursday (6/28), we will begin at 11:00 AM and end about 4:00 PM.  

All participants will need to have a laptop and an external mouse. I will get back to everyone on the room number later.

Hey,  
what's the latest in the service world?     I am working with Tom May on services in Ercot in addition to my Ercot ISO duties.
How does the price cap crap work?    Does this have opportunity for us on the service side or does this kick us in the face?

JMF

Lloyd,
Would it make sense to press our EES/West Point guys to a decision?    We should express that we want to hire internally,  however,  we do have external candidates that we are considering.

The Reliant guy,  Ryan Thomas,   was a good interview and seems to have something positive to prove.   I believe that HR has some specific questions that they wish us to ask regarding his employment at Reliant.

Also,   EES is petitioning Kevin for me to let Watt's go right now.    I have indicated to Terry Donavan that mid July would be preferable due to our being already short staffed.    

Let me know your thoughts on this when you get the chance.    I will be out of the office for half day Friday and all day on Monday.

Greetings - I have attached the most basic expectations for our group.   We have been spending a lot of time balancing the books lately, and the attached will relieve some of this, so we can focus on trading.   I will make sure that we receive balanced books from Day ahead trading/scheduling.
Also,  make an effort to know why we run reports, etc.  so that you can make suggestions to streamline this operation. 

I will provide more documented general procedures and will spend time with each of you on how to handle cuts in Enpower and Lotus Notes.      

We have a good group and we will do well in the new market.    However,  this will take an extra effort from each of us.
If you have questions about any of the expectations,   ask.    That is why we make the list.

Thanks,
JMF

 

CHECK IT OUT.    IF YOU TRADE DAYS WITH ANYONE,  MAKE SURE THEY HAVE A SIMILAR SKILLSET.
IE,  DONT TRADE WITH THE NEW GUY TO FILL A NIGHT SHIFT ALONE.

THANKS!

JMF

Thank you,
JMF

Unplanned Losses - ($898.22)
Static Sch Fees - $49.00
ERCOT Sch Fees - $136.40

Total - ($713.82)

Don't spend it all in one place!

PS  I'll be out on Friday however I will be in early Monday to finish calculating June's losses and fees then putting the monthly annuities in so that they will be included in June's numbers.  I can email you the file when I finish it so you can check the numbers if you want.  Let me know.

Thanks,

Yes I can.    I have already started working on this.   Chris Watts will help me get this sorted out ultimately.
Sorry for the imbalance.    
You should see drastic improvement from our side effective immediately.   Have a good weekend.

JMF

John-

Can you help me solve some imbalance issues on these 2 days in June?

Thanks!

Chris,
I had tried to reconstruct Sunday the 24th based upon your notes,  but was unsuccessful.    I am going to need you to spend some time straightening this out.     Enpower is out of balance  and the books are as well.  
Risk management/Settlements wants this balanced,  as we cannot tie out with our customers.

We will probably need to restore Enpower to precut status,  then initiate the proper deal entry to handle the cuts that came in.

You mention inadvertancy in your Notes,  but I dont know the particulars of this problem.    I'm sure you are aware that every cut needs to be reflected in Enpower.     If you were in balance when you arrived for your shift,   then you should be in balance when you leave.
The Real Time position manager is used to check whether this happened or not.

Give me a call to straighten this out.

JMF

Lloyd,
This is the guy I was talking about last week.   Kevin seemed to think he would be good on the retail side.   I can answer any questions that may arise, or ,   I can put you in touch with Saji.

Thanks,

Hi John,

Nice meeting you on Friday. I have attached my resume which gives an outline of my background and the work I had done while at ENA origination and ENA trading/structuring. Since I have been with EBS for only 3 months, I have not included any details of the work I have done here. 

Let me know if I need to meet or talk to anyone at the desk to move this forward.

Thanks for all your help.

Joe,
I need some help on the schedule for September 20th.   Steve Olinde is on vacation this day.   I intended to cover for him,  but I am now trading the dailies for Frontera.     I will not be able to cover the RT shift.

I know that you are working alot of days before then,  but I would appreciate your help.

Thanks,

JMF

   We have created a quick quide to do QSE trades through the Ercot Portal.    This initial guide should get you started, however,  this is not a comprehensive handout that contemplates every situation.     I am asking you to read the rules and implement a trade using the Portal.    As you have noticed,   our counterparties have already started trading two hours out.       We will be trading paralell until the ISO rolls out for Friday.   This means that you will have to submit the "traditional" Ercot Oasis and also submit the QSE trade.    We must monitor to make sure that our counterparties have submitted their matching QSE trades, as well.   Otherwise we will be out of balance with Ercot.

A copy of our QSE quide will be in your inbox.     Make sure that you read/ study it and ASK QUESTIONS.

Thanks,

JMF

Chris,
Good questions:
1. You are fine using Ercot System as the delivery opint until the Ercot ISO opens on July 20th.    Subsequent to that, we will enter the appropriate zone for each purchase or sale as West, North or South Zone.       If we wish to schedule mw's across a path,  ie South to North,  we will need to create an Ercot transmission deal to link south>north.     We do not actually do an Ercot Oasis, etc, to buy this transmission,  rather,  this is a way to reflect the desired pathing internally.
Risk Management is creating this internal transmission counterparty for us.  I will let you know what it is called.

2.  The positions that we manage for Frontera/Teco Services should not be reflected in the P&L sheet, as we had been doing.
My fault for not knowing the process as agreed to previously with Settlements & Risk Mgmt.    We are to keep these deals in the Services P&L sheet,  as Real Time has done for MDEA.     
The location for this spreadsheet is:

M:Eservices/applications/services

We will request access to this tool for everyone.

Thanks,
JMF

Attached are a few questions Steve and I have talked about.

1)  What do we need to be showing as the delivery point on our Ercot trades (i.e. Ercot system border only?  the various zones "West 2001"  "South 2001, "North 2001"?  split delivery point b/w the buy and sale piece "i.e CPBS border on the buy form San Antonio and HLP border on the sale to RHLP?

2)  What acronynm do we need to put in the P&L for Frontera?  EPMI Teco Services?  or Frontera?  

NOTE:  Steve Olinde wanted me to remind you that he will not be in the office for training tomorrow (Thursday) b/c the Ercot portal will be down.  He will return for training on Monday around 3:30 pm.

Dave, its good to hear from you.
We are in Houston and its hot!   My wife is doing great and we are still trying to get used to life in Houston.     
I am trading in Ercot region (Texas) and, of course,  Brett is now working at the ISO.    
MY WIFE AND I MISS PORTLAND
Working in the main office isnt as much fun as working in Portland.    There is a good chance that I will return to PDX, as there are so many good people there and so much to do outdoors. 
So, tell me what you are doing now in Phoenix.    Everyone that I've met from SRP has been very nice,  (Perry,  John Sullivan,  etc.).   Hope you enjoy working there and all is well with your family.

Bobby,
I came really, really close to coming back to Portland.    I was recently asked to help get the Ercot (TEXAS) region off of the ground by organizing,  training and motivating the Real Time group.   I declined initially, as I had previously turned this job down from Portland.    I came to Houston to trade cash.    Bait and Switch.
  Anyway,  I was looking to return to PDX to work in Mid Mkt or Services, wherever I could have an impact (positive impact, jackie).    
Once I expressed to Houston that my bags were packed, more opportunity presented itself;   I am going to get experience in managing our assets in Texas.   We have an agreement with Teco to manage a 480 mw combined cycle facility in South Texas.   We have some other interesting arrangements as well.

I will be working with Doug Gilbert-Smith, who is the term trader in Ercot.    Good, solid technical guy.   These guys are in a tight spot and due to the timing of all of this,  I agreed to finish the rest of the year in Houston and get this thing up and running.    Ercot is currently not short nor volatile.    Not much fun yet, we'll see how the pool works.
I am working with Smith and Jeff Miller as well.

For all of its sound, fury and ego's the Houston office is actually disorganized and short on morale.    
My transition could have been handled better by a monkey man.      My gut tells me that if I stay with the company,  I will be moving back to Portland early next year if they will have me.

Let me know when you will be in town and I'll set up some golf and margaritas.   No boat anymore,  I'm bumming a ride with my friends.

Later,
JMF

what up?

Dave,
I should have been more specific;    Brett is working at the Ercot ISO,  near Austin Texas.    His e-mail address is below.

'bhunsucker@ercot.com'

Thanks,
JMF

Hey John!
I'm glad got through to you and that your settling into Texas life.  I did
not know Brett was at the ISO now.  How long ago did he make the switch? If
you have an email addr. for Brett, I would appreciate touching bases with
him also.

Not sure if you remember me telling you before I left PDX, but Phoenix is my
home town.  I have been loving it!  And the family really likes it here too.
Went javalina hunting with my son for the first time back in Feb. and love
camping out in the desert.  We did not kill any of those little pigs (did
not even see one), but it was still a blast.

Of course it is hot as hell here too.  Not a lot of humidity, which is a
life saver, but still keeps a fellow inside were the AC is working.  From
October to May, the weather is great, and that's when we do most of our out
door stuff.  My son is 12 years old now and already as tall as dad.  Man!
Does that ever make a fellow realize he is getting "old."  If I'm ever in
Houston John, I'll look you up.  I usually bring my wife (Joy) along on
business trips, so maybe we could meet you for one of those famous Texas
steaks one evening?

Take care John and may God continue to bless you!

Alex traded an hourly deal (HE 18 & 19 for 30 mws from  CPSB City of  San Antonio to Reliant HLP) on Tuesday afternoon, however, did not get the deal entered into the new ERCOT portal.  The scheulde was input into the old ERCOT oasis and the power flowed as scheduled.  I tried to input the schedule into  the new ERCOT portal, however, it was not accpeted b/c it  was not recieved prior to 2hour hourly ercot deadline.  This is for your information.

Sorry that Johnny had not spoken with me,  but it will work out okay.
It seemed like you were needing some additional days off in July?   Is that right?

Hope your training with Errigo went well this weekend.

John,

I made a list of dates that I had requested off to Johnny Palmer(recruiter) when I hired on and he told me he ran them by you but obviously he did not.  I wanted to give you these dates and see if you could work with these days that I need off.

8/10 (6:30pm - 9pm)  Marital Seminar
8/11 (9:00am - noon) Marital Seminar
10/13 (evening) couples shower
11/2 - 11/11 Wedding and Honeymoon

Thanks, Alex.

This is good info to know.

1)  ERCOT conference call

John Adams with ERCOT called at 3:30 pm on Saturday afternoon to say Enron responded to instructions inappropriately during Friday's frequency control test while under single control area operations.    Friday's instruction from Ercot was for Enron to deploy balancing energy while Enron did not deploy balancing energy as per the instruction because no balancing bid was in place.  Enron  was not the only QSE to be confused by these instructions.  

Adams later clarified the definitions of the operation constraints
OC1	worst level constraint

OC0	commercially significant constraints CSC) approved once per year by ERCOT

OC2	entered manually through operator entry

OC3	populated by DC power flows (FST); designed to include all generators in the constraint equation and adjust for load flows.

John encouraged all to understand the distinctions between all these constraints before actively participating in the balancing energy market.

2)  schedule mismatch

Enron had a schedule mismatch for Sunday's (7-8-01) schedules.  The mismatch was with a 5 mw obligation to BTU for HE 7 to HE 22.  Sunny and I reviewed this situation on Saturday evening.  Sunny said he submitted this schedule several times on Saturday and early Sunday morning.  The off peak hours matched fine.

Settlements and Risk have blessed our version of the procedures.    Now we need to run this by Teco.   
Should I call Frank Busot to discuss,  or is this an item for discussion in the meeting on Tuesday?

We have already received their invoice for June and they have again invoiced us at the sales price, rather than the minimum market price.

I will be involving Clint in the reconciliation to give him some exposure to this side.

What do you think?

Can you price a flight for me to Tampa that would leave from Hobby airport?    The meetnig is on Tuesday and I could leave either Monday night or Tuesday morning.
I could take an afternoon flight from Tampa to Houston Hobby.

We are long 65 mw's from Frontera at $5 for tomorrow.   It is scheduled into the North 2001.
Sell if needed.

JMF

Brett,
I have a business question,  for a change.   Ercot load is forecast to be as high as 46,124 for hour ending 1200 today.   The actual printed from the website is less than 43,000.   I know that there is South to North congestion,   but is this actual load right?    Is interruptible load being curtailed due to the congestion or is their rain somewhere that isnt showing on our weathermap?

Any help you can give would be appreciated.   I dont think that this is proprietary info or anything.    I am trying to see if the forecast is worthless.

Thanks,
JMF

	Please make the following arrangements for me in order to join Tom and Jeff in Tampa for the Teco meeting:

7/16 - Depart Hobby to Tampa at 7:50pm flight.
Stay at Hyatt - Jeff Miller has made the arrangements already.

7/17 - Depart Tampa 4:30, arrive Houston 6:35pm.

I will  be calling on Friday to check on this.   Remember,  I will be on vacation Friday and Monday.   I was scheduled to take Tuesday off, but I will have to attend this meeting.
Please do not schedule a vacation day for me on Tuesday.

Thanks,
JForney

John,

This is what I've come up with so far on Market Opportunity & Operational plan.  I think this would be a good place to also include Mexico opportunities.  Please add/edit as you wish.

Thinking out loud:

Operational Plan and Market Opportunities going forward:

Off-Peak Energy (including Weekends & Holidays):		To date, this market has been less-attractive-EPMI and TECO need to work together to ensure Frontera is gaining maximum value.  This should begin as soon as possible.  Examination of  NOT running the plant during  [Forney, John M.]  the weekend and other offpeak hours  is paramount.

ERCOT Market:	EPMI personnel have a wealth of experience in working in ISO Markets.  It is our feeling that the ERCOT market, which opens July 20, will provide [Forney, John M.]  significant   opportunity in maximizing value for Frontera.   [Forney, John M.]      Opportunity should lie within the Balancing Market [Forney, John M.]  ,   Ancillary Services Market [Forney, John M.]   and the decremental bidding "market."  [Forney, John M.]  Immediate plans will include submitting decremental bids into the ISO.   We will be responsible for responding to the ISO instructions by decreasing the output from Frontera during key hours.

 

Thanks for remembering me.  Hope everythnig is well with you too!

Lloyd,
a couple of questions:
Will Joe Capasso be aggreeable to start in my group on August 1st?    That would be awesome.    Let me know if I can help with anything on this

What is the status of the personal best award recommendation for Errigo and Olinde?

Thanks,
JMF

Please use the following:

Cell -  813-760-7199
Office - 813-228-4907 (should roll over to his cell after hours)
second line in home:  813-634-7772

We have had problems locating Jerry on occasion in order to affect schedule changes.   He lives in a rural area and his cell phone doesnt always work.    In these instances, we tried to contact the plant to instruct them to increase/decrease generation.    They have refused in the past, as they were only to receive instruction from Jerry.

The plant should now be aware that this communication problem can exist and will be receptive to making generation changes per our instructions.

JMF

Lloyd,
here is another Bryan guy.   Pretty much the same length of service as Kevin.

Mr. Forney,

Thanks or giving me a moment to speak to you today.  I am looking for a
position at Enron for the near future.  I have been serving as a day ahead
and hourly trader as well as a scheduler for BTU.  Other tasks have included
designing automated spreadsheets to assist with trading and settlements and
various IT work.  I am looking for something high paced, something that will
keep me busy throughout the day.  I am quick with analytics and have taken
courses in Calculus, Differential Equations, Statistics, and Econometrics to
add to my BS in Economics.

I am looking to move to Houston for personal reasons, to be with the girl I
am planning on marrying next year.  I like it here at BTU, but staying in
this area is not presently an option.  Please take a look, ask me any
question you can think of, and feel free to contact me at any time.  I will
be in Houston Saturday through Wednesday visiting my girlfriend who is a
consultant for Sun Gard, working at Reliant.

Thank you again,

Jerry see the attached.   Ercot has your direct line (cell) for down balancing today.    We are evacuating.

My cell number is 713-412-7529

Call  me if you need anything.

Thanks!

 

From time to time we have applicants from other shops that interview with our desk for RT trading, scheduling, or other positions.
If you recognize someone from another firm,  or know who they are,  do not discuss their interest in Enron with anyone else.

Recently,  we have had two applicants who have reported that others at their firm knew that they had interviewed with Enron.  Both felt that someone in this shop had discussed their visit here.    Totally unacceptable.     I have to ensure that this information is not coming from  my group, hence this note.

Common sense would dictate that discretion is necessary in these situations.   If you have any feedback on this situation I would like to hear it.   

Thanks for your attention to this very important issue.

JForney

Steve,
Check this out-  does this have any truth to it?
JMF
Lloyd,

First, I would thank you for taking time out of your busy day on Friday to
touch base with me via email about where we are in the interview process.

When I spoke with John Forney on Friday afternoon, I did not know exactly
how to handle a situation that had come to my attention early that morning.
I wanted to spend some time mulling it over prior to emailing about it.

As you may have remembered from previous conversations, I was off for four
days last week, returning to BTU on Friday at 5:30 a.m.  When I arrived to
work, I was greeted by Dan Bailey, who informed me of a very interesting
conversation that he'd had with Steve Olindi.

Apparently, Steve had taken the liberty of informing Dan of my interviewing
activities with Enron the previous week.

With this information at his disposal, Dan (who is my senior trader and,
therefore, someone to whom I report) decided to share this with my
co-workers at the QSE.

Both Brandon Whittle and Dan Bailey's response to this was to proceed in
questioning me about the innerworkings of Enron's trading practice.  I felt
that if I shared what information I do have, that would be considered a
breech of confidentiality.  However, they do have their intentions set on
securing interviews of thier own, so their persistence increased over the
course of the day.  This made my day extremely uncomfortable even though I
repeatedly downplayed the interview.

With this leak of information, that I assumed was to be kept confidential,
my concern is that this has put both my job at BTU and the possibility of
employment with Enron in danger.

I am interested in the opportunity with your company, but am now very
concerned where this puts me in both areas.

Please advise.

Kevin Libby

Corry,
Can you add me as a trader in Enpower under Ercot Asset?    Also,  please add Alex McElreath as a trader under Teco Services.
Additionally,   Alex is not able to get into Lotus Notes and, ultimately,   East Power Scheduling Discussion.  
Jeff Miller needs access to East Power discussion - he has Lotus Notes.

Thanks,
JMF

Lloyd,
I spoke with Steve directly about Kevin's e-mail and concerns.    Steve said that Dan of C.O.B contacted him,  inquiring about job opportunities here.     Steve did mention to Dan that "someone" from their shop had already inquired.   He was not specific.    Dan,  evidently,  figured who this was (not very hard)  and spread the word at the COB office.   Subsequently,   Dan and Brandon sent their resumes.

I have spoken directly with Steve about this issue.  I also have put out a note to the group which I copied you on.    Clearly,  this is unacceptable and Steve has apologized.

How do you feel about this:   
if we hire Kevin,  then this problem somewhat goes away.    I need someone immediately and Kevin could be plugged right in,  similar to Alex.     I know that Kevin may not be a solid fit for the trader track program,  but I am needing some help pretty quick.

Let me know - sorry for the very awkward  situation.

JMF

Had to copy you on this......dont be offended,  my friend is from Shreveport.
JMF

I wonder if they've got a patent yet?

Jerry,
Take a look and check to see if I missed anything.    Also,  I would assume that you have some additional energy to sell for hour ending 7&8  and he 22.   Is that true?

Thanks,
JMF

 

Jerry,
Lets try this one:

 

I am scheduled to be out of the office for a few days in late August.    The dates are specifically 8/22, 23 and 24th.   

Thanks,
JMF

Lloyd,

Do you have time to meet with George at noon today?   I am going to talk with him again at this time.

JMF

Michael,
how do you know which deals are the options if they are entered as forwards?
I input into the comments,  but I was about to ask how these options get trued up.

Thanks,
JMF

Frontera 696831.1 price changed from $25.66 to $26.6975
LCRA 697499.1 price changed from $36.02 to $35.855

A friend over at tractebel told me that they had a plant coming on line 9/14.  The plant is located in the North zone with the capability of 340mw, 35mw will run on 9/14 and be thrown into the pool. If you  don't already have them as a contact their number is 877.350.8420.  Kenneth Kemp and Tim Ming are ERCOT contacts.

Hour ending 3 for 5 mw's has been confirmed with HLP.
HE 3  was 60 mw's originally,  but was cut intra hour.   The integrate mw's are 10mw'w and are reflected on revised oasis request 4405.

HLP agrees with this.

JMF

HE3 & HE5 ARE IN QUESTION

I've already checked the quantities on the preschedule....The hourly deals (allegedly) for HE 3 & 6 are in question.

OUR OASIS requests indicate 5 Mwh for HE3 & some other quantity (either 0 or 10--indicating a potential cut--the original deal was for 60).  The Oasis request will shed some light on this. 

So we have for HE3 & 5:

Our OASIS requests
Deals entered in Enpower
Deals entered in the P&L sheet.

Call HL&P & see if they show anything ABOVE & BEYOND the preschedule for these hours.  I'll be back around 1pm & we can finish this and the minor price discrepancies.

Amy,
How's it going?    I was wondering how Jeremy was doing.      Is there anything I can help with on an "unofficial" basis?
It would seem that he has a decision to make,  though I havent heard of his progress lately.

Did you have your vacation yet? 

JMF

Lloyd,
George has departed for his planned vacation.   He will be back on the 30th, per his voice mail.
I bring him in at that time.

JMF

Please see the attached that weve discussed.  Please note what is contained on the sheets on the bottom of the tool.

Thanks,
JMF

 

We must notify the Control room (GENCO)  personnel concerning any deviation from the preschedule.  
 For example,   when we have availability,    or even "must sell"  situations off of Frontera,  the Control Room must revise their Resource Plan.    They need to revise in order to prevent an Area Control Error problem. 

They have the same deadline (two hours before hour ending)  that we face in submitting QSE trades - give them timely info so that they can get their side in.    

For now,  you can use the Stento (dial 5 432) or telephone 877-294-3900.     Of course,  you can just knock on the door.
In Ercot only,   we are allowed to exchange information with the control room.    No other region has this capability.

Thanks,
JMForney

Pete,
Do me a favor;   e-mail me your question and I'll work to get an "official" answer.      Remember that although we will get an answer,   the invoice may appear somewhat different.
Of course,  the tariff overrules any answer that we may receive.  

Thanks,
JMF

TJ -
How many spots does the Ercot RT group have for the LV trip in October?

JMF

Lloyd,
We received this from Preston.     Everyone on this distribution list would assume that EES is waiting on information from us.
We are still awaiting meaningful data from Narsimha/Preston.
I am going to discuss this with Narsimha.
I feel like a reply is warranted,  as we are making no headway on this project.

I fear for Preston if he is to work with me in the future.

JMF

I need your help to make September 1 physical delivery happen. Please talk amongst yourselves and set up meetings as necessary. Just keep me in the loop. 

Rogers Herndon and I (and others) are going to meet this Friday to go over the report. Please have your plans of action/feedback/comments to me by Thursday morning, so I can make sure they get included in the report he sees. 

 

Thanks for all your help so far.

Rogers,
Customers call 	quite often to inquire about Retail Service.    Is there a single contact person that we can transfer them to?
I talk to someone different each time from EES.     
I'd like to get a procedure in place for the floor so no one gets lost frmo the outside.

Let me know what you think,

JMF

Hourly deals should be under Teco SVC the majority of the time.    However,  at times Enron's option (under Ercot Asset book)  will be long into the Real Time market.
This is Frontera generation,  but Enron bought it in the form of the option. 
You will see deals of this type for today under the Ercot Asset.

So hourly deals:
Teco Services - 99% of time
Ercot Asset - 1 %
Hrly Ercot - NEVER

Jeff or John,

Please confirm for me that HRLY-ERCOT should NOT have any deals with Frontera and that all "hourly" deals with Frontera should be with the TECO-SVCE book.

Lloyd,
I received this from Preston.    It appears now that they wish to choose the customers that will switch.   
We were of the understanding that we were to pick the customer based upon the information that EES was to provide.
We havent received the necessary information,  so no choice has been made yet.

Please see the attached and let me know your comments.

JMF
We would like to switch these accounts. We'd like the switch to be effective September 4th, but our top priority is to make sure they get into the pilot program. (I realize that it may be impossible to decide exactly when the switch will become effective)

Please confirm that we can get this done.

Preston,

I talked with Rebecca this evening.  Here is the summary:

- We cannot be ready to do business with CP&L or TNP by August.
- She has a relatively high degree of confidence (85%) that we could be ready with HL&P and TXU, here are the main issues:
She would like the rate schedule (and account number if available) of each account we would like to get into the pilot to confirm that there is room.  She indicated that she had understood that all rate schedules are filled and that the website may be in error.
There are outstanding issues on how interzonal congestion and gross receipts tax will be billed.
Invoicing will likely be manual with additional costs associated.  There may also be other manual workarounds necessary at additional expense.
The Pilot Agreements will need to be completed (per Gloria Ogenyi).

Please send her item #1 asap so that she can confirm that there is room for these accounts.  Once this is done we can put on the full court press for August.

Thanks,
Jeff

Jerrry,

See the attached megawatt awards for tomorrow.    We are talking with the Ercot staff regarding the settlement of this and the	OOM  (Out of Merit)  decrease for today.   It is our understanding,  per the protocols,  that when we are dispatched down the ISO keeps our $35  scheduled sale  whole.    We are paid this revenue stream (by our sale counterparty) PLUS the greater of:  the applicable balancing energy price for that hour or zero.    If you are decreased by 50 mw's for an hour you receive:
$35 sale + balancing $33.50 = 68.50/mw for not running your plant.   

For the capacity tomorrow,
We will reserve the mw's below and possibly sell the rest.    The Resource Plan is increased to reflect 400 mw's plus the awarded megs for each hour.    The EMS will only show 400 mw until we get deployed.  
  At the time of deployment,  we also receive the balancing energy price for the hour exercised.
We bid in a  Non-spin product which requires us to respond within 30 ".   They can take partial hours, at their option.

I hope this helps.

JFORNEY
Director, EPMI

 

 	

I have 2 tee times reserved for a foursome but I only have 2 golfers (my
friend from vegas and myself).  It would be great if you could join us.

We would like to try and play sunday morning as well but I do not have a tee

Jerry,
Please disregard the explanation of the OOM power settlement.     The ISO called us at 7:15 pm and explained a different scenario
altogether.   We need to discuss this further. 
Sorry for the confusion.

JForney

Thanks for your reply.
Here's what I have learned from our conversation:
Since I have not gotten a specific response from my customers,  my spots were "captured" by Don and Juan's group?
I acknowledge that I have not relayed specific names for Reliant and TXU, as they havent responded after many calls,   but did not receive notice that I was to lose my spots.
I expected to be able to include my employees,  as Juan and Don have now done with my spots.

Don and Juan have invited my employee,  Steve Olinde,  with one of my original spots.   He will attend.

I am not trying to give you a hard time,  but I need to know who authorized filling my spots?

JMF

Well...the trip has been booked....at one time you had a few spots.  The only room we have now if for one. We used your spots because we never got your response so we filled them with customers.

Please let me know ASAP if Steve Olinde will be in that spot so that I can get his airfare booked and notify the hotel.

Thanks TJae

Rebecca,
We have heard that the resource imbalance was pretty high.     We will discuss this with you.   We definitely dont want to talk to Teco/Frontera until we get a handle on this.
We will come by this afternoon.

JMF

The ERCOT invoice extract is available and has been copied to M:\Eservices\ERCOT\ERCOT_System_Extracts\.  I will save these files to this directory on a daily basis for your information and review. Here is a copy of the 7/31/01 file.  

 << File: 7-31 Statement Detail.xls >> 
Jeff & John - ERCOT is not showing what we expected for Load Imbalance.  We need to get together and discuss this difference.  Also - do you have any information about what TECO's resource imbalance should have been?

Thanks,

Rebecca

I left you a request over a week ago concerning clarification of your question.
Could you please present your question in written form as a reply to this e-mail?
If I cannot answer the question,  then I will get an answer from our Ercot Rep.

The Ercot Settlement Statements have just arrived and we are breaking them down to ensure that they Protocols are being followed.
This is what is complicated as Ercot doesnt yet know their own rules.

Let me know what you have.

JMF

Any luck yet on the question regarding ERCOT settlements?

TJ:
Please make sure that the Ercot RC is not billed for our portion of the customer trip.   If I can assist with this accounting,  let me know.    I dont wish to subsidize the other Hourly traders who are now able to attend this customer meeting at my expense.

In the future,   I need to be aware of any decisions that will adversely affect me or my group.
I am a Commercial Director and no one below this rank should be making decisions on my behalf without my knowledge.

I do realize what a large undertaking this trip was.   We werent able to secure a commitment from customers,  but I was confident that our spots could be filled internally ( with our group members).    I am sure that the overall headcount for this trip
did not change,  rather the allocation to each group was changed.

My goal is not to give you a hard time - I dont usually mention rank or make much of a big deal out of anything.
But I do expect a certain amount of respect given my rank,  profitability and that I have been here 8 years.
I try to extend the same courtesy to you and your staff.

JMF 

Thank you for the communication...I will add Steve and do my best to get him in all the activities.  Next time I will just be a pain in your ... I thought you realized how important it was at the time I gave you the note to finalize this trip.  They are a lot of work and we have to have all info. in at least a month to make room for changes or errors.

Sorry for the confusion.

Thanks for your reply.
Here's what I have learned from our conversation:
Since I have not gotten a specific response from my customers,  my spots were "captured" by Don and Juan's group?
I acknowledge that I have not relayed specific names for Reliant and TXU, as they havent responded after many calls,   but did not receive notice that I was to lose my spots.
I expected to be able to include my employees,  as Juan and Don have now done with my spots.

Don and Juan have invited my employee,  Steve Olinde,  with one of my original spots.   He will attend.

I am not trying to give you a hard time,  but I need to know who authorized filling my spots?

JMF

Well...the trip has been booked....at one time you had a few spots.  The only room we have now if for one. We used your spots because we never got your response so we filled them with customers.

Please let me know ASAP if Steve Olinde will be in that spot so that I can get his airfare booked and notify the hotel.

Thanks TJae

TJ -
How many spots does the Ercot RT group have for the LV trip in October?

JMF

Johnny,
What is the status of George?   I think that you have been speaking with Lloyd Will concerning bringing him over from EES.   George is inquiring about his status and wants to know whether he should mention anything to EES.    I would think not, at this time.
Lloyd is out of town until Monday,  so I am trying to follow up on his behalf.

Thanks,

I just received this from Lloyd.   I dont want to cause any double coverage by HR, so you might want to check with Kim.

I called earlier today and left a lengthy phone message........sorry about that - we had a trading issue in the middle of my conversation with you.

Anyway,  I received the following question from some of our Retail folks. 
If you could help answer this question I would really appreciate it.
Jeff Miller and I are planning to visit Austin next Friday to discuss Settlements.   We look forward to meeting you.
Are you a golfer?   We may try to play Friday afternoon.

Example assumptions:
Market consists entirely of 4 QSEs who have the following schedule-actual variances in a particular hour; A=+50MW; B=+50MW; C=-25MW & D=-25MW.
Market energy price is $100/MWH.

Since money paid by C & D is insufficient to fully reimburse A & B (5000+5000-2500-2500=5000), what happens in the settlement?  Do A & B get proportionally less than they otherwise would have gotten?  Or, is there a banking mechanism that builds up in hours where there are overages and is drawn down in hours where there are shortages (such as example above)?

<Embedded StdOleLink>
<Embedded Picture (Device Independent Bitmap)>

Here you go:

There is no banking mechanism.    If A&B are net long,  they receive the balancing energy price for all of their mw's.   If C & D are short,   then their short position is covered by the Ercot ISO;    C & D are charged the balancing energy price plus replacement reserve /mw.

If the money, at the end of the day,   is insufficient to pay A&B,  then this full cost will be allocated on a load share ratio basis.     This charge will be allocated under the UFE (unaccounted for energy) charge type.      
If C & D serve load,  then they will share the expense of paying for the balancing energy price to A & B.      A & B escapes this expense allocation, as they do not serve load.

Kim,
Keenon has been recommended to Doug as a possiblity in RT.   I think our roster has been filled out,  however,  I had promised this guy an interview before I knew that Lloyd had lifted some people.
Can we schedule an interview with Keenon,  as I think that he is a strong prospect.

I will send you a copy of his resume via office mail.     He can be reached at 713-410-2255.

Please let me know what you think.

pls see the attached for our expectation of imbalance for 8/2.

 

Ercot is now requiring that we fill out and fax the attached form to  them when we have imported/exported across one of the DC ties.
The file is located in:

Please update tag number,  megawatts (positive for exports, negative for imports),   and total number of schedules.

Thanks Lance,
I have a question:  on the Ercot transmission outage  page,   the TU  Bellmead station is listed as having trouble - the buss is damaged due to storm.    Is this the reason that there are TU CSC's, as mentioned on the Ercot conference call?  The station is to be out until August 10th.  We have had a significant price split and I think that this might be the specific reason.
I have tried powerworld,  but I couldnt turn off this station.

What do you think?

JMF

Doug,

A few weeks back I showed you a picture of what ERCOT could look like with LMP prices.  The attached figure has the lines removed as you requested and areas identified by price.

 << File: 2001 Summer Peak LMP.doc >> 

Lance

Frontera is long hour ending 7-11 by 5 mw';s.    This has been scheduled into the North 2001 zone on behalf of Teco Services.    Please sell this power for > $5,  if possible.
Use your judgement - let me know if you have questions.

Please cut the imbalance deal and replace with the new sale.

Thanks,
JMF

	Attention:
The Ercot ISO has been settling our trades scheduled to the North by giving us the West or South Balancing Energy price.      We have officially disputed this allocation, as we believe that we would,  at most,  incur a load deviation imbalance in the North zone (to be settled in the North).  
Again,  a purchase in the South scheduled to our load in the North is receiving the South or West prices.

We are awaiting Ercot's explanation.

Until further notice,  do not schedule energy from the South or West to the North.         You may still engage in intrazonal, or same zone,   trades (QSE to QSE ).

What IS permitted is imported from outside Ercot into the North zone.     The DC tie is in the North and we should stay aggressive,  working with the SPP team to secure transmission to and from Ercot.    When in doubt,   wake me up.

Update:

At 6 pm,  our Rep from Ercot agreed that the schedule mentioned above should have load imbalance assessed at the NORTH price.     However,   I still cannot accept his answer as the gospel,  as any written interpretation of their tariff will always overrule our guy.

I will advise when it is safe to re-enter the water,  but for now:   EVERYBODY OUT OF THE POOL!

JMF

NEVER FEED STRAY ANIMALS -  THEY KEEP COMING BACK
I have a couple other questions that you may be able to help with.

Have you or anyone in your area looked at the metering requirements for curtailable loads?  Typical cost/configuration/communications support - etc.
How do CPS-1 & CPS-2 play out in the ERCOT market?  Controls on paying for a service versus leaning on the grid.

 

We are required to input down balancing bids for all generators that we represent.     Every morning it is especially important that we have a DBES bid input for Frontera.
We should have balancing bids in for all hours,  but we are most likely to be deployed in the morning hours.
We are required to monitor the Deployment instructions and communicate any instructions to Jerry Watson @ Teco/Frontera.

Frontera is willing to pay a max of $10 to decrease their gen.    This bid tells Ercot that we are willing to pay up to $10 for Ercot to fill our schedule during the time that we are being "balanced down."

We should never see prices below $10 without being deployed down.     If this situation happens,  we have to explain to Frontera why we didnt get selected by the ISO.
This is an important part of the Services side of our business,  and is the only way that we get paid on these type transactions.

If anyone has any questions on this, please give me a call as this is very important to all of us.'

JMF

Lloyd,
Do you want to answer George's questions, or do you want me to handle this?

Ercot has a problem that could cause us great financial pain:   
Sometimes when we are  submitting an hourly schedule, through the Ercot Portal,  the Day-ahead schedules are affected.
Mismatches for every counterparty occur.     We are subject to the hourly price for mismatches and this could prove extremely costly, even for one hour.
    Eric Saibi spoke with the Ercot help desk who indicated that the problem was on our side.

I called Ercot  and after some time,  they relayed that they were experiencing server problems.

Attached below is the ticket number related to this problem.   If this occurs again,   make sure that you reference this number.

Thanks,
JMF

David,
we often trade with EPMI, as they may be the best bid on any given day.      So,   the language should apply.

Thx,
JMF

Please make lower case the words "contract price" in second sentence of the indented item Contract Price:  Resale of the Contract Quantity in a Back-to-Back Transaction/EPMI Transaction has been effected at the contract price of US Dollars $60.00/MWh. Clint or John -- is it true that sometimes these balance-of-the-month sales may be EPMI Transactions, or will they always be Back-to-Back Transactions with third parties?  If they'll never be EPMI transactions, then we can remove that reference from the red sentence above.  --DP  

This is the confirmation for the fixed price deals, containing the newly revised language.  Please review and let me know when the language has been agreed on to include in the confirmations.

Thanks!

Narsimha -
Can we get together to discuss how best to serve your retail load?     I think this simple process has been complicated by the number of players involved.
We will give you any structure that you need and provide transparency as to how we do what we do.   What more is there?

I have heard that this could start as early as September,  but we are still a bit short on detail.     If we started in September,  I would envision passing local charges, congestion,   etc to EES.    We would schedule your hedges,  your load and cover any remaining balance (or not) with respect to load zone.
We would provide scheduling services,  settlements and   24 hour coverage to handle any  contingencies that might occur.

I look forward to working with you on this issue. 

Give me a call when you get a chance.

Thanks,
JForney

We have not scheduled this load as of yet.   I met with Narasimha yesterday in order to cut through the b.s. and get at least a rudimentary plan in place.
Here it is:
	By 7am - EES submits to us their  load plan / hedges - EES to use their forecast initially.
	We cover open position and submit schedules to Ercot
	We monitor Real Time and handle continigencies
	Wholesale settlement provided,   ancillary service charges , local congestion,  etc is to be passed to EES.

Narasimha will provide the load info and we are projecting a September 1st start  at the latest.    

We are preparing a term sheet today that will reflect the basic requirements above.    We will certainly add more complexity to this deal in the form of fixing exposure to A/S and other charges.   
We are prepared to go forward with this immediately.  

JMF

Are we using this load now?

FYI

I'm not sure what has been communicated regarding the enrollments.  I wanted to ensure everyone was aware of the current status. 

The (5) packaged ice accounts were accepted by TXU and load availability was confirmed.  The 814 enrollment request will be submitted today/tomorrow by CSC.

The (28) target accounts were rejected by Reliant as the rate class is full. There is no load available.

Please advise if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Rebecca

Scott, 
I dont get discounted tickets,  but occasionally someone will offer them for sale on the e-bulletin board.
I'll keep an eye out for you.

JMF
John, Do you have access to discounted tickets to Astro's games?  I am
trying to buy tickets for the games on 9/21 & 9/23

Kim,
Havent talked to you for awhile.    Hope everything is going well.
I do have a question about who will be doing my review.     Also,  dont we still have a rating system?     I would like to see my entire review and have the opportunity to sign off on it.   
Also,  is it possible for me to review my personel file?   Is this within company policy?

Lastly,   can you provide to me a copy of my contract?    Mine is packed in a box somewhere due to the move.

Thank you for your time.

JMF

Perfect.   Thanks.
I can review the folder anytime this week.    

Thanks again
JMF

Hi Stranger...

In answer to your question, Kevin and/or Doug will be doing your review.  When he presents it to you, it will be final barring any changes the two of you may make together or your personal comments.  Once you sign it, it can not be altered.   In answer to the question on your personnel file, you should be able to view it in my presense (hr security policy)  Let me find out how that can be arranged for you.  Nothing should have been added to the file w/o you knowledge eg. counseling forms and such since you would have to sign off on them)  I can request a copy of your most recent employment agreement for you.  We should have it shortly.

There was additional language added to the fixed Price delivery point and that is reflected in the confirmation attached below.

 << File: sample.doc >> 
  Fixed Price deals

We are still waiting on your final okay to start confirming Frontera deals on these formats.  Do you  have any problems with these confirmation formats?

I believe these are the final formats of the three confirmations we will be using for the Frontera deals.  Please review and let me know if these will be okay to send to the counterparty.

We are doing a good job in deal entry accuracy.    I have had few instances where I am asked by Risk Mgmt to troubleshoot problems,  as had been the case the previous months.
GOOD JOB !

Please stay focused on this 

JMF

Lloyd,
Frontera needs a portal so that they may submit outage schedules for their plant.        We, as the QSE,   arent able to submit this, per Protocols.

Thanks,
JMF

Yesterday the Frontera plant was idle due to economics.   We had  submitted a Resource Plan (this indicates to Ercot what we plan to generate) with zero mw's and zero premium  because the unit was offline.   In the Resource Plan,  we can  attach a premium for OOM up or down.   In the plan for yesterday we indicated that our unit was "unavailable and offline".  
   The plant personel are responsible for submitting an outage schedule with Ercot - this cannot be completed by the QSE.

Ercot called yesterday and asked if we could start the unit if they needed us to.   We called Jerry Watson (with Frontera) and he relayed that this was possible.   Ercot immediately OOM'd us up 135 mw's, beginning hour ending 13,  to control congestion.   They later upped this to 185 mw's for the remainder of the day, through 2400.
I called Mark Patterson, who is our Ercot Rep.,  and I explained the situation.   I wished to know how they could OOM us if we were offline.   I also wanted to know how this would settle.

His reply is as follows:

Since we indicated verbally that we could run the plant,  that changed our status from unavailable to available.
Since we had an implied low premium (zero)  on our plant,  we were high in the OOM stack and were called upon.
We would receive only the mcp for our power because we had no premium indicated.  The mcp was low all day ( mid teens)  yesterday.
If we had been OOM'd up and could not recover our startup & gen costs,  we could dispute the bill and provide sufficient documentation to recover, at most, our costs.

We immediately revised our Resource Plan and indicated 185 mw's available  with a $50 premium.    This invoked the Protocol provisions requiring them to pay us the 18 heat rate times gas costs.   
The Protocol section dealing with OOM up payments is found under section 6.8.2.2.   Please review this to understand why this applies.

This was a very educational process.    We think that in revising our Resource Plan "on the fly"  we were able to turn a bad situation into a profitable day for Frontera.

Until further notice, the following policy should be implemented:

If Frontera is offline and Ercot calls to ask about the availability.    Say the unit is NOT available.

If Frontera is scheduled to run, need to input into the Resource Plan the following premiums:

$50 premium for OOM up.
$10 premium for OOM down.

These premiums will be added to the mcp and will be used to determine our place in the merit order.
If we are OOM'd up,   the premium will require that the heat rate formula is invoked.

If we are OOM'd down,  then we should be paid the mcp + premium.

Please call me if you have questions,

J. Forney

There is length for the offpeak scheduled in the North and South.   LET IT RIDE, no adjustment is necessary.

Ercot Asset is long 50 mw from 12-23 in the North.   We will monitor and sell hourly,  as needed.

Thanks,
JMF

I want to go to this!

Victor,
Thanks for calling today.   Obviously this hasnt been the best day in my 8 year career with Enron!
I have attached my resume for your review.    I am interested in talking to you in more detail at your convenience.

Thanks again,
JForney

Jerry,
Please see the attached spreadsheet for tomorrow.
We booked you out on the Enron option for $22.25.    So,  we are selling you next day for $22.25.
Also,  to fill Mirant's call for 12-22 we purchased $23 power from Aquila.    This should get you flat for the day.

We will not run tomorrow,  as of now.    We will reflect this in the Resource Plan and reflect that the unit is unavailable and offline.

 

For all that have missed the floor meeting,   we have been downgraded to "junk" status,  ending our merger plans and crushing our stock price.
A likely scenario would have us declaring bankruptcy within a few days.     Payroll is said to be funded until the end of the month, at least.   
If bankruptcy is filed,  payroll should be covered.
Another very real option is that the trading floor could be parcelled and sold to an outside company.   There are discussion underway that deal with this possibility.

Currently,  we are not trading.    We need to continue to report to work and keep a log of Real Time prices.    Continue to update the Hourly Prices sheet for a record of prices.    We may need these prices as support for liquidated damages.

More counterparties will be defaulting and cutting schedules.     Please make note of such cuts and prepare to bill LD's.   We have prepared a cut log for this purpose.

What up badeer?

It doesnt take you long to respond to a slam.    of course, no details of our discussion were mentioned to badeer - i told bobby that you sounded like you came from a bar the last time i talked to you.    
i am flying out of state for an interview on monday.    i expect to fly again later next week.   
i am still interested in being a part of a leaner trade floor at Enron,  but this proposition is less likely than my leaving.    the creditors and the bankruptcy judge are not that likely to approve good bonuses for performers, in my opinion.      We will be dogged with credit issues and lawsuits for a long time.		
what do you think?

Greetings:

I have attached my resume which details my  experience and capabilities.    If you have further interest in talking with me,  please contact me at 713-853-7160 or 281-419-4388.

havent talked to you for awhile. hope everything is going as well as can be..
i have a biz question:   is the cash balance plan safe?

jmf

george,  here is some info...
John -

Sorry I was on the phone and didn't talk......hope that you are doing OK too!!!  I am hanging in there.....

Here is a q&a regarding the cash balance plan.

Will there be changes to the Cash Balance Plan as a result of the Bankruptcy and are the assets safe from creditors?
No changes have been made to the plan to-date. It is a possibility that the Company may have to reconsider the continuance of future accruals for active employees. If this does occur, accrued benefits will be frozen but interest will continue to be credited. 
The Trust holding the Cash Balance Plan assets is not part of the bankruptcy estate and is not subject to the claims of Enron's creditors. 
There is a lot of q&a's posted on www.enron.com which you may find helpful if I am not available to assist!  Let me know if you need anything else......

Last week was the hardest week that our office has ever experienced.  When I look down the list of people who were laid off I see the names of some very talented people.  Things have unfolded so quickly -- the reality of the situation is settling in for me, and probably many of us, today.  

Again, I wanted to express my thanks and gratitude to everyone on our floor -- both current and former employees.  In the interest of keeping people informed about who is here and who is gone, below is a complete list of layoffs done last week within the west power team.

Allan,
I havent heard anything from Anadarko,  but I am talking to several other players.    There is a possibility that I will be relocating to Tampa Florida or possibly back to Oregon.	Thanks for passing my info along and inquiring as to my situation.      We still need to make time for that beer.   I get out of work very early each day, as our trading opportunities are severely limited.

I would like to pass on a couple of resumes from two of my friends that were released at Enron.      My friend has some solid accounting background and his wife worked in HR as a specialist.    They are a Woodlands couple and would like to avoid that crappy drive to Houston.

I know that Anadarko is probably being swamped with resumes,  but I didnt know if your department had specific needs that may match what Jim has to offer.  This guy is extremely detail oriented and capable.
If you could review and pass these on,  I would really appreciate it:  this is my golfing buddy and he cant play anymore if he isnt working.  Just kidding

Tell me what is happening with you.  ( I still dont miss Koch,  but I miss working 8 - 9 hour days!).  I think that Mike Eiben has been long gone from Enron.   I had been looking for him before the layoffs,  but hadnt been able to find him in the voice directory, etc.

Call or e-mail and I will meet at Buffalo Wild Wings or somewhere else.  We dont have to talk about work.....no,   lets not talk about work!

Thanks,

JMF	

  

I have a 1:10 t time for Windrose on Sat.    I have a 3:1 coupon that will reduce the expense to $51 pp + tax.
Let me know if you can go.

JMF

Rob,
attached are my friend's resumes.     i also added mine for your critique.   Let me know what you think.
I need to talk to you about negotiating a new deal;   unfortunately it looks as if I may be leaving the state,  either to Florida or back to Oregon.

The offers are starting to come in,  but I dont want to leave anything on the table.   Need your advice,  so let's have that beer!

   

Frank,
I spoke with Victoria Bender and Julie Gildea yesterday.   Julie expects to send me some info today.
I will be out of the office after lunch today,  so it would be best if she sends e-mail to my home address,

fourknees@msn.com

My cell phone will also be on,  the number is 713-412-7529.

Thanks,
JMF

Amy,
do you have time to meet with me for 15 minutes?

thanks,

yep

Absolutely......I am in the middle of confirming some details, but should be free in about an hour or so.....

Is this OK?

Yes, but we are consistenly being OOMC'd,  so it's kind of an ongoing question.
Thanks,
JMF

If you are referring to the OOMC for September 14th we are still working
on a number of issues pertaining to that trade day.

Mark,
Thanks for your reply concerning ancillary service procurement.    I was
wondering if Ercot had made a decision on OOM capacity payments.
Our position is that our custmers,  ie.   Teco/Frontera   should recover
at least their O&M expenses for the capacity,  as they are standing by
awaiting instruction.

Has there been any progress in this subject?

JForney

Cant - I have friends coming in from Calgary.       I went to a great course yesterday;   Glenloch Farms is not too far from the Woodlands and was a cool layout.   We will have to go when I get free.

I need some support on this:
For the last two weeks,  Ercot has been giving us OOMC orders.     They have told us to run the plant, without question.     We have asked them whether they mean OOME when we run.    To a man,   the Ercot dispatch guys have said that OOMC means to run, they want the power.     
I have launched three e-mails (requesting clarification)  to Mark Patterson,  starting weeks ago on this issue.    Yesterday,   I caught Mark by phone at 5:30pm.

Mark consulted with his operations group and determined that we had been OOMC'd and we should run,  but they are not going to pay us the hr calc.
They said that OOMC means run and we are supposed to sell this power.     This confusion on our part will prove costly to Frontera as they will be paid the imbalance, instead of the heat rate calc.       We cannot sell in the offpeak hours for greater than $5.      It costs us $26 to generate power.

Mark said " dont worry, at worst case you can file for reimbursement."     Mark also said that we will get paid for the capacity. But what???

It is my opinion that it is no accident that Ercot was vague on this issue.     They want to penalize us if we dont run,  and if we do ,  we will lose money.
We then file to get a break-even rebate.  They are acquiring ancillary reserves for free and not even paying for the energy component.

I realize that these issues will be discussed in the Tuesday meeting and I will provide examples, as requested by Ercot.

I need some support from the protocols and I need some suggestions.   I  do not want to allow these guys to game us anymore.  
We will be more vocal in this meeting.    If no resolution is reached,  I vote for ignoring their OOM instructions.
I need a ruling on whether they can force us to lose money.  

Thanks,

JForney

Thank you Bill!

David,
I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:

Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, starting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.
The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week,  per Mark Patterson.

The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the protocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the spirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.

   
Here is the problem:
the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid.
We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC means run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to run by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc, as we were previously under OOMC orders.

I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding this issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someone else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me "dont worry,  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money."

Here is my view:
OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.
Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  a group supposedly unconcerned with price.
If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OOME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the imbalance.
OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagreement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.
Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in hopes of filing for a "breakeven."   Ridiculous.

I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had "no comment" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has "no comment."
Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive closure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will receive.

I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in response to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  Ercot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their view was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compliance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.
Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME deployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a software issue, not a protocol issue.   
We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be settled.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down the unit.    Ercot said that " it was entirely reasonable that we would  request to be compensated in the form of an OOME."
The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an instruction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instruction on a regular basis?

Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic environment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations personell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for "forcing them to OOME our plant."

Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me,  what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.

This is a start.   I am having our Regulatory guy review our OOMC/OOME situation.

Thanks,

Please check out the following.     The agreement I reached with Ercot/Frontera yesterday is as follows:
When we receive an OOMC,  we will crank up the plant then call Ercot and request an OOME once the plant is online.
If Ercot doesnt give us an OOME,  then we will need to advise them that we will take the plant down.   We dont actually want to do this,  as there are some expensive start charges associated with this.

We will discuss further in the meeting.

Thanks,
JMF
David,
I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:

Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, starting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bids exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.
The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formula is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due out this week,  per Mark Patterson.

The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actual energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the protocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the spirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.

   
Here is the problem:
the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot dispatchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were not generating into the grid.
We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC means run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Ercot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to run by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME calc, as we were previously under OOMC orders.

I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding this issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Ercot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate calc,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we would receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someone else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me "dont worry,  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lost money."

Here is my view:
OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.
Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  a group supposedly unconcerned with price.

They will not run unless we receive an OOME.  Call me if you need to,  but call before 10pm.

AJ,
Thanks for checking in with me.   I had a couple of questions:
Does Anadarko have any power plants or do they trade gas/electricity actively?      I currently do several things:
I am the Manager of the real time Power Trading desk.    I also manage the Ercot Asset book.   I trade around a combined cycle gas plant in south Texas.
I am required to trade gas along with  the power in order to properly hedge the plant.
I would be interested in continuing in this area. 

Thanks for anything you can tell me about working at Anadarko.   I could send my resume,  but if we dont have paralell needs,  then I wont bother.
I have some other things that I am working on.

Thanks again for asking.  This company will be fine,  but I have worked 12-14 hours/day for 8+ years.   When the stock price is $90, I can somewhat justify the hours and lack of life.   However,   although I am sure that Enron will bounce back,  I am no longer willing to sacrifice to make it so.    

I have been consistenly profitable in my time here.   I have never been on a losing team - we have always made major money for the company,  so it is very hard to understand how this whole thing is unwinding.

Anyway,  thanks again and I look forward to hearing from you.

JMF

Thanks

The study guide just test you on the material. Its not really that good. If
you read the text and apply the principals, that's all you'll need. As he
points out, it more about discipline and psychology. Good Luck. Let me know
how you do trading.

Sure,  I am online everyday.
I get in about 6 am, usually putting the numbers on at 6:30.   I start with hr ending 8-22 and change to 9-22 usually when the first interval of he 9 is printed. 
This is at my discretion.   
You may post a limit order (either a bid or offer) that covers mine and transact online.   You wont necessarily be trading with me,  another counterparty can lift your offer or hit your bid.

Let's trade it up!!!

JForney

Are you all still showing numbers for intraday ERCOT swaps?  If so when do
you normally post them.  Thanks.

deal no.  773763 has been changed.
sorry for the confusion.

JMF

John,

Thanks for entering the offpeak deal into enpower.  We just need to adjust the location as Cinergy (Into) as the delivery point.

Just talk to me when you get in tomorrow.

Thanks,

Erik

A lot of shops are interested,  mainly speculators.       I have had at least 7 different counterparties use this.      Utilities or generators have a big interest in hedging their balancing energy exposure,  locking in a fixed return.   How they are exposed to the imbalance price is their business, as I am not encouraging running an imbalance, etc.
No problem with EOL,  as we are trading it up.
You need to add the US PWR Financial Swap to your EOL profile, in my opinion.     You will see Ercot S 8-22  and N 8-22.   You will need to add these and every other hour listed.
Thanks,

Thanks for the info.  Just curious, are there many other shops showing an
interest?  Also, I haven't seen any numbers yet this morning, have you not
shown any or is it a problem with my EOL?  Thanks again.

Frontera was asked to generate 135 mw's for this day.    They were generating but our meter read was showing zero.    Ercot was also showing zero.
Steve Olinde called and Frontera assured us that they were running.     
We will need to file a dispute for approx hours ending 1 - 7?
I am not sure when the meter came back,  but it was ok when I came in this morning.

Thanks,
JMF

Mark Patterson, our Rep,  called today to ask me if everything was resolved=
 to my satisfaction.    I relayed that I did talk to John Adams last night =
and he did agree to give us one hour notice with an OOME instruction.    Th=
is is great,  however,   Mark warned me that we were outside of the tariff =
because Ercot still maintains that OOMC means run.
He relayed that in the event of line meltdown,  etc.  we would be liable.  =
   John Adams also said this last night.   We are officially on notice of p=
otential QSE liability.

In my opinion we need to:
Call Ken Saathoff and see if he can resolve their confusion today, otherwis=
e we need to file whatever is necessary, under the protocols,  to protest t=
his ridiculous interpretation and to protect ourself from this "liability."
Officially request clarification in the protocols on this issue.

Thanks,
JForney

Here are a few additional points: =20

I spoke with Ken Saathoff at ERCOT last week (he is the director of technic=
al operations) and he agreed that an OOMC instruction is essentially a "be =
ready" instruction and an additional OOME or another type of unit specific =
instruction is necessary for the plant to deploy. He is John Adams boss, so=
 there is a disconnect between the two levels.  In addition to Kent, I spok=
e to Mark Walker the senior corporate counsel regarding payment, or lack th=
ereof and he suggested that the only method would be to dispute the settlem=
ent statement and use that process.  Going forward however, that is not an =
effective mechanism due to the delay in payment and the necessity to prove =
your cost structure.

In speaking with Forney a few minutes ago it sounds like he may have convin=
ced John Adams, but I would be happy to call Kent Saathoff if you feel that=
 would help.

Forwarded as discussed.  Doug Gilbert Smith has asked that your group draft=
 a complaint to the PUCT regarding this misinterpretation of the Protocols =
by the ERCOT ISO, which effectively requires a generator called on for the =
OOMC ancillary service to run its plant, and sidesteps the obligation to pa=
y an OOME price component when the plant's output is utilized by ERCOT.  Th=
e OOMC compensation is currently negligible (and recovery of actual costs u=
nder Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.1(6) may take a long time), and the OOME compensa=
tion has various problems as well: (1) the more ERCOT calls on a plant for =
OOME, the the lesser the OOME price paid (Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.2 -- Heat Ra=
te value decreases), and (2) plants directed to provide, say, 135MWs of OOM=
C/OOME, are not allowed to generate above 135 MWs in an interval (thus runn=
ing the plant economically at a lower heat rate) to sell the excess in the =
marketplace. The Frontera plant, a customer of EPMI acting as QSE, is locat=
ed such that ERCOT is and will be consistently telling the plant via its QS=
E to provide OOMC -- to produce energy going north on a line in South Texas=
. Doug says we should advocate to the PUC that plants in such a position sh=
ould be Reliability Must Run ("RMR") and be paid at an adequate premium for=
 their support of the system' reliability.

I noted to you as well that this is likely to be a dispute with ERCOT over =
the interpretation of the Protocols, conducted under Protocols Section 20, =
and we would appreciate any reg. group efforts toward preparation for iinit=
iating such dispute.  Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tom=
orrow even if ERCOT tells us, their QSE that it should be dispatched. Thus =
we are caught in the middle.  The legitimate bases for not complying with a=
n ERCOT dispatch instruction are stated in Protocols Section 5.4.4(2): "thr=
eat to safety, risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment, or otherwise=
 is not in compliance with these Protocols".  Though the Protocols Sections=
 1-22 seem to recognize as to other capacity- oriented ancillary service pr=
oducts that it is 'generating capacity available but not energy delivered t=
o the grid', I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC.  The Operating Gui=
des' definition of OOMC, page 21 seems to recognize this however, and Secti=
on 2B of the ERCOT Market Guide, p. 8 (Feb 22, 2001) recognizes the distinc=
tion between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the positi=
on stated by John Forney below.=20

Sorry for the long e-mail -- I was trying to provide a statting point for y=
our group.

Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me, =
 what is our next step?  I need to move aggressively on this issue.

I kind of lost my temper a bit with Mark.   Probably wont sound good on tap=
e,  but I told him that a monkey-man wouldnt interpret the protocols that w=
ay.
Its the Dynegy thang talking.

JMF

I will put in a call.  Kent is always on the run so it may take awhile to r=
un him down.  I will also do something in writing to get a "record".
TTT

Mark Patterson, our Rep,  called today to ask me if everything was resolved=
 to my satisfaction.    I relayed that I did talk to John Adams last night =
and he did agree to give us one hour notice with an OOME instruction.    Th=
is is great,  however,   Mark warned me that we were outside of the tariff =
because Ercot still maintains that OOMC means run.
He relayed that in the event of line meltdown,  etc.  we would be liable.  =
   John Adams also said this last night.   We are officially on notice of p=
otential QSE liability.

In my opinion we need to:
Call Ken Saathoff and see if he can resolve their confusion today, otherwis=
e we need to file whatever is necessary, under the protocols,  to protest t=
his ridiculous interpretation and to protect ourself from this "liability."
Officially request clarification in the protocols on this issue.

Thanks,
JForney

Here are a few additional points: =20

I spoke with Ken Saathoff at ERCOT last week (he is the director of technic=
al operations) and he agreed that an OOMC instruction is essentially a "be =
ready" instruction and an additional OOME or another type of unit specific =
instruction is necessary for the plant to deploy. He is John Adams boss, so=
 there is a disconnect between the two levels.  In addition to Kent, I spok=
e to Mark Walker the senior corporate counsel regarding payment, or lack th=
ereof and he suggested that the only method would be to dispute the settlem=
ent statement and use that process.  Going forward however, that is not an =
effective mechanism due to the delay in payment and the necessity to prove =
your cost structure.

In speaking with Forney a few minutes ago it sounds like he may have convin=
ced John Adams, but I would be happy to call Kent Saathoff if you feel that=
 would help.

Forwarded as discussed.  Doug Gilbert Smith has asked that your group draft=
 a complaint to the PUCT regarding this misinterpretation of the Protocols =
by the ERCOT ISO, which effectively requires a generator called on for the =
OOMC ancillary service to run its plant, and sidesteps the obligation to pa=
y an OOME price component when the plant's output is utilized by ERCOT.  Th=
e OOMC compensation is currently negligible (and recovery of actual costs u=
nder Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.1(6) may take a long time), and the OOME compensa=
tion has various problems as well: (1) the more ERCOT calls on a plant for =
OOME, the the lesser the OOME price paid (Protocols Sec. 6.8.2.2 -- Heat Ra=
te value decreases), and (2) plants directed to provide, say, 135MWs of OOM=
C/OOME, are not allowed to generate above 135 MWs in an interval (thus runn=
ing the plant economically at a lower heat rate) to sell the excess in the =
marketplace. The Frontera plant, a customer of EPMI acting as QSE, is locat=
ed such that ERCOT is and will be consistently telling the plant via its QS=
E to provide OOMC -- to produce energy going north on a line in South Texas=
. Doug says we should advocate to the PUC that plants in such a position sh=
ould be Reliability Must Run ("RMR") and be paid at an adequate premium for=
 their support of the system' reliability.

I noted to you as well that this is likely to be a dispute with ERCOT over =
the interpretation of the Protocols, conducted under Protocols Section 20, =
and we would appreciate any reg. group efforts toward preparation for iinit=
iating such dispute.  Frontera has indicated they will not provide OOMC tom=
orrow even if ERCOT tells us, their QSE that it should be dispatched. Thus =
we are caught in the middle.  The legitimate bases for not complying with a=
n ERCOT dispatch instruction are stated in Protocols Section 5.4.4(2): "thr=
eat to safety, risk of bodily harm or damage to the equipment, or otherwise=
 is not in compliance with these Protocols".  Though the Protocols Sections=
 1-22 seem to recognize as to other capacity- oriented ancillary service pr=
oducts that it is 'generating capacity available but not energy delivered t=
o the grid', I have not seen this made clear as to OOMC.  The Operating Gui=
des' definition of OOMC, page 21 seems to recognize this however, and Secti=
on 2B of the ERCOT Market Guide, p. 8 (Feb 22, 2001) recognizes the distinc=
tion between capacity and generated energy clearly in support of the positi=
on stated by John Forney below.=20

Sorry for the long e-mail -- I was trying to provide a statting point for y=
our group.
  -----Original Message-----

David,
I need some help with an Ercot protocol interpretation:

Frontera has been issued  OOMC requests by the ISO on numerous occasions, s=
tarting September 14th.    This Out of Merit request is issued if no mkt bi=
ds exist to solve congestion, whether local or zonal.
The OOMC, as I understand it,  reserves capacity for Ercot and the premium =
is predetermined based on a formula mentioned in the protocols.   The formu=
la is based on the replacement reserve clearing price,  which currently is =
zero.   This is because the replacement reserve market is non-existent.  An=
 announcement on how the OOMC capacity payments will be calculated is due o=
ut this week,  per Mark Patterson.

The second component of this option is OOME.    This is a request for actua=
l energy related to the OOMC option.   The strike price is calculated from =
a preset heat rate multiplied by the HSC daily price, as mentioned in the p=
rotocols.  So the OOMC/OOME ws designed to work like the ancillary services=
 with a capacity award and an energy component.  I think that this is the s=
pirit of the OOM's, as mentioned in Section 6 of the Protocols.

  =20
Here is the problem:
the head of Ercot Market Operations,  John Adams,  interprets the protocols=
 to mean that OOMC requries the plant to be generating.     When Ercot disp=
atchers had issued an OOMC,  they quickly followed up to ask us why we were=
 not generating into the grid.
We explained to them, on numerous occasions,  that we dont believe OOMC mea=
ns run.   If they wanted us to run,  then they would need to issue an OOME =
for the actual energy component.    I asked my employees to clarify with Er=
cot whether we were being asked to run,  yes or no.    When instructed to r=
un by Ercot,  we had to assume that we were settled based upon the OOME cal=
c, as we were previously under OOMC orders.

I sent at least three e-mails to my Ercot rep,  Mark Patterson regarding th=
is issue.   I finally caught him by phone and he relayed that he thought Er=
cot's  intrepretation was correct.    For all of the times that we ran,  at=
 their request,  we werent going to be paid based on the OOME heat rate cal=
c,  rather we were going to receive the balancing energy price ( a penalty =
for Resource Imbalance).   For example,  in the early morning hours we woul=
d receive as little as $1 for electricity that cost $27 to generate.   Mark=
 also mentioned that when they said run,  they expected us to sell to someo=
ne else,  or just generate into the imbalance.    Mark told me "dont worry,=
  you can file to receive your generation expenses in the event that you lo=
st money."

Here is my view:
OOMC does not mean run.  It means have the capacity available in the event =
Ercot calls,  much like replacement,  responsive reserve and non-spinning.
Ercot's interpretation is being decided by the Manager of Mkt Operations,  =
a group supposedly unconcerned with price.
If OOMC means to run,  then why would the protocols contemplate, or need OO=
ME?  They would never have to pay OOME if we were already running into the =
imbalance.
OOMC is an option and the exercise is OOME.   This is basically the disagre=
ement.    This could very well be a $500,000 issue for Frontera.
Why would anyone generate for $27 and dump to the imbalance mkt at $5 in ho=
pes of filing for a "breakeven."   Ridiculous.

I spoke with Bill Kettlewell with Customer Relations and he had "no comment=
" on whether OOMC means to generate.  Mark Patterson now also has "no comme=
nt."
Bill and Mark said that we needed to file a dispute in order to receive clo=
sure on the OOM capacity payment.   I suspect that we will follow this same=
 path when we file for OOME reimbursement vs.  the imbalance price we will =
receive.

I had instructed my employeess to refuse to turn on the plant   (in respons=
e to an OOMC) until we receive an OOME instruction.   This has compelled  E=
rcot to deploy an OOME request to us, because they need  to have us online =
to control local congestion.   Would this not be an omission that their vie=
w was incorrect?  Section 5.4.4 says that a QSE may fail to comply with an =
Ercot directive if it causes a safety concern, or ,  Ercot is not in compli=
ance with the Protocols.  The latter is in effect.
Ercot is now telling us that they cannot instruct us, or give us an OOME de=
ployment,  unless we are already runnnig.    I think that this is a softwar=
e issue, not a protocol issue.  =20
We worked out an interim compromise with Ercot until this issue can be sett=
led.  Once we have been OOMC'd,  we will start to gen.   Once we reach full=
 load,  we will request an OOME.   If they dont comply,  we will shut down =
the unit.    Ercot said that " it was entirely reasonable that we would  re=
quest to be compensated in the form of an OOME."
The Ercot dispatchers are complaining that OOME requires them to send an in=
struction every 15 minutes.   Is this why we are not getting the OOME instr=
uction on a regular basis?

Finally,  I stressed to Ercot that I wasnt trying to manipulate prices, via=
 OOME or force Ercot into a corner.    It just is not the right economic en=
vironment to generate for $27 and sell for $5.    Further,  operations pers=
onell at Ercot have frelayed their displeasure with me for "forcing them to=
 OOME our plant."

Can I get an opinion on whether OOMC means to run?   If you agree with me, =

We are long 50 mw's  (ercot asset book) for the 2x16 .   This is scheduled into the North market.

Attached is a list of the Hourly Desk contacts for the Frontera plant.  Please use the main phone number for all Frontera communications.  The voicemail number can be used for non-urgent messages.  In addition, home and cell numbers are provided in case of emergency.  Thanks.

John

 - TPS Hourly Desk Contact List.doc 

We are long 50 mw's for 16 hours Saturday and Sunday.    The length is under the Ercot Asset book and the cost is $15.    I am concerned about Sunday morning,  specifically,  hours ending 7-11.   If you could sell  this for a decent price,  it would be a good thing.  The purchase is an interdesk deal,  so it wont show in Enpower Scheduling.
Also,  for hours ending 15-20 on Sunday we are long an additional 100 mw's at $16.31.   The purchase is under deal #873330 from City of Austin.  The temps are supposed to be warm and it should be muggy on Sunday ahead of the cold front.    This is scheduled to the North Zone under Enpower 873332.  Either leave alone or sell under the Ercot Asset book.

For Monday,  we are long 50 mw's onpeak under another interdesk deal.   The length cannot be seen in Enpower scheduling.      This deal is under Ercot Asset and has been scheduled to load (north) under deal #873255.   Also,  we have another 100 mw's from COA (see Enpower #873330) for he 15-20.     
This is scheduled to north zone under enpower #873332.

Dont forget that the night crew will report to the new building Sunday evening.   The phones are to be inactivated here at 5:30 pm Sunday.

Thanks and lets trade it up!

Madhup,
Any luck on developing this tool?   Also,   tell me the status of the Esca people.   The hourly trading system is not complete and I understand that they are leaving.
No documentation on how to use the system is available,  as far as I can tell.

JMF

We are collecting information to dispute Ercot's OOMC calculation.    OOMC has not had a defined clearing price due to the the non-functioning Replacement reserves mkt.
Ercot has asked us to file a dispute for each time that we were issued an OOMC.   I think that this goes back to Sept 14th.

Also at issue is the payment for the actual power once it is called for.    Ercot claims that OOMC means run, instead of standby.   So,  for the times that we were asked to run,  Ercot will only pay us the balancing energy price, versus the OOME heat rate calculation.

How far can we go back in a dispute?  I thought we were somewhat limited.

JMF

--
[Forney, John M.] 
 
It appears that Ercot is reversing their interpretation.   We still need to dispute/collect for OOMC payments and also file under OOME heat rate provisions for all of the times that we ran when we were under OOMC.
Does this make sense?
 
JMF

FYI

Thane,

There must be some miscommunication.  I just talked with John and he

knows that an OOME instruction is necessary to get energy from OOMC

capacity.  It is not required by the protocols to bid in to balancing

market as is Replacement.  That causes us some operation problems and we

may ask for that requirement to be applied to OOMC as well.

I have a follow up question on our discussion at the TAC meeting last

week.  As we discussed, an OOMC instruction for hours 0-24 at 50MW would

for example require a unit to be prepared to provide the 50MW, but not

to actually provide the energy.  Another unit specific instruction or

OOME would be required for the unit to actually run at 50MW.

As recent as this morning, we were told that ERCOT would provide us an

OOME instruction when they want us to run after an OOMC instruction.

However, they also said that we were operating outside the protocols due

to John Adams' interpretation that when we receive an OOMC for a certain

time period at a certain level we should be generating.

We need immediate clarification on this issue.

Jerry,

Please see the attached:

   

The instantaneous supply in the form of ancillary services was supposed to be provided to us  by COA.   The contract was not specific concerning the intraday gas supply, or how we would schedule intraday power.  
COA wants us to "split the meter" at the plant,  allowing us to schedule our own 100 mw's ( and assume all liability) and also arrange our own gas agreement.
Otherwise,  they dont want to allow us intraday capability.
The agreement doesnt expire until Nov 3, 2003.

Their would be two gas contracts to consider,  I suppose:  Enron needs to contract for their own supply for this plant and also wants to sell to COA directly.

When do you want to talk?

JMF

We need to talk about instantaneous supply and how it is dealt with under your Sand Hills contract. The contract I am working on with Austin really doesn't address this issue and in order for me to include this in the contract we will need to talk. I have a call in also with Lonestar to talk about this as well. I have Janet Wallis helping me address some of these issues. We may want to schedule a meeting to include her also.

Let me know where we stand.

So,  it would appear that we have a good case for recovering some money for OOME?   I am of the opinion that for every time I was ordered to run under the OOMC,  I should be paid the OOME calc.
Is this flawed logic?  What do you think.

We are short 50 mw's for offpeak tomorrow @ $13.    I would not expect to have to fill this,  but if you do,  buy in the South and schedule under Ercot Asset.
We originally purchased this power from El Paso.

Thanks.

John,

Please feel free to make any changes to the priorities below. 
I should have covered most of the big items and even thought up a new enhancement (i.e. - UNDO key), but feel free to add to this list.
I have not sent this to Madup Kumar yet, so just delete this message and forward to him.
I hope this isn't too harsh towards Sasha, but I wanted to get the point across (regarding the PS message at the bottom).
I really hope that they can complete these changes. It would make life much easier.

Joe Capasso

Madup,

In reference to Eterra, I have prioritized some enhancements to the system that will improve its usage and accuracy.  When using Eterra, some tasks are difficult to complete and can result in mismatches in the Ercot Portal.  I will identify some of the difficult tasks and I will make some suggestions on enhancements.  
In addition, I realize that we are working with time constraints and limited personnel.

I will categorize the list based on Priority 1, 2 & 3.

Priority 1 - Very important and needs to be completed immediately
Priority 2 - Important and needs to be completed within the next 30 days
Priority 3 - Moderate importance, easy tasks can be completed at programmers convenience.

Priority 1A:

Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades, such as a simultaneous Buy from Counterparty A in the South Zone and a Sell to Counterparty B in the North Zone.  Currently, this has to be done by entering two trades, a purchase from Counterparty A (South Zone) to the Hourly Ercot Book and a second trade, a sell from the Hourly Ercot Book to Counterparty B.  I realize that we have a problem with the transmission between the North and South Zones and that is what makes this a difficult enhancement.  

Priority1B:

Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation.  The current process is to input a buy from Frontera and a sell to Frontera.  This is not very intuitive and causes some confusion.  Why can't we input a buy from Frontera just as we would with any other trade? It could be as simple as clicking a box to indicate that Frontera (i.e. - EPMI) should be adjusted on the resource side and not EPMI on the obligation side.

Priority1C:

Eterra should not write over any trades that were input manually into the Ercot Portal.
Is there any way that we can make it identify a trade that was input manually into the portal?
When it finds one then it should not overwrite this trade.

Priority2A:

Undo Button - On various occasions, we have sent Bal Day trades to the QSE MOS/Ercot Portal and 
it was not the result that we had expected.  Therefore, the trader has to manually change each of the trades. This can be a very time consuming process.
Is there a way to have an UNDO button (similar to the Excel UNDO key) to retract the trade information from the QSE MOS or Portal?

Priority2B:

Change the short name in <internal counterparty> & <external counterparty> to the actual long name, (i.e. - elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy)
Reason: It is just difficult to read. I brought this up with Sasha and he said it would be a quick fix, but it is still not done.

Proirity3A:

Please give us a list of the Counterparties and their appropriate QSE names, (i.e. - El Paso Merchant is actually APX)
This helps us identify what it will effect in the QSE MOS and Portal (for example, elpasomeren is converted into APX).  
But does ELP or ELPASELECOM convert to APX also?

Priority3B:

Match Flow Period to automatically update the Contract Date.  This is one less step that we need to worry about.

The above mentioned enhancements will allow us to quickly and accurately update the QSE MOS & Ercot Portal. 
In addition, it will allow us to quickly correct the portal if a mistake occurs.

If you need additional clarification on any of these topics, I would be happy to meet with you to discuss this further.
I will be working days on Monday, Nov. 26th - Thursday, Nov 29th.

Thanks,
Joe Capasso

  
PS - Below is an email that outlines my conversation with Sasha on November 3rd.  Unfortunately, none of the "quick fixes" have been completed yet.

John,

I met with Sasha today for approx. 3 hours.
We reviewed the exact process for inputting data into Eterra and verifying the trades prior to being sent to the QSE MOS.

Here are some suggestions that I made to Sasha for improving Eterra (the top of the list is the highest priority):

 - Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades, such as a simultaneous Buy from Calpine (South Zone) and a Sell to FPL (North Zone).
   Currently, this has to be done by entering two trades, a purchase from Calpine (South Zone) to the Hourly Ercot book and a second entry of Hourly Ercot book 
   to FPL (North Zone).  Sasha said he is working on this, but problems are occurring due to the transmission between South and North.

 - Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation.  The current process is to input a buy from Frontera into the Frontera book.
   This is not very intuitive and we are still trying to work out an easier process.  (Possibly even having a button that we can click to indicate that
   it is a purchase from Frontera.  Essentially, this would increase the EPMI mw's in the Ercot Portal.)

 - Change the short name in <internal counterpary> & <external counterparty> to the actual long name, (i.e. - elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy)

 - Give us a list of Counterparties and the appropriate QSE, (i.e. - El Paso Merchant is actually APX)
    So that we know what it will affect in the Ercot Portal.

 - Match flow date to automatically update the Contract date.  One less step that we need to worry about.

I tried to impress upon Sasha that in trading "time is of the essence" and that we don't have much time to input data.
Therefore, we need to streamline the deal entry process and to make it more user friendly.
I realize that the first two items will take some time, but the last 3 items should be quick fixes.

I hope this helps.

Joe Capasso

Kim,
Has the Savings plan website changed?   I admit seeing a e-mail about the change of administrators,  but I didnt realize the website would be incapacitated.
What's up?
JMF

We are short on the offpeak for the three days including saturday,  sunday,  and monday.     We are floating 55 mw's   in the South zone.
If you replace this power,  please remove the appropriate counterparty in the portal and replace with new counterparty.

Also:

The Frontera plant is currently NOT scheduled to run this weekend or Monday.    We are currently,  as of Friday,  experiencing problems with units #2 & #3.  These tripped offline when a breaker problem on CPL's side occurred.
We have been asked by Ercot to reflect in the Resource Plan that unit #1 is available but offline.   We have done so.  When the other units become available,   please update them as available in the Resource Plan for the remaining hours of Saturday.    We should make sure that we have OOM premiums (up and down) and zero mw's scheduled.

If you have questions,   give me a call.    

JMF

Madhup,
We still need to provide detail on when errors/ problems actually occur.
I will work to get this to you by tomorrow.
Thanks,
JMF
Looks ok overall but here are a couple of suggestions:

Make price/mgw  an optional field in the deal entry section of eterra.  
2B should be a higher priority. Also, an alternative to 2B is to have a drop-down box within eTerra to display the corresponding name of the counterparty.

Undo Button - On various occasions, we have sent Bal Day trades to the QSE MOS/Ercot Portal and 
it was not the result that we had expected.  Therefore, the trader has to manually change each of the trades. This can be a very time consuming process.
Is there a way to have an UNDO button (similar to the Excel UNDO key) to retract the trade information from the QSE MOS or Portal?

Priority2B:

Change the short name in <internal counterparty> & <external counterparty> to the actual long name, (i.e. - elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy)
Reason: It is just difficult to read. I brought this up with Sasha and he said it would be a quick fix, but it is still not done.

Proirity3A:

Please give us a list of the Counterparties and their appropriate QSE names, (i.e. - El Paso Merchant is actually APX)
This helps us identify what it will effect in the QSE MOS and Portal (for example, elpasomeren is converted into APX).  
But does ELP or ELPASELECOM convert to APX also?

Priority3B:

Match Flow Period to automatically update the Contract Date.  This is one less step that we need to worry about.

The above mentioned enhancements will allow us to quickly and accurately update the QSE MOS & Ercot Portal. 
In addition, it will allow us to quickly correct the portal if a mistake occurs.

If you need additional clarification on any of these topics, I would be happy to meet with you to discuss this further.
I will be working days on Monday, Nov. 26th - Thursday, Nov 29th.

Thanks,
Joe Capasso

  
PS - Below is an email that outlines my conversation with Sasha on November 3rd.  Unfortunately, none of the "quick fixes" have been completed yet.

John,

I met with Sasha today for approx. 3 hours.
We reviewed the exact process for inputting data into Eterra and verifying the trades prior to being sent to the QSE MOS.

Here are some suggestions that I made to Sasha for improving Eterra (the top of the list is the highest priority):

 - Allow the Deal Entry screen to accept single entry trades, such as a simultaneous Buy from Calpine (South Zone) and a Sell to FPL (North Zone).
   Currently, this has to be done by entering two trades, a purchase from Calpine (South Zone) to the Hourly Ercot book and a second entry of Hourly Ercot book 
   to FPL (North Zone).  Sasha said he is working on this, but problems are occurring due to the transmission between South and North.

 - Change the process of increasing the Frontera generation.  The current process is to input a buy from Frontera into the Frontera book.
   This is not very intuitive and we are still trying to work out an easier process.  (Possibly even having a button that we can click to indicate that
   it is a purchase from Frontera.  Essentially, this would increase the EPMI mw's in the Ercot Portal.)

 - Change the short name in <internal counterpary> & <external counterparty> to the actual long name, (i.e. - elpasomeren to El Paso Merchant Energy)

 - Give us a list of Counterparties and the appropriate QSE, (i.e. - El Paso Merchant is actually APX)
    So that we know what it will affect in the Ercot Portal.

 - Match flow date to automatically update the Contract date.  One less step that we need to worry about.

I tried to impress upon Sasha that in trading "time is of the essence" and that we don't have much time to input data.
Therefore, we need to streamline the deal entry process and to make it more user friendly.
I realize that the first two items will take some time, but the last 3 items should be quick fixes.

I hope this helps.

Joe Capasso

thank you,
you are one of my favorite hr reps

Here was the communication that went out most recently.  Hope that helps.

The Savings Plan Transition Period Ends Early!

We have been working closely with Hewitt Associates to get you access to your Savings Plan account before November 20 and are pleased to announce that the internet site went live as of 8:00 AM yesterday morning, November 13. 

Log on to benefits.enron.com and check out the new website - you will enjoy the new features.

Once again, we have appreciated your patience during the transition period.  

EnronBenefits . . . keeping pace with your lifestyle.

Madhup,
here is some more specific detail, as promised.

Thanks,
JMF
Ettera issues:

1.  When hourly is asked to manage a day ahead position we cannot adjust the position in ettera and makes it a worthless tool, the position cannot be found.  We have to adjust the day ahead position in the portal directly.

2.  If we have a day ahead position and adjust it hourly it will change back to the original schedule when we submit another schedule.

3.  Frontera is too time consuming and confusing when we have to show a buy from frontera and a sell to frontera when we buy from them.

4.  The whole process takes to long, on average it usually takes 5 minutes to put an hourly schedule in when it only takes a minute when done directly in the portal.

Thats all I got, I hope it helps.

Alex

more detail
jmf

John,

I wanted to clarify my e-mail I sent from work I don't think I was specific
enough.

1.  On the day ahead position that hourly would manage, lets say it is in
the short term ercot book.  In ettera if you go to that book you will not
find that trade.  So the only way to adjust it is to go and do it in the
portal.

2.  Also if you have a day ahead position and we manage it hourly,if we were
to adjust it for balday, for instance if we were long 50mw in the pool and
we sold 25mw balday it would reflect the change.  But if we came back and
did another trade and submitted to xml it would change back to 50mw.

3.  We need to change how we show a buy from frontera.  We now have to buy
from frontera and then sale back to them.  This was a way to fix the problem
short term but it should not be a long term solution.

4.  And ettera is still very time consuming.  It takes anywhere from 5-8
min. to enter a trade for just one hour.

I hope this is more specific.

Mr Taylor,
I have attached my resume, that explains what the heck I have been doing.   Let me know if anyone has interest in a profitable Woodlands boy.

Thanks!

 

Anadarko does not currently operate any power plants.  Primarily E&P and
related marketing functions (trade gas/crude/ngl's).  I have heard of a
project that is beginning that is looking into the prospects of trading
electricity.  How soon that may occur is simply a guess.  Obviously
there is a substantial amount of hedging activity related to the
gas/crud/ngl's.  You can always check the web site to see if there are
other areas you may be interested in.  Hope all works out well.  Send me
you resume if you wish.  Give me a call after Thanksgiving and we can
try to meet at Mollys/Papas one afternoon.  Phone numbers:
832-636-7045 (w)
281-298-7860 (h)
Keep in touch, ajt.

Frank.  
The ancillary services market for non-spinning has been horrible.   Non- spinnning for today is,  at most,   90 cents/mw for hours 14-18.  The remaining hours are worth zero.
The down regulation and up regulation markets are lucrative  at as much as $11.99/mw ,  but we are not certified for this service.     As I understand it,  there is some work necessary on the plant to allow us to sell up/down regulation and replacement.  GE personel were to travel to the plant and do some work,  but in light of world events,  I do not know if they have arrived.
Once the upgrades are complete,   we need to restart the certification process with Ercot.

If we sell non-spin for .90,  we would need to withhold this power from the market.   We have been selling,  on a Real Time basis,   as much power as we can get out the door.   We have not been selling offpeak and we are starting schedules,  typically at hour 10 through 22 for a sales price of $24.

That is the latest.   We are currently looking at making sales in October.  The heat rate is around 10.7

Thanks,

JForney

 

Jerry / John,

Are there any opportunities for our units in the non-spinning (day-ahead) reserves market?

Looks like the only awards / deployments thus far have been in the intra-day down-balancing market...

Please see the attached.    Remember that we are planning on buying hour ending 7 (50 mw's).    So,   we wont actually generate 250's as the schedule indicates.
Alex will take care of this tonight.

Prices for the weekend look like:
onpeak $20.75
offpeak $ 12.25
gas  $2.06
This doesnt look too good for the weekend run.    Let me know what you need to do.

Thanks,

JMF

 

For tomorrow, see the attached schedule.     This is what is communicated to Frontera.     The mw value at the top of the page indicates what their total generation should be by hour.   The Resource Plan shuold be identical to this row.       Row 5 mirrors the purchase from Frontera in Enpower.     The Mirant call and Enron's call (Ercot Asset Book - 100 mw's) are listed as well as any daily trades executed on behalf of Frontera.    Please familiarize yourself with this report    

The top line will indicate how much power is available for bal-day sales,  etc.    Additionally,   the Resource Plan needs to accurately reflect to Ercot what the plant is capable of.  For example,   if we are generating at the maximum of 450 mw's,  we need to reflect that the combined maximums on units 1-3   do not exceed this amount.

Otherwise,  Ercot thinks they can OOM you up.

Specifically for tomorrow,   please note that we are going from 135 mw hour ending 6 to 250 mw's hour ending 7.     The plant doesnt like to do this.  A 200 mw schedule would be much more preferrable for this ramp.
So either :
1.  purchase 50 mw's from RT market for he 7.    Change Resource Plan to 200 mw's for hour ending 7 only.  Put purchase from  in  Teco Services book.
Make another corresponding sale to Frontera counterparty in the Teco Services book.   If you dont make the second entry in Enpower the Teco Services book will be long for hour ending 7.
2. have plant drag  and buy imbalance - they will call to make this decision.  No entries will be needed.

Call if you have questions.

<< A few etiquette guidelines for men:

Any Man who brings a camera to a stag night may be legally killed or beaten
by his fellow partygoers.

Under no circumstances may two men share an umbrella.

It is OK for a man to cry under the following circumstances:
a. When a heroic dog dies to save his master
b. The moment Angelina Jolie starts unbuttoning her blouse
c. After wrecking your boss' car
d. One hour, 12 minutes, 37 seconds into "The Crying Game"

Unless he murdered someone in your family, you must bail a friend out of
jail within 12 hours.

If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off limits
forever, unless you actually marry her.

The minimum amount of time you have to wait for a guy who's running late is
5 minutes. Maximum waiting time is 6 minutes. For a girl, you have to wait
10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10
scale.

Bitching about the brand of free beer in a friend's fridge is forbidden.

However, feel free to gripe if the temperature is unsuitable.

No man shall ever be required to buy a birthday present for another man.

In fact, even remembering your buddies birthday is optional.

When stumbling upon other guys watching a sporting event, you may always ask
the score of the game in progress, but you may never ask who's playing.

It is permissible to quaff a fruity chick drink only when you're sunning on
a tropical beach... and it's delivered by a beautiful supermodel... and it's
free.

Friends don't let friends wear Speedos. Ever. Issue closed.

If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem. You didn't see nothin'.

Women who claim they "love to watch sports" must be treated as spies until
they demonstrate knowledge of the game and the ability to drink as much beer
as the other sports watchers.

Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza, but
not both. That's just plain mean.

Never talk to a man in a bathroom unless you are on equal footing: both
urinating, both waiting in line, etc. For all other situations, an almost
imperceptible nod is all the conversation you need.

For Monday,   it is necessary that we sell the following for Frontera:

he 4 -30mw's
he 5 - 30 mw's
he 7 - 30 mw's
he 23 - 85 mw's 
he 24 - 85 mw's

Also,   we need  to buy 15 mw's for hour ending 7 to assist with Frontera's ramp.

We are not running the plant this weekend.    The Resource Plan should reflect that we are available but offline.
We need to ensure that the minimums and maximums accurately reflect what the plant is capable of.
Also,  please make sure that the OOM premiums (up & down) are input as $50 and $40 respectively.

FYI - for OOM up,  we receive a 14.1 heat rate multiplied by the Houston Ship Channel price.   For this weekend assume $2.05.   IF you can make hourly,  bal-day sales in excess of this,  check with Jerry or Ken at Frontera.

Steve Olinde is notifying Ercot that we are coming down this weekend  for economics.   We have given them this notice so that they can effectively manage their system.

I will be out of town this weekend.   I can be reached by my cell if you have an important issue.

Thanks,
JMF

We are long 100 mw's for hour ending 16-19 on Monday.   This is currently scheduled to load.
If prices are poor,   we need to sell this energy early Monday morning for >   $22 if possible.

The sale goes into the Ercot Asset book.

Thanks,
JMF

The position for Monday is currently scheduled into imbalance in both the QSE MOS and Enpower.
Make sure that both are modified when you make sales/purchases.

Attached are the spreadsheets that reflect what Frontera is doing for the next three days.   Again,  look to the top line to know what generation output should be.  

Know it,  learn it,   live it.

Thanks,

JMF

We were down balanced in excess of what we were willing to pay,  as indicated by our bidding structure.   It seems that their software is not recognizing our bids.
Our Ercot Rep, Mark Patterson is looking into this.   
We will dispute down balancing bills for the labor day weekend,  as this problem persisted every day.

Thanks,
JMF

Mark/ Pat,

Please see the attached file.

It includes a screen print of the xml price curve and the deployment message.

In my conversation with Pat Moast this weekend, I am concerned that we are getting deployed when we should not be.
Today, (i.e. - 9/1/ 2001) the market clearing prices have been approximately $14 (1300HE) to $24 (1200HE) and we have been 
getting deployed.  According to Allgowed at the Real-Time Desk at Ercot, we are getting the MCP when we are deployed.
This brings up two questions.

First, should we be getting deployed based on our Price Curve (see attachment for an example)?

Secondly, are we getting the MCP or the Bid price within the Price Curve?

Please contact us asap to rectify the problem.

Sincerely,
Joe Capassso
Enron Power Marketing Inc.

 

Mark,
Hope all is well in Taylor.    I have a couple of questions about OOMC capacity payments.    As discussed in our meeting,  I received a manual OOMC on Thursday 9/13 (10:30 pm)  from Terry at the ISO.
He reserved 220 mw of capacity from the Frontera unti for hours ending 9-2400 for Friday,  Sept 14th.

We were,  indeed,   exercised on Friday.    I think that we understand the payment for the energy portion of the exercise.

However,  we are not certain what we will be paid for the capacity portion,  as the formula for OOMC payment is based upon the Replacement reserve market.
The replacement reserve prices have been zero.

Could you provide some help on this?

Thanks,

J Forney

 

Andrea,
apparently an imbalance deal was entered under Teco services and the mark to market flag was not removed.    I show negative new deal value for Teco Services,  when I sold above the curve on their behalf.
I assume this is the reason for the negative new deal value.

The deal has been revised,  as it was to be a temporary placeholder anyway.   This imbal. sale deal will be taken to zero and resold to another counterparty tonight.

Will I ever get a true up for the negative new deal value?

JMF

fyi

jmf
John, A resolution to this issue has not been made.  Obviously we will need to have a resolution prior to final settlement.

Ken,
Laurel will be sending the spreadsheet from now on.   I asked her yesterday to include you on the distribution. 
I will be out of the office next week.   Clint Dean will step in for me.

Thanks,

John - Don't forget to add me to your spreadsheet distribution.

I used to carpool with a guy and his wife from Liberty.   He asked me one day:  " what if someone called you and told you that you just won a new Towncar - all you had to pay was the $700 in  taxes?"    I told both of them (laughing)  that it was a scam and someone would have to be an idiot to fall for that,  since they didnt enter any contest.
They both looked down at their feet and said that they sent a check to this outfit.    I called them dumbasses again and they called their bank to cancel the check.

The jackass scam artist called them back,  bitching that they had cancelled their check.    My dumbass friend was talked into this transaction AGAIN.
He tried to reinstate the check ,  but the bank's policy prevented him from reactivating this payment.    He was going to do this again,  but I told his in-laws,  friends and everyone else I could to talk to him.   He finally saw the light.   Just doing my job.

Anyway,  this guy is a super nice (but dumbass) guy.    He works at the Harris county courthouse.    His wife ran off with a crack head,  left him with the kids,    didnt come homefor several weeks and then wanted a divorce.    The divorce was in Liberty where this woman,  also a dumbass friend from wayback,   had worked for the Judge presiding over her case.     
She got the kids and he pays $2500/month.

Life is less fair to dumbasses

Not sure if you knew of this or not...

DON'T EVER DIAL AREA CODE 809

This one is being distributed all over the U.S.  This
is pretty scary - especially given the way they try to
get you to call.  Be sure you read this and pass it on
to all your friends, family and business associates so
they don't get scammed!!  THIS IS A MAJOR SCAM.

Don't respond to E-Mails, phone calls or web pages
which tell you to call an "809" phone number.  This is
a very important issue of Scam Busters because it
alerts you to a scam that is spreading "extremely"
quickly.  This can easily cost you $24,100.00 or more
and is difficult to avoid unless you are aware of it.
We'd like to thank Verizon for bringing this scam to
our attention.  This scam has also been identified by
the National Fraud Information Center and is costing
victims a lot of money.

There are lots of different permutations of this scam,
but HERE'S HOW IT WORKS. You will receive a message on
your answering machine, voice mail, etc, asking you to
call a number beginning with the area code 809.  The
reasons you are asked to call varies.  It can be to
receive information about a family member who has been
ill, to tell you someone you know has been arrested,
died, to let you know you have won a wonderful prize,
etc.  In each case, you are told to call the 809
number right away.  Since there are so many new area
codes these days, people unknowingly return these
calls.  If you call from the U.S., you will apparently
be charged $2,425.00 per minute.  Or. you will get a
long recorded message.  The point is, they will try to
keep you on the phone as long as possible to increase
the charges.  Unfortunately, when you get your phone
bill, you'll often be charged more than $24,100.00.

WHY IT WORKS:  The 809 area code number is located in
the British Virgin Islands (The Bahamas).  The 809
area code can be used as a "pay-per-call" number,
similar to 900 numbers in the U.S.  Since 809 is not
in the U.S., it is not covered by U.S. regulations of
900 numbers, which require that you be notified and
warned of charges and rates involved when you call a
"pay-per-call" number.  There is also no requirement
that the company provide a time period during which
you may terminate the call without being charged.
Furthermore, whereas many U.S. phones have 900 number
blocking to avoid these kinds of charges.  900 number
blocking will not prevent calls to the 809 area code.
We recommend that no matter how you get the message,
if you are asked to call a number with an 809 area
code that you don't recognize and/orinvestigate
further and just disregard the message.  Be wary of
E-Mail or calls asking you to call an 809 area code
num! ber.  It's important to prevent becoming a victim
of this scam since trying to fight the charges
afterwards can become a real nightmare.

That's because you did actually make the call.  If you
complain, both your local phone company and your long
distance carrier will not want to get involved.  They
will most likely tell you that they are simply
providing the billing for the foreign company.  You'll
end up dealing with a foreign company that argues they
have done nothing wrong.  Please forward this entire

joan,
good to hear from you - everything is still pretty wild up here, but it is going very well.    Sorry to hear about the neighbors,  but i think that you will enjoy living downtown.
there is so much to do here now.  
how are your hours now?  im sure that they are pretty scary.

seen any good bands lately?

JMF

are you still around?  what's going on? 

we are so busy, it is amazing.  we will probably be closing 4 vpp's in the next 1.5 months...for a total of , well, with the curve as is, over $350 MM. 

i am moving...downtown to a hi rise.  my new neighbors moved in in july, with 4 yappy dogs.  they are right outside my bedroom.  so, i have not had a quiet nite sleep, or morning, or even afternoon since they've been here.  long story, but have decided to move out, then will put my house on the market.  hopefully, the housing and financial markets will stay up until i sell.  if not, then i will have to rent it out.

still not dating anyone, so if you know of someone.....

joan 

actually, my hours are very good.  can't remember if i told you, i ended up hiring diane cook to join us.  so, she can take things and run with it, and so can tricia.  so, i have been getting in late, normally i take a lunch, and am out of here by 6 or 6:30.  this am I met a foundation guy  - ouch....$4100.  I will be meeting with 2 more.  hopefully he's the highest.

last week I saw a guy I have been listening to for about 3 or 4 yrs, but have never seen - Chris knight.  we was very good.  he is Steve earle-ish.  he's a guy's guy.  redneck.  you can always borrow a cd if you'd like.  oh, wait, i never get the cd's back.  hee-hee.
[Forney, John M.]  OWW  -  that hurts.   who do i have?  you prob dont even remember now 
i am seeing a band at the satellite this friday - jupiter coyote.  i was wanting to buy some ski boots last yr [never did cuz i couldn't find any store that sold those sock warmers/liners], but there was this big, long haired, hippy kinda guy helping me, and he had on a "son volt" pin/button, so we started talking, and he turned me on to jupiter coyote.  so, have their cd, and am going to see them.

tell debbie i said hi.

Hello,
I am using MSN dial up through the Enron program.  I understood it to be a $5 co-pay.    MSN customer service has said that they are billing me $25/month for this service and they dont know anything about an Enron special program.
Who can I contact to resolve this issue?

John Forney
Director,
Ercot Power Trading

I notified Coleen at the ISO that Frontera will be off line starting at 2300 hours tonight for economic reasons.  I also told Coleen the plant will be available if needed.

The ISO sent OOMC of 164 mws for 2400 9-25-01 through 2400 9-26-01.  I called the ISO and spoke with Jay about the OOMC.  Jay told me that he will probably hold the plant at minimum load tonight.  He wasn't sure what loading the plant would be at during the day.

I notified GENCO ( John Pappa ) of the OOMC and told him that I will advise him of the output level once the ISO lets me know.

I called ( Ken ) and told him about the OOMC.  I told Ken the plant will have to run all day tommorrow.

At 1945, the ISO revised the OOMC for the 26th.  The new OOMC is 184 mws/24hr.

 

Mark/ Pat,

Please see the attached file.

It includes a screen print of the xml price curve and the deployment message.

In my conversation with Pat Moast this weekend, I am concerned that we are getting deployed when we should not be.
Today, (i.e. - 9/1/ 2001) the market clearing prices have been approximately $14 (1300HE) to $24 (1200HE) and we have been 
getting deployed.  According to Allgowed at the Real-Time Desk at Ercot, we are getting the MCP when we are deployed.
This brings up two questions.

First, should we be getting deployed based on our Price Curve (see attachment for an example)?

Secondly, are we getting the MCP or the Bid price within the Price Curve?

Please contact us asap to rectify the problem.

Sincerely,
Joe Capassso

We are short 100 mw's in the Ercot Asset book for hours ending 7-22.    We want to remain that way,  unless the balancing energy market goes haywire.
We would need to delete our SC counterparty EL Paso and input a replacement QSE in the portal if this is filled.
Enpower shows 100 mw's coming from Ercot imbalance.

This deal would need to be cut and replaced with the power that was purchased for bal-day,  etc.

Thanks,
JMF

FYI,
This morning Ercot asked us to run all three units for a manual OOM.    Our Resource plan indicated that our total minimum was 220.    I believe that we had a discussion with Ercot indicating that our minimum on a 2 on 1 config was 280.    We ran at 280,  but our resource plan was not updated.     Ercot called mid-morning to say that they only wanted 220.   It is possible that we will be punished financially (receive the balancing energy price) for the 60 mw's over their request.

The point is,   the Resource Plan is the only thing binding.    We must reflect our true minimums at all times.    If the situation changes intraday,  we need to make changes in the resource plan to reflect what we can actually do.

Please see the e-mail below from Alan.

JMF
All,

ERCOT is questioning us the resource plan we put in the MOS, especially the Min/Max MWs for STG001. If we only have one CT running, then the Min/Max for ST would be 58/80 MWs instead of 130/184 MWs. Here is a list of points I got from Frontera for your reference:

1. One CT running:
	CTG101		STG001
MW	80		58
MW	100		64
MW	110		66
MW	120		68
MW	130		70
MW	140		74
MW	150		80

2. Both CT's running:
	CTG101		CTG201		STG001
MW	80		80		130
MW	100		100		140
MW	110		110		148
MW	120		120		151
MW	130		130		154
MW	140		140		158
MW	150		150		165

If you have questions, please let me know. Thanks.

Until further,  it is best to avoid long positions in the morning hours that are to liquidate against the balancing market.    The downside is $1000 and the upside maybe $10.

Thanks,

Ken,
As discussed earlier,  I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow.       If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule,  I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale.

I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from Enron for the short generation.    Basically,  you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20.     

The benefit in this swap would be:
hedge against floating price
lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues
avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule -  $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point,  however,  I used this in the analysis.

Please let me know what you think.      Enron will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers.   
I  think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run.

Additionally,   I think that there may be a good down balancing or OOM down  opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule.

Let me know what you think,

Rebecca,
For September 28th,  we have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours ending 7- 11.   We bill them $20,  Enpower #794481,  for various hours.
I will take the floating imbalance price for the following megawatt totals :

he7 - 310 mw's
he8 - 310 
he 9- 240
he10 - 140
he 11 - 60

Frontera will be running a resource imbalance for these hours.  (see imbal.  # 794516).       I should be allocated the imbalance charges as listed above and Frontera is responsible for any remaining imbalance for this day..
This is a financial swap that we will be offering our customers and I need your feedback on any requirements that you have in settling this product.

Thanks,
JMF

John,

Here's the response from MSN.

	"We have changed his account to the $5/month plan and credited his account
for previous "overbillings".  For some reason, the account was created
as a "Standard" $21.95/month account.

He should see a $5 charge on his statement going forward. His next
billing date is October 11, 2001."

Is this okay with you?

Please let me know if this does not happen.

We have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours 7-11 for $20.   They sold a 340 mw schedule for the onpeak tomorrow.
They will be ramping up starting hour ending 7 for the following:

He7,8  - 30mw's
He 9  - 100
HE 10 - 200
HE 11 -280

So,  basically,  they will be dragging significantly for these hours.    We sold this imbalance to them for $20 and we will take the floating price.
The Resource Plan will only show 340 mw's onpeak.     

Ercot will call and ask about our ACE issue.    Just say that our unit is just now coming up and we are on the normal ascension ramp mentioned above.

Thanks,

JMF

we put it on for tomorrow.   i am short the pool at $20.
i gave them an agressive bid and i think that we will both win.

Talk to you later,

Tom,
Frontera did agree to do the financial swap for tomorrow.   I am really excited about getting this product off.    I guess we need to follow up with the swap papers now.

Here are some things that we proposed to Frontera:

September 20th - I suggested selling October at $24.75.   This was a 10.72 heat rate.       I had to take off for an Austin trip and Clint took over for me in trying to get them to transact.
Power moved down,  but so did gas,   The heat rate was the same,  but they still didnt want to transact as power moved down to $24.75.    Power reached low of 10 heat rate for October recently - it is currently 10.2.

I suggested early this week in selling balance of the week at a 10.5  heat rate.   The dailies have been now liquidating as low as 8.9 hr.

August (late) - Clint proposed selling 12.7  heat rate in September .   They didnt want to because they wanted to liquidate in the daily market.  This didnt work out.

On a daily basis,  Frontera has a problem making timely decisions.   For example,   I give them gas prices and daily prices.   They say that they would like to stay offline for the next day.   I tell them that I will bookout my option.   
They call back later and say that they would like to run.     Bids are now $2 less for my option and the prices they receive for their ramp up and onpeak schedule are horrible.

On Tuesday,   I suggested selling a $24 call option for October for  a $1.25 premium.    This would have at least brought in $23,000.   They werent interested in this idea.

I communicate my feelings on the market very early.   If they could react quicker,   I would smack the first bids that showed their faces,  including EOL.
I could have taken out 200mw's in a simultaneous trades several times over the last two weeks.

Clint has some other instances that he would like to relay.   He will be sending another e-mail.

This relationship,  although not initially profitable,  has allowed us to develop other relationships that would not have otherwise been possible.   I dont really want to lose the job.   We are providing some outstanding support, in my opinion.

The thing that weakens our case is that Ercot is not providing the appropriate settlement details that would help illustrate our case on the OOM payments.
The settlements extract,  as I learned on my trip,  is key to explainnig this value.     The OOM value itself is well over $200k.

Good luck!

JMF

In this case,    Ercot Asset gets allocated the expense of the imbalance.   The enpower deals listed below are under this desk.
The financial swap info is going out,  Frontera being the most logical first customer.

Is there anything else from us that you would want?   Im thinking in terms special entries that would notify your group to withold balancing expense from Frontera,  etc.

Let me know what you think.

JMF

There are two considerations that I can think of.

1)	We need the market clearing prices in Enpower pub code table to accurately book and settle these financial deals.  I have already informed IT of this issue.
2)	If we trade "financial swaps" with customers they MUST have a financial contract with ENA.  This is not necessarily a requirement for Frontera because you can effectuate the trade through ERCOT by buying and selling the physical mw involved.

Question:  When you say you should be allocated the imbalance for HE7-11 as outlined below, do you mean Hourly ERCOT?

 << File: fronteracalc.xls >> 

Mark,
We have a question related to the acquisition of ancillary services;       Ercot publishes their various A/S requirements on a daily basis.
We have noticed that you dont procure up to the amount that you say that you require.

For example,  on 9/27,   Ercot published that the System Requirements are 1,800 mw for Regup.      Ercot procured only approx. 117 mw's each hour.
The same thing occurs for REGDN and Responsive.

Is Ercot satisfying their reserve requirement needs with OOM and Upbalancing,  etc.?

I will be out of the office next week,   so can you reply to Doug Gilbert-Smith?   His e-mail is doug.gilbert-smith@enron.com.
Otherwise,  he can be reached at 713-853-9310.

I saw the memo.   It is true about the startup charges.   It is listed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
Is there more that we need to discuss on this deal?

Thanks,
JMF

ERCOT-ASSET

Does it need to go in the ERCOT ASSET Book, TECO SVC Book, or Hourly ERCOT book?

Kayla

I spoke with Clint--he's familiar with this situation.  Basically, if we don't call on the option for a certain amount of time, we are responsible for start-up charges when we do call it.  It should be a charge to John's Book.

John--see Clint & myself on this.

Jeff

On 9/17 there is a start charge for 1376.90.  I spoke with Lisa and she said we incur these charges when we do not call on an option, or when we miss calling on an option for 12 consecutive hours.  In this particular case, she said we incurred the charge because we called again on it.  Do you know where in the contract that it talks about this?

Thanks, 
Kayla

TJ,

Mark,
Thanks for your reply concerning ancillary service procurement.    I was wondering if Ercot had made a decision on OOM capacity payments.
Our position is that our custmers,  ie.   Teco/Frontera   should recover at least their O&M expenses for the capacity,  as they are standing by awaiting instruction.

Has there been any progress in this subject?

JForney

Due to the slowdown in trading,   I will be concentrating on leaving positions for RT to trade around.    
These will keep you in the market and give some flexibilty and decision making responsibility.    This will make more sense,  once you inherit the position.

The following positions need to be watched for monday:

1.     We are short to Mirant (on behalf of Frontera) for hour ending 6 only.     We need to buy 50 mw's and schedule this with Mirant Real Time.     
They are expecting and have agreed to this trade.   This is energy that Frontera owes them on a prescheduled basis.

If you are working Sunday night,   check in early with Mirant to make sure they are aware of this trade.   It is very common that they get a bad "handoff" and are unaware of this transaction.     Give them plenty of time to work this out.

We schedule this in the portal as a buy from X  and a sale to Mirant.    In Enpower,  buy from X and sell to Frontera (under the Teco Services book).   Enter this as a flat transaction,  ie buy for $20 and sell to Frontera for $20.

2.    The Ercot Asset book is long 5 mw's for offpeak Monday at $11.25.    Sell this or leave to the pool, as necessary.     I will be long this power offpeak for the balance of next week 10/16-19.     

I think that Saturday morning will come in strong, as we are getting some cooler weather.    I think also that some larger units are coming off line,  which will put upward pressure on the offpeak.

Each member of the group needs to tell me what positions they want.       Next day onpeak is trading for $20.5,  offpeak is trading $11.25.

Sent by: Office of the Chairman
Dear Enron Employees:

 With the addition of communications to our core businesses, it is 
appropriate for us to modify our existing tag line to simply "Endless 
possibilities."  This change is effective immediately and replaces our 
current tag line of "Natural gas. Electricity. Endless possibilities."

 To achieve our goal of a unified Enron brand, each employee has the 
responsibility to make the Enron image a consistent and strong identity.  
This is partially accomplished through correct application of the logo and 
tag line.  A revised Corporate Identity Guidelines Book has been developed to 
assist you in following the correct standards.  You may obain a copy of this 
new book by completing a Forms Request and ordering Item #42629.    These 
guidelines will also be made available electronically on the Brand Site at 
home.enron.com.

 We'd like to take this opportunity to remind all of you about the importance 
of maintaining a consistent look, especially with our stationery and business 
cards.  It has come to our attention recently that some employees are having 
these items produced by outside vendors and are not following the established 
guidelines.  This must stop immediately.  Please use the internal resources 
available to you for these items.  They will ensure that all guidelines are 
followed correctly and consistently.  If you have questions on how to get 
these items or on the guidelines, you may contact Marge Nadasky in Corporate 
Identity at marge.nadasky@enron.com.

 One name, one company....one Enron.  Our recent reorganization brings us 
another step closer to realizing this goal.  Please make sure you do your 
part to protect and strengthen the Enron brand around the world.

 Thank you for your continued support and cooperation.

      Office of the Chairman

Attached please find 2 draft letter to send to acquiring shippers with copies 
to releaseing shippers.

Letter A is to go to those shippers that have not paid the November 
invoices.  Pursuant to the tariff, Northern can give notice to terminate the 
service agreement.  At such point, the service agreement reverts back to the 
releasing shipper.The letter includes a notice that we consider the agreement 
extended to 2003 per the rate case even without their execution.

Letter B is to go to those acquiring shippers that paid the November 
invoices.  For those service agreement with an original expiration date of 
10/31/99, the payment constitutes acknowledgement that the agreement 
continues to 2002 pursuant to the administrative amendment that extended the 
agreement pursuant to the rollover provisions.  The letter includes a notice 
that we consider the agreement extended to 2003 per the rate case even 
without their execution.

Do we want to add to both letters that if the amendment is not executed, 
Northern will consider the releases temporary and the entitlement will revert 
back to the releasing shipper by x date?  or do we want to just wait until 
11/1/02 and see what happens.  (the revert back maybe should be in a separate 
letter to the Releasing Shipper otherwise the acquiring shipper will just do 
nothing and we'll be fighting with the releasing shipper anyway.  I'm 
rambling but hopefully you get the jist. 

Please let me have your comments ASAP because I don't know when 30 days from 
the invoice runs out.  Considering they have ten days to pay and we know they 
haven;t paid, we for sure only have 20 days.  Thanks, Dari

Can't make it.  Thanks.  DF

Mike, I'll be down in Houston Thursday and Friday the 11th and 12th.. Would 
either day be a good one to meet with Robbie Walls?  I've got lunch open both 
days.  DF

How bout getting me on a Wed PM flight to Hou. on Jan 10 and back to Omaha on 
the Fri afternoon flight on the 12th?  I need to be in Houston at the office 
until at least 3:00--can I still get a flight better than the late one?  DF

I note in TW's bullets for 12-22 that TW did the "Cal Border Backhaul" deal 
with SW Gas.  The last I heard about it, the deal had cratered.  I had 
serious reservations about doing the deal as it was initially described to 
me, which included a Cal border sale of "surplus" gas and a backhaul for EES 
on behalf of SW Gas.  My probems were (1) the issue of possible or apparent 
affiliate preference and (2) the need for adequate documentation of "surplus 
line pack."   My last guidance was that a deal like this might be doable, but 
only if we could document the "surplus" and if Stan signed off on it.  What 
happened?  Does the deal involve EES???  Was that raised with Stan and 
Danny?  The bullets don't mention the identity of the "shipper" that the 
backhaul was done for.  Please respond.  DF 

Some additional thoughts on the force majeure issue--i.e., are we cutting off 
shippers' supply due to force majeure?  

1.    If the gas at the point is out of spec on water, the answer is clearly 
no.  We're shutting in that supply due to our termination of a waiver of the 
tariff quality spec., not due to force majeure.  We have the discretion to 
grant or terminate waivers of the tariff in our discretion as prudent 
operators and so long as we don't discriminate.   If that gas is out of spec 
on any of the specific items listed in the "Quality" section of the tariff 
(Sec. 44?  47?  I can't remember which but its one of those) then the answer 
is the same.  

2.  If the gas is being shut in because of heavier hydrocarbons, I think the 
answer is the same as above if there is risk of those heavier hydrocarbons 
falling out as liquids.  I'm remembering the catch all section of the Quality 
paragraph as prohibiting "dirt, gums, and other impurities that would 
interfere with the operation of compressors, blah blah" or something to that 
effect.  That catch all seems to me to include liquids.  IF the c6 and 
heavier is going to form hydrates and fall out as liquids, then the people 
delivering those heavies to us are delivering out of spec gas--therefore no 
force majeure.   I read Eric's very scientific email and I think the punch 
line was that the heavy hydrocarbons may fall out as liquids--right?   The 
thing I can't remember is whether the Quality section has specific max. 
limits on the individual heavier hydrocarbons.  If so, and if the shippers 
are within those limits, my theory based on the catch all language doesn't 
work as good.  

3.  If we think we need to claim force majeure, we have a problem, because we 
could have bought our way out of this situation for a nickel.  Generally, an 
event isn't force majeure if it is purely economic.

I'll think about this some more tomorrow and give you guys a call.  DF

That's more or less what I expected.  Good enough to cover us until the 4th.

Per my conversation with Lynn and Steve on Friday night, we have claimed 
force majeure for any gas shut ins that actually happened for the 1st.  (I'm 
not sure how extensive that actually turned out to be).   Does that have any 
financial consequences or other consequences for us?  For example, on TW, 
certain force majeure situations can force us to refund demand charges, 
right?  NN's tariff doesn't have a similar mechanism, but we may have common 
law exposure.  We may need to revisit the Jan 1-4 period when we talk 
tomorrow or Wed.  This would really make Continental and possibly others mad, 
but at worst, we could put out a revised notice saying that the shut-ins for 
the 1st -4th were not FM.  Any thoughts?  DF

Lynn Blair
12/31/2000 03:16 PM
Just an update, I notified Continental that we will not consider the 
compressor shutins made this morning as
Force Majeur.  They (Melissa Master) did not seem to be too surprised.  She 
does understand
if we go back down on the 4th or 5th we will not mark any of the compressor 
with Force Majeure.
Thanks for your input.  Lynn

yes--lets talk at 9:30 to prep for the 10:00.  df

Per Louie Soldano, I called Dave Sinclair (GPG ROW) about whether we have any 
ability to negotiate a favorable right of way deal with the BNSF railroad.  
In Dave's experience, that is a nonstarter.  Apparently, a bunch of 
utilities, including us through Dave, have even formed a coalition to try to 
figure out how to get the railroads to be more cooperative.  If the RR owns 
its ROW outright (which many of the old railroads do out west) we might be 
able to condemn an easement by getting a FERC certificate.  In other words, 
the RR would be treated just like any other landowner.  If we did that, Dave 
thinks BNSF would treat it as a declaration of war.  Since our lines cross or 
parallel BNSF right of way all over the place from Topock to Duluth, that 
would be foolish.  

I swore Sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world I was 
interested in and he thought we could probably stitch together private ROW 
without too much pain.  If the RR option doesn't pan out, we may want to 
suggest to Tino and Dennis that our ROW people can handle this.  Assuming we 
can't come up with some magic contact with the RR, I propose that, at the 
appropriate time,  we tell Dennis and Tino that the last 7 or 8 miles of ROW 
should be flagged as a potential problem that Enron can help resolve once we 
decide to go forward.   

Other than the BNSF issue, I don't think we have any specific "to dos" or any 
specific comeback date to Dennis and Tino.  So what do you guys think should 
happen next?  DF

I received a call from Doug Gill, a reported for the Gas Processors Report, a 
small publication that is similar to Gas Daily.
(1 800 874 2544 ext 121)

He stated he had written a report on shutting down processing plants being 
shut down, and the impact to Processors. (He is faxing me that particular 
publication)

He was interested in doing an article on the impact that gas processing 
shutdowns has had to pipeline operations.

Per Doug: 'nobody is quoted'. With all the issues we have going on, I didn't 
know if we wanted to take advantage of this opportunity or fully decline this

01/10/2001 01:02 PM
Drew, since my message to you this morning I've spoken with Gerald Nemec and 
Mark Knippa and here is what I've been able to learn.  ECS's position is that 
they could not begin getting a monitoring system in place (automated or 
manual) until it could obtain access to CDEC's website, which required the 
execution of a confidentiality agreement with Tri-State to protect the 
confidential information on the website.  I do not remember exactly when I 
first reviewed the confidentiality agreement; I believe I OK'd a draft 
agreement sometime over the summer (Schedule 21 became effective sometime in 
July), and I received executables from Gerald Nemec around Thanksgiving, 
which I had signed and returned to ECS.  The confidentiality agreement was 
fully executed as of Dec. 8, 2000.  ECS blames the delay between draft and 
execution on Tri-State/CDEC, who allegedly would not work on the 
confidentiality agreement until the merger was completed.  

Currently ECS is working with Kevin Hyatt on getting an automated system in 
place.  TW has access to the CDEC website, but such access is of limited use 
until an automated system is implemented, because identifying peaks would 
require continuous monitoring.  Apparently the programming is being done 
through Arnold Eisenstein's group (using an outside contractor, I believe).  
In fact, EE&CC has been responsible for the automated system from the outset, 
in that development of the monitoring system was included in ECS's payments 
to EE&CC.  

ECS believes they have done everything possible to fulfill their obligation 
to develop a monitoring system.  But they also argue that even if they did 
not fulfill this obligation, they are not responsible for the expenses TW 
incurred due to use of the compressor during peak load periods, as the 
implementation of a monitoring system is no guarantee that peak loads will 
actually be avoided.  While ECS does have a point, this is still a pretty 
harsh legal position for ECS to take with an affiliate and business partner.  
If ECS breached its obligation, it should take responsibility for its share 
of the consequences.

The difficult question is whether ECS breached the obligation.  What is "good 
faith" is subjective.   Since the confidentiality agreement is for the 
protection of CDEC, ostensibly the Enrons could have just signed an agreement 
and sent it to CDEC and it would have been binding on us.  However, issuance 
of a password and access to the website was totally within CDEC's 
discretion.  It is difficult to know whether there is anything ECS or TW 
could have done to expedite the process.   Also, we will probably never be 
able to tell for sure how long the confidentiality agreement sat on CDEC's 
and ECS's desks prior to execution.  

Going forward, until an automated system is implemented, TW will still risk 
being charged for peak demand until it monitors the website continuously.  If 
we do monitor the system manually, I believe the agreement does obligate ECS 
to reimburse us for the additional employee time.  I asked Mark Knippa to 
find out how soon the software could be installed.  Kevin should, probably 
follow up with him on this.

Please call me; while writing this I had a gut feeling I should probably talk 
to you about it before sending to the larger group.  Centilli appears more 
than anxious to get this resolved (and is adamant that ECS owes us money).  
Thanks.

   
	
	

Randy, this is the issue I left you the voice mail on.  Article 6 of the 
Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) 
with ECS obligates ECS to "work in good faith with CDEC" to establish an 
automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading 
conditions on CDEC's system.  We had a pretty good idea when we signed the 
contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start 
date, so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to 
"assist [Transwestern] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same 
result and will hold harmless and keep [Transwestern] whole for all cost and 
expenses" associated with the manual system.  We will fight with them about 
who owes the $200k that James mentions below based on their failure to 
"assist" us in managing the cost.  In the mean time, we need to make sure 
that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to 
mitigate future costs.  Do we have someone who is watching this out there?  
We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to 
manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.  James 
had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement--I 
guess between ECS and Transwestern--that would permit ECS to communicate to 
us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC.  That sounds like a 
BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we 
can figure out a solution.  Thanks.  DF 

James Centilli
12/14/2000 02:49 PM
Would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression 
Service Contract in respect to the Load Control Management.  My understanding 
was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC's online profile in order 
for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC's peak 
load periods.  We have not received access to this information which has 
resulted so far in additional electric cost of $200,987.33 for the period of 
July through September.  Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder 
of this year, that I have not been able to review yet.  This cost is 
averaging $79,000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have 
in August and September.

Good point, but I'm comfortable we're covered because our bidders were all 
bidding on a chunk of capacity and primary points.  They are deemed to be on 
notice that they had alternate point rights (its in the tariff) and if they 
wanted to submit a bid that had a different rate for primaries and 
alternates, they could have done so.  None of them did, and most importantly, 
the winning bidders did not.  Our letter agreement simply memorializes that 
we will charge the same negotiated rate whether the gas flows on primaries or 
alternates.  I assume from your message you are OK with this and they can get 
it nailed down?  DF  

   
	
	

I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in 
the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that 
the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed 
to.   My concern with adding the language below is,  could it be argued that 
not everyone knew the rate would or could apply at any point, since we just 
stated Topack and Needles and if they knew they might have bid a different 
rate?? 

Susan Scott
01/11/2001 02:42 PM
After discussions with the commercial group I propose that that redlined 
language be added to the attached Dynegy agreement and to the 4 other 
negotiated rate agreements we've done.  If there are any objections you need 
to get back to me ASAP.

In discussion with Dave, we thought it would be good to put this together in

Susan Scott would like authorization to order an Aeron chair for each of her 
offices - on 47 and 41.  This particular chair is designed to help with back 
problems, which she has.  Many people at Enron already have this type of 
chair, but we rarely, if ever, have a surplus because they are so popular.  
The cost is $567.77 per chair plus tax.  Please approve the purchase of two.  
Thanks!

I believe you got a copy of the John Sommer letter to producers dated Jan 6 
that MKM's spies intercepted.  She forwarded the Sommer letter to Stan and 
discussed it with him.  Dari and I vented our aggravation by drafting the 
attached letter to Gibson and Kyle complaining of Sommer's duplicity, but 
after tempers cooled, MKM and I decided not to send it to  Stan or urge him 
to send a written response.  As it stands, MKM and I will probably bring it 
up with Sommer in OK City and strongly suggest the importance of coordinated 
communication to the producers.  Stan may also bring the letter up orally 
next time he's on the phonne with Gibson or Kyle as an example of how not to 
handle this situation.    

Yea--it was outstanding news!  What a hoss.  Can't catch you this time but 
keep me posted on your next trip.  DF

I am flying to Houston on Monday, am free for dinner, then leave Tuesday p.m. 
for Washington DC.  Leave word at the Downtwon Hyatt if you can join me.  
Great news about Frank, wasn't it?   mcs

I have been updated by Susan on her (largely futile) efforts to push ECS on 
the $200k we think they owe us.  Martha, please get me a half hour Tuesday 
with Susan, James and Kevin so we can decide how to get closure on this.  If 
I understand ECS' position, their argument is that CDEC stonewalled and 
delayed granting access to the critical website and therefore its not ECS' 
fault that manual peak monitoring wasn't operational until December .  That 
argument, it seems to me, is BS because we never heard even a shred of 
warning or request for help from ECS on getting things moving, right?  At 
minimum, TW could have raised holy hell with TriState and CDEC management to 
get things moving if we knew that ECS was stymied.  But we heard nothing.  Is 
that our story?  

If its going to take me doing some yelling at Knippa or Steve and Rod talking 
to Redmond, lets decide what the script is and get it done.    

Thanks for the helpful message.  I'll go ahead and order her one--I think 
I'll let her decide where she wants it, as two chairs sounds a bit over the 
top.  DF

   
	
	

We do not have a "policy" regarding the ergonomic chairs.  From my 
experience, management can approve this request if it is reasonable 
(generally, if the person making the request is confined to long hours in an 
office chair which could potentially cause or worsen back problems) and if 
they have money in the budget as the cost would be borne by the department.  
I understand that Pat Scarsborrow (sp?) at 3-5368 is the person in Property 
in Houston to contact for these chairs.  I also found out that any time new 
furniture is ordered, that these chairs are now standard issue.  Our Safety 
person indicated that OSHA is coming out with new rules this year which may 
require that companies provide this benefit to employees, so you may as well 
get ahead of the game.  I'm told that it generally takes 2-3 months after the 
order is placed before the chairs arrive.

Please let me know if you have any other questions in this regad.

I don't think having an intrastate in the ETS family would be a problem.  We 
could even run it with a merchant business if we firewalled the merchant 
entity off from the ETS pipelines.  Keep me in the loop and get MKM's group 
in at the appropriate time (far enough in advance of us submitting a bid that 
they can opine on the valuation).  Thanks. df

Any thoughts on the intrastate pipeline aspect??
	
	

Here is a transmittal from Conoco on the PowerTex deal.  They suggest we 
schedule our data room visit for Friday Jan 26.  Please let me know if THIS 
DATE WORKS FOR YOU?  Seems like one day in the data room should be sufficient 
given that our interest is limited to only the PowerTex system. 

Before going to the data room, there are several issues we ought to think 
through.  Here are some of them, ... you can probably add others.

Assuming we leave it standalone, PowerTex would be the only intrastate 
pipeline in the ETS family ... is that a problem? 
ETS can not buy/sell gas, so can the PowerTex business be structured as 
transport only (or do we need to bring in a marketer or other player?)
What are the growth opportunities (access to new customers, inexpensive 
increases in capacity, etc.)
What are major risks going forward (losing customers to competition, contract 
expiration, reduced contractual transport rates, etc.)
Any environmental/litigation exposure
Structure of transaction (taxes, liabilities, indemnifications, etc.)   
Others?

Steve is now in Omaha, but when he returns let's get together as a group.

Here is what I've been able to learn about the hedges of the TW index rate 
deals.
Morgan has been working in connection with Dan Fancler, Tracy Geaccone (sp?) 
and Dave Neubauer to make sure these can go under FAS 133 and for any other 
analysis that needs to be done.  They will continue to do so on the other 
deals and I'll follow up.  I am satisfied the interim procedures are being 
followed.  Questions -- let me know.

Susan's draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the 
Commission.  To save Susan from trying to translate my weird scribbles, I'm 
having Martha type up my vitriol.  Please hold off on detailed comments on 
Susan's draft unless you've already finished them.  I'll circulate a revised 
draft to you all later today.  In the mean time, Susan and Frank and Steve, 
are there not some cases in which the Commission has specifically granted 
confidential treatment of precedent agreements or discount agreements in 
expansion cases.  I know the bulk of authority is against us, but I seem to 
recall at least a few stray decisions where the Commission granted confid. 
treatment (even if only for a limited time).  Lets talk.  Thanks. DF

In representing to participants at the TW Options technical conference that 
shipper call options will not be sold on capacity that is subject to a ROFR, 
our underlying assumption (I believe) was that capacity subject to a ROFR 
isn't posted as generally available either.  Jeff, Lorraine and I just 
learned that this is not the case.  Our "generally available" posting system 
does not distinguish between capacity rolling off of a contract and capacity 
that is subject to a ROFR; all it recognizes is the expiration of the initial 
contract term.  Therefore, we have capacity posted on our website that is 
subject to the current shipper's ROFR and that is therefore not really 
available.  We found this out when a shipper called asking about some posted 
space.  Jeff's initial reaction was "no, that space isn't available."  But 
when we checked the posting, there it was.  The commercial people instantly 
recognized it as space currently subject to a contract that contains a ROFR.  

My recommendation is that we modify the posting procedure to NOT post 
capacity until we know that capacity is unsubscribed after we jump thru all 
the ROFR hoops.  The premature posting of that capacity is, at best, 
confusing to our customers who might count on getting the space by bidding 
maximum rate.  I realize that modifying our system might involve additional 
time and cost, but I think it's misleading to leave it as is.  Please let me 
know whether you concur.

I don't have a problem supporting the concept generally.  Since they took the

Margarite Wong-Chapman, general counsel of Tennessee Gas Pipeline (and Peggy 
Heeg, general counsel of El Paso corp) called me to see if the Enron Pipeline 
would be willing to file in support of their hourly firm filing.  She called 
because she said that our pipelines are on record as saying that pipelines 
need flexibility to serve electric generators.  Protests are coming from the 
Dynegy/Indicate Shipper crowd that claim that pipeline can provide hourly 
flexibility within current FT.   A technical conference is set for next 
Tues.  & either Nancy or Jan will cover.

I told Margarite that I would see whether I could drum up any support for an 
ETS intervention and comments in support.  I told her that any ETS comments 
would at most be brief and state general support for the notion that pipeline 
need flexibility to serve electric generators.  I also told her that I 
doubted that we could file by next Tues.  

Let me know what you think.  Personally I see some value from cooperating 
with El Paso on this issue.

FYI - I will separately fax you a copy of the proposal to be discussed at the 
next INGAA/Generator roundtable meeting next Tues. here in Houston.  For the 
most part, the proposal is more of the same tone -- we should be able to 
serve generators under existing services.  

No concerns--I think we ought to go.  Thanks.  DF

As you know, the marketing affiliate conference is still set for January 31.  
The Alliance of Energy Suppliers (EEI's generation arm) has filed a letter to 
postpone to conference.  The Commission hasn't acted on this request, so at 
this point the conference is still on.  Interestingly, the FERC hasn't issued 
a notice of the panel participants yet.  Bob Flanders of FERC says not to 
expect the notice before Monday -- so maybe there is some hope of this being 
canceled yet.  

In the meantime, INGAA is moving forward to prepare for the conference.   
Speakers friendly to our cause include INGAA - Joan Dreskin, AGA, Williams - 
Scott Turkington, and ENA.  Dominion is a mixed bag.  They oppose more strict 
rules -- but since they have already been applied in their merger, they may 
also say that such conditions should be applied to all.  

Joan Dreskin's comments will be very generic in opposition to rule changes 
and WIlliams will be fairly negative.  I'm afraid they come off as a bit too 
defensive.   So, basically the best case will likely be made by Leslie Lawner 
of ENA.   She knows the % capacity that ENA holds on our pipes.  She is aware 
of transactional data that is out there.  She has been briefed on the 
Dominion merger conditions (extension of the rules of all affiliates, logs of 
affiliate communications and visits, etc).  

I know that you probably already read Jan's summary of comments.  If you are 
interested, here are INGAA's working papers.

 - List of Roundtable Participants.doc
 - marketing affiliate comments 1-09-01.doc
 - Questions.doc

Please let me know next week if there is any specific point or argument (e.g. 
Drew's Funny Money email) that we would like to ask Joan or Leslie to 
raise.   Otherwise, I expect that we will have the opportunity to file a 
detailed reply after the conference.

One additional point.  If we aren't going to try to rebut the "funny money" 
argument on the merits, can we at least have Leslie Lawner or someone loaded 
up to dispute their circumstantial case?  Both Amoco and Dynegy argue that 
marketing affiliates hold a much higher percentage of the capacity on their 
sister pipelines than they do on non-affiliated pipes.  They argue that 
unfairness or abuse can be inferred from that fact alone.  The Enron pipes 
may be a statistical oddity on this.  A very small percentage of NN and TW 
capacity has been held by affiliates.  I think the same is true on Border and 
to a lesser extent on Florida.  Amoco and Dynegy can't have it both ways.  If 
they want to infer abuse from a large percentage of a pipe's capacity being 
held by marketing affiliates (i.e., El Paso) then they also have to infer an 
absence of abuse from a small percentage (i.e., the Enron pipes).  Can we 
argue this???  DF    

Shelley Corman
01/19/2001 09:32 AM
I think Joan will do great at addressing the issue that there is no evidence 
of abuse.  I'm not as confident  that she will be as indignent as I would be 
about why we spent so much money on transactional reporting if nobody is 
going to use it.    I'm going to write up a q/a for her on this points.  We 
probably should make transparency a focal point in our follow-up comments.

Great job on the Oelwein Incident presentation at the Safety Coordinators 
Workshop. I believe we all recognize that there is some legal risk in taking 
this proactive posture; I believe the risk to our employees is greater if we 
don't present lessons learned in a clear and prompt  manner. The comments I 
heard were very favorable, and many could relate this incident to ones they 
had been involved in. 

I love your standard opening of an open invite for an attorney joke, but of 
course am shocked that we would have field employees who have a joke ready!

Again, this sharing of information at this stage of the game adds 
considerable integrity to all of management.

Here are some bullet points based on our conversation Friday morning 
regarding the ECS Compression Service Agreement.  These bullet points 
summarize our position and are intended to be a starting point for a 
conversation between persons at TW and at ECS (who are yet to be determined) 
regarding the additional power costs incurred by Transwestern as a result of 
the lack of a system for monitoring peak loads on CDEC.  If you have 
additional comments, please let me know.  

We still need to decide who is going to call whom; I am going to leave that 
up to you, but do let me know if I can help. 

-  ECS is under an obligation to work in good faith with CDEC to establish a 
monitoring system that would automatically 
alert TW to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.  

-  Rate No. 21 became effective in July 2000.  ECS did not obtain permission 
for TW to access the "Members Only" portion of CDEC's website (which contains 
load data) until January 2001.  Access to the information required a 
confidentiality agreement, which was executed in December.

-  ECS blames the delay on Tri-State/CDEC, who allegedly would not work on 
the confidentiality agreement until the merger was completed.   "Good faith" 
by ECS would reasonably include alerting TW to any such delay or any 
difficulty in getting access to CDEC's information.  TW was never contacted 
in this regard.  

-  Since Rate No. 21 contains a rebate for customers that avoid peak load 
times, we assume that CDEC is under an obligation to provide such customers 
with access to peak load information (I have not been able to verify this, 
but it makes sense).  If this is true, we should have been able to have 
access immediately upon the effectiveness of Rate No. 21.

-  Most if not all of the $325,000 peak load costs incurred by TW since July 
could have been avoided had TW had access to a monitoring system.  Because it 
did not alert TW to difficulties/delay in getting the necessary information 
from CDEC, ECS did not act in good faith in obtaining such access and should 
therefore take responsibility for its share of the consequences.

-  ECS needs to act without further delay to build an automated monitoring 
system to eliminate the need for someone to continuously monitor the 
website.  An estimated completion date should be provided.

I've left messages at CDEC to ask about access to the Members Only part of 
the website; I'll follow up.  The website states only that access is granted 
"on a case-by-case basis."  I hope to make contact on Monday and will let you 
know what I'm able to learn from them.

I can fly from Houston to Denver on Thur. late afternoon or evening so I'm 
available to meet with MMS anytime on Friday.  Martha, please coordinate with 
Paul and Mark and get me where I need to be, returning to Omaha on Friday 
after the meeting Mark is setting up.  Pls get me to Hou. on the Thur. am

these expected improvements.  She must show significant improvement in the 
following areas during this next:  six months, 30 days, 60 days (whatever you 
deem appropriate).  I would also suggest one more action item.

"Lee must improve on collaboration efforts on projects.  She needs to take 
the initiative to seek expertise, assistance and direction from peers/clients

communicating the status of projects with management and clients."

FYI
Mike and Andy,

Andy, I tried to send this message to Richard as well, but the computer 
directory is fouled up and won't let me do it.  I hope sending it to you is 
sufficient, but if not, let me know.

I received a call from Mike Noone of Mike Beatty & Associates about the 
above-referenced lawsuit, which is filed in state court in Garfield County, 
Colorado.  For Andy's reference, Beatty & Associates is representing the 
Enron entities and a number of other defendants in the Grynberg MDL case.  
This case is not a gas measurement case, which is the gist of the Grynberg 
action.

Noone's firm represents the plaintiff; I did not ask who represents the 
defendants, all of whom are Questar entities.  The lawsuit arises out of a 
partnerhip agreement to build the Transcolorado Pipeline.  The Transcolorado 
Pipeline takes gas from Colorado producers at its northern end to an 
interconnect (or interconnects) at its southern end to either El Paso or TW, 
who deliver the gas to California markets.  After it was built, Questar 
allegedly began building a competing pipeline, called the Main Line 104 
Project (the designation used in the FERC filings), which will connect 
Questar's gathering system at the northern end of the pipeline to the Kern 
River Pipeline.  Kern River will apparently ultimately deliver the gas to 
California markets.  KN contends that the Main Line 104 Project will take gas 
from exactly the same basins as the Transcolorado Pipeline (the Picence and 
Ulenta Basins, if I have that spelled correctly) and is in direct 
competition.  I did not ask Mike what relief KN is requesting.

KN is interested in documentation from TW and ENA that discusses what their 
competitive options are in getting gas from the area served by the 
Transcolorado Pipeline to California markets.  It appears that KN is hoping 
to see some discussion of the Main Line 104 Project as an alternative to the 
Transcolorado Pipeline.  It strikes me that such information may be highly 
sensitive.

I asked Mike why he thought ENA would have any such information, and Mike 
said that he thought ENA might own or have an interest in some producing 
properties in the relevant area.  I told Mike that that would be a surprise 
to me, and that EOG, which is the Enron entity that typically owns such 
interests, was spun off last year.  Mike said he would take another look to 
see why they thought ENA would have such information.

The trial date is one year out, and this is apparently the first round of 
discovery.  Mike would not be surprised if we got a call from Questar's 
attorneys, requesting the same information.

Noone faxed to me the proposed subpoenas, with the understanding that I was 
not authorized to accept service for them.  I will send copies to each of 
you.  Let me know if you would like the Unit to handle or assist in the 
handling of this.

After doing some looking, I've reached the same conclusion as you, Lee:  if 
PG&E fails to comply with our request for assurance of creditworthiness, the 
"Termination" provisions of Section 16.1(b) of our General Terms and 
Conditions will be triggered.  The wording is convoluted, but basically it 
means:

If PG&E fails to perform any obligation under a service agreement, TW may 
terminate the agreement under the following procedure:  1) TW serves written 
notice on PG&E that it is in default, and that TW intends to terminate the 
agreement, 2) PG&E gets 30 days to remedy the default, 3) if PG&E does not 
remedy the default within 30 days, the agreement shall become null and void.

3 issues + my answers:

 1.  Is failure to provide assurance of creditworthiness a breach of the 
service agreement?  I think so -- our Form M Service Agreement expressly 
incorporates the General Terms and Conditions of the tariff, and one of those 
terms and conditions is that shipper must provide satisfactory assurance of 
creditworthiness or TW can terminate service.

 2.  How should Section 16 be read in conjunction with the creditworthiness 
provisions of Section 13?  Section 13 provides that shipper must provide 
satisfactory assurance of creditworthiness within a reasonable periodor TW 
does not have to continue service.  I see nothing in the tariff that would 
prevent us from suspending service to PG&E immediately if they fail to comply 
with our request for assurance of payment within a reasonable time.  
Simultaneously with our suspending service, we should send the letter of 
notice pursuant to Section 16.  

 3.  Is termination of service under Section 13 the equivalent of termination 
of the agreement under Section 16?  I do not believe our suspension of 
service pursuant to Section 13 would result in automatic termination of the 
contract, nor would it allow PG&E to just walk from the contract; it appears 
that either party would have to follow the procedure under Section 16 in 
order to terminate the contract (the notice provisions apply to shipper as 
well as transporter).  Section 13 does not talk about termination of the 
contract, only termination of service.  While I am not satisfied that this is 
crystal clear under our tariff, since it is not expressly stated, I do think 
it is the best answer given the fact that the tariff has, in Section 16, a 
specific procedure for terminating a service agreement.  While there is some 
Texas contract law on implied rescission based on mutual repudiation of the 
contract, I believe our tariff is controlling here because the tariff 
provisions I've cited amount to express contractual provisions between the 
parties governing termination, so there is no reason to go to common law.  
Drew, in answer to your question, our termination of service is not 
anticipatory breach because by definition anticipatory breach is repudiation 
without an excuse.
 
Now for the interesting part.  The Bankruptcy Code provides that a utility 
may not alter, refuse or discontinue service to a debtor solely because of 
commencement of a bankruptcy action or because a debt owed by the debtor was 
not paid when due.  However, the utility may alter, refuse or discontinue 
service if neither the trustee nor the debtor, within 20 days after the date 
of the order for relief, furnished adequate assurance of payment for service 
after such date.  I'm no bankruptcy expert, but my point is simply that our 
rights may change once a bankruptcy action is filed.  The Commission has held 
that termination of service cannot be inconsistent with federal bankruptcy 
law:  see El Paso Natural Gas Company, 61 FERC P61,302 (1992) (involving El 
Paso Electric bankruptcy).

If you need anything else, let me know.

 Under ordinary contract law, we would probably have the right to terminate 
the contract if PG&E is in breach.  

Not a problem.  I'll let you know how it goes.  df

Here are some bullet points based on our conversation Friday morning 
regarding the ECS Compression Service Agreement.  These bullet points 
summarize our position and are intended to be a starting point for a 
conversation between persons at TW and at ECS (who are yet to be determined) 
regarding the additional power costs incurred by Transwestern as a result of 
the lack of a system for monitoring peak loads on CDEC.  If you have 
additional comments, please let me know.  

We still need to decide who is going to call whom; I am going to leave that 
up to you, but do let me know if I can help. 

-  ECS is under an obligation to work in good faith with CDEC to establish a 
monitoring system that would automatically 
alert TW to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.  

-  Rate No. 21 became effective in July 2000.  ECS did not obtain permission 
for TW to access the "Members Only" portion of CDEC's website (which contains 
load data) until January 2001.  Access to the information required a 
confidentiality agreement, which was executed in December.

-  ECS blames the delay on Tri-State/CDEC, who allegedly would not work on 
the confidentiality agreement until the merger was completed.   "Good faith" 
by ECS would reasonably include alerting TW to any such delay or any 
difficulty in getting access to CDEC's information.  TW was never contacted 
in this regard.  

-  Since Rate No. 21 contains a rebate for customers that avoid peak load 
times, we assume that CDEC is under an obligation to provide such customers 
with access to peak load information (I have not been able to verify this, 
but it makes sense).  If this is true, we should have been able to have 
access immediately upon the effectiveness of Rate No. 21.

-  Most if not all of the $325,000 peak load costs incurred by TW since July 
could have been avoided had TW had access to a monitoring system.  Because it 
did not alert TW to difficulties/delay in getting the necessary information 
from CDEC, ECS did not act in good faith in obtaining such access and should 
therefore take responsibility for its share of the consequences.

-  ECS needs to act without further delay to build an automated monitoring 
system to eliminate the need for someone to continuously monitor the 
website.  An estimated completion date should be provided.

I've left messages at CDEC to ask about access to the Members Only part of 
the website; I'll follow up.  The website states only that access is granted 
"on a case-by-case basis."  I hope to make contact on Monday and will let you 
know what I'm able to learn from them.

As long as Dave and/or you are signing off on the EOL packages, I don't have 
any problem with this.  As to non-EOL deals, we may also want to eliminate 
the requirement that all Demarc deals need such a high approval level.  I 
don't think there is anything uniquely risky about Demarc as long as we have 
our capacity posting squared away.  DF

I spoke with the person who administers the Members Only website at 
TriState.  I explained to her that we had been a customer under Rate No. 21 
since July but only obtained access recently.  She processes the request 
forms, and seemed to indicate that obtaining access is really a matter of 
routine.  She said we should have been able to get access as soon as we 
became a customer.  I told her we had signed a confidentiality agreement and 
she confirmed this was routine also.  I did not press her on the specifics of 
how ECS/TW obtained access, as I felt she had already given me enough 
information to tend to confirm our suspicions.  She was helpful, and had we 
known to contact her or someone in her department I feel certain we could 
have talked our way thru the red tape (if any really existed).

Bummer.  Thanks for the quick answer.  The Maritimes case does give us at 
least a small foothold to use.  DF

   
	
	

My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on 
point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of 
contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here:

**
 In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997), 
Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it 
submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that 
Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential. 
Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off 
dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such 
information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes 
requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept 
confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years 
public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for 
confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market 
support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the 
contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of 
longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and 
support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed 
services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of 
the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made 
public. 

FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could 
terminate contingent on the
occurrence of certain events.

FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (1996).
**

In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas 
Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a 
request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission 
explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment 
but transportation contracts should not:  

the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a 
different
footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are 
subject to similar disclosure
requirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas 
sales in a
competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under 
the assumption that the pipeline
exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that 
competition is from other
pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting 
requirements. 

There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the 
context of Section 4 cases.  

Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the 
next few days and let you know if I find anything. 

   
	
	

Susan's draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the 
Commission.  To save Susan from trying to translate my weird scribbles, I'm 
having Martha type up my vitriol.  Please hold off on detailed comments on 
Susan's draft unless you've already finished them.  I'll circulate a revised 
draft to you all later today.  In the mean time, Susan and Frank and Steve, 
are there not some cases in which the Commission has specifically granted 
confidential treatment of precedent agreements or discount agreements in 
expansion cases.  I know the bulk of authority is against us, but I seem to 
recall at least a few stray decisions where the Commission granted confid. 
treatment (even if only for a limited time).  Lets talk.  Thanks. DF

What  about the risk that a bankruptcy trustee could pull the escrow account 
back into the general creditors' estate?  Is that any greater than the risk a 
prepayment would be required to be returned?

I think we do need to review this with Stan and/or Danny (as well as someone 
else in Enron that's managing the bigger picture on PGE credit risk.)

Rod Hayslett

01/24/2001 01:54 PM
I guess I would argue then he hasn't secured the future business, since it is 
not fully prepaid.      We could raise the amount to cover the days exposed 
and be in a better position.

   
	
	

 I have spoken with Chris Chung of the PG & E Risk management group in regard 
to the necessary credit assurances TW would require. Chris stated he could 
not provide a letter of credit but would consider a prepayment. He also 
indicated that through his business group he heard as a rumor that we would 
accept a one month valuation. To continue the discussion, I told Chris a 
decision as to the amount would have to be  authorized by my management and 
my proposal as to how the prepayment would work , is PG & E would wire the 
agreed prepayment to us to secure the February business, then make payment 
for the January transportation on the due date in February and then make the 
prepayment on a monthly basis with a true up to the actual invoice. Chris 
countered with PG & E posting a Security Deposit in an Escrow account to 
secure the future transactions. The issue I have with this arrangement is 
that theoretically if PG & E defaults on payment on the due date, we have 
approximately forty days exposure and more until we can suspend service which 
could be an additional thirty days.

 Please review and advise your comments and/or direction. 

 Also, should we review our proposal with other Senior Management before 
responding.

 Regards.

here they are.  gracias

Paul, as we discussed on the phone, here are my conclusions on the 
terminability of our firm contracts with PG&E.  I believe Drew and Shelley 
concur (and they are welcome to add their comments, of course).  

If PG&E fails to comply with our request for assurance of creditworthiness, 
the "Termination" provisions of Section 16.1(b) of our General Terms and 
Conditions will be triggered.  If PG&E fails to perform any obligation under 
a service agreement, TW may terminate the agreement under the following 
procedure:  1) TW serves written notice on PG&E that it is in default, and 
that TW intends to terminate the agreement, 2) PG&E gets 30 days to remedy 
the default, 3) if PG&E does not remedy the default within 30 days, the 
agreement shall become null and void, after we obtain the requisite 
regulatory approvals, which Shelley advises me would include obtaining 
abandonment authority from FERC.  
 
The Bankruptcy Code provides that a utility may not alter, refuse or 
discontinue service to a debtor solely because of commencement of a 
bankruptcy action or because a debt owed by the bankruptcy debtor was not 
paid when due.  However, the utility may alter, refuse or discontinue service 
if neither the trustee nor the debtor, within 20 days after the date of an 
order for relief, furnished adequate assurance of payment for service after 
such date.  I am not a bankruptcy expert, but my point is simply that our 
rights may change once a bankruptcy action is filed.  Let's hope that our 30 
days runs before PG&E goes to Bankruptcy Court.  FERC has held that 
termination of service cannot be inconsistent with federal bankruptcy law:  
see El Paso Natural Gas Company, 61 FERC P61,302 (1992) (involving El Paso 
Electric bankruptcy).

As far as whether there could be a temporary release of PG&E's capacity, our 
tariff does not contain any provision under which we could compel any shipper 
to release its capacity.  PG&E certainly has the ability to release its 
capacity, but it does not sound as if they would want to without some 
incentive.

If there are any other questions give me a call (or Drew or Shelley).

   
	
	

 Per our conversation.

 Thanks
Steven Harris
01/23/2001 01:19 PM
I am not sure I exactly understand your question. It is possible for us to 
sell the space if PG&E were to release it. However, I am sure PG&E has no 
intention of letting it go as they need it for their core supplies. Also, 
since the market value of the space is greater than what they pay us it would 
cost them more money in the long run to get rid of it and have to buy/ ship 
supplies under some other supply arrangement. For an answer to any legal 
rights they have Susan Scott would be the best one to answer that. 
Thanks.     

   
	
	

 Steve,

 The question has been brought up in regard to the capacity that PG&E holds 
and it's marketability, in the event that PG &E defaults and goes into 
bankruptcy.  Could a preauthorized temporary release of this capacity be 
considered where performance would continue, while PG & E would retain it's 
liability under the Firm Contracts?

 Thanks and Regards.

I agree with MKM--I think we either said or at least implied in the options 
conf. and filings that ROFR cap. isn't posted as available until the ROFR is 
waived.  I think that approach is the logical way to handle postings and that 
we are pretty much locked into that approach.  On the commercial issue Rita 
mentions below, it seems to me that Elizabeth Brown has the commercial 
impacts backwards--the marketers have always told us they are able to 
negotiate higher rates if LESS CAPACITY is posted as available because of the 
appearance of scarcity.  On that logic, we should want to keep ROFR capacity 
off the EBB until the right is waived.  DF

   
	
	

My thoughts on that we just filed to state that ROFR capacity isn't posted as 
available.  Yet, this , as I understand it leads the market to think it is, 
and then when a market requests the service, we'll tell them it isn't 
available.  Seems to head us to bad customer relations and false impression 
on capacity available.  If its under contract, we shouldn't falsely advertise 
it as available in my opinion.   What are others thoughts?  MK

   
	
	

Mary Kay,  

Are up OK with this footnote idea instead of changing the capacity posting to 
reflect ROFR rights?

	Rita Bianchi
	01/22/2001 08:17 AM
	
According to Elizabeth Brown, TW Marketing does NOT want to change their 
Unsubscribed/General capacity posting to exclude ROFR.  They would prefer a 
footnote that capacity may be subject to ROFR.  As I understand it, TW 
Marketers feel that they  can negotiate better prices for capacity if it 
isn't widely known that the capacity is under ROFR.  Elizabeth suggested that 
they talk to Susan Scott.

I confirmed with Bob Johnson & Doug Aschwege that NNG's posting excludes 
capacity that is subject to ROFR.

I would agree with Paul, unless Drew thinks we can get the agreement out of 
here in the next 30-40 minutes.

   
	
	

 In order to comply with the request we have made to P G  & E of a 12:00  
P.M. CST deadline, Chris Chung of P G & E has advised that our proposal has 
to be submitted to him by Noon today in order to effect a  wire transfer by 
the Monday deadline. Drew is close in the completion of generating the 
Agreement, however, with the internal review and approval process, it is 
doubtful we can achieve the timetable needed by P G  & E. It would be my 
recommendation that we extend the deadline from Monday, January 29 at Noon to 
Tuesday, January 30 at Noon. This would permit our internal review with the 
expectation of sending P G & E our Agreement by Monday morning and allowing 
time for their review. I have spoken to Drew and he is comfortable with this 
approach. Additionally, in my conversation with Chung, I indicated that our 
approach and proposal would be for P G & E to wire transfer the necessary 
funds prior to our providing transportation for February and then payment 
would be expected to be made for the January transportation on the 
appropriate due date in February. (Approximately the tenth )

 Please advise your comments at your earliest conveniece.

 Thanks and Regards.

That was an interesting little conversation.  I came back down and looked for

ee=20
did a recap of where they are in that proceeding and explained how proposed=
=20
changes to daily balancing impact FT-H. =20

Basic Description of FT-H

? The target audience of the FT-H is combined cycle base load generation, n=
ot=20
necessarily peaker plants, though the service is available to all shippers.=
 =20
? FT-H will be generally available capacity subject to an NPV open season. =
=20
Contractual rights assigned to FT-H are firm daily quantities that can be=
=20
nominated hourly as 1/18 to 1/4 of the daily quantity. =20
? FT-H shippers must specify a 12-hour daily service period for MHQ=20
eligibility (i.e., 7:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.) and daily receipt quantities hav=
e=20
e to match delivery quantities on a contract basis (not necessarily on a fl=
ow=20
basis). =20
? Nominations have a one hour start-up and shut-down time. =20
? Balancing is the same as regular firm with no hourly balancing charges
? Rates are analogous to storage charges, with three components:=20
deliverability rate (hourly, 70%), capacity rate (daily, 30%), commodity=20
charge (based on flow).

Summary

With only lukewarm support of the proposal at the conference, Tennessee wil=
l=20
gather and send some clarifying material out to parties, but will also thin=
k=20
about pulling the service at this time.  If they do continue with the FT-H=
=20
proposal, the pipeline will file a modified proposal in two weeks with=20
comments due in mid-March.  There may be a follow up conference to be=20
scheduled at a later date.  A FERC order on the filing must be issued by=20
mid-May.

FERC Staff stated that they prefer to keep Tennessee=01,s order 637 proceed=
ing=20
(RP00-477) separate from FT-H (RP01-81).  Tennessee met with customers on 6=
37=20
issues the following day (Jan. 24th) and will file a letter on their proces=
s=20
going forward in RP00-477 by January 31st.

Discussion

After Tennessee=01,s explanation of the FT-H service, Staff asked questions=
=20
about the impact of hourly service on other services, and began by asking i=
f=20
Tennessee could make public any modeling or service studies done to determi=
ne=20
the impact of FT-H on other points (Staff noted that this analysis or=20
transparent modeling should be filed for transparency).  This opened the=20
debate about =01&historical operation,=018 which is the focal point of exis=
ting=20
shipper concern.  Shippers define historical operation as that they=01,ve=
=20
received over time; Tennessee maintains that current tariff entitlements as=
=20
contracted define current service, excluding enhanced services that may hav=
e=20
been offered when available.

LDCs are concerned with losing these =01&enhanced=018 historical services a=
nd argue=20
that their contracts were signed so long ago that many of the services they=
=20
use now were not available or defined then, and some, such as pressure,=20
wouldn=01,t be acceptable today as written in their contracts.  At the hear=
t of=20
the matter, LDCs have become accustomed to access to more than 1/24 of thei=
r=20
MDQ in an hour and do not want their capacity to be defined as such.  Also,=
=20
there is concern over nomination priority using NPV to compete with FT-H. =
=20

Other LDC concerns: =20
? Preferences to secondary rights to FT-H over FT-A,
? Ability of FT-A to get MDQ on peak,
? NPV will bias against FT-A (Tennessee explained that a max rate FT-A=20
shipper wins over FT-H because of total hourly capacity).

Generators, the alleged primary customer for this service, were lukewarm in=
=20
their responses.  Calpine and Dynegy said that they=01,d likely stick to FT=
-A=20
for their plants.  Though they encouraged FERC to accept the service, they=
=20
were not convincing that they=01,d sign up for it today. =20

Dynegy detailed a list of concerns and issues with the service:
? Dynegy=01,s not interested in the 12-hour designated block of time, they =
need=20
more flexibility,
? Ramp up time isn=01,t adequate,
? Rates are too heavily weighted toward demand side,
? Service needs to be somehow standardized for capacity release and=20
e-commerce,
? Penalty rates should not be based on power prices,=20
? Third parties should be able to offer this in competition with Tennessee
? Offer FT-H as a seasonal service.

David Port, ETS is purchasing a trading system from Caminus to track their 
transactions.  Included in this system are position reports which the 
Accounting Department will be using to report and determine compliance with 
the attached policy and procedures, including open positions, VAR, MTM, 
approval limits, Greeks, credit risk, stress testing, basis positions, 
confirmations and invoicing.  The ETS Risk Management policy requires that 
our reporting conform to the corporate standards, accordingly your name was 
given to me as the person who could help direct some of the more technical 
reporting standards.

Caminus is doing an introduction to their system today from 12:00 am to 3 pm 
in 49c2, however I know you will not be back in town until next week.  Vernon 
Mercaldo is coordinating the installation of the system and will be needing 
your input relating to Corporate reporting standards.  As the project 
progresses he will be contacting you.

Attached are drafts of the ETS Policy and Procedures.

Miles--sorry about the hurry up.  Please give me a call on this at 
402-398-7449.  Note the issue raised by the email from Rick Dietz. Thanks.  DF

Attached is the revised version incorporating Julia and Rick's comments.  
Note that to avoid confusion I've labeled the new invoice as the "Prepayment 
Invoice" to distinguish it from the "Normal Invoice" we send out later and 
which we'll use as the true up mechanism.  I've designated the agreement to 
be sent out by fax and FedEx, with two signed originals to be included to 
speed execution by PG&E.  I think Rod is the logical candidate to sign it but 
have left name and title off for now--whoever signs it please add this.  
Please call if there are any questions and please send me a copy of the final 
signed version.  DF  

Rick Dietz
01/26/2001 02:39 PM
Rod, Paul and I spoke and have only two changes. The second one is a more 
significant change to the true up mechanism language in paragraph #4.  Julia 
is in agreement with the changes.

Paragraph 2: after "by wire transfer", add "according to the underlying 
agreements." 

Paragraph 4: We felt this sounded a little complicated and may appear to be a 
deposit.  We would recommend changing the paragraph to read:  "Transwestern's 
invoice applicable to February, 2001 business, which is to be delivered to 
PG&E on or before the 1st of March, 2001, will include a true up of PG&E's 
prepayment for February, 2001.  All subsequent invoices will similarly 
include a true up of PG&E's prepayment for that production month." 

If you have any questions, please give any of us a call.

Rick

I think I beat your deadline for internal distribution, but we need a bit 
more time to make sure this approach will work.  In particular, Julia and 
Rick need to take a quick look at the true up mechanism and  I need to go 
back through it one more time to make sure I haven't forgotten something and 
to clean it up.  I look forward to your comments.  DF 

   

Rod Hayslett

01/26/2001 12:57 PM
I would agree with Paul, unless Drew thinks we can get the agreement out of 
here in the next 30-40 minutes.

   
	
	

 In order to comply with the request we have made to P G  & E of a 12:00  
P.M. CST deadline, Chris Chung of P G & E has advised that our proposal has 
to be submitted to him by Noon today in order to effect a  wire transfer by 
the Monday deadline. Drew is close in the completion of generating the 
Agreement, however, with the internal review and approval process, it is 
doubtful we can achieve the timetable needed by P G  & E. It would be my 
recommendation that we extend the deadline from Monday, January 29 at Noon to 
Tuesday, January 30 at Noon. This would permit our internal review with the 
expectation of sending P G & E our Agreement by Monday morning and allowing 
time for their review. I have spoken to Drew and he is comfortable with this 
approach. Additionally, in my conversation with Chung, I indicated that our 
approach and proposal would be for P G & E to wire transfer the necessary 
funds prior to our providing transportation for February and then payment 
would be expected to be made for the January transportation on the 
appropriate due date in February. (Approximately the tenth )

 Please advise your comments at your earliest conveniece.

 Thanks and Regards.

I think I need to be down there that week anyway--Martha lets try to schedule 
it so I can go to this.  thanks df

In the last several weeks several areas have come up where the TW commercial 
team could, in my opinion, use some clear written guidance on gray areas 
under the tariff ought to be interpreted.  Here is my list.  Please add items 
if I've missed any.

1.  When can TW "selectively market" available capacity?   I.e., if capacity 
is on the board as available, and no one has bought it, are there any limits 
on calling up a customer, or a group of customers, and pitching a deal?  I 
think we have a lot of discretion here--after all, using the telephone to 
talk to one customer is always "selective" since there's only one guy on the 
phone, not all our customers.  Also, can we deliberately leave a customer off 
the list of "the usual suspects" we call to pitch a special deal like an 
index to index deal or a discount?  I've asked Lee to pull together a quick 
analysis of this issue.  

2.  If we get multiple bids for a chunk of capacity outside of the open 
season context, how do we allocate it?  This is the situation we got into a 
couple of weeks ago on the '02 and '03 space.  Are we always required to use 
a lottery?  Do we need to modify the tariff to use pro rata, or can we use 
pro rata simply by notifying the customers in advance?

3.  What approval process applies to max rate contracts and negotiated rate 
contracts?  The ET&S discount approval procedure still applies to TW 
discounted deals (even there is no ET&S anymore).  I think all neg. rate 
deals should be approved by law and regulatory, but I don't need to see max 
rate strd language deals.    
4.  ???  I think there was another issue, but I can't remember what it was.  

Thanks for your input on this.  DF

I guess you wouldn't want to use any of the joint venture entities to issue 
the guarantee because of the complexities of their ownership structures.  You 
also wouldn't want to go outside of ETS because of marketing affiliate 
issues.  By process of elimination, I guess I'm OK with NN issuing the 
guarantee.  In my view, if Mavrix' commercial strategies are unsuccessful and 
Northern has to perform on the guarantee, good luck recovering any of those 
dollars in Northern's next rate case.  Thanks.  DF

Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp., which is a subsidiary of ETS, needs to 
satisfy TW's creditworthiness requirements in order to enter into a 
transportation agreement with TW.  Paul Cherry has suggested that Northern 
Natural Gas issue a guarantee.  Please let me know whether you think this 
would be acceptable.  If Mavrix wanted to hold NNG capacity, TW could issue 
the guarantee.

Pls RSVP "no" if necessary.  Thanks.

MEMORANDUM

TO:???? ??????? Regulatory Policy Commission 
FROM:?? Joan Dreskin 
DATE:?? ??????? January 31, 2001 
RE:???? ??????? Request to intervene and reply to Indicated Shipper and 
Dynegy's Request for Rehearing, Texas Eastern Transmission Corp., Docket No. 
CP95-218-003.

??????? On January 16, Indicated Shippers and Dynegy took rehearing of the 
Texas Eastern order that held that pipelines do not need preapproval from 
FERC to acquire capacity on other pipelines.? Indicated Shippers and Dynegy 
took rehearing on the following grounds: (1) The Commission order is 
procedurally defective in that it repeals a Commission regulation, 18 CFR o 
284.242, without following a notice and comment rulemaking procedures; (2) 
The old Texas Eastern policy has been effective, and has deterred the conduct 
it was intended to preclude; (3) The Commission order ignores crucial "rate 
impacts" associated with off-system capacity acquisition; and (4) The 
Commission's references to the ability of a pipeline acquiring offsystem 
capacity to release that capacity under the acquiring pipeline's tariff are 
unclear.

??????? Although the Commission's regulations do not provide for answers to 
rehearing requests, Dominion and Duke have asked that we intervene and 
respond to Indicated Shippers and Dynegy's request for rehearing in order to 
help the Commission formulate its decision.? As you may remember from INGAA's 
marketing affiliate comments, the Commission's December 14 order has a lot of 
excellent language in it, such as statements that holding offsystem capacity 
does not favor marketing affiliates, that INGAA wants to support.

??????? If Chairman Hebert wishes to keep his promise to do away with tolling 
orders, this rehearing would need to be acted on by Wednesday February 14, 
2001.? Accordingly, if INGAA wishes to be heard it must do so quickly.

??????? Please let me know by COB tomorrow whether you support INGAA 
responding to Indicated Shippers and Dynegy's request for rehearing.? If you 
agree, then I will proceed to get our Board of Directors' approval. 

Gifts do help--preferably large denominations!  

   

Man,

I knew I should have sent more gifts your way last year.

Now I can't even get you to a meeting.

Oh, well.

We will hook up via phone and I talk to you then.

later

We all knew about this concept--its Danny's "Newco" idea.  The only thing 
that is new is they finally decided on a name and got the paperwork for the 
new corporate entity out of the Corporate Secretary's office.  I knew about 
the name a couple weeks ago.  As far as I know, no one has signed off on any 
particular transaction or on a procedure to follow when "Mavrix" starts 
transacting business.  We all better understand at that point that this may 
be a "lose lose" deal--if Mavrix makes a ton of money, everyone will come 
after it (as soon as they find out) and claim we arre playing games with 
confidential information if Mavrix is trading capacity on the Enron pipes.  
If Mavrix loses money, tough cookie--there's no way to plow the losses back 
into some regulated entity.  It is probably now time to have a prayer meeting 
with Danny, Steve, and probably Stan, just to make sure everyone knows what 
we all think about the risks before they charge off and start doing deals.  
DF 

   
	
	

Were you involved?  MK
Susan Scott
01/31/2001 09:42 AM
I thought the officers had discussed this with Danny quite some time ago, as 
the organization of the company was set in motion in early Dec.

Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp. has been organized as a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of ETS for the purpose of transportation capacity management.  The 
officers are the same as the slate of officers of Transwestern.   The company 
will neither buy or sell gas nor use transportation capacity.  However, it 
does plan to enter into natural gas transportation contracts (and resell the 
capacity thru capacity release).  That is why the creditworthiness question 
has come up.
I really don't have any information so send you, unless you want to see the 
organizational documents.  Steve Harris can answer any business-related 
questions you have.  Or, I'll be happy to try to answer any other questions.

   
	
	

Susan, maybe I'm the only one, but I hadn't heard of this new company and 
what it is to be used for until Mondauy's staff meeting.  What details do we 
have on this?  can you send me some info on this?  thanks  MK

Here are some bullet points based on our conversation Friday morning 
regarding the ECS Compression Service Agreement.  These bullet points 
summarize our position and are intended to be a starting point for a 
conversation between persons at TW and at ECS (who are yet to be determined) 
regarding the additional power costs incurred by Transwestern as a result of 
the lack of a system for monitoring peak loads on CDEC.  If you have 
additional comments, please let me know.  

We still need to decide who is going to call whom; I am going to leave that 
up to you, but do let me know if I can help. 

-  ECS is under an obligation to work in good faith with CDEC to establish a 
monitoring system that would automatically 
alert TW to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.  

-  Rate No. 21 became effective in July 2000.  ECS did not obtain permission 
for TW to access the "Members Only" portion of CDEC's website (which contains 
load data) until January 2001.  Access to the information required a 
confidentiality agreement, which was executed in December.

-  ECS blames the delay on Tri-State/CDEC, who allegedly would not work on 
the confidentiality agreement until the merger was completed.   "Good faith" 
by ECS would reasonably include alerting TW to any such delay or any 
difficulty in getting access to CDEC's information.  TW was never contacted 
in this regard.  

-  Since Rate No. 21 contains a rebate for customers that avoid peak load 
times, we assume that CDEC is under an obligation to provide such customers 
with access to peak load information (I have not been able to verify this, 
but it makes sense).  If this is true, we should have been able to have 
access immediately upon the effectiveness of Rate No. 21.

-  Most if not all of the $325,000 peak load costs incurred by TW since July 
could have been avoided had TW had access to a monitoring system.  Because it 
did not alert TW to difficulties/delay in getting the necessary information 
from CDEC, ECS did not act in good faith in obtaining such access and should 
therefore take responsibility for its share of the consequences.

-  ECS needs to act without further delay to build an automated monitoring 
system to eliminate the need for someone to continuously monitor the 
website.  An estimated completion date should be provided.

I've left messages at CDEC to ask about access to the Members Only part of 
the website; I'll follow up.  The website states only that access is granted 
"on a case-by-case basis."  I hope to make contact on Monday and will let you 
know what I'm able to learn from them.

I've deferred the negotiation with Mark Knippa given my need for some 
information from James and Kevin on our ability to avoid peak usage, etc.  
Steve Harris and I talked this morning about settlement authority and our 
going in position, obviously, is that ECS should pick up the whole $300+ K.  
I expect that Knippa will angle toward a split the difference approach and 
then try to put his share of the value on some future deal.  To counter 
that,  I think I'll need to hit him pretty firmly on the "relationship 
issue."  I.e., he's got to fix this problem or his chance of doing more deals 
with the pipeline group will be seriously hurt.  That should be a big deal to 
him and may get us the resolution we need.  To push that I need three things 
from you:
1.  Rod, have we already communicated to ECS, or at a higher level like 
Redmond, that we won't do any more deals with them?  Obviously if we have 
already told them we're done working with them, my threat won't carry much 
weight.
2.  Are you all OK with the threat?  I suspect that our threat to quit doing 
business with them will go immediately up their chain of command and that 
Redmond or someone will call Stan to complain.  
3.  Can we agree conceptually to do future deals if Knippa needs a bucket to 
put our dollars in?  He may propose something specific and I'd like to be 
able to agree that we will "work with them" on future deals.  

Thanks.  DF   

The Mineral Leasing Act may be the statute that governs--at least I'm 
familiar with it as the statute governing the MMS onshore oil and gas royalty 
program.  There are also statutes that cover hard rock mining rights and 
surface (i.e., grazing) rights.  I'm not sure which one is the basis for 
Greg's theories.   What you guys need is a real dirt lawyer.  Don't we have 
any ex-EOG lawyers around?  There aren't any in ETS that I'm aware of that 
know this stuff.  As to the RFP process, I have even less of an idea.  I hear 
you on your instinct to give him the answer, but one of my goals is to hear 
what MMS thinks its legal basis is for going after storage and forming my own 
view of whether they are right or just blowing smoke.  DF

   

I am doing some research on statutory authority to try to understand where 
the 12.5% comes from.

Drew,

Any thoughts on where I might go to find out more about the MMS RFP process 
because , if we understand it, we may be able to find a loophole.

I figure if we tell Greg what the answer is, he may be willing to accept it 
as opposed to us asking him to find the answer and relying on his 
interpretation

I feel awful about that--particularly since PGT did the same thing!  df

FYI. You should be ashamed asking PG&E to pay us up front for demand charges. 
Apparently, California feels we are "predators"!  
CPUC Votes to Keep Gas Flowing
A special session yesterday of California's regulators gave PG&E's utility 
authority to amend its gas supply deals to keep supplies flowing to the state 
past Feb. 7 when the current federal DOE emergency order expires, but it 
postponed action on another PG&E request that Southern California Gas Co. --- 
which has strongly objected --- be compelled to provide emergency supplies to 
the PG&E utility's residential and small business customers. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission, said 
PG&E's utility is a "victim --- a victim of circumstances and a victim of 
predatory practices by natural gas suppliers," now demanding payment for 
future supplies up front --- not because the utility has failed to pay its 
past gas bills, but because the electricity crisis has sapped its 
credit-worthiness. 
The CPUC action allows PG&E's utility to offer suppliers the option of 
securitization or, in effect, a lien, in the utility's retail customers' 
bills which cover the full cost of the wholesale gas prices as an incentive 
to have the suppliers extend contracts with PG&E's gas utility operations 
while the credit-worthiness of the company itself is dubious. It won't be 
until next week when the utility begins negotiating new contracts, that it 
will know if the CPUC action will overcome the suppliers reluctance to extend 
contracts in the current situation, according to PG&E gas utility 
spokesperson Staci Homrig. 
On the operational side, PG&E on Wednesday declared a low-inventory OFO 
because of a cold snap causing more supplies to be burned then pipeline 
shippers were bringing into the system. The action was thought to help cause 
the PG&E citygate price to jump from $11 to $17 on Wednesday. As for reports 
of low storage, Homrig said that while the utility's supplies are very low, 
they are adequate for the next week. They are not dipping into cushion or 
base gas at this point, Homrig said. 
Lynch said that PG&E has not defaulted on any payments, but nevertheless, in 
what she considers predatory practices, the suppliers have required advance 
payments or payment at the time supplies are provided. "These gas suppliers 
are taking advantage of an emergency situation to extract another pound of 
flesh," Lynch said in voting for the securitization measure. "Suppliers who 
have been paid when due, are now saying regardless of existing agreements 
'pay us today.' They are doing this in the coldest time of the year, so the 
commissioners have to take these difficult steps to allow PG&E amend these 
agreements in order to keep the gas flowing." 
Part of the CPUC's action places a 90-day limit on the securitization option, 
so with the way gas contracts work, in effect, it only provides about another 
30 days' worth of supplies, said Homrig, who noted that almost all of PG&E's 
25 to 30 suppliers have asked for special payment arrangements (advances, 
cash-on-delivery or letters of credit) that the company cannot accommodate 
because of its cash-flow crisis.~ Out of ongoing negotiations, the parties 
came up with the securitization proposal in the customer account receivables, 
thus, assuring them they will get paid. 
On the gas side, PG&E has had sufficient revenues --- unlike its electric 
business --- but the suppliers have not wanted to let the utility stick to a 
normal payment arrangement because of the severe credit-rating decline in the 
past weeks. 
The CPUC met in San Francisco late Wednesday afternoon in the midst of a 
whirlwind day of public announcements from the governor, state legislature, 
consumer groups, regulators and utilities. A key piece was missing, however. 
California state legislative leaders called off a morning briefing that was 
to have offered the latest legislative proposals for dealing with the energy 
crisis. Reportedly sticking points remain centered on the key questions of 
who pays for the solutions and how deeply the state gets into the energy 
business. A spokesman for the assembly speaker's office said he had no idea 
when the briefing would be re-scheduled. 
One piece of legislation that got through the state Senate (SB 1X) yesterday 
authorizes another $500 million in emergency funds to purchase power. It also 
would allow the state water resources department to be the utilities' 
wholesale power supplier under long-term contracts at least through 2002. The 
measure drew a protest from CPUC Commissioner Richard Bilas, who argued that 
the state agency be "removed from that role as quickly as possible." The 
bill, which was first passed by the state Assembly, was returned to assembly 
committees last night to iron out changes made in the senate. It then would 
have to be ratified again by the Assembly. 
Meanwhile, consumer activists held rallies around the state protesting the 
state bail-out of the private-sector utilities. This prompted at least one of 
the utilities, Southern California Edison, to come out swinging, saying that 
the recently released results of utility financial audits do not show any 
"windfall profits" or diversion of monies from the utilities to the parent 
company. 
A letter surfaced in Washington from Gov. Gray Davis to the Senate Energy and 
Natural Resources Committee, dated Jan. 30 and outlining measures the state 
is taking to increase energy supply and decrease demand, sign long-term 
contracts and maintain the financial viability of the state's public 
utilities. The letter, a catalogue of recent initiatives already reported 
here, contained no specifics on any long-term contracts nor legislation 
signed that would address the immediate problem. Davis outlined measures 
being taken to speed up siting of new power plants, saying an additional 
2,000 MW would be online by the end of the year. 
Responding to questions on another arena, Edison International's senior vice 
president Tom Higgins said "everything is on the table" in the ongoing 
negotiations between Davis' three-person negotiating team and the two 
utilities, including dropping the pending lawsuit in federal court in Los 
Angeles and crediting excess revenues from the utilities' own generation 
against the whopping wholesale power cost under-collections. 
The state remained under a power watch for the 16th day as the California 
independent grid operator (Cal-ISO) urged conservation because "reserves 
remain very low."

David Port, ETS is purchasing a trading system from Caminus to track their 
transactions.  Included in this system are position reports which the 
Accounting Department will be using to report and determine compliance with 
the attached policy and procedures, including open positions, VAR, MTM, 
approval limits, Greeks, credit risk, stress testing, basis positions, 
confirmations and invoicing.  The ETS Risk Management policy requires that 
our reporting conform to the corporate standards, accordingly your name was 
given to me as the person who could help direct some of the more technical 
reporting standards.

Caminus is doing an introduction to their system today from 12:00 am to 3 pm 
in 49c2, however I know you will not be back in town until next week.  Vernon 
Mercaldo is coordinating the installation of the system and will be needing 
your input relating to Corporate reporting standards.  As the project 
progresses he will be contacting you.

Attached are drafts of the ETS Policy and Procedures.

Who is the exact corporate parent of Mavrix?  I think I saw an email that 
said ETS, but I don't think ETS is a corporate entity.  Is it Enron Pipeline 
Company?  Please let Bob and me know.  Thanks.  df 

Its my understanding that the plan is to have it be a sub of EPC (or whatever 
the name of the parent of TW and NN  is these days).  I thought it had been 
moved already, but apparently not.  Susan, whats the status?  df

It's currently a sub of Transwestern Pipeline Company.   Is this the best 
positioning for legal/regulatory purposes?  I liked your idea, Drew, of 
having it be a sub of Enron Pipeline Company.

If it's a sub of TW, it'll get disclosed in the TW Form 2.  I don't know 
whether that's a concern for you.

ON further reflection, if Mavrix is to be a wholly owned sub of Enron 
Pipeline Company (or whatever the current name is of the top-tier ETS entity) 
then that entity ought to issue the guaranty.  Mavrix intends to buy capacity 
from TW and possibly NN.  It would be innappropriate to have TW issue the 
guaranty if TWs guaranty would likely operate in favor of TW.  Same for NN.  
DF  

Rod Hayslett

01/31/2001 01:16 PM
The consideration isn't the point, its the fact that a creditworthy party, 
Enron for instance, has guaranteed the business and in fact they are 
creditworthy.    Therefore we haven't given Mavrix a special deal compared to 
other shippers, since they are now by way of the guarantee creditworthy.    
As I told you on the phone, Enron will do this for others as well, it's just 
not cheap, it's like dealing with the guys in the pool hall!

Jerry Peters
01/31/2001 12:56 PM
What is the objective of having Mavrix pay its parent/affliate (ETS) a 
guarantee fee?   Will this prove that granting credit was 
non-discriminatory?  I would argue no, since we don't look at the 
consideration paid for guarantees of other companies.  The fact that a 
credit-worthy party has issued a guarantee should be enough.  Legally, Mavix 
is a separate company.  Parent companies frequently guarantee obligations of 
subsidiaries without any direct consideration (other than enabling their 
subsidiary to transact business).

Rod Hayslett

01/31/2001 07:56 AM
I didn't necessarily mean that we would pay a third party, just someone else 
at Enron.

   
	
	

I agree with Rod.  By having it done by an outside party seems to make more 
sense from an external view.   MK 

Rod Hayslett

01/31/2001 06:40 AM
First, Mavrix is a subsidiary of what company?     I don't believe I have 
seen that anywhere, but had heard that it was TW.   If it is not a subsidiary 
of NNG why would NNG issue a guaranty for Mavrix?     I can have the 
guarantee priced and then Mavrix can pay to have someone guarantee it's 
positions.     This is not rocket science, but I believe we need to make an 
effort to keep things looking like they are at arms length and that this is a 
separate company.     If you all agree, let me know and I can have someone 
get with Steve Harris and get the guaranty priced.

For Jerry and John:   Let me know but I think we can get this priced down 
here inside the day.     Let me know how you want to proceed. 
 

Drew Fossum
01/30/2001 06:01 PM
I guess you wouldn't want to use any of the joint venture entities to issue 
the guarantee because of the complexities of their ownership structures.  You 
also wouldn't want to go outside of ETS because of marketing affiliate 
issues.  By process of elimination, I guess I'm OK with NN issuing the 
guarantee.  In my view, if Mavrix' commercial strategies are unsuccessful and 
Northern has to perform on the guarantee, good luck recovering any of those 
dollars in Northern's next rate case.  Thanks.  DF

Susan Scott
01/30/2001 02:27 PM
Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp., which is a subsidiary of ETS, needs to 
satisfy TW's creditworthiness requirements in order to enter into a 
transportation agreement with TW.  Paul Cherry has suggested that Northern 
Natural Gas issue a guarantee.  Please let me know whether you think this 
would be acceptable.  If Mavrix wanted to hold NNG capacity, TW could issue 
the guarantee.

I don't see any serious problems with this.  There are a few things you two 
need to verify or get comfortable with:  bullet 6 says PG&E has made all 
payments in a timely manner.  You can leave it in if its true, but the bullet 
needs to be mutual, not one-way, and I'd suggest replacing it with: 
"Transwestern and PG&E agree that, by entering into this agreement, neither 
is to be deemed to have made any admission against interest."  Also, the 
mechanism in bullet 9 is up to you, Paul.  We should probably list the rating 
service by name to avoid ambiguity.  There are also a couple of minor 
things:  in bullet 2, add an "s" to "contract" inline 2; in bullet 7, add 
"the" at the end of line 1.  Call if you have questions.  DF

If the condition in OneOk's release tied to KN's settlement is "simply 
unacceptable" to ONeOk, then there is no deal unless we simultaneously 
receive the $$ from KN and OneOk and simultaneously sign the agreements.  We 
will need to set up a closing type of event (not necessarily in one city, 
over the phone and fax is ok) and hold each other hostage until all the paper 
is signed and wire transfers received.  Just in case she's curious, my 
position is we don't sign the release until the wire transfer is in our 
bank.  They can take the risk of the deal falling apart at the last minute--I 
don't think we should.  DF

required changes, deletions and/or additions to the Settlement Agreement.
Mostly minor clarifications with the exception of Paragraph 2 (b), which is
simply unacceptable. KNGG will not agree to make it's settlement with NNG
conditional upon actions NNG requires from Oneok, which as you know, are
beyond KNGG's control.

                          If the revisions set forth within the attachment
are acceptable to NNG, please so advise. I will be happy to initiate a wire
transfer tomorrow if we can, at a minimum, exchange fax copies of the
Settlement Agreement.

Good thinking and good hustle on your part Craig, as usual.  Do we know what 
the system problems were and if they were on their end or ours?  I agree that 
timetable issues in general and the approval process for Demarc deals, in 
particular, need to be reviewed when we get together on contract process 
issues.    

   
	
	

This is a long story...

Oneok requested a deal for Feb. 3-28, 10,000/d from MidCon Pool to Demarc @ 
$.03/d Demand + Min. Commodity (Standard Language terms plus all Field Area 
points available as alternates at the discounted rate).  Originally, this 
deal was going to be entered into via EOL.  I input the deal's terms into CMS 
(contract system) under this assumption.  Oneok was a first-time EOL 
participant and they had system problems when attempting to accept the EOL 
posting.  With the "on-time" nom deadline fast approaching, I decided to 
switch the deal over to a standard TFX agreement.  Since EOL deals are 
"pre-approved,"  the deal had already been  manually routed (at my request) 
so it could be activated per our standard EOL process.  This deal was 
required to route due to the Demarc DP (all other terms were standard and 
within the Marketer's approval level).  At the point I decided to switch the 
deal over to a TFX deal from an EOL deal, it was impossible to re-route for 
approval .  I advised Danny and Drew of the change and they signed off on the 
CAF form.  I then called Ranelle and advised her of the switch from EOL to 
TFX but she was not given time to review the agreement.  The deal was then 
faxed to the Shipper, signed, returned, activated and nominated prior to 
11:30am.  The deal got done but not within our standard procedures.   The 
window between a deal being struck and on time noms (a factor in the deal's 
value) is constantly shrinking, leaving no room for error.   Hopefully the 
Contract Process meeting scheduled for next week will address some of these 
issues.  If anyone has additional questions, I'll try and answer them.

There was an EOL deal this morning for Oneok Field Services, req 39940, for 
10,000; Midcontinent Pool to Demarc that because of demarc, requires 
approvals through President level.

Due to the nature of the EOL deals, I routed the request then approved on 
your behalf immediately thereafter.

Please disregard your email notice to approve request 39940.  Should you have 
further questions, please advise.

Great.  The footnote issue scares me.   If we just use the same footnotes as 
a matter of convenience, we may have some flexibility.  DF

   
	
	

Per Tim's discussion with Chandler, they do not attach the brown cover, but 
the footnotes used in the brown cover match the footnotes used in the Form 
2.  therein lies the potential problem.  
He also asked for the list of who receives the Borwn cover, Chandler has to 
get from Treasury, which he said they don't like to do.  I told TIm  to 
pursue in the regard it is needed for Conoco litiagation.

Hey Drew,
 
Sorry that we did not get to meet last week when you were in town.  I have 
pulled up some information on the project performance and wanted to share 
with the group.  I was very concerned by the comment that the project was on 
a rate to cost TW an additional $1.0 million for the year because the demand 
avoidance program was not in place.  I do want to confirm that Arnold 
Eisenstein at ET&S working on the development of the programming to support 
TW's efforts to minimize demand expenses.  It was my understanding during the 
development of this project, that TW was targeting a 75% avoidance for an 
annual basis.   I offer the following details regarding the actual operation 
of the station in 2000. 

Peak load for 12,000 hp = 9,621 kw x 3 = 28,864.0 kw per Quarter

Actual Utilization
   3rd Quarter 2000      % of Max  4th Quarter 2000  % of Max
 kw - generation   22,684.8      78.6   17,779       61.6
 kw - transmission 25,421.0      88.1   22,992       79.6
 
 Target $'s @ 75% 99,142      75.0            73,480      75.0
 Net Actual Rebate  $'s 75,935        78.6                105,181        61.59
  difference            ($23,206)                  $31,702   

Overall net for 2000 under Rate 21 appears to reflect that TW has saved 
$8,496 above their target rebate of $170,622 (75% avoidance) for the 3rd and 
4th quarters.  In addition, ECS has made payment to TW under Rate 19 that 
resulted in an additional $118,441 paid to TW.   Note that ECS has proposed 
to included the transmission demand in the Rebate process which is not 
specifically addressed the Compression Service Agreement.  

Currently TW has access to the web site that graphically displays the current 
Tri-State generation load as well as several years of month by month 
history.  This access was conveyed to TW as soon as the confidentiality 
agreement between TW, ECS and Tri-State was executed and delivered to ECS.  
At this point, EE&CC (now under ET&S) was notified that the system access was 
available to package the load monitoring programming.  As I mentioned above, 
that effort is underway.  

I will be glad to meet and/or discuss these issues when you are available.  I 
will be travelling most of the next (2) weeks but you can reach me via email 
or my
cell phone (713) 851-7703.   Based on the information that I was able to pull 
together, I just don't see the magnitude of dollars that seems to have TW 
concerned.
I would like to discuss at your earliest convenience.

Thanks,

that effort is underway.  

I will be glad to meet and/or discuss these issues when you are available.  I 
will be travelling most of the next (2) weeks but you can reach me via email 
or my
cell phone (713) 851-7703.   Based on the information that I was able to pull 
together, I just don't see the magnitude of dollars that seems to have TW 
concerned.
I would like to discuss at your earliest convenience.

Thanks,

Enron Transportation Services and Mary Kay Miller cordially invite you and a 
guest to attend the 12th Annual Mount Michael Night of Knights on April 7, 
2001.

2001 Mount Michael Night of Knights - "Twelfth Knight"
Saturday, April 7, 2001
Armory Reception, Social Hour and Silent Auction  5:30 PM-7:30 PM
Dinner and Live Auction  7:30 PM
Mount Michael Benedictine School
22520 Mount Michael Road
Elkhorn, NE  68022

Please RSVP to Julie McCoy by Monday, February 26.

pls talk to Norma and find out what we need to do.  I''ll let the group 
know.  df
	
	

I will need to have any exception requests for vacation carry over (beyond 40 
hours) no later than February 15.  Any request you submit should have 
appropriate justification (i.e., what were the extenuating circumstances that 
prevented the employee from being able to take his/her vacation during the 
year).  Since carry-over reports can no longer be run by Payroll, timekeepers 
should be able to access year-end  vacation balances.  If you have any 
questions, please let me know.

Would we be better off letting the trade associations fight this one out?  I 
haven't read the pleading yet, but from your description, I wouldn't be 
surprised if all of them oppose it--AGA included.  DF  

The National Association of Gas Consumers (an association of municipal gas 
systems) has filed a complaint against all sellers of natural gas in the US 
to re-impose wholesale prices caps.  They are seeking a benchmark (soft cap) 
of $2.74/MMBtu.

The benchmark figure is based on an average gas forecast from a recent 
National Petroleum Council study.  (Ken Lay is a member of the NPC).

The procedural rules are a bit fuzzy.  Ordinarily, respondents have 20 days 
to answer a complaint.   However, FERC rules provide for service on 
respondents.  Here NAGC has not named specific respondents.  

I've just been invited to a couple of meetings on Friday PM--the kind of 
meetings where the word "invited" is used humorously.  I think I'm still 
clear after 4:00 pm Omaha time so could be dialed in after then if it would 
be useful.  Sorry to be such a pain inthe ass but getting fired would be a 
real inconvenience right now so I'd better post at these meetings.  I'll have 
Martha coordinate with you guys.  

OK.  DF

Attached are three (3) Agreements for your review and approval.  If approved, 
please so indicate by replying to this email.

1. USGT (Amendment #6), extending term of 400,000 MMBtu/d, East - East to 
03/31/01 with new pricing provisions.
2. USGT (Amendment #7), amends pricing for alternate flows during existing 
contract term from $0.04 to $0.15/MMBtu.
2. Astra Power LLC, new contract for 50,000 MMBtu/d, East - East capacity 
from 03/01/01 to 03/31/03.

USGT Amendment #6 has received both credit and capacity approval.
USGT Amendment #7 requires no capacity approval.  Credit will be notified of 
change in rates.
Astra has received capacity approval, and is awaiting parental guarantee 
letter in order to clear credit.

Just summarize the proposal again (briefly) and indicate the changes we 
agreed to make based on the technical conference and how we believe the 
initial filing, as modified to resolve the reasonable concerns raised by 
parties, ought to be approved.  I'd also add a short recount on the conoco 
and I. Shippers issues and indicate that vague, industry wide market 
affiliate issues are not appropriate in this docket and that the fact that 
some (not even all) producers have paranoid competitive concerns should not 
preclude shippers who would really benefit form these products from gaining 
access to them (i.e, summarize CalPine's very helpful comments).  df 

Susan Scott
02/08/2001 10:07 AM
I understand that the decision is that we will file brief initial comments in 
this proceeding.
I'm happy to take a stab at a first draft, but am not sure where to begin.
If you could list some specific points you think we ought to make, that would 
be helpful.  Thanks.

Rich - Is this really worth the hassle? All the upside is on the side of EES, 
all the downside (work) appears to be on our side. It would appear to me that 
EES could rent an office in some executive office space provider .....but 
maybe I don't have my Enron hat on.

   
	
	

If the cost savings are worth a little bit of hassle, we can do this.  We'll 
need to make a FERC filing by the end of the 1st Q 2000 to identify the 
"shared facilities."  Also, if you decide to go forward, don't do it until 
1-1-2000 so we don't have to scramble to get the info in front of FERC this 
quarter.  Let me and Maria know what you decide to do and we'll arrange a 
briefing on the specific rules to be aware of and we'll make sure we 
understand the situation fully so we can properly disclose to FERC what is 
up.  Please call with any questions. Thanks.  DF   

Rich Jolly on 12/15/99 06:38:43 PM
Drew are we OK to go with this? We don't have any "confidential 
transportation-related information in our office. We do have some operating 
agreements and contracts but they aren't confidential that I know of.  
Rich

Drew Fossum
12/08/99 05:18 PM

EES is a marketing affiliate, so we do need to be careful about shared 
computer systems, phone systems, staplers, paper clips, etc.  If Rich and his 
office have no "confidential transportation-related information"  we might be 
able to do it, otherwise, the hassles and expense of building marketing 
affiliate firewalls might make it counterproductive.   I'm forwarding this to 
the experts for a quick yup or nope on this.  Thanks. DF  

Michel Nelson
12/08/99 05:24 PM
Rich - Per your phone mail, I see no reason why an EES employee couldn't 
office in your Region Office, providing he/she pays rent and we not break any 
market affiliate rules (if they apply here).

Drew - Saving $ for Enron. Any issues I'm overlooking?

I just talked to Frank about my revised draft of the rehearing request.  
Susan, you will be pleased to learn that he has successfully talked me out of 
starting world war 3 with the FERC.  I've asked Frank (and Steve) to massage 
the draft to avoid a frontal challenge to FERC's disclosure policies and then 
to work with you to get it finalized. The plan is to carve out a limited 
exception to the normal disclosure rules given that the Gallup case is over 
and there is  no pressing need for disclosure in advance of the normal 
discount report filing.  Thanks.  DF   

More specifically, this is the ECS Gallup mtg--Kevin, will we have answers on 
our peak avoidance by then?  Thanks. DF

The Gallup meeting will be held on Monday, February 12 at 4:00 pm in 
conference room EB4701.

Three to-dos on our Mavrix meeting:
1.  Follow up and make sure the officers get set up correctly.
2.  Talk to Perry Frazier in planning--he is keeping copies of the actual EBB 
postings showing that we have had the Ignacio-Thoreau piece of capacity 
posted (the 33,000/d).  I'd like you to keep copies of those postings in your 
file until Mavrix actually buys that capacity.  If we end up in a fight at 
some time, we'll be able to prove the postings were out there, because the 
actual postings are not electronically archived, I am told.
3. All Mavrix deals will need initials from legal--probably you, Susan.  For 
now, please let me know of any deals Mavrix does with non-Enron pipes.  For 
Enron pipes, of course, contract approval will be via our ordinary procedures 
and MKM's group and I should be advised as a matter of course.

Susan Scott
02/09/2001 02:42 PM
Maria and Drew:  Lee and I wanted you to preview our draft before we submit 
it to a wider audience.

Some comments:  I've not yet included the automatic open season similar to 
NNG's; I need more information on why NNG does it that way before I try to 
sell our marketers on the idea, and I've e-mailed MKM about it.  Also, we did 
not include a minimum time frame for response to bid solicitation because 
thought it unnecessarily limiting.  

Would like you to take just a few minutes to give us your initial comments 
and also your opinion on how best to circulate this (i.e. to MK's group 
first, then to marketing?).  

Many thanks.

pls print for me on Monday--thanks.  df
 I haven't done additional research, but off the top of my head here's what I 
think.

1.  Open season giving all parties an equal shot to capacity is better than 
selective marketing.  However, once capacity is posted, a shipper is free to 
inquire about it and we should be free to solicit interest by picking up the 
phone.  I can research whether any pipeline got its hand slapped for 
selective marketing.

2.  I thought we had agreed that we need a separate provision that governs 
the allocation of capacity on TW's system apart from ROFR.  In the rewrite, 
we should add language that allows us to use any non-discriminatory 
allocation methodology as long as we give shippers advance notice by posting 
the methodology on our website.  Until then, Section 13 of the FTS-1 Rate 
Schedule is the only guidance we have.  "All available capacity shall be 
allocated under these procedures..."  The lottery only comes into play if 
there are two bids of equal value.  I think we could use pro-rata as an 
allocation methodology if we notified all parties on the website ahead of 
time.  

3.  I agree with you on the approval process for negotiated rates and no or 
limited approval for standard language max-rate deals.  Maria.     
In the last several weeks several areas have come up where the TW commercial 
team could, in my opinion, use some clear written guidance on gray areas 
under the tariff ought to be interpreted.  Here is my list.  Please add items 
if I've missed any.

1.  When can TW "selectively market" available capacity?   I.e., if capacity 
is on the board as available, and no one has bought it, are there any limits 
on calling up a customer, or a group of customers, and pitching a deal?  I 
think we have a lot of discretion here--after all, using the telephone to 
talk to one customer is always "selective" since there's only one guy on the 
phone, not all our customers.  Also, can we deliberately leave a customer off 
the list of "the usual suspects" we call to pitch a special deal like an 
index to index deal or a discount?  I've asked Lee to pull together a quick 
analysis of this issue.  

2.  If we get multiple bids for a chunk of capacity outside of the open 
season context, how do we allocate it?  This is the situation we got into a 
couple of weeks ago on the '02 and '03 space.  Are we always required to use 
a lottery?  Do we need to modify the tariff to use pro rata, or can we use 
pro rata simply by notifying the customers in advance?

3.  What approval process applies to max rate contracts and negotiated rate 
contracts?  The ET&S discount approval procedure still applies to TW 
discounted deals (even there is no ET&S anymore).  I think all neg. rate 
deals should be approved by law and regulatory, but I don't need to see max 
rate strd language deals.    
4.  ???  I think there was another issue, but I can't remember what it was.  

Thanks for your input on this.  DF

lets talk in am--did we pay SET to forgo their option on the Gallup 
space????? ON the "gross margin" spreads mentioned in 3, do we hedge the fuel 
componenet or is that the customer's problem?  Pls print this page for me as 
I can't.   DF

Attached for your review and approval are three (3) Agreements:

1.  New contract with Sempra Energy Trading for 35,000 MMBtu/d, SJ Blanco to 
SoCal Needles, 2 years, Jan. '04 thru Dec. '05, at a Negotiate Rate of 
$0.50/MMBtu, plus applicable fuel.  Sempra replaces Dynegy who holds this 
capacity under an Index-Index deal for cal. '03.

2.  Amendment to Sempra Energy Trading, Sempra waives option to increase 
MAXDTQ under existing Gallup contract from Jan. 1, '04 thru Apr. 30, '05 
(contract termination date, no ROFR rights).

3.  Amendment to existing Calpine contract, extends term for two (2) years, 
Jan. '04 thru Dec. '05 on existing Index-Index deal for cal. '03.   Path is 
SJ Blanco to Calpine South Point del. at Cal. border. 

Agreements (nos. 1, 3) are in credit and capacity approval.

Expedited approval of the Calpine contract is requested as it is an Index - 
Index transport that will [likely] be hedged immediately upon ETS mgmnt. 
approval and Calpine execution.  Currently, spread swaps would result in 
$0.85/MMBtu gross margin for '05, and $0.77/MMBtu for '04.

No, but MKM apparently thought this issue did impact the idea of uniformity 
of approach among the pipelines, which is Shelley's turf.  df

Susan Scott
02/12/2001 01:24 PM
Drew, do I now have to run all tariff filings by Shelley too?
I am not complaining, because she always has good input, but I don't want to 
be in a TW Options situation ever again.  Please advise.

Susan,  can you get Shelley a copy of my comments sent down today?  thanks

Susan Scott
02/08/2001 01:45 PM
Here is a slightly revised version of a tariff filing to allow TW to allocate 
alternate firm by price.
I know everyone has been busy, but please try to get comments to me next 
week.  Thanks.

Susan Scott
01/31/2001 04:03 PM
Please see the attached.  As you can see, there are a couple of issues we 
probably need to discuss.  Please let me know your comments and questions.  

(We do not have a target filing date yet; after we reach a consensus on what 
this is going to look like, how rates will be calculated, etc., Ramona will 
be better able to determine how much time will be needed to make the 
necessary system changes.)

Has the old adversary adopted an "if you can't beat em, join em" strategy?  I 
noticed that CNG is planning to build some high deliverability storage.  More 
competition is always a problem, but at least that is a vindication of the 
MHP strategy.  I noticed Vaina was quoted in the trade press.  Is he the man 
on Tioga now?  DF     

I need you guys to look at this quick and give me advice.  df 
	
	

***  EOL ROUTING ***

Please send your approval by return email, to Craig Buehler, for the EOL 
packages listed on
the attached spreadsheet.  Each of the packages (22 in total) shows the path, 
sustainable capacity
and proposed rate for each product.  The rates are estimated to provide a 
measure for the dollar
amount of the discount (per our current discount policy).  These 22 products 
are the initial deals
being offered; subsequent packages will be routed as they are developed.  
Please call Craig, at
713-853-6964, if you have questions.  After approval by Legal, Reg Affairs 
and Marketing, the
approvals and/or comments will be forwarded to Danny McCarty for review.

I am OK on selling these packages on EOL.  This approval is based on my 
understanding that all of this capacity is currently posted, or, if not 
currently posted, will be posted for the appropriate amount of time prior to 
sale.  Additionally, this approval is contingent on use of the webtext we 
have been using for other EOL deals (I feel the need to say the obvious 
because I don't believe Law will see anything on these packages again).  I 
also assume that these will be short term deals--i.e., less than one year.  
Any long term discounted deals raise concerns that our "standard discount 
language" is designed to address, such as what is the effect of a new rate 
design or reduction in the max rate on the discounted deal.  I think we can 
live without that language in short term deals for now, but we need to 
revisit this issue and come up with a solution before we sell any long term 
deals on EOL.  ONe last thing, it is marketing's decision whether to include 
in the webtext the provision that says Northern gets the $$ if the shipper 
releases the capacity at a rate higher than the discounted rate.  I think our 
approach in negotiated deals has been to get that agreement if we could (a 
basis run up could make it a very valuable right).  If you have any 
questions, call me.  DF

Attached below is my approval of a bunch of capacity packages for sale on 
EOL.  As you can see, I think there is an important issue of contract 
language that we need to resolve at some point if we are going to get maximum 
mileage out of EOL.  Please let me know what you think we ought to do about 
this--in my view, if we are going to sell long term capacity on a discounted 
basis, we ought to keep using the language we have historically used on what 
happens if our max rates are reduced and what happens if our rate design is 
modified.  As to the old confidentiality paragraph and some of the other 
stuff, I'm not sure it is worth keeping and running the risk of FERC finding 
that we have overreached (i.e., the paragraph saying a customer can't ever 
challenge our discount adjustment).   Lets talk.  df

There were several questions left for legal/regulatory to work on at the 
close of our meeting today.  I'll try to restate them, and add my initial 
thoughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems.  

Q 1. Can TW use "negotiated rate" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion?  

A.  Yes.  Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were 
certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.  The only restriction 
is that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an 
alternative to negotiated rates.  We hope to use negotiated rate agreements 
for the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won't know until the contracts are 
executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it 
will be under recourse rate contracts.  I guess that means that in the cert. 
app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that given 
the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our ability to 
sell the full 150.  We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the 
capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a 
combination of both.  

Q 2.  Can we give prospective customers a "cafeteria style" menu of options 
(to steal Jeff's term), like the following:
 1.  5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (or 
whatever number we decide on)
 2.  10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges
 3.  15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah
 4 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantly 
this option is not locked in and will float with TW's actual rate levels and 
fuel retainage percentages)

A.  I think the answer here is "yes."  Whatever options we come up with for 
1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve 
Stojic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated 
rate options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach 
could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking 
our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a 
7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I'm not sure that would be 
a bad thing, but we need to think about it.  We need to be sure we can tell a 
customer "no" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for 
the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out options 
of our choosing and then enforce a "no substitutions" policy (this is 
sticking with the "cafeteria" theme) but we need to be sure.  

Q.3.  If we can use the "cafeteria options" approach, how much flexibility do 
we have in structuring the options?  

A:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose 
to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don't want to 
be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 at 
$.58 instead of $.60.  Susan and Steve: if you guys confirm that we have 
discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options, does that mean we 
can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better 
deal than the recourse option (for most shippers)?  I.e., could we 
deliberately  incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals--i.e., by 
offering options 1-3 at $.55, $.45 and $.40 instead of the $.60, $.45, and 
$.35 shown above.  I suspect that is what Guardian and the other pipes did to 
obtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.            

Q.4.  How do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply???

A.  Ideally, we'd be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy it 
the way we'd prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan, 
Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d 
of offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That's 400 
mm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who want 
option 1 ($.60/5 yrs) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr/$.45 guys?  That 
really hoses the recourse bidders.  Do we have to cover the recourse demand 
first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else?  
Pro rata to everyone?  Under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be 
deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation, pro rata to everyone may 
be the right answer.  Or at least its the answer until we've filled the 
recourse rate guys' orders, then we can give the remaining capacity to the 
neg. rate guys whose bids we value most highly (using some objective 
nondiscriminatory calculation of course).   Ugh. 

Susan and Steve--please take a crack at questions 2-4.  I think 1 is answered 
already.  I haven't done any research yet, so maybe these questions are 
easier than they currently seem to me.  Get me and MKM on the phone at your 
convenience to discuss.  We've gotta move quick so the marketers can get out 
and sell this stuff.  DF

Steven Harris
02/15/2001 08:49 AM
Drew, I think your last question is the one most critical to us at this 
point. The marketers can go out and start selling the project but are having 
a hard time defining how the capacity will be allocated. I left a message 
yesterday for Mary K. regarding these same issues. Thanks.  

Drew Fossum
02/14/2001 04:38 PM
There were several questions left for legal/regulatory to work on at the 
close of our meeting today.  I'll try to restate them, and add my initial 
thoughts, so we can all be sure to focus on the correct problems.  

Q 1. Can TW use "negotiated rate" agreements for its new 150 mm/d expansion?  

A.  Yes.  Independence, Guardian, and other new pipeline projects were 
certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts.  The only restriction 
is that we need to always offer cost-based recourse rate service as an 
alternative to negotiated rates.  We hope to use negotiated rate agreements 
for the entire 150 mm of capacity, but we won't know until the contracts are 
executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it 
will be under recourse rate contracts.  I guess that means that in the cert. 
app., we just tell the commission that we will be 100% at risk and that given 
the huge interest in the open season, we have no doubts about our ability to 
sell the full 150.  We should also tell the Commission we expect to sell the 
capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a 
combination of both.  

Q 2.  Can we give prospective customers a "cafeteria style" menu of options 
(to steal Jeff's term), like the following:
 1.  5 yr. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.60 plus fuel and surcharges (or 
whatever number we decide on)
 2.  10 y. neg. rate deal at a locked in $.45 plus fuel and surcharges
 3.  15 yr. neg rate deal at a locked in $.35 blah blah
 4 .  15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges (importantly 
this option is not locked in and will float with TW's actual rate levels and 
fuel retainage percentages)

A.  I think the answer here is "yes."  Whatever options we come up with for 
1, 2, and 3, we will always have to offer 4 as well.  Susan and Steve 
Stojic:  please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated 
rate options and stick to them.  Otherwise, this negotiated rate approach 
could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking 
our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations (like a 
7 yr, 231 day contract at $.51764, for example).  I'm not sure that would be

customer "no" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for 
the 5 yr term and the $.35 rate, for example.  I think we can lay out options 
of our choosing and then enforce a "no substitutions" policy (this is 
sticking with the "cafeteria" theme) but we need to be sure.  

Q.3.  If we can use the "cafeteria options" approach, how much flexibility do 
we have in structuring the options?  

A:  This one is hard.  We need to be sure that the price and term we choose 
to offer for options 1-3 is solely within our discretion.  We don't want to 
be second guessed by FERC as to whether we should have offered option 1 at

obtain 100% subscription under neg. rate deals.

the way we'd prefer to sell it.  Under the above example, assuming Stan, 
Danny and Steve decide short term deals are better, what if we get 100 mm/d 
of offers on each of the 4 rate/term options described above.  That's 400 
mm/d of demand for a 150 mm/d project.  Can we sell 100 to the guys who want

Here are the documents we will be discussing on our conference call. Our 
"talking points" are in RED.
thanks R2

I'm on a conf. call with Minnegasco from 8-10 Friday.  Please go forward 
without me and I'll circle back in later.  My view is that we need to look 
hard at a second expansion project, maybe jointly with Questar or someone 
else (Mojave?) that goes all the way to the market.  We may be semi-serious 
about the within-Cal. portion of the project, but it would be great potential 
leverage against the utilities and CPUC.  df

at 8 am.  Apologies for the conflict.

Julie,
We had a great idea (but poor execution) to get together with Danny this 
morning.  Even though I'm going to be out on Friday, if Danny is available, 
could you block off about 30 minutes in the a.m. for Drew, Susan, Jeff 
Dasovich and myself to run an idea past him?  If Danny asks, let him know 
we're trying to weigh the merits of filing to build an expansion into the 
state of California.  Whether we ultimately build it or not isn't the issue 
as much as whether the threat of another pipeline could motivate the 
utilities and the CPUC to build additonal take-away capacity for TW 
shippers.  I think Steve Harris is out of town for the rest of the week.  If 
not, we'll certainly want to plug him in also.  Will you let me know in the 
a.m.?  Thanks.

DC on the 20 and 21st.  Any chance of drinking and cigar smoking??  We got a 
nice note from your mom and it sounds like  Rollie is doing great.  That was 
super to hear.  Take care dude.  DF 

Jim--its been a long time since I bothered you!  Congrats (tentatively) on 
the settlement with the Navajos--sounds to me like you and Mr Soldano did 
some fine work! 

 We still haven't pulled the trigger on arbitration of the OneOk imbalance 
(the measurement issue) but we are getting closer.  Before we do, I wanted to 
get your thoughts on our "two prong" strategy once again.  You will recall 
that we intend to initiate the arbitration and simultaneously file a dec 
action in Texas state court.  That approach is described briefly in the 
attached pleading.  The pleading is pretty brief and terse--both Grant Harvey 
at Gibbs and Bruns and Britt wanted to keep the dec action as straightforward 
as possible.  I'll ask my secretary to block off an hour sometime this 
afternoon or early next week if your schedule permits.  I look forward to 
talking with you!  Thanks.  DF

    
Per Grant, I am sending you this last draft.

  <<Petition for Declaratory Judgment_v1.WPD>>

Carter Phillips is going to have his partner, that noted litigator, the one 
and only Phil Nowak, argue the case!  When you gonna be up here on Monday???  
Let me know--I'll be at the office on Mon. PM.  df
Believe it or not, we just received a 25 page cert petition to the Supreme
Court filed by Bath Petroleum.  As you will recall, the Second Circuit's
decision was an unpublished per curiam order.  Even more remarkable is that
Carter  Phillips of Sidlley & Austin signed the petition as counsel of
record.

I will send a copy to Patty.  We can talk next week about our brief in
opposition.

Get a dog???  My view on that is why bother getting a dog when you can have 
just as much fun letting the wife and kids treat you like one?  Congrats on 
the hush hush thing--that's great and well deserved!!  Keep watching your 
back--you just became a bigger target!!  DF

bummer.? Sounds like you need to get a DOG.? 

No, not planning to be in DC until March 8-9.? Headed to CA though -- Marina 
Del Ray.? They finally came through with the VP promotion (still highly hush

Either I didn't fully understand the December Texas Eastern order or else 
FERC has just put a new and unhelpful spin on it.  The Thursday rehearing 
order dramatically changes how the "shipper must have title" rule applies to 
acquisitions of upstream capacity.   I thought the Dec. order pretty clearly 
allowed a pipe to acquire upstream capacity and then resell that capacity 
under the acquiring pipeline's rate schedules.  FERC specifically held that  
the "shipper must have title" policy won't be applied if the acquiring pipe 
treats the acquired capacity "as though it were part of its own system".  (p. 
61,886)  The Dec. order even cited TW's acquisition of park n ride capacity 
from PG&E as an example of the type of transaction that (I thought) could be 
done without advance Commission approval.   Now, FERC explains that it did 
not intend a "blanket waiver" of the shipper must have title policy.   Pipes 
can still acquire upstream capacity without advance FERC permission, but only 
if the acquiring pipe is going to use the acquired capacity for operational 
needs or to resell under the selling pipe's release mechanism.  If the 
acquiring pipe wants to use the acquired capacity to support sales of service 
under the acquiring pipe's rate schedules, a specific waiver of the "must 
have title" policy is required (see FN 20 and text).   We are right back to 
where we started.  I guess the orders signal that FERC is  much more likely 
to grant waivers of the "must have title" policy than in the past, but I 
don't think we are good to go to acquire upstream storage, for example, and 
resell it as FDD or IDD until we get permission first.  

Shelley--let me know if you hear any expressions of outrage from other 
pipes.  This might be worth chasing on rehearing since it is such a clear 
about face by FERC.  

  

Anything from Knippa???  DF

Here is a draft of the compliance filing regarding our operational control 
agreement with ECS.  Please let me know your comments by C.O.B. tomorrow.  At 
this point I'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested 
by the Commission.

I'm still working with ECS to finalize the agreement.  Their attorney is 
checking with his resident experts to make sure ECS, by expressly giving TW 
Operational Control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling.  I 
do not expect the agreement to change significantly.  

The way I understand the suggestion, we will always be able to change a slate 
if we need to.  This puts more of the responsibility on us to keep the names 
updated if any changes need to be made.  I guess I have no problem with that 
as long as we can develop a systematic way of handling this and then be 
disciplined about following that system.  Bill--I suspect you will end up 
being our "system" so are you up to it?

     

Review the message below from the Corp., Sec., office, and let me know if you 
have any disagreement over their intention to alter the annual election 
process.  (I for one do not see any problem with this, since we make changes 
on a regular basis.)  

Bill  
With the goals of (i) getting the corporate database as up to date as 
possible; and (ii) increasing the efficiency of the Corporate Services 
department, I would like to suggest the following changes: 

Given the constant restructuring of Enron there are usually several major 
projects in the works to change the slates of directors and/or officers.  As 
we are handling approximately 2,500 active legal entities, it takes a great 
deal of time to sort out the details, handle the data entry,  prepare the 
election consents for your review and signature line initials, and circulate 
for signature..   However, if we take domestic annual elections out of the 
equation we can solve one problem area relatively easily.

As you are aware the domestic annual election project is a very large 
undertaking both for the Corporate Services group, and for the various legal 
groups.  Historically, it's been a time for the operating groups to review 
the slates of directors, officers, and attorneys-in-fact, make changes, 
review again, make more changes, until the final unanimous written consent 
resolutions are produced, initialled, and signed by the directors or 
stockholder(s) - a frustrating process that has frequently taken many months 
to complete.  I'd like to recommend to you that we reduce the annual 
elections to a more "administrative" function, i.e. the annual election of 
directors only (as required by state law).  I'm suggesting that we re-elect 
the existing  directors as of a specified date (within 13 months of the 
previous annual election to conform to state law), the consents are prepared, 
sent for your review and initials, signed by shareholder(s), and placed in 
the minute books, and the project is over!  All other changes to the director 
and officer slates, and attorney-in-fact appointments are submitted by you to 
us in the normal course of business throughout the year.   We'll send you 
annually the familiar slates of directors, officers, and attorneys-in-fact 
for your review, but the pressure on you and on us to respond to a specific 
election date is removed.  You  review the slates, discuss them within your 
operating groups, and choose your own date for resignations and elections, 
entirely separate from the annual election of directors function.

I look forward to discussing this with you and/or your staff, and I'm open to 
any comments and suggestions that you might have.  What worked well 
historically has become a nightmare for all concerned and it's time to open 
the box and re-examine the contents now, before we start all over again in 
June 2001!

If I don't hear from you I'll assume that you agree with this suggested new 
format and you won't hear from us on this subject until June 2001.

Why would PGT do that????  If there was that much demand, you'd think they 
would have been able to extract a neg. rate deal for something north of max 
for a shorter term.  Maybe that shipper demanded the recourse rate.  Weird.  
By the way--good memo to Shelley on Red Rock.  df

Rumor on the street is that the entire 200 MMcf/d of capacity in the PGT-NW 
expansion went to one shipper who offered max. rates for 35 years.

1. MOPS.  Suggested that the MOPS rehearing be brought to Madden's 
attention.  As a result we are looking at filing a motion to expedite.  Spent 
much of the week reviewing the MOPS proceeding up to date, reading pleadings 
and cases. Drafted a motion to expedite which has been circulated for 
comment.  While it is not very compelling for expedition, it is a way to get 
the proceeding brought to FERC's attention.  Apparently, there is a push to 
clean up old dockets.  Also it brought to my attention that Northern, in this 
proceeding, proposed to sell to Enron Gulf Coast Gathering, which I had 
forgotten.  so that if we find another purchaser, the filing will have to be 
amended. Also the Enron affiliate made the filing for the declaratory order.  
Kim Wilkie and  were talking about MOPS and what needs to be done while she 
is out on maternity leave.  We were talking about the waiver and ROFR 
agreements which John Goodpasture is getting executed.  We need to review 
whatever was done, if anything, at the time of the original filing to sell to 
the affiliate. Also take a look at the current ones to see if they would be 
broad enough to cover  not only Northern but a subsequent sale by Northern 
afilliate, if we should want to handle the sale of MOPS in that manner.
  2.  Attended the South End Task Force Meeting Tuesday morning.  It was a 
long meeting and quite productive. It was a brain dump by the south end 
commercial guys for Shelley and Mike and a man named Mike Gadd who called in 
from London who will work with Danny McCarty on asset deals.  It was decided 
to go ahead and start presenting potential deals to various Companies who we 
think would be interested in the various south end assets.  For exampleBob 
burleson is going to present a deal for some Permian assets to SPS.  SPS will 
have to divest certain power plants but still would like to maintain some 
control.   SPS may be interested in purchasing the pipelines form Northern 
and TW that currently serve the plants.  SPS would operate the line as an 
intrastate Hinshaw.  We think these asets are a good candidate to get Stans 
approval since they are not useful to get gas to California and the COS is 
$18 and incremental revenue is $2-3.  I will be involved in putting the 
proposal together starting with confidentiality agreements.  
Shelley believes that we should actively package and seek out potential 
interested buyers.  For example, approach Duke about the Hugoton area because 
Duke has a huge helium plant there. Also talk to El Paso because of its 
recent acqusition of CIG and ANR   and  interest in getting Rocky Moutain gas 
to Cailf.  Also seek out those interested in the Beaver assets and go make a 
pitch.
I am reading the existing contracts we have with Oneok as well as GPM/Duke to 
determine any adverse terms and conditions which could hinder a sale.
Another meeting is scheduled for the week of March 4 to go over the SPS deal 
with Stan.
 3 FERC Audit CWIP.  Continue working with Gary Zahn and Michelle Winckowski 
on a futher FERC inquiry on the Sublette work order.  Will prepare a response 
next week.

Next week continue work on the above items.
By the way  good luck with getting Mike's job if you want it.  We would be 
happy to have you here!!

pls put on my calendar.. .thanks. df
Britt, Grant, Becky and I have a conference call scheduled tomorrow morning 
at 9:00 am with Rick Dietz, Harry Woodson and Tangie Dikes to discuss their 
testimony.  Do you want to be included (if you're feeling better)?  Have some 
chicken soup and take it easy!

sorry--I left you off the list.  df

I just had a good conversation with Sempra's regulatory person who is working 
on the data responses for Stephanie Katz.  Her name is Gillian Wright, and 
she is a "regulatory case manager" whatever that is.  She was pleased to hear 
about the extension til Wed 12:00 for her responses.  The best news is that 
she was a very chatty individual and was interested in our thoughts on the 
questions.  I told her that our answer no. 1 was just going to confirm that 
the recourse rate is in fact in our tariff where it is supposed to be and it 
is always "offered."  I suggested that her question no. 1 was a little 
different and to me, indicated that FERC just didn't understand the daily 
markets at all and further didn't understand very much about index to index 
deals and how they might be the best way to contract in many circumstances.  
She took that bait and said that their answer would focus on exactly 
that--that fixed rate deals create risk issues for trading companies that 
index deals lay off.  She also said that FERC's questions looked similar to 
questions Sempra Trading has had to answer on other deals and that she 
thought her answer would be similar.  I got a high comfort level that she 
viewed this whole thing as no big deal.  Are any of you aware of where Sempra 
may have been required to answer questions like these???  Kathy R:  have you 
seen any above-max index deals involving Sempra?  It may have been CPUC 
questions she was referring to, but I didn't want to make a big deal of it.

Gillian would like to get a fax of our responses to her at 213-244-8820 as 
soon as they are ready.  Susan and Maria please make sure we get that done.  
She said she'd send hers to us as soon as she could, but I didn't push for a 
draft to review as her thinking sounds consistent with ours.   

As for Sid, Scott Walker's regulatory guy won't be available until tomorrow 
morning.  Scott is having him call me then to discuss the answers.  Scott was 
appreciative of the extension, but frankly didn't sound like he planned to 
meet the Tuesday deadline anyway.  In fact, I'm not sure he cares all that 
much about meeting the new Wed. deadline.  DF    

fyi
check for Sempra filings on Kern River....

Drew,
Here's a chance to wear your honorary Marketing beanie.  If you read the no=
te=20
below, we're engaged in very preliminary conversations with PEMEX with the=
=20
idea that maybe TW/NNG could offer a viable alternative to EPNG to move gas=
=20
into Mexico through the Samalayuca lateral (commencement point located=20
approx. 50 miles east of the city of El Paso).  New construction would=20
involve approx. 150 miles of pipeline and associated compression to tie int=
o=20
the existing TW/NNG systems near Waha.  Notwithstanding PEMEX's desire to=
=20
move off EPNG for a portion of the load, I don't think the economics will=
=20
work.=20

However, KN Energy (now Kinder) used to own a line they acquired through=20
Westar (they acquired it from El Paso Products Co.) that runs from Waha=20
westward to a point near the city of El Paso.  It's primarily a 20" line, a=
nd=20
it currently serves El Paso Electric Co. and several directly connected=20
industrial customers.  As a KN operation, it typically didn't run full.  I=
=20
see the acquisition of this line as one possible way we could serve both th=
e=20
existing markets as well as incremental volumes to PEMEX at a rate that mig=
ht=20
work for them.  I completely spaced on the fact that Kinder sold many of it=
s=20
south system assets (including this West Texas line) to Oneok last year.  I=
f=20
we are to pursue this idea, then we're forced to dealing with Oneok.

I know that we're in deep dog poo with Oneok right now regarding Bushton.  =
My=20
question is, are we in any kind of position to talk to Oneok about this=20
asset, considering  the legal status of our dispute at Bushton?  Also, does=
=20
our desire (potentially) to own this asset create any kind of negotiating=
=20
currency with Oneok on the Bushton issue?

I'd appreciate your thoughts.  We're due to have Pemex in our offices next=
=20
week.   Thanks!

Pemex has approached Transwestern with the idea of Transwestern building an=
=20
interconnecting pipeline between the current EPNG/Samaluyca interconnect at=
=20
EPNG's Hueco compressor station and TW's facilties in West Texas.   Pemex h=
as=20
indicated they might move as much as 300,000 MMCf/d on the lateral, althoug=
h=20
the email below shows increments to only 200,000 MMCf/d.  Pemex is well awa=
re=20
of the fact that the lateral will not be an inexpensive proposition, but th=
ey=20
claim to see another supply option (other than EPNG) as necessary,=20
particularly in light of EP Merchant's behavior regarding their ownership o=
f=20
the large 1.2 Bcf/d block of EPNG capacity.

To this end, I've arranged a meeting (originally set for Mexico City, now i=
n=20
Houston) to sit down face to face with Pemex and discuss this project. =20
They'd like us to be a specific as possible and set the email below to assi=
st=20
us in our design considerations.

I see this project being one of possibly two separate projects.  First, we=
=20
could re-establish a dialogue with Kinder Morgan to see if they'd be=20
interered in talking to us about an ownership position in their West Texas=
=20
line.  Secondly, we could build new pipe to TW/NNG.

With respect to NNG, I think there's definitely an opportunity to promote t=
he=20
use of the NNG South end as a potential supply/services source.  Not only=
=20
does NNG have a full range of storage and line pack services, but they coul=

possibly bring Trailblazer gas from the Rockies down to serve this load.

Audrey, if you would, please set us up for meeting here in Houston on Frida=

March 9, 2001 beginning at 9:00 a.m.  We need a conference room for about 1=

people from 9-12.  I'd like a coffee/juice/rolls setup for this meeting if=
=20
possible.  Also, check with me as time draws near and we can arrange a plac=
e=20
to take them to lunch.  I think we can finish our business with them at lun=
ch=20
time and make plans for our next steps.

Jeff,

As we talk this morning we are interested on developing a new project
with your company that could take gas into EPNG=01,s Hueco compressor
station located in Hudspeth County, Texas.

The preliminary information we can give you in order to move forward
with the project is this:

Receipt point:                            Transwestern and NNG
Delivery point-                            Hueco Compress Station
Delivery Pressure-                      840 psi
Volume                                     100,150 and 200 MMBTU/day
Term                                         10,15 and 20 years.

The information we would like to receive from you is:

1.         Permissions you will need to get in order to build the
interconnection FERC, RRC, EPNG, others (timing for those permissions)
2.         Time to build the interconnection
3.         As we understand, you as interstate pipeline need to post the
capacity at the EBB, how much time would it take?
4.         Rates and fuel charges that apply for all your system
(Transwestern and NNG)
5.         Estimated cost for the new interconnection facilities.
6.         Supply areas that we can access
7.         Storage Facilities

We hope that with this information you can run your first numbers about
how we can make this project work and we can have some distance walked
for our upcoming meeting on march 9th, 2001

Thank you in advance for the help and if you have any question don=01,t
hesitate to give me a call.

Sincerely yours=01(

It appears that EOTT Energy Pipeline Limited Partnership will be named as a 
defendant in a lawsuit brought by some of the landowners who were affected by 
a crude oil release in a subdivision near Midland, Texas.  The release 
involved a segment of pipe purchased by EOTT from the Texas-New Mexico 
Pipeline Company in May of 1999.  If EOTT is named as a defendant, we intend 
to file a cross claim against Tex-New Mex.  In that cross claim, we intend to 
allege fraud and gross negligence by Tex-New Mex in the clean up of that 
release and the subsequent representations to EOTT regarding the cleanup.

Please let me know by Wednesday, Feb. 28 at noon if you have any issues with 
EOTT's claim against Tex-New Mex.  If I do not hear from you, I assume there 
are no issues.  Thanks for your response.

Thanks.  My guess is that someone ought to go and represent TW.  Fawcett and 
Harris ought to make that call.  Jeff D:  I assume you know who Lad Lorenz 
is.  Either Jeff:  does Lad's involvement signal anything to us--i.e., is he 
their "get stuff done guy" or their "try to look like you are getting stuff 
done guy" ?  DF

You get this?  Someone that I know forwarded it along to me.  Know anything 
about it?

 I got Jim Derrick's sign off on V & E on the patent for Kim and 
Martha--bring the guy in  and get him acquainted with them and keep me 
posted.  thanks. df

Great idea--I don't have any specific suggestions to add to this checklist, 
but I encourage all of you to help Susan get this finalized.  I know you guys 
have all worked hard on these deals and I appreciate that hard work and your 
patience.  We all deserve a system that works more smoothly, so lets take 
Susan's lead and create one!  Thanks.  DF

 

My experience with the February deals this week has shown me that we need to 
improve our system of communication on negotiated rate deals.  
I think a simple checklist for the marketers, legal & reg. would help.  
Here's what I suggest:

- Marketer:  Work with Susan on negotiated rate contract language.  E-mail 
draft of contract to Glen, Mary, Susan, Mary Kay and Drew for information and 
for sign-off by Legal and Regulatory prior to sending to the shipper.  

- Mary and Susan -- have a telephone conversation to confirm that a filing 
needs to be made, and if so when.  If a filing does not need to be made 
immediately, note filing date on both Mary's and Susan's calendars (and on 
Filing Log).

- Marketer:  Contract must be executed at least one day before gas flow.  
Once contract is executed, immediately (1) fax it to Mary at 402-398-7006 and 
(2) make sure the contract representative (Linda Trevino?) knows that it is a 
negotiated rate deal and needs to be posted on the transactional report.

- Mary?  Susan?:  Contact Linda Trevino to let her know the negotiated rate 
tariff page that should be reference on the transactional report.

-  Mary/Glen:  Draft negotiated rate filing and have Susan or Maria review.  
Rate language in tariff should be identical to contract negotiated rate 
language.  Send to D.C. for filing.

Let me know if I've left anything out, and I'll get this edited, spiffed up, 
etc. and circulate it to the marketers so we can get through April and all 
other future deals without a hitch.

In anticipation of potential litigation involving TW's operational 
activities, please prepare an analysis for me of the reasons for TW's sale of 
excess natural gas at the California border.  I am aware of several of these 
sales and have been  informed that excess pressure at the border is the basic 
reason for them.  I'd like a more specific explanation that includes the 
following information:
1.  What are the specific pressures and volume considerations that could make 
it operationally necessary to sell gas at the California border?  
2.  What is the process that is followed to make such a determination?
3.  Which individuals or groups are involved in determining whether an 
operational sale is necessary?
4.  In what way have system operations changed since last year and how do 
those changes contribute to the increased frequency of such sales compared to 
previous years?
5. What alternatives to operational sales are considered before the decision 
to make a sale is reached? 

Thanks for your attention to this request.  Please give me a call to discuss 
and please designate your response as "Privileged and Confidential, Attorney

I haven't seen a contract yet on the original 33,000 on TW but Susan thought 
the deal was going to be done--she's checking to see where the holdup is.  On 
the El Paso capacity, Mavrix never submitted a bid.  I think the deadline got 
past us before we were ready.  df    

   
	
	

What is the latest on this?  Did they bid on El Paso?  MK

Drew Fossum
02/09/2001 05:30 PM
Three to-dos on our Mavrix meeting:
1.  Follow up and make sure the officers get set up correctly.
2.  Talk to Perry Frazier in planning--he is keeping copies of the actual EBB 
postings showing that we have had the Ignacio-Thoreau piece of capacity 
posted (the 33,000/d).  I'd like you to keep copies of those postings in your 
file until Mavrix actually buys that capacity.  If we end up in a fight at 
some time, we'll be able to prove the postings were out there, because the 
actual postings are not electronically archived, I am told.
3. All Mavrix deals will need initials from legal--probably you, Susan.  For 
now, please let me know of any deals Mavrix does with non-Enron pipes.  For 
Enron pipes, of course, contract approval will be via our ordinary procedures 
and MKM's group and I should be advised as a matter of course.  

Thanks.  DF 

Julia and Steve--here are some questions I've sent to Darrell on the TW Cal. 
border line pack sales.  I'd like him to pull in the right people to get me 
the answers so we will be prepared if we need to explain these events.  
Darrell--I thought I'd better let your bosses know that I've been putting 
more stuff on your already full plate.  Thanks all.  DF

If we do that, does it still go on our "permanent record"?

Congrats!!
Also  I don't think it wise to put due diligence activities on Legals weekly 
bullets but I will put them on my weekly report to you.  Those reports get 
too wide a distribution.  OK??

I got the call today.  Got the job.  I feel like the dog that caught the 
car--enjoyed the chase but don't know quite what to do with the car.  DF

Shit--I knew I forgot something!  My boss leaves for good on April one, so 
I'll be spending 3 or so days a wk in Hou starting now.  I'll be the VP and 
General Counsel of Enron Transportation Services, which is the division that 
runs all the pipelines.  Yeeha.  I agree about getting together--when you 
coming down to visit the sister in law?  Maybe we can run up to MPLS for a 
boondoggle.  Also, I'll be in DC the 22d and 23d of March--where are you?  DF 

Congratulations! 

What is the job, anyway.? Or have you failed to even ask? 

When do you go?? We need to plan a get together. 

I got the call today.? Got the job.? I feel like the dog that caught the 
car--enjoyed the chase but don't know quite what to do with the car.? DF 

It did in fact keep me up half the night but I did in fact remember it.  
Akamai Technologies.  Not sushi, not teriaki, just Akamai.  More value-added 
service from the legal dept.  DF

Problems Mount for Sierra Pacific Resources,
Acquisition of Portland General Appears Uncertain

by Will McNamara 
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

The probability appears to be getting smaller that Sierra Pacific Resources 
(NYSE: SRP) will complete its $3.1 billion acquisition of Portland General 
Electric (NYSE: PGB) from Enron (NYSE: ENE). Enron disclosed in an 8K filing 
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Feb. 27 that the sale of 
Portland General had been delayed because of "recent events" in California 
and Nevada that affected Sierra Pacific. Walt Higgins, chair and CEO of 
Sierra Pacific Resources, told Wall Street analysts that the acquisition 
agreement will terminate if it has not closed by May 1. 

Analysis: Yesterday I wrote about the apparent collapse of the merger between 
Consolidated Edison and Northeast Utilities (NU). Now, another high-profile 
merger appears to be unraveling. As with the Con Edison / NU deal, the 
problem facing Sierra Pacific Resources' pending purchase of Portland General 
from Enron is based in economics. Namely, it appears that Sierra Pacific 
Resources' recent financial problems have cast doubt on the company's ability 
to complete its purchase of Portland General. This is not a good development 
for Sierra Pacific Resources, as the financial and legal implications of this 
potentially dead acquisition could exacerbate the company's current financial 
problems.  

First, let me provide some background on this deal. The origin of Sierra 
Pacific Resources' attempt to acquire Portland General date back to November 
1999. Enron had purchased the company in 1997 as a strategic move to 
facilitate its intent to play a major role in the retail markets of 
California and the Pacific Northwest. At the time, Enron saw itself as a 
prototype for the future of the energy industry, adding transmission and 
distribution capabilities as well as more diversified fuel resources to its 
already successful wholesale marketing core. Stymied by the slow start of 
competition in California and Oregon, Enron underwent a transformation in its 
corporate philosophy. Under the growing direction of Jeffrey Skilling, Enron 
no longer believed that it needed to own hard assets to retain its place in 
the top tier of energy companies. That philosophy has served Enron well, as 
its success in nearly all of its business sectors has been well documented. 

Yet, Enron's transformation opened the door for Sierra Pacific Resources, a 
relatively small and regionally based holding company, to move in for a 
purchase of Portland General. Owning Portland General made more sense for 
Sierra Pacific Resources than it did for Enron. Portland General, which 
provides electric service to over 700,000 customers in the Portland-Salem 
area, was viewed as a good acquisition target as it would help Sierra Pacific 
Resources to gain scale and a foothold in two fast-growing states (Nevada and 
Oregon). Sierra Pacific Resources agreed to pay Enron $2.1 billion for 
Portland General, which included $2.02 billion in cash and assumption of 
Enron's $80 million merger payment obligation. In addition, Sierra Pacific 
Resources agreed to assume $1 billion in Portland General debt and preferred 
stock, taking the total value of the purchase to $3.1 billion. Portland 
General appeared happy with the scheduled sale from Enron, acknowledging that 
its own core business "delivering safe and reliable power with a customer 
service focus" was more in line with Sierra Pacific Resources.  

However, a number of economic factors on Sierra Pacific Resources' side of 
the table seem to be thwarting this acquisition. As I discussed in the Feb. 
22 IssueAlert (available at www.consultrci.com), Sierra Pacific Resources 
reported a significant fourth-quarter loss ($18.2 million) as a result of 
soaring costs of power in the western United States. The company incurred 
losses as a direct result of "the growing and unrecovered cost of purchased 
power in the volatile wholesale market." As a result, Sierra Pacific 
Resources filed with state regulators for an emergency rate increase. 
"Without some rate relief, the cost of fuel and power is close to crippling 
our ability to serve the needs of our customers," said Mark Ruelle, the 
company's chief financial officer. The company attributed the latest 
quarter's loss to nearly $258 million of unanticipated fuel and purchased 
power costs. 

Specifically, Sierra Pacific Resources reported a 4Q 2000 loss of $18.2 
million, or 23 cents a share. This compared with a profit of $26.8 million, 
or 39 cents a share, excluding a $56 million deferred energy write-off a year 
ago. Including the write-off, the company reported a loss of $29.2 million, 
or 42 cents a share, in 4Q 1999. For year-end 2000, the company reported a 
net loss of $39.8 million or 51 cents per share, a 177-percent drop from 
1999. 

In addition, the company's stock has fallen steadily over the last few weeks 
(at one point, dropping 11.8 percent to $10.80 on the New York Stock Exchange 
Feb. 7). At the close of trading on March 7, shares of Sierra Pacific 
Resources were priced at $13.80, which is still down from its 52-week high of 
$19.43 and book value of $17.82. The drop in stock price could make it 
difficult for Sierra Pacific Resources to secure the financing necessary to 
complete the purchase of Portland General. 

Meanwhile, Sierra Pacific Resources' available cash flow could be impacted by 
possible restrictions placed on the sale of its power plants. The Public 
Utility Commission of Nevada (PUCN) mandated divestiture as a condition of 
the 1999 merger between Nevada Power Co. and Sierra Pacific Power Co, which 
created the holding company Sierra Pacific Resources. Toward that end, the 
holding company and its wholly owned utility subsidiaries commenced a public 
auction of approximately 2,900 MW of power generation facilities. Of Sierra 
Pacific Resources' nine power plants, which are mostly fired by natural gas 
and coal, seven have been entered into sales agreements to companies such as 
Dynegy and NRG and will be sold upon final regulatory approval.   

However, over the last few weeks, there has been growing concern that Nevada 
regulators would not approve pending sales or authorize the sale of 
additional power plants by Sierra Pacific Resources, thus preventing the 
company from using the proceeds to pay for the acquisition of Portland 
General. Perhaps out of fears about depleting the Nevada's power supply, the 
Attorney General's Bureau of Consumer Protection, the Southern Nevada Water 
Authority and the AFL-CIO have urged that the sale of the plants be delayed 
or canceled. Further, Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn has called on the PUCN to 
reconsider the 1999 order that required Sierra Pacific Resources to sell the 
plants owned by its two utilities, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power. Any 
available cash that Sierra Pacific Resources was planning to use from the 
power plant sales to support its acquisition of Portland General may not 
materialize if the sales agreements are delayed or terminated. 

Ironically, Nevada Power and Sierra Pacific Power Co. just received approval 
from the PUCN to secure $1.4 billion in bank loans, bond financing and 
preferred securities. However, due to agreements that the utilities 
previously made, none of the borrowed money may be used, directly or 
indirectly, to financially support its parent's acquisition of Portland 
General.  

Thus, Sierra Pacific Resources seems to be between a rock and a hard place 
regarding this purchase, which it apparently still wants to complete. It 
would appear that Sierra Pacific Resources will have difficulty financing the 
purchase of Portland General due to the combination of its significant 
financial losses, plunging stock prices and possible restrictions against the 
sale of its power plants. Presumably, these are the "recent events" to which 
Enron referred in its SEC filing.  

It is fairly clear that Enron no longer wishes to own Portland General and 
believes that the company does not fit into its strategy for continuing 
growth. What remains in question, however, is what will happen if Sierra 
Pacific Resources' pending acquisition is not completed by the May 1 
deadline, thus terminating the sales agreement. The problems associated with 
the Con Edison / NU merger are leading to litigation. One can't help but 
think that lawsuits would be inevitable in the Enron / Portland General / 
Sierra Pacific Resources case as well, as Enron presumably would seek to be 
compensated in some way for the $3.1 billion that the deal includes.  

Further complicating matters for Sierra Pacific Resources is a growing 
movement to municipalize the electric markets in Las Vegas and Henderson, 
Nev. On Jan. 11, the Southern Nevada Water Authority suggested that the 
agency could become a public power authority. Pat Mulroy, general manager of 
the water authority, recommended that the agency buy power on wholesale 
markets and possibly generate electricity from some of its own power plants 
to serve cities in the area. Efforts to municipalize electric systems in the 
southern half of the state could potentially gain momentum if Sierra Pacific 
Resources' financial problems worsen.

Rod, I have an e mail stating that TBG has found sufficient funds for the 
bridge financing associated wither E&C activities of the three compressors 
stations and that Pete Weidler has agreed to allow E&C to roll the cost of 
equipment (compression) into the EPC price. 
The compression is to be ordered by ETS on the behalf of GTB.  My question is 
which ETS company will the equipment be ordered through?  GTB has made 
reference of EAMR in the LOI signed with Solar but I question that statement.

I don't see any problem with this transaction since it appears to be limited 
to Louisiana assets, but the issue of whether we are impacted by the 
noncompete agreement strikes me as a commercial call.  Please let me know if 
you have any problem with the transaction and I will pursue it.  Thanks.  DF

I blew you guys off this am--couldn't handle 5:30 am two days in a row!  I 
did get my three miles in , but at the more civilized hour of 6:30 am.  It 
almost killed me!  see you soon,  df 

Here it is.  The format's a little screwed up, but what do you expect from me?

Well, I've gotten myself into a fine kettle of fish.  Got any advice on how 
to handle the new job?  (or is this like asking the one legged man how to 
avoid land mines?) 

A couple of additional thoughts on this morning's conversation: 
 
1.  if we really think the next 6 or 8 months will sort out the takeaway and 
receipt point capacity issues, why not bet the whole farm and try to hold 
onto the whole 150 mm/d until next winter or fall and see if the perceived 
value goes up?  We could tell Calpine "no" on their bid and hold them off for 
several months "negotiating" if that's what we thought would lead to the best 
value.  I don't personally think this would be a prudent approach, but its 
where our logic leads in the extreme, so we'd better be prepared to explain 
why getting the bird in the hand from Calpine is smart.  

2.  We'll research the question of whether we can reject any recourse bids 
that come in over the next 6-8 months if we decide to hold onto the 60 mm/d 
for awhile.  I've thought about it a bit more and I'm pretty sure you're not 
going to like the answer.  First, FERC says we've got to have a recourse rate 
in place for all capacity, new or old.  One reason is that there needs to be 
a max rate that applies to long term capacity releases.  We have the option 
on new projects to go with the existing max tariff rate or a new 
incrementally designed rate.  We are going with the existing tariff rate on 
RedRock.  Fine, but that makes the existing rate the recourse rate for all 
purposes.  FERC's logic will be that TW could sell all of the RedRock 
capacity at recourse rates (currently $.38) and never suffer a revenue 
shortfall even if future rate cases reduce TW's overall rates, because the 
costs of all TW's facilities--including the new project--will be considered 
in the next rate case.  Think about it--our rates will only go down in the 
future if the ENTIRE cost of service goes down.  We'd never "lose money" on 
RedRock, but we might not make as much as we could have made with an 15 year 
fixed $.38 negotiated rate.

There is another  approach.  We could have Mavrix submit a binding bid right 
now for the 60 mm/d and just flat out sell it to them.  That would send a 
pretty strong signal to the market that we are serious about deadlines.  The 
downside of that aggressive approach is that it would get us into the same 
mess that El Paso finally got themselves out of, with Amoco, Dynegy and the 
whole gang beating the crap out of us.  I'm not to fired up about this 
approach for that reason.  I'll give you a call Monday after I've picked our 
best regulatory brains on these issues.  DF     

remind me to call Mike and see if I need to be at thsi.  I don't think so but 
I'll let him make the call.  df
With the amount of e mail traffic within the last couple of days concerning 
the GTB E&C project and the fact we are close to contract execution, I would 
suggest we have a meeting to be sure everyone is on the same page.  I have 
scheduled this meeting for Monday, March 12 at 1:00 pm in conference room 
3AC31c1.

If there are questions are conflicts of schedule, please let me know.

Thanks Craig!  I'll look forward to seeing your smilin' face more 
frequently!  [Actually that will be tough since I currently see it at least 
twice a day on a life size billboard in the Omaha office lobby!!]  df 

WAY TO GO DREW!!!

It's really refreshing to see someone who works hard (and works smart) get 
recognized.  Well done...
Congratulations,

Attached please find the February 2001 report showing current month activity 
in the System Levelized Account (SLA).  Information for this report comes 
from data provided by Gas Accounting Department.  Several items to note for 
this, the first distribution:
All non-shaded information on this report reflects the same data as shown on 
Exhibit No. 7 which has been provided to Northern's shippers in conjunction 
with Docket No. RP01-76-000 data requests.  (Only January data has been given 
to the shippers at this time.)
Columns (j) and (k) serve to highlight the segregation of the SLA account 
into its two components - cash and future liability.  The two columns add 
together to equal the total amount of the SLA account on the books (Column 
(i)). 
Column (j) reflects the cash portion of the SLA account, i.e. the actual 
amount of cash spent/(received) in maintaining Northern's operational storage.
Column (k) reflects the future liability portion of the SLA account, i.e. the 
future amount of cash to be spent/(received) in clearing the Dollar Valued 
Volume short/(long) position.  It is computed by multiplying the month-end 
Dollar Valued Volume short/(long) position by the respective month's MIP. 

This file contains both the January and February report.  To print each 
month's report, simply click on the respective tab.

Actually, Mike, the cost benefit for you guys is pretty good since the hassle 
is mostly on the legal and regulatory folks where it belongs!   Seriously,  
the quarterly FERC filing I mentioned needs to be done anyway as I understand 
it because we use it to apprise FERC of various changes in our compliance.  
Since Rich's folks out there don't ordinarily have access to "confidential 
transportation related information" except maybe for occasional advance info 
on operational problems or outages, there shouldn't be much need for training 
or risk of accidental disclosures.  There is no filing fee or other out of 
pocket cost, and we are, as always,  eager to help with any deals that might 
bring some value to ET&S or Corp.  (and who knows how valuable a little 
sucking up to EES might be in the long run!?) .  Just let us know what you 
decide to do and we'll get the paperwork done.  Thanks.  DF

   
	
	

Rich - Is this really worth the hassle? All the upside is on the side of EES, 
all the downside (work) appears to be on our side. It would appear to me that 
EES could rent an office in some executive office space provider .....but 
maybe I don't have my Enron hat on.

   
	
	

If the cost savings are worth a little bit of hassle, we can do this.  We'll 
need to make a FERC filing by the end of the 1st Q 2000 to identify the 
"shared facilities."  Also, if you decide to go forward, don't do it until 
1-1-2000 so we don't have to scramble to get the info in front of FERC this 
quarter.  Let me and Maria know what you decide to do and we'll arrange a 
briefing on the specific rules to be aware of and we'll make sure we 
understand the situation fully so we can properly disclose to FERC what is 
up.  Please call with any questions. Thanks.  DF   

Rich Jolly on 12/15/99 06:38:43 PM
Drew are we OK to go with this? We don't have any "confidential 
transportation-related information in our office. We do have some operating 
agreements and contracts but they aren't confidential that I know of.  
Rich

Drew Fossum
12/08/99 05:18 PM

EES is a marketing affiliate, so we do need to be careful about shared 
computer systems, phone systems, staplers, paper clips, etc.  If Rich and his 
office have no "confidential transportation-related information"  we might be 
able to do it, otherwise, the hassles and expense of building marketing 
affiliate firewalls might make it counterproductive.   I'm forwarding this to 
the experts for a quick yup or nope on this.  Thanks. DF  

Michel Nelson
12/08/99 05:24 PM
Rich - Per your phone mail, I see no reason why an EES employee couldn't 
office in your Region Office, providing he/she pays rent and we not break any 
market affiliate rules (if they apply here).

Drew - Saving $ for Enron. Any issues I'm overlooking?

Lets defer to MKM's group on whether to seek a waiver on this.  I don't see 
any real value to us of solving Mewbourne's problems for them.  DF
Keith Petersen
02/09/2000 05:28 PM
Earlier this afternoon, Mike Sheppard, the attorney for Mewbourne, called 
requesting that we file for a waiver for Mewbourne's two projects.  He passed 
on how he had talked with FERC, Lee Huber and Shelley Corman about the new 
Landowner notification for both projects.  He now realizes that TW is 
required to do Landowner notification, but has the ability to file for a 
"Waiver" from FERC.  He wants TW to file for the Waiver to reduce the number 
of days before Mewbourne can flow gas.  It is my understanding that the OGC 
was open to granting a waiver expediently in the event there is no ground 
disturbance.

Mewbourne - Two Projects:

Hemphill Co. Interconnect - 
Mike S. asked why we couldn't move ahead on filing for the Waiver for the 
Hemphill project.  I told him that before we could move ahead we will need 
additional information.  First, we would need the legal description of the 
location, line number of the line the interconnect was to be connected to and 
who is the landowner(s)  that would be impacted.  He said that he would 
forward the landowner's name to me.  The one question that I did not have an 
answer for are environmental clearances required?  Because we are to have the 
environmental approved dates prior to work commencing (required for Blanket 
projects).  Another question Mike S. was not aware of; "to activate the valve 
does TW need to cross other private properties reach the site?"
Information needed for the waiver:

 Location of Work (Legal Description)?
 Landowner's Name and Address (per the latest Tax Role)?
 Environmental Clearances - Are they required?
 

SE New Mexico - 
 On this project Mike S. was not aware that TW had to excavate to make the 
connection to Mewbourne.  In this project, TW must inspect the valve and 
operator (tie-in point) for damage.  Environmental must review to see if 
clearances are required for the required digging.  Because there is ground 
disturbance, the landowner(s) will need to sign a waiver for the 30 day 
notice.  This waiver by the landowner would be filed with FERC.  Another 
question that Mike was unable to answer "is this project on Tribal lands?"  
Another question Mike S. was not aware of; "to excavate the valve does TW 
need to cross other private properties reach the site?"  

 Location of Work (Legal Description)?
 Landowner's Name and Address (per the latest Tax Role)?
 Environmental Clearances - Are they required?
 Landowner "Waiver Consent"

Michele, earlier had a conversation with Shelley on how filing for waiver may 
help the overall outcome of Landowner Notification ruling.  By showing FERC 
how the rule is affecting not only the pipeline, but how it affects producers 
and landowners may help in changing the rules.

Please review and give me you input.  If we are to file for a Waiver, 
Certificates will all of the above information.  Mike Sheppard is a 
persistent person and wants to flow gas as many of you already know.

Thanks

I would have jumped yesterday but couldn't figure out how to get my window 
open.  Since I'm on the 7th floor and the snowdrift goes up to the 4th, it 
wouldn't have done much good anyway.  Know of any good part time jobs--I need 
to supplement the ole' retirement plan!  df

Hey, great talking to you.  I appreciate your willingness to talk to David 
about the DOE situation.  He's a great guy and one of the best substantive 
lawyers I've met.  Short bio--U. of Missouri undergrad, Northwestern law 
school.  He was a staffer after law school on the House or Senate Ag 
committee--I can't remember which.  Big time federalist society member and 
knows all those ultra-right winger types.  He was my partner at Wiley Rein 
and Fielding and was the right hand man of Dick Wiley and Fred Fielding among 
the younger partners--kind of an enforcer, future executive committee type 
(he kept me from getting fired a couple of times--I'm sure he regrets that 
now).  Dave wasn't an energy lawyer originally, but did a lot of work on my 
client stuff and took over my natural gas clients after I left Wiley.  He 
also did a lot of electric restructuring stuff (he was one of the lead 
lawyers for Penn. Power and Light and United Illuminating on the Order 888 
compliance filings and Nepool and PJM Power Pool open access 
restructurings).   He's a Missouri native and got tired of the DC law firm 
rat race and moved to KC.  Currently a partner at Blackwell Sanders Peper 
Martin--does a lot of Utilicorp/Aquila stuff as you'd expect.  Dave's direct 
dial at work is 816-983-8385 and his home number is 816-407-9026.  

Mark--anything you can do to give this guy a sense of what life is like at 
DOE would be great.  I'm not sure how seriously Dave is being considered for 
the DOE Dep. GC spot, but I know that Fred Fielding and Dick Wiley have done 
some pushing on his behalf.  It may be that a call from you to someone out 
there might put him over the hump.  I'll leave that for you and he to 
discuss.  Thanks and good luck with your various adventures!  df           

Porter and the whole gang called me while you were at lunch MKM.  I'll give 
you a full report when I get off this conf. call but short answer is they 
don't want to meet next wk and want us to provide a bunch more info and then 
meet.  DF

Did Bill Cordes talk to you yesterday about the start date for me to move to

Since the Assistant General Counsel position is equivalent to Sr. Director 
Legal would have to follow these same guidelines for people that are proposed 
to move from Senior Counsel to AGC.
At the year-end 2000 PRC meeting for ETS, we discussed the Senior Director 
title and criteria for its use.  Attached is a recap of that discussion and a 
proposal for the use of this title in ETS prospectively.  Give me a call if 
you have questions or suggestions for modifications.  I would like to 
finalize the criteria prior to the commencement of the 2001 mid-year PEP/PRC 
processes on May 7.

You probably need to look at this.This only addresses expenditure approval 
and does not address "execution" authority. Sometimes non VPs believe that if 
they can approve the expenditure then they can sign contracts in connection 
with the expenditure even in the absence of a power of attorney. Accordingly 
it might be wise to expand the "Delegation" section of this policy.
Please review and provide comments to myself and/or Lisa Sutton.

FYI, based on comments received, attached is the draft which will be 
distributed to Stan's direct reports for comments. We plan to have the policy 
in place before the end of March.

I think one area that needs to be clarified is that many nonVPs believe that 
if they have the expenditure authority they can sign contracts in connection 
with the expenditure they are approving even in the absence of a power of 
attorney. I think we need the policy to clarify the difference between 
expenditure authority and execution authority. Our various company bylaws 
state that only VPs and above have authority to sign contracts and bind the 
company unless the President of the company delegates execution authority. 
Therefore we either need POAs or delegations of authority for execution 
authority below VP. This policy needs to clarify this point. I have sent this 
to Drew and we will work up some new additional language.

Please review and provide comments to myself and/or Lisa Sutton.

Did our HR guys get the apartment lined up for me yet?  I'd like to get that

Lets talk tomorrow about the whole basket of TW issues, including this one.  
thanks. df
I fielded a call today from Mr. Rob Cooper of U.S. Gypsum.  Mr. Cooper 
indicated that he's been in contact with Lorraine for purposes of acquiring 
Red Rock expansion capacity.  Moreover, Mr. Cooper has been in contact with 
SoCal Gas in order that SoCal Gas recognize firm deliveries from Transwestern 
at Needles in excess of the current (sustainable) limit of 750 MMcf/d. 

Mr. Cooper insists that he is making progress with SoCal Gas aimed at lifting 
the 750 window to 760, and that SoCal Gas has indicated U.S. Gypsum would be 
entitled to an exclusive right to the increased amount.   While trying not to 
be argumentative, I told Mr. Cooper that if SoCal Gas was willing to set 
aside a discrete increment of capacity for a single shipper, it would be a 
radical departure from current SoCal Gas policy.  Currently, SoCal Gas does 
not provide unbundled intrastate transmission.  They have only accepted or 
not accepted pipeline nominations, as the case may be, as an aggregate 
volume, with no distinction being drawn on who the upstream shippers were.

I set about to try to explain that there is no correlation (other than 
coincidental timing) between (1) TW discussions with SoCal Gas at raising the 
capacity window at Needles and (2) TW's effort to sell Red Rock Expansion 
space.  In addition, I attempted to explain that TW feels it will be required 
to follow certain rules pursuant to its tariff and FERC policy associated 
with making new delivery point capacity available on a non-discriminatory 
basis.  With respect to this issue, I told Mr. Cooper that, although we're 
currently discussing it, we'd yet to come to any decision on how, if 
incremental capacity does become available at Needles, TW would make such 
delivery point capacity available to its shippers.  

Mr. Cooper then proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how, if that's the 
case, then "he's wasted 3 weeks in active negotiations" with both SoCal Gas 
and TW aimed at securing capacity at Needles.  He said on several occasions 
that "end game" for him was to secure a firm portal from the interstate 
system onto and through the SoCal Gas system.  Mr. Cooper also expressed a 
concern that if he's forced into a competitive bidding situation with other 
big marketing companies (in his words, "such as ENA") for Needles capacity, 
then he probably couldn't compete, and once again, would be left on the 
outside looking in.  He pointed to the El Paso Merchant deal on EPNG as a 
prime example.  

Mr. Cooper said he wasn't ready to accept my explanation as to why TW 
couldn't commit to offering U.S. Gypsum an exclusive right to any incremental 
Needles capacity, and asked that I formally "run it up the flagpole" to 
senior management and get back with him by telephone with TW's "official 
position."   As an editorial comment, I'm not sure Mr. Cooper completely 
understands (or cares about) the landscape here.  I'd go so far as to say 
that from his style and the tone of his conversation with me, he won't easily 
take "no" or even a "maybe" as an answer.   The difficulty for TW is going to 
be in trying to persuade him that we're interested in his business and 
sympathize with his position, but that we face real legal and/or regulatory 
issues here, and they cannot be dismissed or ignored by U.S. Gypsum or any 
other customer.

I'd like to be in a position to call him back on Friday and give him TW's 
"official position" on his request for Needles service in the Red Rock 
expansion.  Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Help?

Great--Martha, pls get me in here for next wk.  I'll be down in Hou all wk I 
think.  I would like to see what else is available, so why don't you give me 
a call on Monday afternoon in Houston and we'll figure out when would work to 
take a look.  Thanks.  DF  (Martha--ignore my earlier email on this subject)

Hello Drew, I wanted to touch base with you regarding your temporary housing 
situation.  Deb Cappiello called me this morning and informed me that the 
Marketing apartment is fully available to you starting on Monday, March 26.  
Deb mentioned that they would still receive the invoices in Omaha, but could 
code the invoice to a Legal cost center if you decided to go with this 
apartment.  

Debra Kallus in the relocation department is available any time to discuss 
alternative temporary housing with you as well.  She has offered to have a 
representative personally show you corporate housing close to downtown if you 
are interested.  Let me know if we need to proceed with Debra further or go 
with the Marketing apartment.  My extension is 3-6609 and cell number 
713-410-3058 if you would like to discuss.  Thanks.

 You will need to add Drew FOssum to the list on officers on several 
companies -- whenever Mike leaves.

Going forward, I would appreciate your informing me of any change affecting 
the slates of the Directors and Officers of ETS entities.  As the liaison 
between this office and the Corporate Services office, I'm frequently 
questioned about these changes.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

Yes--that would be great.  Please remind me what changes need to be 
made--removing mike from the operating company officer slates, etc.  I 
guess.  df

Mike/Drew - Should I prepare the necessary Board documents for the upcoming 
change?

Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.  

I'm going down Sunday night--which flight are you on?  df  

I guess I'm heading to Houston Sunday to help Britt, Becky and Rita on the 
document production and privilege log stuff.  Be sure to call me as soon as 
OneOk calls with their offer to settle.  

I'm good with it, but have one question.  In par. 2, does the reference to 
Sec. 13 of the tariff incorporate the lottery method?  I think that's what we 
are getting at with that reference and I'm ok with it, but I just wanted to 
confirm that's what we meant.  Thanks. df

I could not remember where we were in the process of reviewing these posting 
& bidding procedures so I am sending them around one last time -- if anyone 
has any further comments please let me know.

The author was obviously not aware that the Enron pipelines pride themselves 
in having standardized our "operational nuisances" !!  df

 This brief is not very well written -- many legal mistakes and grammar is 
also really poor.  Here are my questions and 
 comments.  I did, however, enjoy reading about "the unique operational 
nuisances of every interstate pipeline".

I found an old (1945), long FPC case, "In the Matter of the Montana Power 
Company", that deals with Montana Power's reclassification as a public 
utility -  this is one of the few mentions of the Milwaukee railroad:

n38 The witness was also vague when asked to consider a hypothetical case 
similar to that in which John D.

Does this sound like the right case? 

That is unclear at this time--I'll consider this and as I'm not moving for

Will someone residing outside of Texas be replacing you as general counsel of 
NNG?  If so, then that person could replace you.

Thanks Ann--I won't move until Summer, but am aware of this issue (Mike Moran 
reminded me that an Omaha replacement needs to be found).  I've asked our 
paralegal Bill Brown to help find likely suspects but if you have an idea let 
me know what we need to do.  Thanks.  df   

Drew, Will you be moving to Houston soon?  I guess that when you do relocate 
we should find a substitute for you on the OPI director and officer slate.

I have cc: Melinda Winn on this e:mail because she is handling legal matters 
for the tax group now, and would handle the election of a replacement for you.

Thanks--I'll pass that info on to the employment guys.  df 

A friend of a friend (Petula Workman) is looking for a part time legal 
position.
She is a great lawyer -- was on law review, people who worked with her love
her, but she just wants a part time gig since she is a mom with kid
responsibilities.

She wants to work part-time (20-24 hours/week) preferably employment 
litigation, but commercial litigation would work too.

If you have need or know of someone who does, let me know and I'll get her 
resume for you.

thanks

Good--the "to the extent that" phrase is appropriately ambiguous on what 
actually happened--should make Harris happy.  DF

For your comments.

Wow--softball questions.  Two thoughts:  1, should we be gentler on the "lack 
of takeaway capacity" issue?  Steve would know how to play this given Socal's 
position.  2,  Did McKinsey check with Enron before taking this assignment 
from Cal?  The lack of conflict of interest rules in the consultant world 
never ceases to amaze me.  That being said, McKinsey is probably the best 
outfit we could hope for to take this investigation over for Cal.  I'd like 
to be on the call to be sure our script for FERC on the neg. rate deals 
dovetails with what we tell these guys.  Let me know when the call will be.  
We may know what the TW FERC order says before this conversation with 
McKinsey happens so lets talk again before the call.  Thanks.  df  

McKinsey & Co. has been engaged by the State of California to evaluate 
conditions in the gas market to California.  A Mckinsey representative, 
together with a CEC staffer, asked to interview TW next Wednesday, Mar 28 
(time TBD).  I checked with Steve Kean & he encouraged us to proceed (albeit 
with some caution knowing California's great desire to shift blame).

McKinsey forwarded the attached list of questions.  You'll see that they are 
very general & policy oriented.  I have taken a stab at filling in proposed 
answers.

I'd be happy to field the call (together with Steve Harris if he is 
available).  Let me know if you have feedback and/or prefer to handle the 
call yourself.

Got any ideas on who would be the best person in our group to work on this?  
Thanks.  df

I have been asked to be the Legal Department stakeholder for the final 
development and implementation of the iBuyit program.  Basically, iBuyit is 
an intranet based procurement and payables systems being developed for 
implementation across Enron.  It is intended that this system will become the 
standard method for purchasing any number of services and for paying the 
invoices associated with these purchases.

As a stakeholder, it is my responsibility to assist with the development of 
the product and its marketing (internal to the various Enron Legal 
Departments).  In order to ensure that the development and implementation run 
as planned, the program calls for the appointment of "Change Agents," - 
defined as:

"individuals who are highly respected within their area and known as the 'GO 
TO' people among their peers."

Though I am sure this definition fits each of you to a tee within your 
respective departments, I am also well aware that schedules may prohibit you 
from being the Change Agent.  Accordingly, what I am in need of is assistance 
in designating that one person within your respective departments who can 
become the Change Agent for your group.  The responsibilities of this 
position are the following:

 - to disseminate communications regarding the project
- to develop awareness and ownership of the product among their department
- to encourage use of the product
- identify those who will need training
- encourage peer training attendance 
- engage in rumor control (basically relay the facts of the program and not 
the myths (e.g., the product will replace jobs))

In picking the appropriate candidate, I would make sure that he/she has a 
working knowledge of the procurement and payables practices of your group, 
together with knowledge of the SAP system.  Since the iBuyit system will 
interface with SAP, this latter knowledge would be very useful.

Please let me know as soon as possible who is the likely candidate from your 
group so that I can meet with them and bring them up to speed on the 
program.  For your benefit, I have attached below the general information 
that has been provided to stakeholders about  the program.

If any of you should have any questions, please call me.

Thanks.

You have been selected to attend a Stakeholders Kickoff Luncheon on March 
20th from 11:00 AM to 1:00 PM at the Double Tree Hotel in the Travis Room, to 
learn more about the new iBuyit Payables Workflow tool.  The iBuyit Payables 
Workflow tool is fully automated and will allow for greater ease and accuracy 
when coding and approving invoices.  

At the luncheon:
o You will be the first to see the iBuyit Payables Workflow tool 
o We will be asking you for input on the tool 
o We will reveal more about your role in the success of the iBuyit Payables 
Workflow tool

Please review the attached Stakeholder Roles and Responsibilities and the

for you at the luncheon. Also, please bring your list of identified Change 
Agents with you. (Change Agent is defined in the Stakeholder Roles and 
Responsibilities attachment)

If you cannot personally attend, be certain to send an alternate.  Direct any 
questions about the event or any special dietary requests to Judy Knepshield 
at X-35788.

Here are my comments--I'd like to take out the stuff about the rate and any 
implication that we have flexible terms and conditions.  DF

Please see the attached and let me know your comments as soon as possible.

FYI.  Feel free to sit in so you have a better sense of what you might face

either Shelley's or Steve's office.  DF
  Scott Tomashefsky with the California Energy Commission would like to 
schedule a call from 5-6 PM (3-4 PT) on Wed, Mar. 28 to discuss the questions.
I gave him my number to call.  Drew and I will sit in from here.  Steve - let

I think we do say that in the "to the extent we didn't get binding bids for 
all of the capacity" sentence.  With that clarification, I think we ought to 
get this posted and the letters out to shippers.  Susan--make it so.  
Thanks.  df  

   
	
	

As revised is ok, letter also,  but shouldn't we refer to the fact we didn't 
get binding bids, since we are way beyond March 2nd?  MK

   
	
	

Here are my comments--I'd like to take out the stuff about the rate and any

Thanks--I appre ciate your willingness to help.  One thought Dot had is that 
it might make sense to use someone (i.e., Denise or Ja) who does the actual 
entry of payables into SAP.  Do you do any of that stuff directly on SAP?  
Stop by and grab me for a minute and we'll decide who to use for this.  df

Business/Financial Desk; Section A
Deal for Use of Gas Pipeline Stirs Dispute on Competition
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and LOWELL BERGMAN

03/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 4
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Early last year, the El Paso Natural Gas Company took bids from two dozen 
companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline from 
Texas and New Mexico to meet one-sixth of the daily demand of energy-starved 
California. 
The winner: El Paso's sister company, the El Paso Merchant Energy Company, 
which buys, sells and trades natural gas. The bidding was not close. El Paso 
Merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid, 
in total, for bits and pieces.
Why pay so much more? California officials, who are pressing a complaint 
against El Paso at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, say the answer 
is simple. The state contends that El Paso Merchant, with help from its 
sister company, saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of 
natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity. 
According to sealed documents obtained by The New York Times that are part of 
filings in the federal case, executives at El Paso Merchant said internally 
that the deal would give them ''more control'' of gas markets, including the 
''ability to influence the physical market'' to benefit the company's 
financial positions. 
El Paso executives called the accusations fanciful, and in a formal response 
to California's complaint, said the state ''grossly distorted'' company 
documents by quoting words and phrases out of context. 
The dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the 
natural gas industry, which fuels a growing share of the nation's electric 
power plants. 
At issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive 
abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas, and whether federal 
regulators adequately enforce existing rules. In particular, many industry 
officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor 
unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximize 
profits. 
More than 200,000 miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country, 
moving natural gas from Canada, the Southwest and other producing regions to 
fuel factories, power utilities and heat houses. 
Not long ago, many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity. But 
experts say that several regions, including California, New York and New 
England, now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants. 
In California, state officials and utility executives said the documents in 
the federal case, and El Paso's actions, were proof that the state's energy 
crisis stemmed not just from an ill-conceived deregulation plan but from 
price manipulation and profiteering. 
''They are the market maker with this pipeline,'' said Loretta Lynch, the 
president of the California Public Utilities Commission, which has struggled 
to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages. 
El Paso ''sets the price in California,'' Ms. Lynch said, and what it did was 
intentional. ''It has affected the price,'' she said, ''for everything 
related to heat and electrical power prices in the state.'' 
California's complaint to the federal agency contends that El Paso Merchant 
''has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity'' on 
the pipeline. The state also charges that El Paso Natural Gas, the pipeline's 
owner, has had no incentive to spur competition, by offering discounts to 
other users, because the two companies are corporate siblings. The state said 
that El Paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit 
anticompetitive behavior. 
The sealed filings in the El Paso case indicated that the company expected to 
make money by widening the ''basis spread'' -- the difference between what 
gas can be bought for in producing basins of Texas and New Mexico, at one end 
of the pipeline, and its price on delivery to Southern California. 
As it turned out, spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price 
of gas soared in California, adding to costs for wholesale electricity that 
pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy. California utilities paid $6.2 
billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10 
months, state officials estimated. The utilities are not allowed to recoup 
the costs from customers. While the cost of 1,000 cubic feet of gas typically 
is less than $1 higher at the California end of the pipeline, spot prices in 
the state rose to almost $50 more than the Texas-New Mexico price in 
December. 
To executives of the parent company, the El Paso Corporation, the accusations 
of market manipulation are ludicrous. 
High gas prices in California, El Paso executives said in interviews, are 
easily explained by soaring demand, the poor credit standing of the state's 
utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or 
store enough gas for winter. 
''The idea that anybody is holding back on California is really ridiculous,'' 
said Clark C. Smith, president of El Paso Merchant's operations in North 
America. 
Some El Paso customers, though, agreed with California officials. The Pacific 
Gas & Electric Company, the San Francisco-based utility, condemned El Paso in 
a filing with the federal agency after its lawyers reviewed the sealed 
company documents. 
''It is now very clear from the business records of El Paso Energy 
Corporation,'' the utility said in the filing, ''that the business strategy 
El Paso Merchant was authorized at the highest corporate levels to pursue 
involved manipulation of price spreads.'' 
The agency has not ruled on California's complaint, which asks that the deal 
between El Paso Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant be invalidated. Based on the 
agency's history of policing energy providers lightly, many industry 
observers predicted that the complaint would be dismissed, perhaps as soon as 
the agency's public meeting on Wednesday. 
Nonetheless, El Paso Merchant is feeling some pressure. The subsidiary said 
recently that it planned to relinquish control of all but about 22 percent of 
the capacity on the pipeline to California, rather than exercise an option 
that would have allowed it to retain the entire capacity of 1.2 billion cubic 
feet of gas a day. 
Critics said they believed El Paso made the move in hopes of lessening the 
chance of government action. El Paso executives deny that but do say that 
their decision was influenced by the backlash over the arrangement. 
Surrendering the pipeline capacity made for a ''gut-wrenching'' decision, Mr. 
Smith said, but was ''a first-class gesture'' to California. El Paso Merchant 
paid $38.5 million to control the pipeline capacity from March 1, 2000, until 
May 31, 2001. While Mr. Clark said he did not know the return on that 
investment, he acknowledged that it was lucrative. 
''No doubt about it,'' Mr. Clark said, ''we made good money.'' 
The question of whether El Paso's conduct has driven gas prices higher is 
expected to be scrutinized by legislators in Sacramento this week. The 
company also faces several lawsuits, including one by the city of Los 
Angeles, that accuse it of conspiring with other companies to prevent 
pipeline projects that could have eased California's energy crisis. El Paso 
denied the accusation. 
With pipeline capacity and gas supplies tighter, concerns about 
anticompetitive behavior have increased as price volatility has created 
soaring profits for energy marketers and traders. 
Dynegy Inc., a Houston-based energy trader, was once the target of complaints 
to federal regulators that it had artificially raised prices by abusing 
capacity that it controlled on El Paso's pipeline to California. 
In a filing with regulators in January, Dynegy contended that pipeline 
companies routinely favored affiliates. ''Abuses abound because of financial 
windfalls, difficulty of detection, lengthy investigations and increased 
complexity of the market,'' the company said. 
''There are some red flags right now,'' said William L. Massey, a member of 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission since 1993. Mr. Massey said he was 
troubled by the potential for abuses when pipeline companies own gas and 
power marketing subsidiaries as well as electric plants fueled by natural 
gas. El Paso is in all those businesses. 
''What the commission ought to be serious about is: What are the forces at 
work? Is it simply robust markets responding to true supply-and-demand 
signals, or is it a market defined by market power and some measure of 
affiliate abuse?'' he said. 
Many in the industry do not believe changes are needed. 
''There are rules in place today that protect against affiliate abuse,'' said 
Stanley Horton, chief executive for gas pipeline operations at the Enron 
Corporation and chairman of the Interstate Natural Gas Association of 
America, the industry's trade group, referring to the rules under which 
California has brought its complaint about El Paso. 
To its critics, El Paso epitomizes the competitive concerns. It operates the 
nation's largest network of interstate pipelines and owns one of the largest 
reserves of natural gas. With its recent acquisition of the Coastal 
Corporation, another large pipeline operator, El Paso has a market 
capitalization of $32 billion. 
At a conference at El Paso headquarters in Houston in February, analysts 
heard executives predict net profits of $1.7 billion this year. El Paso's 
much better known rival, Enron, with its headquarters a few blocks away, is 
expected to earn about $1.4 billion. 
El Paso Merchant provides the strongest growth. Two years ago, the unit's 
profits, before interest payments and taxes, were $99 million; this year, it 
is expected to have $700 million in North America alone. In its latest 
quarterly report, El Paso attributed those profits, in part, to ''commodity 
market and trading margins'' that were enhanced by ''power price volatility, 
particularly in the Western United States.'' 
Critics contend that El Paso set out to exploit those conditions. According 
to the sealed filings, on Feb. 14, 2000, the day before El Paso Merchant was 
awarded the pipeline capacity, executives made a presentation to William A. 
Wise, chief executive of the parent company, laying out the rationale for the 
bid. 
The presentation outlined what it termed ''strategic advantages,'' including 
''more control of total physical markets'' and the ''ability to influence the 
physical market to the benefit of any financial/hedge position,'' according 
to the sealed filings. The passages suggested that El Paso expected the deal 
to give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to 
support financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to 
limit its risk. 
For every one-cent increase in the spread on gas prices, the presentation 
said, El Paso Merchant stood to make an additional $2.4 million. 
Under the heading ''Challenges,'' according to the sealed filings, the 
presentation stated that storage was needed ''to help manipulate physical 
spreads, adding to the overall transport/storage cost.'' 
On April 14, according to the sealed filings, El Paso Merchant's president at 
the time, Greg G. Jenkins, wrote a memorandum to Mr. Wise involving an update 
for directors meeting later that month. The memorandum stated: ''We will make 
money two ways: 1) increase the load factor, 2) widen the basis spread.'' 
The language appears to suggest that El Paso Merchant would profit by 
increasing the gas flow in the pipeline -- the load factor -- while 
increasing the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and 
what it could be sold for at the other end -- the basis spread. 
In an interview, Mr. Smith, the El Paso Merchant executive, said that the 
unit's prices, and profits, on bulk gas sales in California were locked in 
months in advance, so that the company could not benefit from rising prices 
in the spot market. 
Otherwise, Mr. Smith declined to provide any details about money made on the 
pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in 
prices ahead of time. In addition, Mr. Smith said that nearly all of El Paso 
Merchant's pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last 
year, with no capacity withheld to increase prices. 
The company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in 
the sealed documents. But El Paso Merchant, in a filing with federal 
regulators, said California's complaint had ''misconstrued and incorrectly 
interpreted'' what it termed ''snippets of data.''

To All -

Just a follow-up message to each of you about the iBuyit program.  

I am still in need of a designated volunteer from each of your groups to act 
as a Change Agent for this program.  Since it is a Corp. initiative and will 
be implemented over time, I need to make sure all areas of the Legal Dept. 
are on board.  

Please provide me with the name of at least one person within your group who 
fits the Change Agent bill.  For those that have forgotten, the Change Agent 
is defined as follows:

"individuals who are highly respected within their area and known as the 'GO 
TO' people among their peers."

Their responsibilities are:

- to disseminate communications regarding the project
- to develop awareness and ownership of the product among their department
- to encourage use of the product
- identify those who will need training
- encourage peer training attendance 
- engage in rumor control (basically relay the facts of the program and not 
the myths (e.g., the product will replace jobs))

Information needs to be distributed to these individuals as soon as possible 
so that they can be prepared for demonstrations of the iBuyit product next 
week.

Thanks for your assistance.

If any of you have any questions, please let me know.

I need to get on msoft outlook asap and get off lotus notes.  To accomplish 
that, I'd like CMS contract approval emails to go to Tony for the south end 
end and Dari for the North end, for discussion with me orally and approval on 
their computers.  Can we do this??   If not, we need a better system that 
allows me to get off lotus notes.  thanks. df

Great.  DF

Attached is the TW expansion filing press release.  With the filing being 
made on Thursday, March 29, we'll plan to issue the release to natural gas 
industry publications after the market closes on Thursday, March 29. 

Please review the press release one last time.  This draft includes changes I 
previously received from Rex, Drew, Steve Harris, Mary Kay Miller, Stan and 
Shelley Corman.

Please let me know if you have additional changes by noon on Thursday, March 
29.

Also attached is a filing fact sheet that will be used as reference for media 
calls.  Please let me know of changes to the fact sheet by Thursday, March 
29, at noon as well.

Thanks for your immediate attention.

Attached is the latest version of the Segmentation Brief.  You should note 
that it contains three new sections-III A (drafted by Mark Cook) and III C & 
D (drafted by Ken Driver).  I received some comments on the prior versions of 
these new sections, but did not incorporate them.  If your comments/concerns 
are not addressed in the new sections, let me know.

We hope to circulate tomorrow the title page and signature block.  The next 
version of the brief which will be circulated on Friday, March 30th, will 
contain table of contents, table of authorities and will be completely cite 
checked.  In the meantime, you will notice that there are several incomplete 
cites or record references.  We could use help completing these, if you have 
the information.

Tell him I'm already migrated to Windows 2000, but that they just havent' put 
outlook on it yet. Maybe that will help.  df  

Drew, I talked to Kelly Strader today about migrating you next week....He is 
having some problems getting that  implemented....I asked him to get a name 
of who can get it pushed through and how badly you need to be migrated and 
he's going to get back with me tomorrow hopefully.  He says they aren't 
migrating anyone right now which doesn't make a lot of sense to me.....Once I 
have a name it might take a call from you ...I'll let you know more...when I 
hear....

Emily:  Drew should be totally removed from our CMS system now, and you can 
proceed with getting him transfered to Outlook.

Drew,

I have replaced you with both Dari and Tony in the routing system.  They will 
both receive all CAF's that would have come to you and should be able to 
approve them. 

Dari, Tony - if you have any problems approving let me know.  Unfortunately 
there is not a way at this time to split out north and south deals so you 
both will receive all general counsel level CAF's.   If this becomes a 
problem let me know and I will try to do something for you.  

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  

Thanks

Linda

I could see accruing $100,000 for legal fees on the ONeOk arbitration--which 
will be concluded in May.  We could also reserve against OneOk's 
counterclaim--which is about $4 million.  We expect a final arbitration 
decision 15 days after close of the hearing which should be well within the 
2d quarter.  We may decide to use post-hearing briefs, however, which might 
push the decision into the third quarter.  Let me know if either of these is 
worth pursuing.  DF    

Guys - anything we can do on the environmental side???

Drew & Mike - any thoughts on legal fees????

We reviewed the forecast with Stan this afternoon, and Stan requested that we 
do everything possible to accrue as much expense in March as we can (to the 
benefit of 2nd and 3rd quarters).  I recommend that you focus on larger 
amounts.

Please send your projections to Vera as soon as possible.

Lou,  Are there any environmental or PCB reimbursements that we could 
legitimately accrue in March?

Thanks for your help!

It appears today that ETS will end the first Quarter with at least $25 
Million additional dollars due to improved Revenue Margins.   This assumes 
that Operations will end the Quarter Flat with Plan.   If we end up under 
Plan, then it adds to this amount, and of course if we end up over it 
subtracts.

It is imperative that we provide to Vera an accurate projection of where we 
will end this quarter, asap, but no later than Thursday of this week.

Our preference would be to push as much of this $25 million into the second 
or third quarter.

We should make every effort to project our spending for March, compare our 
actuals to plan for January and February and provide Vera this projection.

We should also look to the outer quarters to see if we know of any major 
payments we have to make during these quarters and accrue for them.   We 
should also get with all our AP clerks and make sure that we have paid all 
the bills we possibly can before the end of this week, including working 
Saturday, if we have to.

Shirley Jo - please make sure that we have properly received everything 
through the system that can be properly accounted for.

Thanks,

First question:  "yes."  Maria, please draft something up for Mike.  Second 
question: "your call."  Maria or I could be available if you think it would 
be productive.  If they are going to get into any deal structure issues, or 
any questions on the documents, its probably a good idea.  DF  

   
	
	

Drew - Do I need some kind of confidentiality agreement? An attorney present 
to discuss at first meeting?

MKM - One questions Jim Gill had was how do we get around FERC requirements - 
someone from Regulatory available to discuss at first meeting or.....?

Although we believe the operating agreement and other details are in order, I 
hadn't just planned to send them as is to Hanover. Some counseling may be in 
order here, as I'm moving into new territory for me......

Mike,

Talked to Jim Gill at 4:30 pm.  They are very interested.  He proposed the 
following steps:

1)  Send him an equipment list.  I think the Description and Location 
Schedule 1.1 from the P&S Agreement would more than suffice.

2)  He would like to visit the stations with the Hanover V.P. of Operations 
and one other person.  (He indicated 3 total.)  A quasi due diligence look at 
the condition of the facilities.  He would like access to records etc. during 
his visit.

3)  We could set down and talk "financials" after that.

He did not seemed surprised that I did not have good station plot plans to 
supplement the equipment list.  I will get a package together tomorrow.  
[Forgot to get his address. dah!]

I conjectured that you would want to discuss this with him further tomorrow.  
He said he would be in all day.

Here are the stray facts I mentioned:
  Sulfur River system:  1200 miles of gathering in East Texas and some 
treating/processing
  approx. 170 mmcf/d of throughput currently; significant growth expected 
from new drilling [?]
   EBITDA:  $40mm/yr
   Rex Kouri (sp?) is the founding equity in Sulfur River  (I haven't heard 
of him, but they acted like I should have) 
   An outfit named "Energy Spectrum" put $30 mm in equity into Sulfur River a 
few years ago and thinks now would be a good time to cash out
   $90 mm in debt
   $1/mmbtu gath/proc. margins
  The guys I talked to said the Sulfur River assets, coupled with the Koch 
upstream assets in the area, would make an interesting combined play.
   Koch was asking $200 mil. for their gathering assets a year ago or so--I 
don't know if its the exact set of assets that Pat and Jerry were suggesting 
we'd want to include in the package.

The two guys involved are Pat Keeley, of Friedman Billings and Ramsay in DC 
and Jerry Langdon (the ex-FERC Commissioner), who is an investor/dealmaker.  
Let me know if you want me to get these guys to come in and pitch this deal 
to you/your team.  Reminder--Langdon is talking to Stan on the 10th on EOTT 
and he may bug Stan about this stuff, so it may be good to get to Stan 
first.  DF 
 

I had a prior obligation at lunch on Mon.  We need to reschedule the 
Leadership Dev. mtg.  Fran, could you work with Emily and find a time?  
Sorry, I know I've disrupted this twice n ow!  I'm good for lunch on Wed if 
that would work for everyone.  df

Yes, lets continue to have the pre-meetings formerly known as Mike's every 
Mon. at 8:30 (pls put on my calendar Emily).  I'll be in Houston this Monday 
so just come to my office at 8:30 if you are both here.  Dot, pls cover the 
staff meeting on Monday, April 9 as I'll be on vacation.  Also, pls cover the 
Derrick large GC meeting at 9:00 am on April 12 as I'll be at NN's Keyex 
meeting in Cal.  (I may be able to call in to this but would like you to 
cover anyway in case something goes haywire). Thanks df 

 If Mike has "checked out", will he then not be here on Monday at 8:30 for 
pre-Stan meeting, or what?  Should I just 
 call Drew?   When? 

I've asked Fran to reschedule this--sorry.  df

Laura and Fran asked me reschedule their meeting with you and after checking 
everyone's schedule it looks like 11:30 to 1:00 on Monday is the only time I 
can get all of you together.    They have reserved EB1136 and are providing 
lunch so please mark your calendars.

I will be out tomorrow but back on Monday so if a conflict should come up 
before Monday call Jan Cobden at 3-6044.

This may be a good idea, but lets not forget that BP is the entity formerly 
known as "BP Amoco" which, if I'm not mistaken, is the home of Jeff 
Hooligan.  That guy sees evil in every pipeline deal,a nd may not have even 
known that his commercial people were doing deals with TW.  I'd like to think 
that the commercial people at BP have more clout than Hooligan and Kathy 
Edwards, but I wouldn't bet the ranch on that.  df  

I'm assuming that BP Energy which is part of Indicated Shippers' Protest is 
the same BP Energy which entered into a negotiated rate transaction with TW 
for March.  Is it worth it to give their business person a call and see if 
they can get Kathie to withdraw the protest?  Let's discuss if you think we 
might get somewhere with them.  Thanks, maria

That's a better idea.  df

Are we still considering adding ETS-owned generation at one or more of the TW 
compressor stations in Arizona or NM?  In case that is still a possibility, 
let me pass on something we may want to follow up on.  I called an old law 
partner of mine from DC who is now in the generation development business 
this week to have lunch and catch up.  This guy says he has come up with a 
good formula for getting new generation built fast and cheap.  He's got an 
80mw nameplate simple cycle project (two frame 6 turbines) under development 
in Utah that he started development on a month ago and is projected to go in 
service on July 1.  Pretty quick work compared to other projects I've seen.  
Here's his racket:

1.  He gets used, first quality turbines that have been well maintained.  His 
Utah turbines are something like 2 year old GE units that he bought from 
Tokyo Electric (he said they had 4000 hours on them and were maintained in 
typical electric utility gold plated style).  He didn't say, but I suspect 
there is no warranty on the units.  Obviously, this isn't a bold new 
strategy, but this guy claims to have a good handle on available used 
equipment.

2.  His siting/permitting strategy is to use "brownfield" sites--i.e., 
existing industrial or utility infrastructure is there along with some 
existing air emissions sources.  His Utah site is at the Magnesium Corp. of 
America plant on the Great Salt Lake. Magcorp is an ex-client of mine and I 
know it is a huge emissions source and has no Nimby issues.  Our compressor 
sites, in contrast, are not major emissions sites but may have some other 
things in common with this strategy.

3.  Here's a mysterious one--he says the financing is backstopped by the site 
owner (Magcorp in his project, potentially us if we do a TW project) but the 
corporate structure he has designed results in the power plant being treated 
as a non-controlled, non-affiliated entity for air permitting purposes.  That 
means the power plant emissions are not treated as part of the same emissions 
source as the host/site.  I'm not sure how/whether this works in a TW 
scenario, but it might be worth looking at.  We'd need to make sure that any 
power plant deal we chase doesn't screw up the timetable on the RedRock 
expansion application at FERC.  MKM--if we could preserve the "separate 
source" concept for air permitting purposes, could we even start work on 
developing a power project soon or would we be better off to wait until we 
have a FERC certificate in hand??       
    
Let me know if there is anything worth pursuing on this.  I'm having lunch 
with this guy on Mon. and will probably learn more.  The thing he is proudest 
of is that given the low permitting cost and relatively cheap cost of 
installed capacity, the project is expected to pay for itself in TWO MONTHS 
and then generate 100% upside.  Sounds good to me if its real.  DF

This sounds great--I take it that they are still seeking interconnects with 
us and El Paso, but it sounds like an FT agreement for most or all of their 
MDQ may be likely.  Super.  df 

Kirk,
Great to hear that the project is moving forward.  I think TW feels it's 
emotionally vested at this point!  I will ask the Facility Planning folks to 
get started on providing a more detailed "budget quality" estimate of the 
cost to construct the interconnect and metering station.  With recent changes 
in FERC regulations concerning pregranted authority to construct delivery 
points, TW can immediately proceed to build without the complication of a 
FERC prior notice filing as was required in the past.  

Therefore, the only limiting factor at this point is the time it takes to put 
together the estimate, as well as the documentation we'll need in order to 
implement a new delivery point on the system.  To this end, I see the 
following documents:

 1.  Letter Agreement authorizing TW to open a work order to proceed with the 
budget quality estimate.  This will involve a commitment by Big Sandy to 
reimburse TW for the cost of the engineering if Big Sandy ultimately pulls 
out of the project.
 2.  A Facilities Construction and Operating Agreement providing for the 
reimbursement by Big Sandy for TW's construction of the tap and/or metering 
station.  This agreement would also provide for TW's operation of the 
metering station if Big Sandy elects to it to TW specification in order to 
avoid the CIAC.
 3.  An Operator Balancing Agreement (OBA), a standard tariff form agreement 
defining the role of Big Sandy as delivery point operator as well as the 
disposition of any volumetric imbalances that may accrue during the month.

From a timeline standpoint, we can be in the position to get these documents 
completed within a relatively short time (30 - 60 days?) depending on whether 
there are any sticking points in our negotiations.  By the way, the only 
agreement that may take some time to work through is no. 2 on the list, 
although with our recent experience in hooking up other plants on the system 
this past year, we've already done a lot of the "lawyering" spade work.

Not that I'm especially found of meetings, but it's been a while since we've 
met to discuss the physical requirements of the facilities.  Moreover, we've 
got some new people in our Facility Planning and Engineering and Construction 
groups who would benefit from meeting their counter parties on the project 
side.  May I suggest a face-to-face meeting where I can bring our planners 
and engineers to meet with their counter parties to kick off this project?  
We can meet anywhere its convenient for you guys.  

I look forward to working with you on this project.

Jeff-
Well it has been a few weeks since we last discussed the Big Sandy
Project, and I want to move forward based on our last
conversation/e-mail.

Specifically, I would like to formalize a more detailed interconnect
(MSA/tap) study and associated cost estimate for Big Sandy.  I also want
to obtain from you a timeline, including all the necessary
documents/agreements, based on a projected Big Sandy online date of
8/1/03.

At this point, I am recommending that the Project look to TW for most if
not all of its' natural gas requirements, and thus, the pressure
integration issue is not relevant.
We are simply looking for a TW tap with mainline pressure, and a TW
constructed MSA.
I understand the CIAC issue, and as such, the Project may elect to
construct the MSA per TW specs, to mitigate the tax implications.

Please let me know what additional information require to support this
activity.
Thank you in advance for your efforts in bringing this project to
commercialization.

Kirk

As you'll see in the Legal bullets, TW Commercial has asked me to look into 
the following issue.
As you probably know, SoCalGas is proposing to add compression to its system, 
which will result in at least 50,000 MMcf/d additional takeaway capacity from 
Needles by Dec. 2001.
TW's shippers have gotten wind of this thru the trade press and are already 
calling TW to ask about the availability of additional Needles capacity.  
Many of them are already shippers to Topock who would love to switch their 
primary point to Needles.
The issue is this:  One of the reasons Red Rock capacity has been so slow to 
sell is that we have no more Needles capacity available, and shippers are 
less enthusiastic about shipping to Topock.  Our marketers would like to 
earmark the new Needles delivery point capacity for use by Red Rock shippers, 
rather than let existing shippers move primary points.  This will help to 
sell out the expansion space.
I am looking thru my file of cases on the topic of reserving capacity for 
expansions, to see if it gets us anywhere.  I'll let you know what I find.

up a conference call to discuss this sometime next week.  Thanks.

Hey I'm watching your fair city on the tube--I suppose you are at the NCAA 
final.  I'm stuck down here in Houston again--been down here at least 3 days 
every week for a month.  Sandra digs it--at least I'm out of her face.  She 
was down here last week with me for 3 days looking at schools and houses with 
the 3 girls.  That car was full of bitching, whining and crying.  And the 
kids got a little cranky too.  Gonna come and visit us???  We'll probably 
move in August--bring your dad's pickup and you can help!  What a great time 
to move when its 200 degrees and the fire ants and poisonous lizards are in 
full frenzy.  Ugh.  We've gotta hook up with you guys before then.  We're out 
for Easter week, but we'll need a quick road trip eventually.  It would also 
be cool if you guys want to come down--Omaha would seem like Cancun after the 
winter you've had!  Take care dude. DF   

no--golf's great!  df

Drew, just a FYI....I signed you up for golf at the Law Conference for 
Thursday afternoon....you were out of pocket and Martha said you like 
golf....I can change it to Skeet shooting or rafting on the Guadalupe if 
you'd rather do that.....!!!!! Seriously, let me know if you want me to 
change it....

Did we ever look at that storage project up near Sacramento?  I think its

would they buy an intrastate, CPUC-regulated storage project??  Maybe to 
backstop their generation portfolio??  df

Thanks Brian.  I'd delete ", oil and gas pipeline" and replace it with 
"utility" at the end of line 3 to make it a bit broader.  Also, I've run this

participation in this corporate working group (see below).  Very glad to have 
you.  Other group members are from  various parts of Public Affairs, both 
U.S. and International.  Mike also said you may want to have Maria Pavlou 
participate, which I leave up to you.  The perspective from the pipeline 
group will be a great addition to our effort.

Please see the note below and respond at your earliest convenience.  Thanks 
very much.

One of Steve Kean's newly formed Working Groups is for "Rates & Tariffs".  I 
have been asked to lead this group.  For those of you who don't know me, I am 
in Houston in the U.S./Canada Government Affairs group, in a section called 
"Rates/Regulatory Services."  Our working group will have about a dozen or so 
people from various parts of Public Affairs.  You have been 
selected/volunteered to participate in this effort by your group leaders.  

The Working Group members are:
Ray Alvarez
Sergio Assad
Roy Boston
Mike Grimes
Kyran Hanks
Rita Hartfield
Nancy Hetrick
Tom Hoatson
Paul Kaufman
Valeria Lima
Bob Neustaedter

Having this group will give us a great opportunity to identify needs related 
to rate and tariff issues across many business lines and countries, share 
resources, problems and solutions, and generally improve the cohesiveness of 
Steve's organization   One of our first tasks will be to think through and 
concretely specify what we expect to accomplish as a group.   We do not have 
a specific product mandate per se - it will be up to us to figure it out and 
deliver it.   Some possibilities are - identifying rates and tariffs policy 
positions, developing policies where none now exist, but are needed, 
identifying rates and tariff resources available to the group, and acquiring 
resources needed by the group. 

As a preliminary matter, could you e-mail me your group name, position, 
location, phone, e-mail address, and "area of expertise".  We will assemble 
this information in a roster to be distributed to the group.

Early in January, we will be in touch to check availability and schedule an 
initial meeting.  Please be as flexible as possible.  In some cases, we are 
many time zones apart and it will be difficult to match everyone's desired 
time. 

As a second preliminary matter, please give some thought to and e-mail me 
what you think a group like this should accomplish.  Remember, the roster 
above has some of the world's leading authorities on rates and tariffs!   We 
will compile both the complete roster and your ideas on group goals and 
distribute them to everybody prior to our first actual meeting.   At that 
first meeting, we will talk through expectations of us and of each other, and 
the proposed goals.  
Please have your inputs to me by January 7.  I look forward to working with 
you.   

As I mentioned in my voice mail, please check up on the signing bonus we 
agreed to pay Tony Pryor.  He didn't get it and we need to get that fixed 
asap.  I'll be at 37555 tomorrow and back in Omaha Monday.  If you learn 
something tomorrow and can't get ahold of me, please leave me a voice mail.  
Thanks.  DF

In doing some research for Dorothy regarding salaries charged to work orders, 
I was advised by Judy Lin and James Weitekamp with accounting, that we need 
to provide Judy Lin with a payroll fixed percentage distribution by 
employee.  For example:

RC - 0237 Eric Benson .10 Navajo Work Order (work order number)
    .90 salary charged to RC

The report to Judy should be for each employee within your respective RC's.  
I have the allocation or percentages for Lou's RC but do not have the 
percentages for Drew and Dorothy.  If you like, please provide this 
information to me and I will be happy to send the request on to Judy Lin in 
accounting who will make all necessary corrections for January and February 
payroll.

 You all should have received by now a photocopy of the 1998 Compliance 
Report from the Enron Gas Pipeline Group Compliance Committee that may be

to you all, we requested that handwritten comments/updates be provided to my 
attention by February 15th.

 I have yet to receive any such comments/updates.  Please provide any 
comments/updates by the end of this week so the report can be finalized and 
sent to Sharon Butcher within the time frame she requested.  If there are no

I received a resume from a Creighton Law School student (will graduate May, 
2001) requesting an internship in either marketing, regulatory or legal.  
Prior to entering law school, he worked as an assistant to the General 
Counsel of Duke Energy in Denver  (from May, 1997 - August, 1998) where he 
became  familiar with some of the regulatory/legal aspects of the natural gas 
transportation and processing industry.  He indicates that he is particularly 
interested in gaining knowledge regarding compliance with FERC regulatory 
requirements and interstate pipeline tariffs.  He's done paralegal work for 
several attorneys in the Denver area since April, 1996 and while attending 
the Denver Paralegal Institute (ABA Paralegal Certificate received in June, 
1996).  He also has a BA in History/Political Science from Jamestown College 
in Jamestown, ND, in 1995.

It's not often that we have an opportunity to bring in an intern with some 
experience in the industry.   Please let me know if you are interested in 
reviewing his resume and can find some meaningful work for him this summer.

Please join me in congratulating our colleagues on their promotions.  Dari 
Dornan, Maria Pavlou and Jim Talcott have been promoted to Senior Counsel 
III, effective June 1.  Additionally, Kathy Ringblom has been promoted to 
Senior Legal Assistant, also effective June 1.  Congratulations, Dari, Maria, 
Jim and Kathy and thank you for your motivation, enthusiasm, and consistently 
high quality work!  DF

I am advised that some of you have not exhibited the requisite amount of 
"pep."  For lawyers and paralegals, you need to pick your reviewers online if 
you haven't already done so.  5 or 6 would be sufficient althought the 
computer lets you pick up to 10.  For those of you who picked more than 5 or 
6 I have reduced that number, based on my thoughts about which of your chosen 
reviewers have had the most direct contact with you and are most likely to 
give a thorough review.  Let me know if you think I really blew it.  For 
secretaries, the online stuff is optional.  If you don't use it, I will 
solicit input from the people you work with like I have in the past and 
consolidate it with my own comments on one form.   Thanks.  DF

I believe Allday is being deposed in Austin, which is still the capital of 
Texas, not the United States (although I understand that our next president 
is thinking about changing that!)  DF

In your weekly report, I noted that Martin Allday's deposition is scheduled 
righ before mine on June 6-7.  I also seem to recall that due to some medical 
issues, Mr. Allday's deposition will be conducted in Washington DC.  If our 
lawers and Conoco's lawyers will be in DC, I could just as easily fly to DC 
vs. Houston for my deposition.  

Is this worth pursuing?????

Here's one for you to chew on for awhile.  As we approach the transition to a 
new organizational structure in ET&S, let's rethink the role and competencies 
of the legal department.  I'd like each of you to answer the following 
questions and circulate your answers to me and each other.  To avoid having 
anyone's answers unduly influenced by anyone else's, please send your 
responses at 12 noon on Thursday.  No, this isn't being graded, and doesn't 
affect the PRC process or any other process.  I just want to get access to as 
much original thinking as possible.

1.  What is the ET&S law dept. currently best at?  (give one example).  

2.  What is the ET&S law dept. currently worst at?  (give one example).

3.  Without regard for any past objectives, what should our top 3 objectives 
be?  (make these very specific--objectives like "We should manage legal and 
regulatory compliance and optimize shareholder value"  don't cut it).  

Thanks for your responses.  DF

I think we both ought to (and the shippers as well if someone can talk them 
into filing).  We aren't a shipper but we do get happy customers and maybe 
even more throughput from the deal, so we clearly have a legitimate interest 
in expedited treatment.   DF

   
	
	

I'd suggest that Southwest Gas make the filing to expedite vs TW,  it always 
seems strange to me when someone other than the applicant files unless the 
party is an actual shipper which we are not--  thoughts???   MK

   
	
	

As you know, we are still waiting for FERC to issue the necessary certificate 
authority for the Southwest Gas/TW interconnect.  Ideally, the interconnect 
facilities would be approved so that they could be constructed by the Gallup 
in-service date.  Two of our Gallup shippers, Sempra and Reliant, have 
provisions in their Gallup contracts giving them the option to change their 
primary delivery point to the proposed Southwest Gas interconnect.  The TW 
commercial group approached me about a motion to expedite based on this 
contractual right.  (Keith, I know we've spoken about this before with 
Lorraine).  Lorraine called her business contact at Reliant, and Reliant's 
regulatory counsel in D.C. called me today to get more information.  He 
sounded very positive about filing a motion to expedite a decision in this 
proceeding and I sent him the relevant background information to get him 
started.  Getting Sempra to consider filing a similar motion might be more 
difficult, but Jeff Fawcett is going to work on his business contact there.   

I am going to put together and circulate a motion or letter to FERC from TW, 
stating that TW's ability to provide service to its shippers will be affected 
unless certificate authority is granted soon.  Any comments in the meantime 
-- let me know.

Got plans for lunch on  Wed. sep. 27th?  I'll be down and eager to chat.  DF

Interesting.  I'll work with MKM and Maria on getting answers to AA's 
questions and comments.  I think we can eliminate the specific cross 
references between the two agreements, but is that the real problem or is AA 
going to choke on our execution of both agreements with the same party?  
(that's a tough one to wire around, if it is their real concern).  Thanks.  DF

11/05/99 04:33 PM
Attached is a revised redlined draft of the above-referenced  Agreement which 
incorporates comments from regulatory and Mike Bryant with V&E.  We have 
added a new Appendix 1 to cover the Assets subject to this Agreement rather 
than refer to the Exhibit in the Purchase and Sale, as well as an exclusivity 
provision regarding use of the Assets.  We've also added a reference to the 
arbitration section in the event the oversight committee cannot agree to 
changes necessary or desirable to the assets.   

Steve!  I was sorry to hear that you have been out sick and generally having

Seems to me they were looking for Flynn 10 years ago, too. I remember at
that time, Rod Merriam told me something about how the "FBI" was looking
for Flynn, at least according to his mom. I DO remember that he was filing
for bankruptcy in the mid-80's. Then he dissapeared. (Used to live in
Crystal, or New Hope or somewhere.)

Oh,....I got it. And a professional job it was, too. Notice that there is
no "send to" address. Only phone #'s.

Yeah- like I'm gonna call Jeff Hogue.

 Hey-  Where are the Christmas pics of "da goils"?

STEAKS?  We got em--stay at our joint and eat big meat 3 times daily.  I've 
got the grill set up so I can flip steaks while sitting in the hot tub 
drinking beer--its sort of like that Yahoo TV commercial where the sad eskimo 
family radically changes their lifestyle by ordering the grill and hot tub 
off the web.  DF

If I come to Omaha, I'll need more 'an pics. I'll need a big steak. Find
me a place where they got them.

Interesting idea!  Hopefully we can find a simpler approach, but I don't see 
any inherent problem with something like that if it seems to make the most 
financial sense.  Thanks. df

   
	
	

How about doing something along the lines of what we did with UCU on NBPL in 
phanthom equity stock?  or something like that-- Mike worked on that deal and 
I'm not sure who else-  MK

   
	
	

I heard from Tino this afternoon and here's what's going on:
1.  Tino has been focused exclusively on right of way issues.  He's been 
flying around in helicopters, etc. and not worrying about much else. They've 
got environmental people already doing non-field work on possible routes, 
like checking for available turtle studies and cultural resource stuff.  
Dennis has been focused on the political angles (apparently) and has 
purportedly gained some additional intelligence about PNM's effort to get DOE 
to re-up their contract for a new two year term.  Tino says DOE told PNM to 
pound sand and will continue to take service under month-to-month rollover of 
the existing PNM-DOE contract until some alternative (i.e., Dennis) comes 
along.  
2.  Tino wants to get deeper into talking to us about possible deal 
structures very soon.  This topic includes at least three things:  (1) how to 
structure the ownership of the pipeline to maximize Enron and Dennis 
finincial upside; (2) how to structure ownership of the power plant and 
related facilities to maximize Enron and Dennis financial upside, while 
satisfying DOE on Indian ownership, and (3) how to streamline the regulatory 
approval process.  An example of the concerns Tino and Dennis are focused on 
is "if the pipeline has a regulated rate of return, but the power plant has 
to share profit with the Tribe ownership entity, where do we put the bulk of 
the return???"  Also of concern is how we cut Dennis in on a slice of 
upside--stock in Enron?  Profit sharing on the power plant or pipeline 
ownership entity?  Something else? 
3.  What do the economics look like?  This is obviously a threshold question 
that we ought to be moving toward an answer on for ourselves, even if we 
aren't in a position yet to share the information.  Specifically, given what 
we know about the likely cost of the pipeline, and the likely capital cost 
and heat rates of the turbines ENA has available, and what we know about 
forward gas curves, and what we know about how much power PNM supplies to DOE 
and at what rate (from the document Tino gave us in KC and PNM's tariff), do 
we think we can build this thing and beat PNM's current price to DOE?  Can we 
beat it by 10%?  Can we beat it by 10% and have enough $$$ to sweeten the 
deal for the Tribe (partly because that would make it more attractive to 
DOE)?    

I suggested to Tino that he ought to put together a list of the issues that 
they are working on and that they think we should be working on and what the 
critical path issues and decisions are.  If we do the same, then we'd be in a 
position to get another meeting together and have a productive agenda and 
find out if this project has real potential or not. 

Bottom line, I think if our analysis of question 3 is that we can hit decent 
RAROC numbers and still undercut PNM's existing DOE contract and cut the 
Tribe in on a decent share of the power plant upside, we ought to move 
forward aggressively.    DF 

Cindy, attached is a memo to Stan on the Conoco case.  He had asked for this 
analysis to help him prepare for the March 29 mediation.  Please print this 
up for Stan and let me know if anything goes haywire with the memo.  Thanks.

The following is a memo from accounting containing some new accounting codes 
you should be aware of.  I should warn you that your timesheets must be 
approved by your supervisor; therefore, Code 5604 should not be used.  

 
It has come to our attention recently that many  of you have been turning
in timesheets that specify large amounts of  "Miscellaneous? Unproductive
Time" (Code 5309). To our  department, unproductive time isn't a problem.
What is a problem, however, is  not knowing exactly what you are doing
during your unproductive time.  Attached below is a sheet specifying a
tentative extended job code list based  on our observations of employee
activities. 

The list will allow you  to specify with a fair amount of precision what
you are doing during your  unproductive time. Please begin using this job
code list immediately and let  us know about any difficulties you
encounter. 

Thank  you,
Accounting.

the Gallup shippers?  I didn't remember that.  If others are ok also, go for 
it.  Thanks. df

   
	
	

Here's a draft of a letter asking for expeditious treatment of SWGas's 
application.  Let me know your comments by Wednesday afternoon if possible.

Yup, went over to the dark side.  On the power plant, I've got a couple of 
guys you need to talk to.  Steve Harris is VP of marketing at TW, and Kevin 
Hyatt is his right hand guy.  Steve is at 713-853-1796 and I'm not sure what 
Hyatt's # is.  Give me a call and I'll tell you what I can about what we're 
doing to help site power plants.  When did you go out-house?  I don't think 
I've run into you since you were running around with Shoneman.  Adios, DF.  

Drew;
Congratulations on your new job.? I didn't realize that you had joined  the

I've got a client interested in developing a power plant in Arizona off  
Transwestern.? Can you give me a good contact at Transwestern?

I suspect that the answer lies in Mary Kay Miller's or Julia White's areas, 
or both.  Mary Kay and Julia, who is the best person to go to to find the 
monthly sales MDQ from 88 through the end of the merchant service?  I suspect 
that Glen or Bob could point us toward the monthly aggregate purchase data 
during that same period (Britt--wasn't this was provided in discovery prior 
to the first trial?).  I think we are still working on the %Mertzon purchases 
were of the total--Kathy Ringblom please grab me in the morning on this.  
Thanks all.  DF  

When they were in Ponca City, Michael Keenan of EconOne (our damages
experts) advised Jeff and Caren that they need the following info.: 1)
monthly figures for system-wide firm entitlement (what our customers were
purchasing from 1988 until we stopped selling). If different from these
figures, then we also need monthly figures for total system-wide purchases;
and 2) monthly figures for deliveries of gas to the Mertzon plant. Please
let us know who we should contact to pull this together. Also, did we ever
get any word back on the question of what % of the total gas Northern was
purchasing the gas behind the Mertzon plant represented?

I read Wednesday's NGPL order (RP00-18-002) as applying only to NGPL due to 
their unique restrictions and tariff rules.  I do not read it as forcing the 
rest of the industry (i.e., us) to use the floor rate as the reserve price 
for negotiated index rate bids and ordinary recourse rate bids.  I think we 
can still determine the reserve price on a prearranged deal like the ENA deal 
based on our good faith valuation of the upside provided by the index 
mechanism.  I.e., on that type of deal, we can determine that the index 
mechanism is worth "x cents" to us and require a discounted recourse rate 
bidder to bid more than the floor plus x cents to win.  Agreed?  

Note that NGPL whined that the unique rules they are subject to place them at 
a competitve disadvantage to the rest of the industry (i.e., us) on this 
issue.  The commission didn't say anything about that, implying to me that 
the rest of us are still free to do what NGPL cannot do.   DF

As I understand the situation, Plains and Tri-State have indicated their 
intent to close the merger.  Tim's best intelligence is that a June 1 closing 
date is the best they can hope for and it may be late June or later.  Also,  
until the deal actually closes, there is always a small chance it could come 
undone.  If we get Gallup in service May 1, we have a 1 month or greater bust 
between our in service date and the date the cheap electric rate kicks in.  
Has Courtney got this covered?  I suspect he's been thrashing around so much 
on locking in the swap that it hasn't been on his radar screen.  

I think we should formally notify ECS that we expect them to negotiate a 
favorable interim power deal to cover the gap between our in service date and 
the merger closing.  (the difference between the $.038 and .067 rate was 
about $200,000/ month as I recall, so this is worth some real $$$)  Also, we 
ought to remind Courtney that he is still obligated to find a better deal for 
us if the merger goes south for some reason.  I drafted a letter  awhile back 
that could be updated for this purpose.  Susan, assuming Steve and company 
agree, could you follow up on this (I'm having Martha email it to you).  The 
contract requires us to notify ECS by March 1.  Thanks.  DF

Got a call from Dennis out of the blue this afternoon.  He's pretty gung ho, 
and also alluded to several other projects he's got on the front burner 
(gas-fired power deals).  He had met again with some DOE folks in DC about 
the power contract and feels it is 70-80% locked in.  Have you ever known a 
project developer who would admit to less than 70-80% odds???  I look forward 
to talking on Tuesday.  DF

I'm OK on this, with one small change.  Please add "/MMBtu" after "$.08" in 
paragraph 3.  I just want it clearer that the 8 cent rate is per unit as 
utilized.  Thanks. DF

Your recollection is correct.  However, I got the disturbing sense that FERC 
would have pounded NGPL for setting the recouse rate a penny higher than the 
negotiated rate reserve price.  Lets talk MOn. on whether we are still OK on 
the ENA deal.  Thanks. DF

recourse at max while the other negotiated rate was significantly lower.  We 
did not set the recourse at max--  MK

No, not that I know of.  I've never met the western Fossum, but I do know the 
guys who own Western Hub pretty well--John Strom and Larry Bickle.  If we 
have any interest in this project or other merchant storage in California, 
these are the guys to deal with as they have mapped about 90% of the state 
looking for salt or other storage plays.

CA Merchant Storage Plant Passes Major Test

     California regulators Thursday released a final environmental impact 
report for the
     state's second merchant underground natural gas storage project in the 
Sacramento
     Valley of northern California. Absent new opposition from surrounding 
landowners,
     Texas-based Western Hub Properties hopes to have its $80 million storage 
project
     operating by the end of this year, following a year's delay in the 
approval process for
     environmental review. 

     Western Hub is also pursuing a similar-sized underground storage project 
in Texas and
     it has identified a site for a second California storage operation in 
the Bakersfield area,
     according to Jim Fossum, Western's California operations manager. 

     Final approval of the Lodi Gas Storage Project located south of 
Sacramento should
     come in May, Fossum said, meaning that construction could begin this 
summer and be
     operational before the end of the year. "We see the environmental report 
as the 'light at
     the end of the tunnel'," Fossum said. 

     Under California's environmental review process (CEQA), the California 
Public Utilities
     Commission (CPUC) prepared a draft environmental report (EIR) 
identifying the
     project's environmental impacts and mitigation measures. The draft then 
was circulated
     to appropriate public agencies and the general public for comment before 
the final
     report can be issued. Three public hearings on the draft report were 
held by the CPUC
     last October. 

     Under the CPUC's procedures, a proposed decision from the administrative 
law judge
     for the case is due by mid-March, after which there is a 30-day period 
before the
     project can come before the five-member commission for a final decision, 
a CPUC
     spokesperson said. 

     "We hope to be on-line, and that is 'hope', this year because we already 
have our
     compressors and pipe, so it is just a matter of getting crews there and 
that can go pretty
     quickly," Fossum said. "In the best of all worlds it would be this year; 
in the worst case,
     it would be a year from now." 

     Western Hub has some of its customers lined up, and it is in current 
discussions with
     others, said Fossum, declining for competitive reasons to even identify 
the types of
     customers, although they are expected to be large shippers, marketers, 
power plant
     operators and other large industrial customers. 

     The Lodi project is designed for full operation as having a 12 Bcf 
working capacity,
     with 400 MMcf/d injection and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal capacities. It will 
be
     connected to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s backbone transmission system 
through a
     35-mile pipeline consisting of three miles of 30-inch-diameter and 32 
miles of
     24-inch-diameter pipe. During the past year's delay in start-up, Western 
has "moved
     the pipeline around a bit, but not a whole lot," Fossum said. "to make 
accommodations
     to nearby farmers." 

     Western Hub's similar-sized Texas project is south of San Antonio and 
would be
     connected with three natural gas transmission systems in the area: 
Houston Pipeline,
     PG&E --- Texas (bought recently by El Paso) and the City of San Antonio. 
"We
     expect to have it on-line the same time as Lodi," Fossum said. 

     Fossum said Western is "moving ahead" with a second California site in 
the Bakersfield
     area, but he declined to give any further details, noting Western Hub 
expects to have
     more definitive information next month. He did say that if a second 
California project
     moves ahead, Western expects to have it operational by early 2002. 

     Unlike northern California, storage in the Bakersfield area would not 
have to connect
     with the local utility transmission system of Southern California Gas. 
The combined
     Kern River/ Mojave interstate pipeline also comes into the area. 

Congratulations!  Sounds like the merchant storage business has had a good 
couple of weeks with you guys clearing your environmental hurdles and the 
Tioga guys finally starting construction!  I may have acted rashly in joining 
the evil empire--should have jumped into the storage business instead!  

Tom, are you the point guy for marketing the project?  I'd like to hook you 
up with our Transwestern marketing guys on possible deals to backstop 
Transwestern's "Park and Ride" service.  We are currently authorized by FERC 
to use PG&E market center service for that purpose, but I suspect firm or 
interruptible Lodi service  would be better suited for what we need.     

Best wishes for continued success!

     Valley of northern California. Absent new opposition from surrounding 
landowners,
     Texas-based Western Hub Properties hopes to have its $80 million storage 
project
     operating by the end of this year, following a year's delay in the 
approval process for
     environmental review. 

     Western Hub is also pursuing a similar-sized underground storage project 
in Texas and
     it has identified a site for a second California storage operation in 
the Bakersfield area,
     according to Jim Fossum, Western's California operations manager. 

     Final approval of the Lodi Gas Storage Project located south of 
Sacramento should
     come in May, Fossum said, meaning that construction could begin this 
summer and be
     operational before the end of the year. "We see the environmental report 
as the 'light at
     the end of the tunnel'," Fossum said. 

     Under California's environmental review process (CEQA), the California 
Public Utilities
     Commission (CPUC) prepared a draft environmental report (EIR) 
identifying the
     project's environmental impacts and mitigation measures. The draft then 
was circulated
     to appropriate public agencies and the general public for comment before 
the final
     report can be issued. Three public hearings on the draft report were 
held by the CPUC
     last October. 

     Under the CPUC's procedures, a proposed decision from the administrative 
law judge
     for the case is due by mid-March, after which there is a 30-day period 
before the
     project can come before the five-member commission for a final decision, 
a CPUC
     spokesperson said. 

     "We hope to be on-line, and that is 'hope', this year because we already 
have our
     compressors and pipe, so it is just a matter of getting crews there and 
that can go pretty
     quickly," Fossum said. "In the best of all worlds it would be this year; 
in the worst case,
     it would be a year from now." 

     Western Hub has some of its customers lined up, and it is in current 
discussions with
     others, said Fossum, declining for competitive reasons to even identify 
the types of
     customers, although they are expected to be large shippers, marketers, 
power plant
     operators and other large industrial customers. 

     The Lodi project is designed for full operation as having a 12 Bcf 
working capacity,
     with 400 MMcf/d injection and 500 MMcf/d withdrawal capacities. It will 
be
     connected to Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s backbone transmission system 
through a
     35-mile pipeline consisting of three miles of 30-inch-diameter and 32 
miles of
     24-inch-diameter pipe. During the past year's delay in start-up, Western 
has "moved
     the pipeline around a bit, but not a whole lot," Fossum said. "to make 
accommodations
     to nearby farmers." 

     Western Hub's similar-sized Texas project is south of San Antonio and 
would be
     connected with three natural gas transmission systems in the area: 
Houston Pipeline,
     PG&E --- Texas (bought recently by El Paso) and the City of San Antonio. 
"We
     expect to have it on-line the same time as Lodi," Fossum said. 

     Fossum said Western is "moving ahead" with a second California site in 
the Bakersfield
     area, but he declined to give any further details, noting Western Hub 
expects to have
     more definitive information next month. He did say that if a second 
California project
     moves ahead, Western expects to have it operational by early 2002. 

     Unlike northern California, storage in the Bakersfield area would not 
have to connect
     with the local utility transmission system of Southern California Gas. 
The combined
     Kern River/ Mojave interstate pipeline also comes into the area. 

I finally stumbled over something that forced me to get my shit together and 
update my email addresses on you guys.  Its been a strong couple of weeks for 
the merchant storage business!  First you guys (and FERC) finally put the 
last nail in CNG and Penn Fuels' coffins on Tioga, then old Larry,John and 
Dill finally dust off Lodi and get going!  Wow!  I shouldn't have joined the 
evil empire quite so fast!

Seriously, congratulations on starting construction up in PA.  I ran into my 
old law partner Hill out in DC last week and got a great update on the recent 
battles against those drips at CNG and Penn Fuel.  Siggy, what are you going 
to do without Carol Lynn to fight with?????  Best wishes for continued 
success!  DF

Maria, please take a look at this list of "Reference Entities" and the 
attached memo.  I doubt we have any reason to knock out any of the listed 
entities based on legal controversies, etc., but its worth a check .  From 
the attached memo, it looks like a more likely reason to disqualify an entity 
would be credit problems or some other commercial issue.  I'm in a bind today 
and out the rest of the week so it would be helpful if you could pick this 
ball up in my absence.   Please get back to me and Mike with the results of 
your analysis.  Thanks.  DF

Jim Fossum is about a hundred years old.  He's been employed by nearly every 
storage developer operating in the state.  We knew him back in the early 90's 
(that's 1990's) when he was trying to sell the "Ten Section" project to 
Mojave Pipeline.   The Ten Section is the project referred to in the press 
clipping near Bakersfield, CA.  Their other project ("Lodi") is in direct 
competition with the "Wild Goose" storage project near Sacramento.

   
	
	

No, not that I know of.  I've never met the western Fossum, but I do know the 
guys who own Western Hub pretty well--John Strom and Larry Bickle.  If we 
have any interest in this project or other merchant storage in California, 
these are the guys to deal with as they have mapped about 90% of the state 
looking for salt or other storage plays.

In preparation of our meeting on March 7th,  attached are the draft results 
of the Mastio Review for NNG and TW.

   
	
	

As you all know we have received detail information supporting the ET&S 
rating out of 50 companies, and we have been analyzing such information in 
preparation for a review with Stan and his direct reports by mid March.  I 
have been discussing our preliminary results with various different groups 
within ET&S and need to also get your input. Therefore, I have set up a 
meeting on Tuesday March 7th at 1:30 p.m. in EB49C2, to review our 
preliminary findings. The goal of this meeting is to review the data we have 
received from the focus group of ET&S customers, and to discuss such results 
from the standpoint of 5 areas we can focus on for improvement both short and 
long term.  Please be expecting a draft of the results from Tammy Lee-Jaquet, 
by close of business this Friday to allow time for review prior to this 
meeting. 

Thank you,
Ricki

Sounds reasonable to me.  When do we sign?  Seriously, this just confirms in 
my mind that Langley isn't looking very closely at the economics of the deal 
because he doesn't have any capital or O & M numbers (or heat rates) on the 
generation equipment so he has no idea how thick or thin the margins might be 
on this project.  Once we are able to show him some economics he will 
presumably be in a position to be reasonable on the issues discussed below.  
If he's not willing to be reasonable, we're done talking to him.  

Steven Harris
03/07/2000 10:28 AM
 I spoke to Dennis Langley yesterday about his ideas on the financial stake 
he is looking for in the project. There are several items which will need to 
be included in our economic analysis as they will burden the project . The 
conditions are as follows:

- Dennis needs (wants) to recover the O&M for his idea-generating group which 
he estimates to be $2 to $3 million per year!  
- Share with Dennis a 50/50 split of any incremental revenue TW receives on 
its existing line as a result of additional capacity sold to serve these 
markets!
- A 50/50 split of any revenue received on the new line which is built .
- The Native American tribe(s) will receive 25% of ownership in the assets 
and 25% of the cashflow stream after payout (he mentioned something about an 
IRR of 8% being the threshold).

 His general feeling was that the pipeline should be a 50/50 joint venture 
but the gas-fired generation plant would be ours. James will need to run the 
numbers but my uneducated guess says that if things were slim before these 
financial hits will certainly render the project uneconomic (especially the 
$2 to $3 million/year extra O&M). He did indicate that they are having very 
good conversations with the DOE and would expect to sign a contract in April. 
I am somewhat  puzzled by what he could commit to since he would have no idea 
what rates he could charge for the electricity or gas transportation.

 I told Dennis we would follow-up with him shortly. In the meantime, we will 
be working with Mark Baldwin to scope out the opportunities in New 
Mexico.      

 

Thanks and happy holidays!  Sorry we couldn't make it yesterday.  DF

   
	
	

I've left a small glass candle on your desk. It was to be given to you and

Bob, Steve Gilbert was not working on this, but he thought that the numbers 
in 10ks and annual reports generally get filled in by Elaine Concklin or 
someone based on ET&S numbers fed up throught the system by Gilbert's group.  
For now, I'm leaving the blanks in this draft blank and explaining to Moran

Emily Sellers asked that I email the draft of the 10-K to you.  It is in 5 
sections because we will eventually fold in the financials and the management 
discussion pages.

Thanks Bob.  I'd suggest that you handle the points in the first and second 
paragraphs of your email with Gary Peng, including updating the verbiage as 
you deem appropriate to address the North Dakota, weather, and mileage 
issues.  Please send to Mike Moran and myself the changes you propose 
(including the numbers).  We have already modified the language you reference 
in your third paragraph (per Michele Winckowski), so that's taken care of.  
Mike, you or I should let Rex know that a couple of these additional tweaks 
are coming through this other channel.  One of us can then send them directly 
to Rex if that would be helpful.    DF

   
	
	

We'll follow-up with Gary Peng (our contact in Corporate Reporting) on the 
numeric data and blanks.  However, for the verbiage for NNG we suggest adding 
North Dakota and deleting Wyoming from the list of states served outside our 
traditional market area.  Our research last year indicated that we no longer 
have any facilities in Wyoming and we do have facilities at Ft. Buford, N. 
Dakota.  This will conform to our Brown Cover footnote 1.  

The note in third paragraph about a warmer than normal winter in Northern's 
service territory in 1999 should probably be updated.  The decline in volumes 
from 1998 to 1999 was mainly due to cooler summer weather (less a/c) in the 
south end of the system.  We obtained this advice yesterday from Gilbert for 
another report requirement.  Also, the reference to approximately 17,000 mile 
pipeline is probably a bit high.  Our 1998 Form 2 reported just under 16,500 
miles.  This number ought to be consistent with whatever is used in the Item 
2 Properties section on page 29 for the aggregate of all Enron pipelines.  (I 
think Corporate obtains a table from the engineers for this disclosure).

The fourth paragraph needs to be deleted or replaced.  It appears to describe 
the Peak Day 2000 project which was old news in 1999.  

Thanks.  These are Feb. only numbers, right?  Do you have something showing 
year to date?  I'll give you a call.  DF

--Dot

check with susan on the daily issue--did we test the reason behind our daily 
limit?  If we can do one month deals, why not 12 month?   
	
	

I thought we had worked on some revised language, because we had a concern 
when the agreement indicated the discount was available for the month.  Glen 
was working with you on this I believe.  MK

   
	
	

The Commercial Group has asked whether they can sell daily firm for longer 
than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily 
firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for 
consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the 
other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a 
certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able 
to "sell daily firm for a one-year period."  In contractual terms all this 
would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), 
and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I 
see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in 
marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month 
period.)

Please review the attached forecast package and send any questions or 
comments to me by 2:30 PM on Friday, March 10th in lieu of an officer review.

A few items to note:  The first quarter is up from our last forecast by 
$5.1MM primarily due to timing of O&M expenses and margins.  The total year 
is flat to Plan.  I have left the upside in the 1st quarter until we meet 
with Rod on Monday to assess where GPG or Corporate need us to be.  We can 
shift some of the upside to 2nd quarter if needed.  We have also collapsed 
the variance explanations to show the changes to date from Plan.

Base gas has been increased by a net of $10MM from Plan, made up of an 
increase in the gain of 11.4 in the 2nd qtr. less SBA fees of (1.2) in 3rd & 
4th qtrs. and legal fees of (.2) in O&M in 3rd qtr.

All of the updates included in the mini-current estimate have also been 
incorporated.  Margin and O&M detail sheets include only the first quarter.

When you open the excel file, you will be asked whether you want to update 
linked information.  Please choose NO.  Once the file is opened, click on 
"file," "print," and then click "entire workbook" and then "OK."  You should 
have a cover sheet with 9 pages behind it.  The graph is in a separate file 
and is only one page.

Please let me know if you have any trouble printing, and we can fax you a 
copy.

Thanks,  Elaine

Emily Sellers asked that I email the draft of the 10-K to you.  It is in 5 
sections because we will eventually fold in the financials and the management 
discussion pages.

Please take a look at this history of the regulatory issues on Hubbard.  Note 
that I am still trying to confirm some potentially helpful facts.  I'll walk 
you through what I think this means on Monday or whenever you have time.  
Thanks.   DF

I found the reference I was remembering over the weekend.  Check out the 
order issued to TriState Pipeline at Docket CP99-61.  FERC got all over CMS 
on the problems posed by "dual jurisdictional facilities" whatever that 
means.  CMS tried to do something that sounds a lot like what PNM would be 
doing under the idea you guys had.

	
	

Interesting.  Assuming we could satisfy the Texas Eastern criteria (which 
would be tough given that this is a firm service, unlike our market center 
service), we still need to think about PNM's situation.  The letter says they 
are a Hinshaw.  This deal would seem to blow their Hinshaw exemption.  There 
is some new law on use of capacity on a Hinshaw for interstate service, only 
I think it involved a capacity lease instead of service agreements.   I think 
it was one of the Northeast pipeline cases involving CMS.  Does PNM know that 
we would use their service for interstate transportation?  If we can crack 
the Hinshaw issue, this might be worth a shot.  DF

Mary,  I was unable to forward the attachment--  so try to get it form Glen
Susan,  I don't think it is a problem to try this, however,  do we have the 
current rates including fuel etc that we would have to pay and how much 
capacity would we be acquiring?  Need to see this-  MK

   
	
	

The Commercial Group has been discussing with PNM the possibility of entering 
into service agreements for firm capacity on the portion of PNM's system 
between Blanco and Rio Puerco.  This would effectively operate as an 
expansion of TW's system from the San Juan Basin to the mainline.  TW would 
acquire PNM capacity then post it as available on the EBB just like we post 
other capacity.  Shippers could then use the capacity to transport gas from 
Blanco to any point on TW's system.   The capacity that PNM has available at 
this time is seasonal (summer months) only, so it would be used to provide 
short-term firm capacity or LFT to TW customers.   The marketers anticipate 
that the additional capacity would mostly be used to ship gas to points on 
TW's mainline besides Rio Puerco -- in other words, the total path used by 
shippers would be a combination of PNM's system and TW's system.  Shippers 
wouldn't necessarily know whether PNM capacity was being used to provide 
service on their contract, only that their gas is being shipped from A to B.  

In re-reading the Texas Eastern line of cases, I believe we can distinguish 
TW's proposal from that in Northern's Docket No. 97-388 because it is more 
specific (we are asking for authority to acquire capacity on a specific 
pipeline) and because it is more in the nature of an expansion of TW's 
constrained San Juan lateral rather than a proposal to broker other 
pipelines' capacity.  I may be overly optimistic, but I also believe we meet 
all the Texas Eastern criteria.

I realize that I have not discussed this very extensively (or at all) with 
any of you, but I have gone ahead and drafted the proposal in the form of a 
letter to FERC.  It seemed the most efficient way to provide a starting point 
for discussion, especially since I was able to borrow heavily from our 
successful Market Center Services filing.  I'm not yet sure where we will 
include it in the tariff, but I propose tariff language along the lines of   
"Transporter may contract for firm transportation service on Public Service 
Company of New Mexico for use in providing transportation service from the 
Blanco receipt point on Transporter's system.  The cost incurred for 
acquisition of any such services shall be separately recorded in Account No. 
___.  Transporter is at risk for recovery of costs associated with such 
services."

After you've reviewed the attached, please let me know your overall 
substantive comments and let's talk about the best way to proceed.  Thanks.

Please find out what you can about which issues FERC is interested in on the 
Gallup rehearing requests.  I.e., did they issue the tolling order because of 
our rehearing arguments on the confidentiality issue or SoCal's on the rate 
discrimination issues?  Anything you learn would be helpful, but this info is 
not so important that risks should be taken to get it.  Thanks.  DF.

Attached is my analysis based on a sales price of $14.2MM and $14.8MM with a 
buy back in the 7th year.  The loan structure for Hanover assumes that the 
difference between the sales price and TW's buy back price would be amortized 
over the contract term.  The remaining balance of the loan is assumed to be a 
balloon payment at the end of the finance term.

I will put together some analysis on a 9 year term and forward this on to you 
when it is completed.

Marketing needs an "order of magnitude" estimate for two IPP projects that 
are being developed-  one is NW Arizona, the other off the Panhandle 
lateral.  These estimates are for purposes of preliminary scoping of the 
project(s).  The Caithness Sandy Project is a little farther along in the 
development process. 

I know we've considered the Wikiup location before as being a possible "first 
drop-off" point for the Panda lateral, but for purposes of this analysis, 
let's look at the Caithness (Wikiup) as a stand alone project.  

With respect to the Panhandle lateral project, do we even have enough flowing 
gas supply to handle this load consistently?  Can we meet the pressure 
requirement?

Since we're probably looking at Timberline-type estimates I'm assuming this 
isn't too long a putt for you guys.  Can you give me a time frame to get back 
to me with something, first on Caithness, then on Panhandle?  Thanks.

It it becomes desirable to structure the Reliant deal off balance sheet, we 
would most likely need a partner, either an industry participant or a 
financial entity.  Some potential industry partners might include Nisource, 
Utilicorp, or Oneok.  (are there others?)  

According to the press, Nisource will need to pay down debt following the 
Columbia merger.  However they have a continuing strategic appetite for LDC 
assets.  They are/will be a registered Utility Holding Company, so obviously 
PUHCA poses no concern for them.  

Here is a possible structure for an Enron/Nisource JV purchase of the Reliant 
package.  Other Nisource and /or Columbia assets could be added to the 
transaction to generate net excess cash for Nisource (presumeably only if ENE 
had a strategic interest in the added assets).

Comments please.

 I spoke to Dan Thomas with PG&E this morning regarding the possibility of 
lifting the flow restriction at Topock. He indicated that they did briefly 
discuss the issue but in light of their current public relations efforts to 
inform the press and policy makers of the current situation they did not feel 
it would be appropriate to increase the limits at this time. However, he did 
indicate that they will be working on some additional "milestones" which will 
allow us to increase flows once they are met .  

I'm sure that many of you are aware that there has been a great deal of 
activity lately related to Enron's evaluation of possible acquisitions.  John 
Goodpasture's group has kept a large number of ET&S people engaged in looking 
at a number of potential deals.  While these deal evaluation projects have 
become routine around here, we all must remember that these projects are 
extremely confidential.  Even after a potential seller has announced that it 
is up for sale, the fact that Enron is looking at a potential deal, as well 
as any of our internal analysis of the deal, remains strictly confidential.  

I realize that many of you have ongoing business relationships with employees 
of some of the companies that we have evaluated or may evaluate in the 
future.  If you find yourself in such a situation, and a business contact at 
the target company asks whether Enron is evaluating the contact's company or 
assets, the only appropriate response is that Enron personnel are not 
permitted to discuss potential acquisitions.  Please be aware that the 
confidentiality agreements that we typically sign as part of the acquisition 
evaluation process preclude any communication by Enron people with employees 
of the target company.  

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this requirement, please do 
not hesitate to give me a call.  Thank you for your assistance.

Here's the latest Tino-gram:
1.  Tino's environ. consultants have not discovered any stop signs.  

2.  The Isleta is interested in granting Dennis ROW/lease for the power plant 
as well as the pipeline.  The power plant could be located on Isleta land 
adjacent to the South boundary of the Scandia reservation.  Thus, the power 
plant could be connected to DOE's existing powerline infrastructure without 
ever leaving the Isleta and DOE land.  PNM would not be necessary to move 
power to DOE.  Unclear to me whether this approach would give the power plant 
optimal access to the power grid for sales of surplus power.  (maybe  this 
could be done through DOE to an interconnect with PNM on the Scandia 
reservation?)

3.  Dennis is using Jim Slattery, an ex law partner of mine in DC (and ex 
Dem. U.S. Congressman from Kansas), as his primary contact with  Bill 
Richardson at DOE.  My recollection is that Jim does have a good relationship 
with Richardson, so this seems very likely to be effective.  Tino reports 
that "DOE is OK with the deal" and the next step is negotiating the power 
contract itself.  Tino said that DOE is aware that the capital for the 
project will not come from the tribe so the tribe's interest will be fairly 
thin.   It is unclear exactly how much indian ownership Dennis and Slattery 
promised DOE.

4.  Tino has run into a power plant consultant named Jack Maddox who says 
he's working on a 230MW plant to be located west of Belen.  Tino thinks he's 
working for the Laguna tribe, but wanted us to find out who is planning a big 
power plant out there.  Is this ours?  PNM's?  El Paso?  

Finally, the next key step is obviously the economics.  Based on what Tino 
told me, I'm convinced that Dennis and Tino don't have a real good sense of 
how much $$$ might be in this deal.  They are groping a bit and our initial 
analysis of the numbers will likely carry a lot of weight.  How are those 
efforts coming?  

Thanks.  DF

Attached is the updated summary sheet for TW's compressor monetization based 
on the criteria decided on in todays meeting.  The 5% COS reduction 
translates to  $149,000 benefit to TW's customers each year.  The sales price 
of $14.8MM will yeild a gain of approximately $3.2MM before tax and after the 
deduction for employee termination expenses estimated at $160,000.  

 

Thanks.  I'll call Tino back and tell him not to fret about what he heard 
from Maddox --I know Tino and Dennis knew about the Cobisa project and I 
think he believed Maddox was working on yet another project.  I can get Tino 
comfortable without breaching our confid. agreement with Maddox by just 
telling Tino that we understand there is just one project down South of our 
target location, not two.  Also, I'll let Tino know that early April looks 
like the best time to get together to talk numbers and we'll call to set it 
up when we are ready.  DF

Drew - Good timing.  Here's what I know:

1) Jack Maddox and I have spoken sporadically in the past about very nebulous 
projects in areas near TW.  (We even have a signed Confidentiality Agreement 
with him!)  After I read your memo, I called him to see what's going on.  

He is working on a 220 MW gas-fired plant near Belen, NM.  Houston-based 
Cobisa Corp. will ask the city of Belen to issue industrial revenue bonds to 
help it build this plant.  Power generated by the plant will be sold to 
customers through service agreements with electricity moving along existing 
PNM lines.  Plans call for construction to begin by Spring 2001 with 
operations to begin by 2003.  Kevin and I have a meeting scheduled with him 
next Friday, March 31 in Albuquereque.  We'll keep you posted.

2)  I received the economic analysis today which factors in some of Dennis 
Langley's wish list.  The "as good as it gets" rate, assuming the project is 
sized at 150,000 MMBtu and fully subscribed over the project life of 10 
years, is $.1631.  This does not include a) any ROW cost, b) a 50/50 split of 
any incremental revenue TW receives on its existing line as a result of 
additional capacity sold to serve new markets, or c) 25% of ownership in the 
assets and 25% of the cash flow stream after payout.  

 I need to continue working the economics with James Centilli.  In the 
meantime, our consultant, Mark Baldwin will hopefully provide us with 
critical market information near the end of March. This is also around the 
time when Tino should have his report on detailed the cost estimate of 
construction and environmental issues.  Maybe we should rally first part of 
April to see where we are.

If you lawyers can support this, I can also, but I believe it could be 
challenged-  MK  

   
	
	

The Commercial Group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into 
discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year.  The 
standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that 
the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the FTS-1 agreement 
renews, but not beyond a specified date.  Typically TW enters into these 
discount letters for a term of one month.  The marketers say that they were 
once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than 
a 3-month term.   I see no basis for this limitation.  The term of the FTS-1 
agreement is one day, renewable from day to day.  The discount is only 
applicable for so long as the FTS-1 agreement renews.  If the FTS-1 agreement 
does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable.  The basis for the 
shipper's transportation rights is the FTS-1 agreement.  We are not 
guaranteeing a shipper "daily" firm for longer than a one-day term.  The 
discount letter merely states that, for so long as the FTS-1 agreement 
renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date.
Does this make sense?  I realize you are swamped, but I need to get Steve an 
answer so that the marketers know what is acceptable.  Drew and I have 
discussed this and he is on board. Thanks.

Thanks Joe.  I'm asking Maria Pavlou to take a look at this and give you (and 
I) a preliminary answer.  I don't see any obvious problems--and the liability 
waiver is a good idea.  Maria--please take a look.  This will raise some of 
the same non jurisdictional revenue issues as the Clifton Machine Shop deal, 
unless we set it up on a strictly barter basis (i.e., no money changes 
hands--you give me 20 hours of training and I'll give you 20 hours of 
training).    DF    

   
	
	

Drew . . . The GPG Training Department is wanting to share training classes 
with Reliant Energy and other companies.  This would involve GPG employees 
attending classes on other company facilities and other company employees 
attending classes on GPG facilities.  The concept will reduce training cost, 
reduce travel expenses, and increase the number of course offerings to GPG 
employees.

Any liabilities associated with training cooperatively with other companies?  
Perhaps a simple disclaimer form that each company signs.

Sorry for the length but it's pretty interesting stuff.

telkajdslkajfdlkasjdflkjsd

I'm OK with trying what the commercial group wants but we'd better be aware 
of the consequences.  If we are successful, it may be a little easier to get 
Kent his authority to buy third party storage from other pipelines.  If we 
are unsuccessful, getting Kent's thing approved will get a bit harder.  I 
think the PNM proposal is pretty specific and has a nice operational basis 
that may help our chances somewhat. Also, I'm forwarding to Shelley to get a 
read on any FERC policy landmines.  Shelley, the summary of Madden's talk to 
INGAA that you circulated today quoted Madden as saying that FERC will take 
up the Texas Eastern remand soon.  Are we headed in the right direction?  
Looks to me like we may give Madden and his people an opportunity to broaden 
the current policy a bit without fundamentally changing it.  Thanks.  DF  

   
	
	

Nothing in my research has indicated that a specific agreement is required in 
order to make this filing.  While it is true that one of the reasons FERC 
rejected the NNG filing in which we sought authority to hold capacity on 
unspecified pipelines was because it was too general, the Commission never 
stated that pipelines must file specific deals in order to comport with the 
Texas Eastern requirements.  I believe that the filing is specific enough to 
address the Commission's concerns because we have narrowed it down to a 
specific portion of a specific pipeline in order to help alleviate a 
constraint on TW's system. The Commission did not require us to have an 
agreement with PG&E for Market Center services, and in fact we did not have a 
deal in place when we made our filing.   While I'm sure it's true that having 
a specific deal in place would make our filing even more convincing, the 
Commercial Group would like to maximize their flexibility to acquire capacity 
on PNM instead of having to ask permission for each deal they do with PNM, 
which is why we would prefer to use the same strategy we successfully 
employed in our Market Center services filing.  

On the Hinshaw issue -- I will forward you the relevant e-mail chain from 
last week.

   
	
	

I didn't see you on the distribution,  please respond to Susan's question on 
timing. 
Susan,  if the capacity is 10,000, what is the rate?  Seems like we need to 
have an agreement that we have all reviewed before we file at a minimum.  do 
we have one? 
How was the Hinshaw issue resolved? 
 Thanks
	
	

I received several comments from you, and I believe we've resolved the legal 
issue (PNM's Hinshaw status).  Any other comments? (Mary Kay, the answer to 
your question is that Lorraine has been discussing a rate with PNM, and the 
amount of capacity they have available is 10,000.)   Mary Kay and Mary, when 
do you think would be a reasonable time to expect to file this, given the 
Order 637 filings we're working on?  

I've attached my draft again in case you need it.

Thanks.

Pls print.  thanks. DF
	
	

Today Christine Stokes will be circulating the discount letter for the USGT 
deal to the usual TW personnel for approval.  Since the revenue sharing 
mechanism agreed to by the parties creates a negotiated rate, we will need to 
make the appropriate filing before the April 1 effective date.  

Attached are 3 documents:  1) cover letter (nearly identical to NNG's), 2) 
tariff sheets and 3) a copy of the discount letter for your reference.  (Glen 
and Mary, please put my draft of the tariff sheets into the usual tariff 
sheet format.  I hope the columns line up on my draft  -- if it is confusing, 
let me know and I will fax you a copy.)

Please let me know your comments as soon as possible...preferably by close of 
business Tuesday.  Thank you.

pls print this and hand it to me.  I tried sending it directly to the 
printer, but couldn't tell if it went.  Thanks. FD
Drew;
I've been working with Jeff Fawcett on two projects.
Two clients are involved.
I've heard nothing from TW on either.? One project (Wikieup, AZ) is  hot to 
go.
Can you kick this guy for me (and TW)?
I've been calling JF with?no response.
Let me know if I can assist you in any way.
Best regards,
GB

Hey, it worked great--I replicated several sets of messages without a 
problem.  Then, on Sunday, I did something and now can't get the computer to 
load up windows.  It stalls out on the "Property of ET&S" screen right after 
I turn it on.  Please make it happy again and ship it back up.  (I don't know 
if this would cause such a problem, but I may have shut off the computer off 
on saturday before I got the message saying "it is now safe to shut off your 
computer."  )  Thanks. DF

Sounds like "hiccup."  Anyway, I got an email from George Briden asking what 
is up with our response on this power plant.  Any problems or is it just time 
lag on studying our facility needs?  Let me know if you want me to call him 
back or help in any way.  Thanks. DF

I'll bring this up with Mr. Fawcett today and you will hear back from either 
him or I or both shortly!  Glad to be of help.  DF

Drew;
Thanks for sending me off to read the order in CP99-522, etc.? I've  gotten a 
good feel for the relevant TW issues. 
Based on our preliminary information, TW looks attractive as the supply  
source for the Wikieup project.? 
?
FYI: I've discussed the project a couple of times with Jeff Fawcett, and he  
promised a first cut estimate? of facilities costs on this (as well as  
another) project, and suggested that it would be done by early March. 
Currently,  however, he seems to be among the missing (not returning phone 
calls,  etc.)? Maybe you could call over there and help me get his 
attention??  I'd sure like to make some progress on this deal.

Thanks for your help.

Q:  What has ECI done for me lately?  A:  Forced me to get new business 
cards.  Thanks a lot.  DF  
	
	

Sent by: Office of the Chairman
Dear Enron Employees:

 With the addition of communications to our core businesses, it is 
appropriate for us to modify our existing tag line to simply "Endless 
possibilities."  This change is effective immediately and replaces our 
current tag line of "Natural gas. Electricity. Endless possibilities."

 To achieve our goal of a unified Enron brand, each employee has the 
responsibility to make the Enron image a consistent and strong identity.  
This is partially accomplished through correct application of the logo and 
tag line.  A revised Corporate Identity Guidelines Book has been developed to 
assist you in following the correct standards.  You may obain a copy of this 
new book by completing a Forms Request and ordering Item #42629.    These 
guidelines will also be made available electronically on the Brand Site at 
home.enron.com.

 We'd like to take this opportunity to remind all of you about the importance 
of maintaining a consistent look, especially with our stationery and business 
cards.  It has come to our attention recently that some employees are having 
these items produced by outside vendors and are not following the established 
guidelines.  This must stop immediately.  Please use the internal resources 
available to you for these items.  They will ensure that all guidelines are 
followed correctly and consistently.  If you have questions on how to get 
these items or on the guidelines, you may contact Marge Nadasky in Corporate 
Identity at marge.nadasky@enron.com.

 One name, one company....one Enron.  Our recent reorganization brings us 
another step closer to realizing this goal.  Please make sure you do your 
part to protect and strengthen the Enron brand around the world.

 Thank you for your continued support and cooperation.

      Office of the Chairman

Except for a small amount of capacity we're managing on a short-term basis 
[owing to the Topock lateral problem with PG&E], our West flow capacity is 
sold-out.  Therefore, there is really no means to compare the USGT alt. flow 
rights with an opportunity cost for unsubscribed firm capacity.  Moreover, 
the receipt points under the USGT deal are not on the San Juan Lateral, so 
any alt. West flow transportation will be marked against a Permian - Cal. 
Border price spread.  However, your instincts are probably correct regarding 
the practical use of the capacity -- if there is a market shift resulting is 
a significant widening of the East - West spread, then we'd likely see FTS-1 
shippers with primary rights more fully utilizing their firm capacity, 
thereby frustrating any USGT attempt to access Cal. Border capacity.

   
	
	

 Steve, Kevin, and Jeff: If what I heard this morning is correct and the San 
Juan-Cal. basis is up to about 25 cents, I trust that we will be selling our 
Cal Border capacity with primary point rights at rates significantly higher 
than the $.04 available to USGT/Aquila under this deal.  In other words, it 
is very unlikely that USGT will be able to move significant volumes to 
California under the $.04 part of this deal, right?  With that understanding, 
I'm OK on the deal.  Thanks. DF

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Please review the attached non-standard discount letter for USGT.  
Transwestern and USGT have agreed to enter into a contract for 400,000 Dth/d 
of primary EOT-EOT capacity for the term April 1, 2000 through October 31, 
2001.   The primary EOT-EOT path will be a 2-part rate structure:  $.0075 
reservation and $.0093 commodity rate. USGT will also have the ability to 
flow to California on an alternate basis at a $.04 total rate.    

Transwestern and USGT have agreed to enter into a Revenue Sharing Mechanism 
whereby after USGT recovers their contract demand charges plus an additional 
$2.5 Million in Commodity Sales Margin revenue,  then TW and USGT will share 
50%/50% in any additional Commodity Sales Margin revenue which USGT may 
receive.

USGT will not retain their ROFR rights for their contract.

(Please note that references to "Appendix A"  in the discount letter refer to 
the FTS-1 Appendix A primary receipt and delivery point allocation of the 
400,000 Dth/d primary capacity.)

Please indicate approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.
All Officer approvals will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final President Level 
Approval.

 

I have no great interest in appealing the FERC order denying rehearing.  This 
one is a loser as it was decided on TW-specific facts and I see no clear 
inconsistency between FERC's various orders on revenue sharing.   Unless 
someone feels strongly to the contrary, lets punt.  Thanks. DF 

I'm in--staying over Friday and flying out on Sat AM.  How far are you guys 
from the scareport?  DF

Dave - louie said you would want to see this....
PG&E Fights Toxin in Gas Stream, Movie Fallout

     Sunday's Oscar winners have nothing on San Francisco's venerable Gran 
Dame of
     combination energy utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co., whose film 
career and notoriety
     seem destined to win increasing Hollywood scrutiny if not gold 
statuettes. 

     Look no further than your local first-run movie theaters and the 
real-life drama, "Erin
     Brockovich," taking the actual name of the latest heroine to put PG&E's 
familiar logo in
     the klieg lights. Unfortunately for PG&E, toxins like chromium or PCBs 
in association
     with its gas pipelines can create their own dramas. 

     Just as the new movie, starring Julia Roberts, hit the theaters earlier 
this month, a new
     real-life problem confronted the combination utility with contaminates 
getting into the
     southern part of its California gas transmission system. 

     The movie is the story of a legal assistant --- a twice-divorced mother 
of three young
     children --- who single-handedly challenges PG&E, exposing its alleged 
operating
     mistakes that led to the use of chromium in its pipelines and eventually 
in the local water
     supply of a small, remote, high-desert town called Hinkley, which is 
about 130 miles
     northeast of Los Angeles. Lawsuits emerged in the early 1990s based on 
the
     development of tumors and other health problems among many of the 
Hinkley residents.
     By PG&E's own admission decades earlier it legally discharged wastewater 
containing
     chromium into the ground at its compressor station near Hinkley. Some of 
the chromium
     eventually got into the groundwater, and PG&E acknowledges it "did not 
respond to (that)
     problem as openly, quickly or thoroughly as it should have." It provided 
drinking water to
     nearby residents and arranged for medical exams for residents wishing to 
have them.
     PG&E also worked with local and state officials to clean up the problem. 
In 1996,
     however, PG&E settled a class action suit (one of several) with 650 
Hinkley residents for
     a record $333 million. 

     "The movie is a dramatization and it is pretty entertaining, so I liked 
it," said Jon
     Tremayne, a PG&E utility spokesperson. 

     PG&E CEO Robert Glynn told his employees, "It's clear in retrospect that 
our company
     should have handled some things differently at that time. And I wish 
that it had." 

     Litigation against the big energy firm continues. Involving the same 
transmission pipeline
     and geographical areas, the current PCBs found in PG&E's interstate 
supplies are
     coming through Enron's Transwestern Pipeline unit at the 
California-Arizona border from
     New Mexico but are not at harmful levels at this point in time. Routine 
testing early in
     February turned up the suspected cancer-causing chemical, which was used 
as a
     lubricant in high-pressure pipelines and compressor stations until it 
was banned. 

     "What we are talking about here is very low levels (ranging from 2 to 22 
parts-per-million,
     or ppm), well below (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) levels 
(50 ppm),"
     according to Tremayne. 

     Since the installation of a series of filter separators on both sides of 
the
     California-Arizona border, PG&E has concentrated on testing and 
following up along its
     southern transmission system that extends some 350 miles to the town of 
Kettleman in
     the northwestern part of the central San Joaquin Valley. PCB traces have 
been found,
     and PG&E has been working with the local gas distributor in the area, 
Southwest Gas
     Corp., to test for signs of PCBs in the nearby Barstow and Victor Valley 
distribution
     systems. As of March 22, none of the definitive results were in and 
there won't be much
     before the end of this month, according to Tremayne. 

     Both state regulators and the federal EPA have been notified of the 
situation. The federal
     EPA confirmed that PCBs are authorized for use in concentrations below 
50 ppm. It is
     the EPA laboratory tests that showed PCBs were known to cause cancer in 
laboratory
     rats. 

     PG&E spokespeople were assuring the public last week that the utility 
will "take any
     additional actions necessary" as a result of data from the ongoing 
testing it is doing of its
     transmission system and interconnecting distribution pipeline systems. 
And the utility is
     planning to install additional filter separators at various locations 
along its pipeline. 

     PCB-containing lubricating oils once were used routinely by a number of 
U.S. pipeline
     companies in their gas pipeline compressors, which help push the fuel 
through the pipes.
     While they are no longer used, some of the oils have remained inside 
some pipelines since
     the 1960s and 70s. If present, they are carried in liquid droplets in 
the natural gas stream. 

     Between the newly released motion picture and PG&E's local wrestling 
match with the
     PCBs, another class action lawsuit against PG&E stemming from the 
original chromium
     issue heads toward trial, pushed by residents in Topock, AZ and former 
residents of
     Hinkley not involved in the first suit. A trial date has been set for 
Nov. 27, and CNN's
     "CourtTV" program is proposing to provide live coverage.

I also want to take the time to thank Tammy Lee-Jaquet for all her efforts in 
pulling this information together for TW & NNG. In addition, Kirsten Hand was 
instrumental in analyzing our information.  We could not have done this

At the meeting this morning, the Commission issued new regulations under the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for Pipelines on the Outer Continental 
Shelf (RM99-5). 

In a nutshell, the rules add new reporting requirements for offshore pipes  
in order to level the playing field with offshore pipelines that are 
regulated under the Natural Gas Act.  

In an important change from the NOPR, the rule exempts from these new 
requirements offshore pipelines that are already regulated under NGA (i.e. 
there will not be dual reporting requirements).

Commissioner Breathitt explained that while this is a modest step and doesn't 
address all OCS issues, she feels like this  provides a light-handed 
regulatory alternative for regulating offshore pipes. 

We are checking this out.  I'll get with MKM and compare notes and get back 
to you.  Thanks.  DF

Mr. Campbell and I will meet Dr. Komai from SoCal in the late morning or 
early afternoon on the 19th in San Francisco.  After our discussions we will 
meet the rest of the group back at the Hyatt.  It is doubtful that Dr. Komai 
will have more than a couple of hours of information to share with the group 
on the 20th so we might considered targeting a departure time in 
mid-afternoon.

Dr. Komai related that the PG&E press activity has caused concern at the 
management level in SoCal and prompted a new round of rigorous sampling 
efforts.

Sounds OK to me.  Thanks.  DF

See the attached.  Enron Corp. has already authorized Brian Cherry to add 
Enron to the list of parties at the end of the document.  I recommend TW do 
the same.  I propose that we ask Brian to add TW to the list, with a footnote 
that we support the transmission proposal only and do not oppose the other 
parts of the term sheet.  (I propose this out of an abundance of caution 
because in one part of the document Brian states the parties have agreed on 
comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the 
parties aren't fully committed yet.)  If he will not agree to do this, then I 
would suggest we leave TW off the list and file a letter with the CPUC along 
the lines of what I circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting 
the motion for extension of time.  Let me know what you think.

What's the status of our analysis?  Has anyone heard anything from Dennis or 
Tino lately?  I get concerned when they disappear for weeks like they 
sometimes do.  Thanks.  DF

We did not document the up front payments, because of Regulatory concerns.  
FERC requested copies of the contracts that defined the payment for 
electricity.  The $500k was negotiated in a meeting with George Fastuca and 
Mark Courtney, where Mark agreed to share his profit.  We had worked very 
closely with them to assure the officer group, how this project compared to 
doing it with out ESC.  They never advised Dave Foti or myself of this 
change.  The calculations for the up front payment was provided by them and 
clearly reflects the revenue sharing agreed to by Mark.

Rod Hayslett

04/05/2000 06:47 AM
Did we have a contract that was written and spelled out?    If not, (pretty 
sloppy business practice), then we are just going to have to tell Bill Cordes 
that we didn't have a deal, and someone is going to have to suck it in to 
make up the $500K.    If we did, what does the deal say?
  

David Foti
04/04/2000 05:45 PM
Rod, Steve, & James:

In rough terms, this is what I understand ECS' logic to be -

The $3.35 per KW for transmission demand charge was assumed not to be 
avoidable and have a 5000 KW minimum when ET&S and ECS agreed on the $2.8MM 
one time payment.
ECS says that they have negotiated to make the transmission demand charge 
avoidable with no minimum.
$3.35 * 10,000HP / 1.341 = $25k
$25k discounted 10 years = $1.9MM
25% of 1.9MM = approx. $500k
Original one time payment = $2.8MM less $0.5MM = $2.3MM (the new payment ECS 
wants to give ET&S)

ECS contends that Fastuca agreed to a 25% sharing of benefits received from 
the avoidable demand.  My recollection is that the 25% was used as a 
benchmark to estimate ECS' fee but was never established as a firm rule.

ECS is supposed to provide us with their own written explanation for the 
$500k reduction.  They are also supposed to send us the "re-negotiated" rate 
schedule 21 that shows the transmission demand charge becoming avoidable.

In any event, whether it is reasonable or not that ECS is due the $500k, it 
is reasonable to expect that ET&S would have been notified of this change in 
a more timely manner.

Rod, Steve, & James:

In rough terms, this is what I understand ECS' logic to be -

The $3.35 per KW for transmission demand charge was assumed not to be 
avoidable and have a 5000 KW minimum when ET&S and ECS agreed on the $2.8MM 
one time payment.
ECS says that they have negotiated to make the transmission demand charge 
avoidable with no minimum.
$3.35 * 10,000HP / 1.341 = $25k
$25k discounted 10 years = $1.9MM
25% of 1.9MM = approx. $500k
Original one time payment = $2.8MM less $0.5MM = $2.3MM (the new payment ECS 
wants to give ET&S)

ECS contends that Fastuca agreed to a 25% sharing of benefits received from 
the avoidable demand.  My recollection is that the 25% was used as a 
benchmark to estimate ECS' fee but was never established as a firm rule.

ECS is supposed to provide us with their own written explanation for the 
$500k reduction.  They are also supposed to send us the "re-negotiated" rate 
schedule 21 that shows the transmission demand charge becoming avoidable.

In any event, whether it is reasonable or not that ECS is due the $500k, it 
is reasonable to expect that ET&S would have been notified of this change in 
a more timely manner.

Re: your comment on this today.  Unbelievable!!!  What a ton of _____.  Lets 
talk.  DF )by the way, whats a PAJE?  DF  
	
	

Heather Mueck (AA) advised me this morning that in spite of our recent letter 
order from the FAO by Jim Guest, AA still does not believe we have enough 
evidence (other than our own opinion) to justify regulatory asset treatment 
for the Y2K costs.  While this position is consistent with what they had told 
us before we made the filing, they had given us no clue last week when they 
were providing their comments on our browncover drafts that they still had a 
problem with the Y2K assets--even when they were relaying Roger Willard's 
comments.

The bottom line is that they will have a PAJE on Northern for the amount of 
the asset  (aproximately $3.6MM), but the amount on TW (less than $.5MM) is 
so small they will pass on it.  As I understand it, that won't preclude a 
clean opinion on NNG this year, but the PAJE will continue in future years' 
audits until the asset is approved for recovery in Northern's next general 
rate case.  Therefore, if we have additional Northern PAJE's in future years, 
the combined effect would be used to determine whether or not a clean opinion 
would be appropriate in those years.

I assume we will suffer the scarlet letter of the multi-year PAJE, rather 
than write off the reg asset in the 1999 Brown Cover and be required to flow 
the write-off through consolidated earnings (and internal scorekeeping) in 
the year 2000.

Please give me a sign off if this is OK.  Thanks DF

Please find attached an explanation of how the $2.8M was negotiated from Dave 
Foti and myself.  The other file attached is the calculations per the 
contracts we executed with ESC and the earnings impact, if we agree with ESC 
new one time payment.  

 The economic benefit  to be derived from this change may or may not be 
achieved, because it is dependent on ESC and TW ability to avoid the peak 
demand  charge.  ESC has an obligation in the contract to assist TW in 
developing a system to monitor and avoid the peak demand charge.  If ESC 
receives this benefit in  the one time payment, TW may lose any leverage we 
have.  The demand payment includes full payment of these peak demand charges 
with ESC rebating the 
 cost on a monthly basis, if these charges are avoided.

 If we need to develop our negotiating strategy before we meet with ESC on 
Wednesday, please advise.

Unless we have bought something that I'm not aware of, I don't believe TW or 
NN has any assets or operations in Louisiana and therefore should not be 
subject to the referenced tax.  As far as other jurisdictions, I don't expect 
that we'd have a problem with in-kind payment as an additional payment 
option.  On TW, which has no fuel tracker, in kind tax payment probably 
wouldn't help us.  Northern does have a fuel tracker, however, and might 
avoid adverse earnings impact from tax volatility if we could pay those taxes 
in kind and stick them in the tracker.  We probably couldn't do that until 
the next rate case, however, because all current taxes are built into our 
base rates at some representative level.

There is a proposal concerning paying the Louisiana Use (Sales) Tax by using 
in-kind rather than paying cash.  Please see the attached memo below giving 
details and asking for your comments:

 -jtm

Given the numbers we got from Mark Baldwin, is this where we are?:
1.  The overall economics of the pipeline project have to be supported almost 
entirely by the new power plant.  At most, we could assume maybe 
5,000-10,000/day of gas load from industrials near the airport, and another 
X,000 from Kirtland's gas load.   This assumed load will ramp up over several 
years (or longer depending on how long these folks existing contracts are) 
and not be available immediately. 
2.  We know the bogey for pricing the electric contract for DOE.  Its 
probably $0.042/KWh, less 15-20% to make it attractive, or maybe $0.056, less 
15-20%.  Either way, a low rate.  
3.  We now know the best case scenario for cost on the pipeline--about $17 mm 
in the 16" configuration, without the Isleta lateral or the lateral over to 
the power plant.  Maybe about $20mm total?
4.  We don't have absolutely reliable info on electric transmission 
constraints from the proposed plant to Palo Verde, so I'd suggest that for 
now we just assume that we would be unconstrained on power sales at Palo 
Verde.  Are there alternative liquid markets available that might have better 
pricing?  Ercot?  Pub. Serv. Colorado?  
5.  I'm not entirely sure how you guys are looking at the overall economics, 
but to my non-business guy mind, the following scenarios (or something 
similar) stick out as the key benchmarks that will decide whether the project 
makes sense:
 A.  Worst Case:
Assume we build a 75 mw power plant (i.e., assume no extra power to sell in 
spot market) and assume we get the Kirtland gas load but no additional gas 
load from the customers Baldwin talked to .  If the rate for the gas line is 
the minimum rate that Enron could live with (based on our internal hurdle 
rates) can we hit the DOE target power price and have any $$$ left over?  I 
suspect this scenario is upside down.  Should we look at two alternative 
configurations for the power plant--combined cycle and simple cycle?
 B.  Mid Case:
Assume we size the power plant at 150mw (or some similar size based on a 
turbine configuration that makes sense) and that we sell the surplus power at 
Palo Verde prices less Albequerque-Palo Verde transmission costs.  Again, 
assume no incremental gas load except Kirtland.  If the gas pipeline rate is 
set at the minimum rate Enron can live with, does the power plant make enough 
$$$ to make the project work?
 C.  Wildly Optimistic Case:
Same as mid-case, except add Baldwin's gas load and start ramping in some 
estimated amount of additional gas load when NM gas restructuring kicks in in 
2003 (did I get the year right?).   Also, start ramping in some estimated 
amount of high priced retail power sales to back out the Palo Verde spot 
sales at whatever year NM retail electric restructuring is expected to kick 
in.  (also 2003, I think).  With optimistic assumptions like this, does it 
make sense?  

Tino suggested a meeting to talk economics in detail around the first of 
May.  Ideally, we'll have a feel for the above relationships, and the 
transmission constraint situation, by then.  Thanks.  DF  

        

This is too cool to be believed.  Obviously, I'm not getting much 
accomplished at work today.  Adios, DF

Regulations Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Governing the 
Movement of Natural Gas on Facilities on the Outer Continental Shelf, RM99-5 

The final rule is attached - 84 pages      

Executive Summary
The Final Rule was issued April 10, 2000 and becomes effective 30 days after 
publication in the Federal Register.

The purpose of the final rule is to establish a data base as a foundation for 
identifying discrimination with OCS gas service providers.  The reporting 
will include affiliations and conditions of service.  This is a procedural 
rule - reporting only.  The rule only applies to gas pipelines - FERC found 
transportation for oil pipelines to be just and reasonable.  The Commission 
is acting in part as a response to the ruling in Sea Robin in which the court 
directed FERC to reconsider the manner in which it applied its primary 
function test to Sea Robin's predominantly offshore system.  

NOPR was issued on June 30, 1999.  The Commission believes that the new OCSLA 
reporting requirements mirror certain existing NGA reporting requirements.  
Salient points of the final rule are:

Exemptions
Service providers that confine their operations to moving their own gas or 
that of a single shipper are exempt from reporting; add new section 
330.0(a)(1) and (2)   Note:  reporting exemption turns on identity of service 
provider and its shippers - not type of service provided.
Gas service providers that are regulated by FERC under NGA are exempt from 
OCSLA reporting; add new section (330.3(a)(4)
Exempts lines that feed into a facility where gas is first collected, 
separated, dehydrated or processed from OCSLA reporting requirements; add new 
section 330.3(a)(3).

Reporting Requirements
If an NGA-regulated company's system includes OCS facilities that are not 
subject to NGA (gathering/production lines), the company must submit an OCSLA 
report covering its non-NGA facilities
Reclassified facilities will no longer be subject to NGA reporting 
requirements but will be subject to OCSLA requirements. (Shippers  no longer 
have protection against the exercise of market power afforded by the NGA). 
Service provider must list all of its affiliates defined as engaged in the 
exploration, development, production, processing, transportation, marketing, 
consumption or sale of gas need be identified in the report; new section 
330.2(a)(6)
Reporting Updates restricted to four times per year.  
Reports will be based on conditions on the first day of the first full 
calendar quarter that begins after the effective date of this rule; reports 
due on the first business day after the close of the quarter.  Providers will 
have more than one full quarter in which to prepare their initial OSCLA report
Providers will be required to submit a description of their operations as 
they stand on the first day of each calendar quarter, e.g. describing the 
provider's status on one particular day; report due on first business day of 
the subsequent quarter (e.g. filing due April 1 will describe operations as 
they stood on January 1).  If the operations are identical on the first and 
last days of any given quarter, provider need not submit an update the 
following quarter
Not necessary to file contracts but must provide table of shippers and 
services; new section 330.2(b)
Retaining requirement for alternative reporting for OCS companies who do not 
provide service under formal contracts, must provide information sufficient 
to derive rates charged and conditions applicable for service between two 
points; new section 330.2(b)(9)
OCSLA Reporting Form available via Internet  http://www.ferc.fed.us or the 
public reference room
Providers new to provisions have 90 days to prepare and submit OCSLA report 
(NOPR had stipulated 60 days).

Mike Moran has informed me that the FTC and U.S. DOJ, as part of their review 
of the El Paso-Coastal merger, have decided to take a close look at the 
merger's possible impact on competition in the Chicago-Wisconsin market.  In 
this regard, those agencies need to set up a conference call in the next two 
weeks to discuss that issue with experts on that market from Border and 
Northern.  This will not be an on-the-record deposition.  It will be a conf. 
call and what I expect to be an  informal question and answer session on what 
we know.   Representatives of the Wisconsin and Illinois Attorney General's 
office (or whatever agency it is in those states that deals with antitrust 
issues) will be on the phone as they are working with the Feds on the 
merger.  I think either one of you guys, with appropriate supervision, would 
do a fine job.  Please let me and Mike know who gets the black bean and what 
your general availability is and we'll get it set up.  Thanks. DF

Thanks Vig--this is very helpful as I've gotten a bit out of the loop over 
the last several weeks.   I don't know exactly what the reason was for 
striking this from our agenda for tomorrow, but it might be for the better 
since we can now schedule a prefiling devoted exclusively to this filing.  
Lets talk next wk on where we stand with Hanover and where FERC's general 
policy on outsourcing is going.  That KN Wattenberg order is excellent for us 
on the jurisdictional issue, so maybe the longer we wait the better the law 
will get for us.  DF  

Donald Vignaroli   04/12/2000 04:14 PM

Notwithstanding the fact that the Monetization project may not be discussed 
at your meeting with FERC tomorrow, attached FYI and "just-in-case" is a memo 
summarizing the proposal.  (I'll drop hard copies off at your respective mail 
drops.)

Not yet--I'll try this wkend.  thanks. DF

I understand that you guys have retained Holland and Hart to give us another

hooked up with the South Dakota firm I mentioned and was favorably impressed 
with their experience in similar matters.  Don Schultz and a couple of his 
partners have substantial litigation experience both for and against the S.D. 
tribes (Ogalla Sioux, etc.) on federal jurisdictional issues.  One of Don's 
partners is general counsel of the Rushmore Electric Cooperative in Western 
South Dakota and has had dealings with the tribes on right of way issues for 
years.   They have cleared conflicts, and are available  if we ever need a 
third opinion or if we get into a spat with the tribes elsewhere.  Sorry it

SoCal's protest is ludicrous. I will work on a response.
By the way, SoCal has actually been remarkably helpful in reaching agreement 
on a settlement -- which we just signed -- in the California GIR proceeding.

 Tino called today to report on their meetings with DOE last week.  Tino, 
Dennis Langley, and their outside lawyer Jim Slattery met with Bill 
Richardson and DOE staff to discuss the "sole source" procurement approach to 
DOE's obtaining an alternative power supplier for Kirtland AFB and Sandia.  
Tino reports that Richardson signed off on the sole source approach, subject 
only to DOE review of the final contract to assure its consistency with the 
public interest.  Tino believes that the combination of significant Native 
American involvement in the overall deal structure along with a power price 
that is lower than DOE's current PNM rates will satisfy the "public interest" 
standard.  

 Slattery is set to begin discussions with DOE next week on the overall 
structure of Dennis' proposal.  I am surprised that Dennis would go this far 
before hearing from us on the economics, but Tino made it sound like the 
initial discussions would be fairly general--i.e., to explain to DOE that the 
plan is to build a new pipeline and a new power plant and to do the whole 
thing in partnership with the Isleta Tribe, but without talking about 
specific economic issues.  Sounds to me like Dennis has Richardson on board 
but is nevertheless planning to pitch to the lower level DOE staff people 
what a great deal this is for the Tribes and therefore the government.  

 Tino, not surprisingly, is eager to see numbers and sit down to discuss 
them.  He suggested a meeting the first week of May in either Houston or KC.  
I asked Tino whether he could get firmer numbers from DOE than we currently 
have on (1) total electric and gas load (current and projected) for the AFB 
and Sandia and (2) actual price DOE currently pays for gas and power.  He 
didn't think he could get better information before the first week in May.   

 On another related topic, through Shelley Corman's group  I got acquainted 
with a guy named Tim Beldon who runs the ENA transmission capacity book for 
the Western U.S., out of Portland.  I talked with him for a few minutes about 
power flows and pricing in the N.M-Arizona area and he seemed pretty 
knowledgable.  He has a transmission engineer on his team who is an expert in 
verifying utility claims of transmission constraints.  Apparently, ENA buys 
and sells a lot of power in the four corners area and is pretty familiar with 
the transmission availabilty and power pricing situation up there.  I didn't 
discuss with Tim the specifics of the project we are looking at, but did tell 
him that Kevin and Steve were looking at a potential power plant load and 
trying to figure out how serious it is.  Kevin, if you guys think Beldon 
could provide useful info on the cost and availability of firm and non-firm 
transmission for the surplus power out of Albequerque up to four corners, 
please give him a call.  It is OK to disclose to Beldon what we are working 
on, but please inform him that we are subject to a confidentiality agreement 
and that further disclosure is improper.  

Please let me know whether a meeting with these guys the first week of May is 
doable.  Thanks.  DF         

      

I will be particularly interested in an update on the "Topock 
Decontamination" item on the agenda.  Give me a break.  DF

Drew Fossum
04/19/2000 09:45 PM
Here's a weird one.  Could we structure the Pueblo pipeline project with the 
following characteristics: 
1.  The lateral from TW's mainline to Albeq. is wholly TW owned (i.e., no 
joint venture with Langley);
2.  The lateral  is 100% debt financed (i.e., it is expected to cost about 
$20 million, which TW would borrow in a project financing, secured by the 
revenue stream under the firm contract for service on the new lateral);
3.  TW files for a 7(c) certificate, seeking an incremental rate for service 
on the new lateral;  Any service on the TW mainline will be subject to TW's 
existing rates;
4.  TW designs the max. incremental rate based on normal cap. structure, 
deprec., O&M, allocations, etc.
5.  TW has one contract for 40,000/day, for 10 years for service on the 
lateral;
6.   The rate for that one customer is a negotiated rate that is based on an 
alternative ratemaking study under which the customer pays enough $$ to cover 
debt service on the project financing, incremental deprec., O&M, A&G, etc.  
No allocated costs or any other costs related to TW's preexisting facilities 
are included in the negotiated rate.  
7.  TW is entirely at risk for cost recovery, but the one contract covers all 
actual costs, except return and taxes on the new line. Basically, the one 
contract locks in a floor of break even cash flow.  If TW fails to lock up 
any additional customers there will never be any "taxable income" for the 
line since debt servicing costs and other expenses completely eat up the 
revenue under the one big contract.  Therefore, there will never be any 
return or taxes related to the new line, unless TW locks up additional 
contracts.  
8.  Any additional contracts TW locks up will generate TW's upside for the 
project. 

The question is can we do this?  Will FERC let us build it?  Will FERC let us 
oversize the pipeline significantly larger than the 40,000/day that the one 
big firm customer needs?   I'm sure I've left out important facts, so I'll 
try to grab you tomorrow to discuss.  

The overall objective is to create the "leanest" possible initial cost 
structure for the pipeline, and therefore for the Langley power plant, 
consistent with TW being able to get the new pipeline built.  I.e., lets get 
the pipe built and help the power plant get to a cheap enough elec. rate that 
they can get their big contract with the govt.  and economically sell surplus 
off-peak power onto the grid.  Even if the new incremental rate for service 
on the lateral is a break even rate, TW's upside comes from incremental 
throughput from the Permian to the new lateral, at a rate of $___/MMBtu, and 
from any additional bypass load we can pick up from PNM (it looks like TW's 
rates off of the new line will beat PNM's industrial rates).   

I appreciate your input on this.  DF 

    

I had an interesting conversation with Mark Courtney today, this time about 
something that doesn't cost us money.  He has gained a good bit of experience 
on transmission availability in NW New Mexico from the Gallup electric 
contract negotiation.  His take on transmission constraints is consistent 
with what Kevin and I had suspected:  Alb. is a load pocket and the 
prevailing flow is west to east into Alb.  Constraints only affect west to 
east flows and a generator in Alb. could always move power to four corners by 
displacement.  Courtney has worked with an ENA transmission guy named Steve 
Walton who apparently has more experience with the 230Kv transmission lines 
that had the problem that led to the recent blackouts in Alb.  If we are not 
talking to him already, he would be another guy worth talking to.      

Per discussions with Susan Scott, I am on board with the original language 
routed on this contract.  DF 

Glad to help--concocting market based rates for storage facilities that 
probably don't deserve them is one of the few things I know how to do.  DF 

Shelley Corman
04/20/2000 12:32 PM
ENA is pursuing a gas storage project.  One assumption of their project 
development is the ability to attain market-based pricing for the facility.  
Tom Shelton called  looking for a primer on how to apply for market-based 
rates.   I gave him the 10,000 ft story of how any regulated entity can apply 
for market-based rates under the Alternatives to Traditional Ratemaking 
policy statement, but that to date only storage facilities have been 
successful in willing market-based rate treatment.  I think his client is 
looking for more of a procedural look at what needs to be done.  Do you care 
if I send  them  a copy of the market-based storage testimony from the last 
NNG rate case?    Sorry, but I mentioned that you forged market based storage 
services for Market Hub Partners in your former life.  So, don't be surprised 
if you hear from Tom Shelton or his client John Allario.

I'd be happy to talk to either of you about NNG's experience or work I did in 
my former life for my old client Market Hub Partners on requests for market 
based rates for their Egan Louisiana, Moss Bluff, Texas and Tioga 
Pennsylvania projects.

   
	
	

Shelley Corman tells me that Drew Fossum (General Counsel of NNG) was

Lorraine and I are meeting Steve Walton on Mon a.m.

   
	Enron Energy Services
	

I had an interesting conversation with Mark Courtney today, this time about 
something that doesn't cost us money.  He has gained a good bit of experience 
on transmission availability in NW New Mexico from the Gallup electric 
contract negotiation.  His take on transmission constraints is consistent 
with what Kevin and I had suspected:  Alb. is a load pocket and the 
prevailing flow is west to east into Alb.  Constraints only affect west to 
east flows and a generator in Alb. could always move power to four corners by 
displacement.  Courtney has worked with an ENA transmission guy named Steve 
Walton who apparently has more experience with the 230Kv transmission lines 
that had the problem that led to the recent blackouts in Alb.  If we are not 
talking to him already, he would be another guy worth talking to.

Mike, here are two draft sets of talking points covering Stan's initial phone 
call with Ted Davis to discuss whether a settlement meeting would be useful 
and the subsequent settlement meeting itself.  Please give me any comments 
you have and I'll send to Stan or have available to hand to him at our 
meeting, which I understand is scheduled for 9 am on Tuesday.  I'll  be 
calling in from Arizona.  Note there is at least one issue we ought to think 
about a bit more--whether to have Stan imply there may be other goodies 
available other than the Hobbs Line.  I'm inclined to avoid implying that, 
but to have Stan primed to pull out additional goodies if necessary.

I have not yet completed a bullet point outline of the settlement proposal 
for Stan to send to Davis after Stan and he meet.  As things currently stand 
it would basically be identical to the second sheet of talking points.   I 
would prefer to finalize that document after we meet with Stan, both to 
minimize the paper in front of him at the Tuesday meeting and to allow the 
Davis outline to be tailored to reflect the strategy we arrive at with Stan 
(I think I'm safe in assuming we will tinker with the strategy a bit on 
Tuesday morning).  If we do modify the strategy, I'll also modify the talking 
points.  

Britt and Barrett, I wanted you to know the timetable in part because, if 
Stan decides to go forward,  we need to send Barrett's suggested letter to 
Jad verifying continued application of the settlement privilege to Stan and 
Ted's discussions.   I intend to call you after the Stan meeting to advise.  
Just in case you don't hear from me by late morning Tuesday, please give Mike 
a call to confirm whether to send the letter.  I may have fallen into the 
Grand Canyon or been bitten by a hila monster.

Drew:  I've reviewed the nature of this deal with John and Dave.  Can you 
please review the legalese (its patterned after the 2/10 letters we sent.)  I 
need to send off today.  Thanks

I agree.  This is not a big enough dollar issue for them to make a huge 
stink, is it?  If it is, can't we match them stink for stink with all the 
imbalance penalties we have forgiven in the past?  DF

   
	
	

Based on the above, it seems that the decision to advise them we can't retier 
still stands.  Isn't there a way to give them the $30,000 of value in another 
manner which doesn't make us file for waiver? Alternatively, we have given up 
more than this in the past to resolve their errors, don't adjust?   We can 
still tell them we plan to address in our Order 637 filing-  MK

Mike, I hadn't seen your email when we talked today.  I'm fine with whatever 
approach you want to take with the documents.  I'll call in for the meeting 
with Stan tomorrow.  I have the phone number.  Sorry we got cut off on the 
MOPS issue today.  I'm a little communication impaired up here, but I'll call 
on Wed. or Thur. on MOPS.  in the mean time, please grab whoever you need

These look fine to me. My sense is that Stan will go over Northern's offer in 
the initial phone call with Ted Davis; therefore it may make sense to just 
combine the two for Stan's purpose but keep the 2nd one seperate as the basis 
for a document to fax to Davis after the phone call. 

Wow.  Pretty interesting info.  I'm trying to think of a "plan B" approach, 
but without ENA (and their turbines) I'm haviang a hard time coming up with 
one.  Steve, I'll talk to you in Tucson on this.  Thanks.  DF

 I spoke to Frank Vickers who is responsible for ENA's power generation 
projects for the Western half of the United States. We discussed the 
opportunities for a generation project in the Albuquerque region and he 
offered the following observations.

 First, he indicated ENA has evaluated numerous projects in that area 
including participation in the Cobisa project. They always come to the same 
conclusion which is that the project economics become non-workable due power 
grid constraints and the inability to negotiate a long-term wheeling 
arrangement with PNM. He felt like the only reason Cobisa could go forward 
was due to PNM being the purchaser of power from the project. 

 We talked about lower the delivered cost of gas to the facility through a 
"zero return" pipeline but in the end what the generation facility would have 
to compete with is power from and around Palo Verde. He is very familiar with 
the ENA model (in fact he could calculate various electric costs immediately 
just based on some parameters I mentioned to him over the phone). In the end, 
he felt like ENA would not want to participate because the risk of having to 
sell the excess power at a competitive rate was just too great given the cost 
to get it to a market.

 We will continue to give the Pueblo project a final look by talking to 
Plains and Four Corners but without the baseload generation the pipeline 
prospects look pretty dismal.        

???  could you give me a call and suggest what to do-- I don't remember that 
we ran any ads.  Thanks. DF

Hey, the day's slippping away and I remember how yesterday went.  (Remember 
Kimball?)  I have a meeting with MKM and FX from 3-5 on the May 9 meeting in 
KC, so here are my thoughts on the call to Foglar:

 "Hey Murray, this is Drew.  We received the Chisos complaint and I thought 
I'd get ahold of you and see if there is any appetite at Duke to sit down and 
discuss resolving these issues in lieu of spending a lot of money on motions 
in Pecos County"   Grunt.  "I am curious whether the pleading is evidence 
that Duke/Chisos are not interested in resolving this outside the courts, or 
is it just a natural reaction to our letter;  a move to bring Northern to the 
table?"  Grunt.  "Is Chisos serious about litigating this?"  Grunt. "If 
Northern and Duke were to get together in the next 3 weeks, do you think it 
would make sense for Chisos to also attend?  Who do you think Duke would 
send?"  Grunt.  "Do you think Chisos would hold off on serving the petition 
pending discussions?"  

I can't think of much else to say/ask.   jrt

As you are aware, next week we will hold employee meetings in  Houston and 
Omaha.   The focus of these meetings is to have Dave Neubauer and Steve 
Harris  give their commercial updates.  We intend to have both Dave and Steve 
give their presentations from last week's KeyEx customer meeting plus some 
updates as to current  revenue levels etc.

We do not intend to show the KeyEx videotapes at these  employee meetings.  
However, we will make available to each of you, a copy of the  meeting 
videotape to share with your employees at satff meetings or to let them 
review it as time permits.
I will assume one copy is sufficient unless I hear otherwise.  Mike Nelson, I 
plan to get at least 4 copies for you unless you need more for  rotation 
throughout the field offices.

Please let me know!

Please call when you've reviewed this.  Thanks. DF

The Rolls-Royce vibration engineer has reported that the compressor itself is 
not inducing the abnormal vibration levels on the drive end bearings.  The 
engineer did report that the vibration is high for a new compressor, but not 
harmful to the compressor for the short term.

It is Rolls engineer's opinion that the excessive bearing vibration is due to 
vibrations created by gas flow through the suction strainer.  Rolls will be 
reviewing the gathered vibration data over the next few days to provide any 
further feedback.

TW Ops, via independent tests, has determined that the amplitude of the 
vibration that is eminating from the suction strainer is at a level which 
can, over time, be detrimental to the mechanical integrity of the unit 
piping. 

EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team have discussed the situation and have 
decided to temporarily take the unit out of service to pull the suction 
strainer.  The strainer will be inspected for foreign material or damage.  
The strainer will not be replaced unless some foreign material is found.  It 
is hoped that the removal of the strainer will 'de-tune' the piping system.

EECC, TW Ops Mgmt, and the TW Ops Team all feel that the risk of running 
without the startup strainer is minimized since the unit has been running 
intermittently for the past few days and has accumulated some significant run 
time.  It is expected that  any foreign material in the suction piping should 
have already been caught in the strainer.  Secondly, the station was designed 
with a suction scrubber which will further protect the compressor.

It is expected that the unit will be unavailable until midnight May 4, while 
the startup strainer is removed.  Care must be taken during the 
reinstallation of the piping spool as to not affect the compressor alignment 
or apply stress to the compressor nozzles.

Since the 311 belt/suspenders approach didn't quite fit, I've had to try to 
convince Mr. Hertzberg that he ought to rely on the NGA Sec. 1 exemption for 
gatherers (Frank Kelly and Frazier concur with us on this, by the way).  He 
is not convinced yet, although he is unable to cite any authority for his 
proposition that being a shipper on TW would subject a gathering company to 
FERC jurisdiction.  I pointed out that Agave, the owner and operator of an 
extensive gathering system that interconnects with TW's system, has for many 
years been a shipper on TW.  Also, Lindy has found that Red Cedar already has 
a long-term transportation contract on another interstate system, 
Transcolorado, so if Hertzberg's theory is right they are going to jail 
anyway!

Red Cedar also seems to be hung up on our requirement that shippers have 
title to the gas they ship.  At this point Lorraine and I believe they might 
just be looking for any excuse to get out of the deal.  If anything 
interesting happens I'll let you know.

So Haskell is trying to play good guy with us on Kansas Ad Valorem while he's 
trashing us at FEEBLE.  ENA is not one of the "largest single shippers" on 
Northern, at least in the market area.  They did that big negotiated rate 
deal with us, however for 300,000Dth, so I expect that is what Haskell is 
talking about.  They may in fact be the single biggest firm customer among 
the producer/marketer segment.  MKM and I ought to whup up on him down in KC 
next week on this issue.

   
	
	

I did not attend today's FEBA conference, but Sarah Novosell brought to my

Re:  ENA El Paso deal.  The trade press is having a heyday with the 
"anticompetitive" angle.  Lets talk.  DF
Enron-El Paso Deal Could Mute Competition to CA

     Fearing an end to pipeline competition in California, the state's 
regulators and Indicated
     Shippers have called on FERC to summarily reject the three 
transportation agreements by
     Approval of these agreements would give Enron Corp., parent of 
Transwestern Pipeline
     But "what's even worse," he told NGI, is the revenue-sharing provision 
in the contracts. It
     stipulates that "after Enron makes $35 million off of these contracts, 
it has to share the
     proceeds with El Paso for 25% of anything beyond $35 million. So 
effectively, Enron and
     El Paso have become partners in how high they can jack up the 
transportation rate
     differential between the California border and the Southwest producing 
basins." 

     The two pipeline companies "that have for decades competed with each 
other in carrying
     Southwest supplies to California are now partners. We think that's 
anticompetitive, and
     there's no way FERC should approve it," Morris said. He recalled the 
basis differential
     between the San Juan Basin spot price and the California border shot up 
by 17% during
     1998, the first year during which Dynegy controlled the El Paso capacity 
into California.
     This situation could worsen under Enron, he believes. 

     "At first blush the El Paso-Enron contracts [do] not appear to contain 
the same
     anticompetitive features of the El Paso-Dynegy contracts," Indicated 
Shippers noted, but
     a "closer review and analysis" reveals the anticompetitive effects of 
the revenue-sharing
     provision (RSP) in El Paso-Enron contracts "are not only similar" to 
those of the hotly
     contested reservation-reduction mechanism (RRM) in the El Paso-Dynegy 
case, "but are
     increased......due to the fact that the contracts are with a marketing 
affiliate of El Paso's
     primary interstate pipeline competitor," Transwestern. 

     Both the RRM and RSP "operate to provide a disincentive for El Paso and 
its competitors
     to compete against each other, or to take any other action that will act 
to drive down the
     basis differential that defines the market value of the capacity," 
Indicated Shippers told
     FERC in a protest filed on Wednesday [RP97-287-041]. The group includes 
producers
     Amoco Production, Burlington Resources Oil and Gas, Marathon Oil, and 
Phillips
     Petroleum, and two marketers - Amoco Energy Trading and Phillips Gas 
Marketing. 

     FERC "should reject the tariff filing immediately. The Commission erred 
in allowing the
     El Paso-Dynegy contracts to remain intact for their two-year term after 
finding that the
     contracts were anticompetitive. This issue is pending in the [D.C. Court 
of Appeals].
     That same error should not be repeated here," the producers and 
marketers said. 

     The CPUC's attempt to block the Enron-El Paso contracts at the outset is 
a little bit
     unusual for the agency, Morris said, but it learned its lesson following 
Dynegy. "When the
     Dynegy situation first hit, we asked for FERC to investigate the matter. 
We thought
     FERC did a very inadequate job then.....This time around we're asking 
for FERC to
     summarily reject it. It's hard for an agency like ours to take such a 
strong stand right at
     the beginning, but we've learned too much from two years of suffering 
under the Dynegy
     situation. And this is even worse." 

     In the event the Commission should reject California's request, the CPUC 
has asked that
     an "anti-hoarding condition" be included in the contracts, which would 
require Enron to
     release unused capacity into the short-term market at a price higher 
than what it's paying
     El Paso for the capacity. "They must make a little profit," Morris 
noted. "We're confident
     Enron can't use the entire 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity.....so there's going to 
be unused
     capacity." 

     The agency also wants FERC to clarify that the primary delivery point 
for the Block II
     portion of the capacity (579MMcf/d) is PG&E-Topock in keeping with the 
terms of the
     1996 settlement between El Paso and its customers. Morris said he agreed 
fully with
     Amoco, Burlington Resources and Southern California Gas (SoCalGas), 
which accused
     El Paso of violating the 1996 agreement by allowing Dynegy to use 
SoCalGas-Topock as
     a primary delivery point for the Block II capacity last summer. They 
contend the alleged
     violation is included in the Enron contracts. 

     He also noted the CPUC will challenge the ability of Enron to call back 
Block II capacity
     after it already had been recalled by El Paso shippers to serve Pacific 
Gas and Electric
     (PG&E) customers in northern California. Last July, FERC granted Dynegy 
the right to
     do this under its contracts with El Paso. But Morris contends the 
decision violates the
     1996 settlement under which PG&E paid $54 million to preserve the right 
of the pipeline's
     shippers to recall the Block II capacity to serve end-users in its 
service territory. 

     The CPUC also intends to challenge the Commission's decision that would 
enable Enron
     to "just sit on the capacity," thereby withholding idle Block II 
capacity from the market.
     Indicated Shippers also contend the Enron contracts violate the Block II 
capacity
     provisions of the 1996 rate case, as well as "exacerbate" the primary 
firm delivery point
     capacity-allocation issues that are pending before FERC now. 

     The CPUC accused El Paso of "deliberately" filing the Enron contracts at 
FERC just
     before the holidays to avoid controversy. The pipeline "is trying to 
sneak one of the most
     controversial things ever past FERC right before Christmas so that 
protests would be
     minimized," said Morris. "They did this with the Dynegy contracts two 
years ago. They
     have a pattern of filing right at the last minute, making it harder for 
people to protest and
     harder for FERC to stop it from going into effect."

Michele Winckowski, Keith Petersen, James Harvey & I met last week to discuss 
compliance with Order 639, the new OCS reporting requirements.  NNG has 5 
NGA-exempt facilities that are subject to the new reporting rules and will 
therefore be subject to Section 330.2.  While these facilities are NGA-exempt 
gathering, they continue to be included in NNG's transmission rates for rate 
purposes and remain eligible points for TI agreements and alternate firm.  
While these points are currently listed as available points and on the 
all-points exhibits of TI agreements, these points are not currently being 
used.  Michele and Keith have voiced concerns about having to perform 
separate OCS reports for these facilities.

Section 330.2(a) requires a report that includes maps and a list of 
affiliates.   Section 330.2(b) requires a description of transactions - 
contract number, receipt/delivery point, rates etc.  

We discussed two possible compliance strategies.  First, NNG could seek a 
waiver, asking that since the facilities remain in transmission rates and 
valid points on jurisdictional contracts, NNG asks that it be allowed to 
include these points in its NGA reports.   Alternatively, NNG could file the 
maps and list of affiliates, but with regard to transactions, simply file a 
statement that these points, while listed as valid on all TI and FT 
agreements have not been used in some time.  

I have read and re-read Order 639 to understand the date an initial report 
would be due.   The rule sets out some of the most confusing effective date 
language that I have ever read. Generally, reports are due on the 1st of each 
quarter regarding the status of transactions on the first day of the previous 
quarter.  On Page 47, the Commission purports to give more time for the 
initial submissions.  Initial reports will be "based on conditions on the 
first day of the full calendar quarter that begins after the effective date 
of thise rule, with initial reports due on the first business day after close 
of the quarter."  What I make of this is that NNG's first report would be due 
October 1, 2000 (based on the quarter commencing July 1).

We may want to considering seeking a waiver on or before July 1 (i.e. before 
the reporting period commences). 

Sorry--I'm not able to do it Monday afternoon.  Would breakfast on Tuesday be 
a viable alternative for Mark?  DF

The May ET&S Operations Field Trip is scheduled for May 24 at Gallup, New

On behalf of Mike, I am inviting you to accompany them on this trip.    The 
day's agenda will include an employee meeting, lunch and an opportunity to 
see the new Gallup Compressor Station.

Let me know if you are interested.

The whole thing also bugs me on an intuitive level, but I'm not sure it is a 
legal conflict of interest.  The Northern cases he is involved in are not 
really  "GISB matters."  There are certainly issues like the 637 compliance 
issue that involve GISB standards, however.  GISB is a freestanding entitity 
and his representation does not equate to representation of Enron so he could 
claim that his only client interest to worry about is GISB itself.  As long 
as he does not take positions in Northern cases that are inconsistent with 
what GISB wants, he's technically OK.  I suspect he'd argue that his work in 
the Northern docket is completely consistent with GISB's objective of 
achieving world domination.  This was my from the hip analysis when Jay first 
showed up in our cases, so I may have missed something.  For example, I'm not 
really clear on GISB's structure.  Can we argue that it is not a real stand 
alone entity but rather  a "front" for a cooperative group of companies that 
includes Enron?  If so, we might have a real conflict.  Thanks. DF

Shelley Corman

I was impressed that NDG filed revised comments in RM98-10 correcting their 
earlier mis-statements that GISB had ratified imbalance netting and trading 
standards.  The revised 2 page NDG filing states that GISB has not yet 
ratified the standards.
Then I noticed who signed the pleading -- Jay Costan.  I guess he ought to 
know, as he is GISB general counsel!

Does anyone else find this to be a conflict of interest for him to be GISB 
general counsel & then be counsel of a customer taking a position against a 
pipeline in a GISB matter.  I like Jay a lot, but I'm thinking of clarifying 
our understanding of his outside representation while he is GISB general 
counsel.

Thanks for the opportunity.  I'm V.P. and General Counsel of Enron 
Transportation and Storage, and its operating companies, Northern Natural Gas 
Co. and Transwestern Pipeline Co.  I'm stationed in Omaha, Nebraska.  I 
practiced law in D.C. for 12 years before FERC and other state and federal 
regulatory agencies and the courts.  As for objectives, I'd like to see the 
group facilitate dialogue and work toward consistency on regulatory strategy, 
as well as serve as a forum for sharing practical "best practices" experience 
Enron people have gained around the world.  I look forward to meeting you!

One of Steve Kean's newly formed Working Groups is for "Rates & Tariffs".  I 
have been asked to lead this group.  For those of you who don't know me, I am 
in Houston in the U.S./Canada Government Affairs group, in a section called 
"Rates/Regulatory Services."  Our working group will have about a dozen or so 
people from various parts of Public Affairs.  You have been 
selected/volunteered to participate in this effort by your group leaders.  

The Working Group members are:
Ray Alvarez
Sergio Assad
Roy Boston
Mike Grimes
Kyran Hanks
Rita Hartfield
Nancy Hetrick
Tom Hoatson
Paul Kaufman
Valeria Lima
Bob Neustaedter

Having this group will give us a great opportunity to identify needs related 
to rate and tariff issues across many business lines and countries, share 
resources, problems and solutions, and generally improve the cohesiveness of 
Steve's organization   One of our first tasks will be to think through and 
concretely specify what we expect to accomplish as a group.   We do not have 
a specific product mandate per se - it will be up to us to figure it out and 
deliver it.   Some possibilities are - identifying rates and tariffs policy 
positions, developing policies where none now exist, but are needed, 
identifying rates and tariff resources available to the group, and acquiring 
resources needed by the group. 

As a preliminary matter, could you e-mail me your group name, position, 
location, phone, e-mail address, and "area of expertise".  We will assemble 
this information in a roster to be distributed to the group.

Early in January, we will be in touch to check availability and schedule an 
initial meeting.  Please be as flexible as possible.  In some cases, we are 
many time zones apart and it will be difficult to match everyone's desired 
time. 

As a second preliminary matter, please give some thought to and e-mail me 
what you think a group like this should accomplish.  Remember, the roster 
above has some of the world's leading authorities on rates and tariffs!   We 
will compile both the complete roster and your ideas on group goals and 
distribute them to everybody prior to our first actual meeting.   At that 
first meeting, we will talk through expectations of us and of each other, and 
the proposed goals.  
Please have your inputs to me by January 7.  I look forward to working with 
you.   

pls put on my calendar.  thanks.df

Please note that if TW eventually decides to file for a tariff change to

proposed accounting methodology included in the filing.  
Rod Hayslett

If FERC is going to tell us the accounting or specifically approve our 
proposed accounting then I have no issues.     I do not want to have a tariff 
change with our interpretation of accounting requirements for it, without 
that specific approval.   So I guess we need to specifically ask for approval 
of the accounting.

Some simple questions?

As I indicated this morning, it's not that I "want" to classify these credits 
as revenues in order to achieve any commercial, regulatory, overhead 
allocation or tax objectives, but if all other factors are considered equal 
believe that revenue treatment is the most appropriate decision from  both 
GAAP and FERC USofA standpoints.  

FERC USofA

In the "Shipper Supplied Gas" section of Order 581 the Commission concluded 
that "it is not appropriate to mandate revenue recognition for gas provided 
by shippers for compressor fuel and other pipeline system use and used to 
provide transportation services.  Instead, each pipeline will have the 
discretion to determine whether it will recognize revenue for these 
transactions in its accounting records...Pipelines electing to recognize 
shipper provided gas as revenue must also recognize an equal amount of 
purchased gas expense.  Pipelines would credit the appropriate transportation 
revenue account (Accounts 489.1 through 489.4) and record an equal amount in 
Account 805, Other Gas Purchases."    We have chosen not to recognize 
revenue, but we do want to track our transactions, so we debit and credit 
different subaccounts of acct 805.  The over-retained volumes on TW are 
debited to acct 805 and credited to acct 495 Other Revenues (also in 
accordance with Order 581. However, for internal reporting we map the 495 
credit to cost of transport (expense).    Sounds reasonable to me.    Will 
you be able to continue that in SAP? Yes.  We'll be using statistical orders 
in lieu of subaccounts.
While the Commission agreed that pipelines would not be required to recognize 
shipper provided gas on its books, it did require those who chose to do so to 
record it as transportation revenue, not as a credit to fuel or gas purchase 
expense.

GAAP

Revenues.  Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 6 defines revenues 
as inflows or other enhancements of assets of an entity or settlements of its 
liabilities (or a combination of both) from delivering or purchasing goods, 
rendering services, or other activities that constitute the entity's ongoing 
major or central operations.

In the TW proposal the cash inflows are the result of a fuel charge factor in 
the transportation tariff.  TW's ongoing major or central operation is the 
rendering of natural gas transportation services to shippers pursuant to its 
tariff.  Therefore  the credits resulting from the assessment of the fuel 
charge constitute transportation revenues.    I don't think there is a 
limitation with respect to cash received in lieu of gas.  When gas is 
retained we can debit and credit 805 and it's a wash.  When we receive cash 
we have to charge a balance sheet account (Cash) and credit an income 
statement account.  We can't opt out of recording an earnings creating 
transaction.   What is the argument that this cash does not just take the 
place of Gas you would have received and should track the normal accounting 
for gas?  The cash alone cannot take the place of a retained volume; the cash 
together with a gas purchase is the volumetric equivalent of a volume 
retained.   Under this proposal we would charge gas purchase expense when the 
cash is used to buy gas that would replace the volumes not retained in 
kind.   I am concerned that what you are proposing may not work as well after 
the next rate case (since I don't believe it likely we will be allowed to 
continue to collect the windfall) and we may be setting ourselves up for 
restatements.    But I guess it really won't matter, because whatever we do 
FERC will have specifically ordered us to account for it that way, isn't that 
right?  There is nothing about our current or proposed accounting that would 
have to be changed as the result of a future rate case that changes the 
volumetric retention factors.  However, if a tracker is imposed, then we 
would have additional entries to make, similar to those we now make on NNG.  
In any event, the  imbalance cashout  approach described below  would result 
in the recording of fuel retention entries  (debit and credit account 805)  
exactly the same as we now record for volumes  retained.  It would merely 
result in the additional entry to resolve the imbalance by debiting cash and 
crediting the imbalance receivable from the shipper.  

Expenses.  Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No. 5 speaks to the 
recognition of expenses and losses:  "Further guidance for recognition of 
expenses and losses is intended to recognize consumption (using up) of 
economic benefits...during a period.  Expenses...are generally recognized 
when an entity's economic benefits are used up in delivering or producing 
goods, rendering service, or other activities that constitute its ongoing 
major or central operations..."

In the TW proposal natural gas volumes are consumed in the operation of 
compressor engines to render natural gas transportation service to 
shippers...the ongoing major or central operation of the company.  Receiving 
cash from shippers in accordance with the Tariff's fuel charge does not 
reduce the consumption of natural gas volumes in rendering transportation 
service, Instead it provides economic assets (cash) to the company to pay for 
the gas volumes that have to be acquired to run the compressors.  Therefore 
the proceeds from the fuel charge represent transportation revenues for the 
company, not a fuel or gas purchase expense reduction.     I recently 
received a memo from Susan Scott (Legal) indicating that in approving tariff 
changes to allow shippers to pay cash for fuel use rather than to provide 
in-kind volumes, FERC looks at the situation as being analogous to cashing 
out an imbalance, where the imbalance was created by the shipper not 
delivering the fuel retention volumes.  If we followed FERC's lead here we 
would record the fuel retention entries with a debit and credit to Account 
805, then credit the cash receipt from the shipper as a reduction of its 
imbalance.  Any gain or loss on the cash-out would be credited to Acct 495 
(gain) or charged to Acct 813 (loss), just like any other gain or loss on 
resolution of an imbalance.  

I think the cashout approach will probably meet the objective of not bloating 
reported margins...at least if the tariff language is consistent with this 
concept.  If you prefer this cashout approach to my original proposal to 
record fee revenue, then I will go ahead and re-draft the accounting memo 
along those lines.  Any final determination of the appropriate accounting, 
though, would have to be made after the language in the tariff revision is 
finalized. However, if the cashout approach is your preference, then I expect 
that we could work with Rates to make sure that the tariff language doesn't 
conflict with the cashout approach.

Shall I re-draft and recirculate the memo using the cashout approach?        

Rod Hayslett

05/08/2000 06:32 AM
I guess I'd like to understand the reason for wanting to call them 
revenue?    

   
	
	

I don't disagree that there are frequently numerous ways to account for 
things--and some ways are better than others for tax, regulatory, financing 
and other purposes.  From an historical perspective before Order 636 we 
didn't seem to have any difficulty recording the proceeds from the PGA 
tracker portion of the tariff as transportation revenue.  Under the proposed 
circumstances, we are charging a fee based on average fuel retention 
percentages that are set somewhat higher than actual consumption and there is 
no requirement for a true-up.  In this circumstance, even though we may call 
it a fuel reimbursement factor, it seems to be more characteristic of revenue 
than expense credit.  

That having been said, if it's deemed to be advantageous to the company to 
account for these cash proceeds as an expense credit, I could support 
crediting the proceeds to a/c 805 similar to our accounting for volumetric 
fuel retention.  If that's the path you'd like us to follow, I'll amend the 
draft memo accordingly.  Please confirm.

Rod Hayslett

05/05/2000 06:58 AM
My first blush problems are 2.     1) This is really reimbursement for an 
item that is designated an expense - compressor fuel and so I don't know why 
you want to show it as revenue.     2)   Having a stat order will not help 
the income statement presentation of revenues, a lower percentage of costs 
being recovered from demand charges, a major factor if we decide to make TW 
really stand on its own.

What is the reason for wanting to bloat the revenue in the income 
statement?     Explain the logic for showing a revenue item for the contra of 
an item that has been determined to be an expense.     
 

   
	
	

If we go with the transport revenue approach, we would for sure set up a 
separate SAP statistical order to accumulate the fuel reimbursement fee 
separately from the other revenue components.  If you think this approach is 
distortive from a reporting trend perspective, we could classify these 
revenues as "other gas revenues" on our GAAP statements--similar to the way 
we've classified excess fuel retention revenue in TW's 1999 GAAP statements.  

Rod Hayslett

05/04/2000 02:41 PM
I would think at a minimum we would like to have some kind of a tracking 
account (nojn-FERC)  for accounting purposes to be able to tell the earnigs 
impact of the transactions.      I have a problem with recording the revenue 
in a plain transportation revenue account since it will skew the percentage 
of transport revenues collected from demand charges  which is an important 
piece for the financial world.   Ultimately I guess FERC will tell us how to 
account for it.

   
	
	

From what we have so far been able to learn about the referenced proposal, 
and after discussions with Dan Fancler, I prepared the attached draft of an 
accounting memorandum for your consideration.  

Please advise if you have additional facts or ideas to be considered.

By copy of this memo I'm asking Jerry Moore for excise tax advice as to 
whether TW would risk incurring excise tax if we record gas sales to the 
shippers and then retain the volumes for fuel.

Shoot.  Due to a conflict on Monday, I'm now scheduled to arrive in Houston 
on Tuesday at 10 am.  I return to Omaha at 8 PM  on Wednesday.  If there is 
anything on Mark's schedule consistent with those constraints, please let me

I met with Ray and Polly Pettingill last night and we made a decision on the 
scoreboard.  A 27' model made by the Fair-Play company.  The quote is 
$12,360.00 delivered and it has all the options they need.  If we buy it 
there is 7% tax, if we donate the money to the school there is no tax. The 
only item preventing us from placing the order is how to word the memorial.  
Polly is going to visit with the kids and get their thoughts.  Also the 
Pettingill's have asked for discussion at Monday nights school board meeting 
on a proposal to name the football field Dan Reedy Field.  If this goes 
through the memorial panel may say " Welcome To Dan Reedy Memorial Field".  
As soon as they make this decision we'll finalize the art work which takes 
about a week then 4-5 additional weeks for delivery.

 The athletic director is not a real fireball, so Ray is working directly 
with the school superintendent.  I spoke with the superintendent last night 
and stated we would like to donate the money to them for the purchase of the 
scoreboard.  He is cautious in agreeing to anything without knowing more 
details.  Ray was to drop off the materials collected from the scoreboard 
company today, 5/10 so he can get up to speed prior to Monday's board 
meeting.  I'll visit with him again next week.

As I stated after our last meeting, Ray is very interested in performing the 
installation.  Also the Waterloo employees are aware of this and they to want 
to take part in the installation.  I informed Ray last night that we don't 
have a problem with him doing it so that is the plan. One recommendation I 
wish to make is, the cost savings on the installation is $2100, can dedicate 
$1000 from Tom's budget to cover incidentals during installation.  I can 
oversee and purchase these items on my purchasing card.  I don't think Ray 
will be capable of getting all material donated. This way would be much 
easier than donating the extra money to the school and then trying to work 
with the school to pay for these items. 

(P.S.  I have communicated the plans to-date to Lana Reedy, so she is in the 
loop.)

Re:    Discussion of Regulatory Issues regarding ENA's Gas Storage 
Development Project

I'm OK with the language, but I want to make sure everyone is OK on the 
concept.  When we left this (unless there have been subsequent conversations 
with ECS that I wasn't a part of) we rejected Courtney's proposal to reduce 
our up front payment by $500,000.  He was to come back and propose a monthly 
quantity of gas to be paid over the term of the contract that would equate to 
the $500,000, but I don't recall that we agreed to it.  Did we intend to 
leave the issue open for more horsetrading on the amount of a haircut ECS 
should take or were we content to cover ECS at 100 cents on the dollar?  I am 
advised that the Btu number in the letter would allow ECS to get the full 
$500,000 of up front value.  

Rod and Steve--this one is up to you and I think its totally a question of 
whether we want to argue for some more $$ because I can't think of any other 
open issue with ECS on this or any other deals that we might be able to 
trade.    DF

	
	

Please take a look at this and let me know whether it accurately reflects 
what you discussed with ECS.  I'm reviewing it now and will let you know my

Rosemary,

Please forward to the Hubbard meeting participants.  It may be good to remind 
them that it is best printed in color.  Also, if you make a change and save 
it before you print, there is a risk of the font change as we saw earlier.

Thanks.

Team

I have summarized in the margins of our DRAFT deal structure the "high level" 
issues that Gail Tholen, Jin and I discussed on Thursday.   These are 
preliminary guidelines and as our deal evolves and our partner's desires 
change, we will have to potentially address completely different accounting, 
regulatory and tax issues.     We hope to touch on some of the issues that 
this structure may raise from a Regulatory perspective with Drew Fossom when 
we meet next Tuesday at 10:00AM.  

Please comment and advise as you see fit.

Thanks

I just wanted to clarify a few points mentioned in this diagram:  

1.  The reason that gain recognition may be precluded under the equity sell 
down if Enron maintains a guarantee is because guarantees are considered 
"continuing involvement" under FAS 66 : Sale of Real Estate.  We would 
essentially own an interest in an asset which is considered real estate (per 
accounting rules). By maintaining a guarantee, Enron has not given up all of 
the risks and rewards of ownership and therefore true sale treatment would be 
precluded.

2.  The lease versus executory contract  debate is centered around the nature 
of the offtake agreement coupled with our involvement in the project.  
Involvement that requires us to take operational risk coupled with taking 
capacity leans toward a lease.  However, each deal is different and there 
isn't a bright line test for determining lease vs. executory; although, it 
certainly looks better if our offtake is minimal.  As well, LD language 
should not only be present but should be significant or market based.  In 
addition, the contract should not mention the storage facility, only that 
capacity will be provided.  Determining whether we are in a lease versus and 
executory contract is based on a preponderance of the evidence (more facts 
pointing toward executory contract versus lease).

3.  In the General Notes section, you mention the Trust being funded by all 
debt and contribution to the project being considered equity.  I'm unsure 
where this conclusion was reached.  This is not something I believe we fully 
discussed.  Whether of not it can be funded by all debt is something I will 
have to digest and get back to you about.   How much money is coming in 
through the investment trust?  From the diagram is looks like Enron ownership 
would be 30% instead of 12% if that piece is considered debt.  30% ownership 
does not necessarily lead to consolidation of Project Co. LLC.  

4.  Two more items of interest that we did not discuss are our Affiliate 
Rules and FAS 98 Sale Leaseback.  Under our affiliate rules, if the capacity 
contract is deemed an executory contract and qualifies for MTM Accounting, we 
can only mark the portion of the contract we do not own.  So long as we 
maintain a 12% interest, we could probably only MTM 88% of the contract.  
However, there is debate in this area depending on our level of "control".  
Affiliate rules normally cover greater than 20% ownership investments unless 
we exert significant influence.  I believe we will be in control of the 
structure.  This will require more discussion later.

-FAS 98 Sale Leaseback is not a good place to be but is something to keep in 
mind.  However, we can be proactive and work toward keeping ourselves out 
lease land and structure this as and executory contract.

Per my request, please allow me sometime to digest this structure and consult 
with my colleagues.  I will be in touch.

Marathon and Phillips Join Protest

    Two more shippers have joined Amoco and Burlington Resources in their
joint protest against El Paso?s decision to sell to Enron 1.2 Bcf of excess
capacity from the San Juan Basin to California. Marathon and Phillips have
joined in the protest, attacking the entire deal as anti-competitive. The
protesters hope FERC will force El Paso to begin again with capacity
assignments. Amoco and Burlington had already protested the deal two weeks
ago at FERC, when they claimed the sale would violate El Paso?s rate case
settlement and tariff. The shippers argue that El Paso was trying to sell
part of that primary firm capacity at delivery points other than
PG&E/Topock), which the settlement prohibits. The settlement was intended to
protect PG&E and allow it to access service. If this capacity is delivered at
other points such as SoCal/Topock, it could add to the glut at that point,
the protesters argued. El Paso and Enron stand to gain if the basis
differential between the San Juan Basin and California remains large.
Marathon and Phillips say that Enron and El Paso can manipulate that basis
differential because between them and their affiliates they control all the
excess capacity from the San Juan Basin to California.

Speculators Reduce Long Ratio

    Speculators have reduced the size of their bets on rising NYMEX crude oil
futures during the two weeks ending last year. Speculator long positions now
outnumber short positions by 1.4 to 1 compared with a ratio of 2.9 to 1 two
weeks earlier and 3.8 to 1 four weeks earlier. Prices peaked at a
post-Gulf-War high of $27.15 a barrel November 22nd and ended the year at
$25.60. Long positions in crude oil futures on the NYMEX held by hedge funds
and large speculators were 44,233 on December 28th, little changed from
44,693 on December 14th, according to the CFTC. Speculator short positions
doubled, though, to 31,868 from 15,364. Speculators also became less bullish
about both gasoline and heating oil as their short positions increased much
more than the long positions did during the two-week period. The ratio of
longs to shorts in gasoline fell to about 3-to-2 from 20-to-1. For natural
gas, speculators increased their overall bet that gas prices would fall. They
had placed bets for rising gas prices from April until mid-November, when a
lack of severe cold weather demand pulled prices down from a two-year high.
The following table shows the changes in speculator positions for crude oil,
heating oil, gasoline and natural gas futures.

Statoil Sells E&P Business to Equitable

    Equitable Resources, has acquired Statoil Energy?s Appalachian Basin Gas
Exploration and Production subsidiaries, Eastern States Exploration Company
and Eastern States Oil and Gas for $630 million. The transaction is expected
to close in February. The sale includes natural gas reserves totaling
approximately 1.1 Tcf, 6,500 production wells, and 4,000 miles of pipeline
network in Kentucky, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Ohio. Sale of the
exploration and production business is the first step in The Statoil Group?s
overall plan of complete divestment of Statoil Energy. Statoil Energy?s
remaining businesses, power generation, energy marketing and trading,  will
be offered for sale in a separate process starting later this month. The
divestment plan is part of Statoil?s overall restructuring program to

EPRI Launches Customized Technical Support Services Subsidiary

   A new subsidiary of the Electric Power Research Institute will offer
customized technical support services to both members and non-members of its
research program. EPRIsolutions is a for-profit subsidiary created to hasten
the application of EPRI technologies already developed through decades of
collaborative research. EPRIsolutions will work directly with our customers
to select, install and support the EPRI technologies most suitable for their
particular needs. Many of the services offered will be performed by the staff
of EPRI?s Technology Application Centers located throughout the US. For
example, the Engineering and Test Centers in Lenox, Mass. and Haslet, Tex.
can provide audits of utility power delivery systems to identify weaknesses
before they lead to outages. The Maintenance and Diagnostics Center in
Charlotte, N.C. can help customers save on the cost of operating and
maintaining their fossil-fired power plants. As an example of how such
integrated services will be offered, EPRIsolutions can help customers adapt
and install the powerful, sophisticated software packages now available for
load forecasting, environmental risk assessment, and retail market
management. In some cases, EPRIsolutions will go one step further by acting
as an application service provider for companies that want to outsource
data-intensive operations. The first such ASP activity will be on-line
monitoring and diagnosis of water chemistry for several nuclear power plants.
EPRIsolutions is being formed through the merger of two existing
subsidiaries, EPRICSG and EPRIGEN, which were created to allow EPRI to
conduct proprietary R&D on behalf of individual funders, who would retain
rights to the intellectual property involved. In addition to continuing this
activity, EPRIsolutions takes on the function of providing customized
technology application and consulting services. Such private-benefit work
lies beyond the scope of EPRI's tax-exempt, collaborative research mission
and thus requires the use of a taxable subsidiary.

HEAD?S UP? PRICES DOWN!

    Natural gas prices have fallen to $2.40/MMBtu from $3.20/MMBtu just last
month. Storage injections still outweigh storage withdrawals. Where will
prices go? Depends on the weather. If it is warm in Houston and New York City
over the Thanksgiving holidays, will prices continue to head south? Under
those conditions, they have since 1993. Call it ?Rader?s Stupid Frozen Turkey
Theory? or call it storage fundamentals, but be prepared in case this silly
theory comes true one more year. For an in-depth, wellhead to burnertip study

Oxy and EOG Swap Properties

    Occidental Petroleum and EOG Resources have exchanged oil and natural gas
fields to cut costs and boost production. Oxy received fields in California
that produce about 12 MMcf per day and mineral rights to more than 700,000
acres of land in the state. It also received properties in the western Gulf
that produce 26 MMcfe per day, adjacent to fields Oxy already owns. EOG
received properties in eastern Texas that are next to fields it owns and
which produce 33 MMcf per day and 3,000 barrels of oil a day. It also
acquired exploration rights on 312,000 acres in the Oklahoma panhandle.

Calpine Buys Reserves from Vintage

     Calpine has acquired 90 Bcf of natural gas reserves from Vintage
Petroleum for $71.5 million, becoming the largest gas producer in
California?s Sacramento Valley. Calpine bought the remaining 58% interest in
the Rio Vista field that it did not already own, along with some exploration
rights. It received the 42%  stake when it acquired Sheridan Energy last
November for $128 million. Calpine plans to purchasing natural gas fields and
pipelines so it can provide fuel for its natural gas powered generators at
lower costs. Calpine plans to expand its electric generation businesses in
California, Texas, Arizona and Nevada along with the Southeast and Northeast.
It operates power plants that can generate 3,400 MW.

Callon Natural Gas Blowout

    Callon Petroleum had a natural gas blowout while drilling a test well in
the Gulf of Mexico and a fire is burning from a portion of the well. There
were no injuries at the  at South Marsh Island Block 261 well, about 60 miles
south of Lafayette, Louisiana. The fire is burning from a portion of the well
casing about 20 feet above sea level. Wild Well Control, a well-blowout
specialty company, is making preparations to bring the well under control.

Attached below is a proposed timeline for activities and deadlines for 
completion of such activities associated with the upcoming TW auction on 
EnronOnline. The timeline is set in order to meet the July 1 deadline for 
implementation. We have tried to structure the activities and deadlines so 
that it can be adapted to other GPG auctions as well. I appreciate everyone's 
help in advance in meeting these dates which I certainly realize are tight 
but are necessary in order to meet the July target. The key activities which 
are critical for completion for the week of May 15 are as follows:

1.Webtext for TW Auction----Finalized by Monday May 15 (to be handed off to 
EOL for auction site design). 
2.Draft Customer Letter announcing auction out for internal comments by 
Wednesday May 17.

In addition, a GPG distribution list for review of certain activities (i.e., 
customer letter, internal employee announcement, press release) has been 
included. We will  update this timeline once a week. If you have questions, 
please call.

THANKS for everyone's help in moving us along so quickly so far!!! We will be 
able to meet the July goal!!!

Julia

Thank you,

Tammy  

No problem with the plan to send a demand letter to El Paso on the 
measurement issue.  Please include me on distribution for the draft.  
Thanks,  DF

How about Thursday or Friday, June 1 or 2 for a round of golf?  I'm in HOU 
all wk and the end of the wk looks pretty light.  I'd be happy to venture out 
west to your Katy/San Antonio nick of the woods if you guys are available.  
Hill, are you gonna be in Houston around then?  If so, can you sneak the 
clubs past your wife?  Please advise.  DF  

PS:  I met with Paul Bieniawski and his new storage group today.  Do you guys 
know how he parted terms with the Frogs?  

Thanks for the offer!  Lets see when we get this event scheduled and I may be 
able to take you up on it.  Looks like you Utilicorp guys need to get 
coordinated or I may have to play golf twice.  That would be brutal.  DF

afternoon of June 1 works great with me.  I've "inked" you in.  Drewski,
plan to stay at the house that evening as well.  same for you David Hill if
you can make it.

no, but would love to here the story.

I enjoyed meeting with you guys and your team this morning.  Our crack 
certificate people have already responded to my request, as you'll see 
below.  As you get deeper into the process, talking with Michele and her 
colleagues may be useful for you as they have been through it all before with 
FERC on storage projects.  Let me know if I can be of further help.  Thanks 
for the quick help, Michele.  DF 
Attached are a list of the exhibits for a certificate application and the 
environmental requirements (this document is the redline for the new 
environmental regulations under Order No. 603, 603A, & 603B). Within this 
document is the minimum checklist requirements for the environmental report.  
I included everything because ultimately we must provide everything --not 
just the minimum.   If this is too much or not enough let me know.   Also, 
the definition of an affected landowner on new or expansion of the boundaries 
of an existing storage facility includes both surface and subsurface owners 
for landowner notification requirements (such requirements are not included 
in the attached documents).  thanks MW

   
	
	

Do we have anything off the shelf that we could send to some guys at ENA that 
are trying to understand the 7(c) process?  They asked me for something like 
a "checklist" of what you'd have to put in a cert. app. to build and operate 
a new storage project.  Any ideas would be appreciated.  DF

I got a call from Tino Monaldo today passing on the results of Dennis 
Langley's meeting with DOE in Albuquerque.  DOE indicated that their current 
PNM rate is "5.3 cents, exclusive of the demand charge."  Tino's consultant 
claims that factoring in the demand charge yields an effective rate of 
approximately 7 cents/KWh.  Assuming we need to come in at 10% less than the 
current rate, our bogey is 6.3 cents/KWh.  This is at the high end of the 
range we hoped they'd be in.

Additionally, DOE indicated that they need "redundancy" and don't want to 
rely on PNM for back up power.  They want a multiple turbine facility--i.e., 
more smaller turbines instead of fewer large turbines.  The new pipeline will 
need to be split connected to El Paso and TW in order to access diverse 
supplies and guard against supply failure.  They have not asked for fuel oil 
backup.  

I know this is starting to look like the project that won't go away, but the 
power price number looks very promising to me.  I think its worth scrubbing 
down the model we've used to replace the generic capital cost and O&M 
assumptions with more specific assumptions related to the specific turbine 
configuration we'd be using.  

If this price is really as favorable as I think, can we make another run at 
the ENA people and Federal Solutions guys to see if they have any interest?  
DF      

If you guys are just going to squabble like a couple of old ladies I'm not 
sure I want to play golf with you!  By the way, Hill, your excuse is lame.  DF

There you go!  Always telling me what to do.

Pat:  Cal me when you have a few minutes.

I couldn't open the document, but that's OK as I will have no problem with 
whatever form and content you include, as long as they don't build in any 
links to porno sites or similar undesirable places.  Thanks. DF

   
	
	

Attached is the proposal by the corporate IT group on the new enron.com 
website.  They have not stated how many sites they are going to modify, or 
how "deep" they are going to go on their revisions....other than to say they 
will not be revising each companies individual websites.  I am viewing the 
presentation today to see the slides for the first time.  Please review the 
slides and let me know if you have any comments on the format, content, etc. 
If I hear more details, I will forward to you.

Thanks.

If we are still talking about 6-1, any time after 1 should work for me, as 
I've got a meeting that ends at 11:30 downtown.  How long does it take to 
drive to Katy at noon???  About 3 hours?  DF

That's the Norman course. Why don't you make a tee time.

Pat

I met with Ms Caplan yesterday and had a good discussion.  I was pretty 
impressed with her.  The only down side is that her inability to sit for the 
Texas bar is a hangup for a lawyer position.   I suggested that she also look 
into getting her license in New York or D.C. as I think those jurisdictions 
are less reluctant to allow non-U.S. lawyers to sit for the bar than Texas 
is.  I'll talk to Mike Moran, Dot McCoppin, Britt Davis and Shelley Corman 
regaring possible positions in GPG.  Have you thought about Steve Kean's 
group?  They might be able to use someone like Emma.  I plan to write her in 
a couple of weeks to follow up with any additional leads I've found.  Enjoyed 
shootin the shit with you, as always!  DF    

Please take a look at this response.  I'm reviewing Mike's draft answers from 
last week and would like to forward to Britt and Barrett all the input we 
have by noon or so.  Thanks. DF

Lou, I agree with your legal analysis.  Susan confirmed for me that the TW 
tariff has no specific PCB limit and I think your analysis is accurate on how 
FERC or the courts would react to the  "toxic substances" language that is in 
there.  Please go ahead and get back to Bill and report your conclusions, 
with my endorsement if that adds any value (perhaps the value of another neck 
in the noose).  Also, it is worrysome that PG&E has an argument that any 
dollars they spend on Southwest must be reimbursed by TW under our 
agreement.  They might feel free to pour money on Southwest to keep them 
happy, even if Southwest doesn't put much pressure on PG&E and as a customer 
relationship strategy , in the belief that it is Enron money they are playing 
with.  Can we do anything to keep PG&E honest on this?  

Given all of the above,  is it our strategy to continue to manage this 
Southwest Gas problem as best we can as part of the broader PG&E problem?

Bill raises some good questions.  I've been struggling with the "legal duty" 
question to SW Gas since we do not have a contract with SW - even PG&E does 
not have a contract with SW - PG&E's contract is with SoCal.   Without the 
contractual duty or a tariff requirement ( I don't believe our gas quality 
section would prohibit PCBs - even should they reach level that is regulated 
by the State of California or the EPA ) that sends us back to common law 
duties/causes of action - such as trespass, nuisance, and ordinary 
negligence.  Since PCBs are authorized by the EPA in natural gas pipelines at 
virtually any level as long as certain actions are taken I don't place much 
stock in the common law duties although the EPA's position would not be 
dispositive - merely heavily persuasive.  Other than some type of weak third 
party beneficiary claim is there anything here???

	
	

I generally agree with the plan going forward, but before we finalize a SW 
Gas strategy, I want to know what our legal duties are to SW Gas if they find 
high PCB's. Is there an EPA requirement? Were any commitments made by TW to 
SW Gas in past years? Would they go after PG&E and, if so, would that fall 
under or commitment to PG&E to cover costs? Keep me in the loop and let's 
make sure we don't get any press on this until all facts are known and a 
communication plan is in place.

   Bill

   
	
	

FYI

Once E&C has developed plans to contain PCB's on the PG&E system, we will 
have to get approval for new 2000 Work Orders. I'm just guessing, but we will 
likely incur expenses of $2 to $3 million. This will be for decon work, for 
filter/separators on their system at customer taps, and probably some big 
filter/separators downstream on their A & B Lines. I'll work to find the $ 
from within the 2000 approved Capital limits.

The following is an overview of the discussions that took place today and 
some excellent work by David and our field lads this evening:

Counsel for PG&E contacted Soldano to relay sampling results from last Friday 
testing on the line to SW Gas (five results- all in ug/100cm2) and all from 
internal surfaces on the equipment and short segment of pipe immediately 
upstream of the SW Gas line - ND, 2.4, 1,7, 5.7,2.5)  and to let TW know that 
PG&E and SW personnel would be conducting further sampling today on the SW 
system not far from the Topock C/S.  He was primarily calling to see how TW 
would respond to two questions that had not yet been posed but which may well 
come up soon - 1.) If SW Gas should request compensation/reimbursement for 
issues associated with PCBs what would be TW's response? and 2.) Would TW be 
interested in ensuring that PG&E and TW speak with as common a voice as 
possible and if so, how that might be accomplished.   Neither question was 
answered but PG&E was assured that TW would continue to work as closely as 
possible with PG&E to resolve any issues.  Possible joint phone conferences 
and meetings with SW were discussed including meeting tied to the planned 
meeting in Las Vegas on the 12th.  PG&E also stated that they were ordering a 
small PECO F/S for the SW Gas take off line which they expected to be in the 
$20,000 to $30,000 range

Our internal discussion afterwards suggested that we wait to see the 
analytical results of today's testing (probably due back on Tuesday of next 
week) before committing to any costs coverage issues and that Kevin Hyatt and 
Lorraine Lindberg would follow-up with Rod Boschee on Thursday on the "one 
voice" issue.  A meeting with SW Gas sometime around the 12th would likely be 
as quick a meeting as SW Gas could prepare for and it would be best if we had 
the sample results back before a meeting was scheduled.

David Roensch and the field crew were able to participate in the sampling 
event on the SW Gas system.  They tested some domestic meters which appeared 
in mint condition.  There were no liquids and from appearances alone, PCBs 
may not be present.  SW Gas had their environmental specialist on location 
and the entire SW Gas crew was reported in high spirits and quite friendly 
about the entire situation.

At the suggestion of Robert Jones (you remember him--one of the growing 
legion of ex-GPG HR representatives), I interviewed a lady named Emma Caplan 
yesterday.  She is the wife of a guy that Enron Networks brought over to 
Houston from London.  She is a "Solicitor" in the English legal system, and 
got her law degree at the University of Wales.  She has not taken an American 
bar exam but may be able to take DC or New York.  For some reason related to 
practice of foreign lawyers in TX, she can't take the TX bar until she has 
gotten a US law degree.  This person is very bright, personable, and 
enthusiastic.  She is extremely interested in working for Enron, either as a 
lawyer once she gets her license squared away, or in a paralegal or analyst 
position until then. I left a copy of her resume with Emily, and I'd ask that 
she please forward it to each of you.  If any of you have need for such an 
individual or have ideas she should pursue within Enron (or outside Enron), 
please call Robert or myself.  Thanks.  DF      

Please give me a call ASAP on marketing affiliate issue on TW Enron Online 
deal.  Cell 402-630-8461 or home 402-572-8595.  I'm in tomorrow around 7:45.

Well, if she's "very bright, personable, and enthusiastic" she certainly 
won't fit in with us.   

I'll follow up with mike and shelly on the person we were thiniking of 
splitting for the summer - that may already be a done deal, if not it may 
make sense to do something more permanent but we will need to look at 
budget...

i could probably use some part time help with Bret Reich exiled to Phase IV 
but i should have a licensed lawyer for that.

Another Tino-gram.  DOE disclosed to Team Tino that they pay a $7.06/mo 
demand charge per KW in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge.  Tino didn't 
know whether that was per KW of monthly demand, per KW of non-coincident peak 
usage, or what.  The PNM tariff for govt. service is priced at $7.16/KW of 
"demand above 10,000kw during peak period"  (peak period is daytime) so I 
assume that is how it is calculated.  If that is the tariff ("Schedule 
4000B") under which DOE really takes service, this is interesting because 
that is not a very big discount off of the stated rate.  It is also 
interesting that DOE is paying $.053/kwh for energy since the Schedule 4000B 
energy rate is $.05072/kwh (maybe the difference is surcharges or something). 
Tino's consultant has figured out that the demand charge equates to an 
incremental $.011 in addition to the $.053/kwh energy charge, for a total 
delivered PNM rate to DOE of $.064/kwh.  This is not as good as the 7 cent 
number Tino threw around earlier in the week, but its still not terrible.  If 
the bogey is a 10% reduction to the current rate, our number to beat is 
$.0576/kwh.  Tino promised us copies of DOE's actual energy bills to confirm 
these numbers.  That would be great and solves the due diligence problem you 
and I talked about yesterday, Kevin.    

Tino also passed along a rumor he heard from the Isleta's consultant that the 
Cobisa Belen project is dead.  Do we know anything about this???  
Interesting.  I'm waiting to hear back from Bill Votaw to line up a due 
diligence call to Tino's government contracts lawyers in DC to confirm 
whether the "sole source" strategy is legit.  Kevin, I'll let you know when 
this is scheduled in case you want to be on the call.  Thanks.  DF

Want to thank you so much for all your help in obtaining the satellite phone 
for our usage.  It was a very short notice and you were able to come through 
and with no hesitation on your parts.  It is so nice to have good people to 
work with and you were so helpful and professional during the whole 
situation.  I was a novice at this phone thing and you were helpful ever step 
of the way.

Again, thank you.

I saw in the press that N.M. has delayed electric open access until Jan 1, 02 
for residentials and small commercials and to July 1, 02 for large 
industrials.  That increases the likelihood that the Pueblo project will have 
to dump power in the wholesale market at 4 Corners for a while before retail 
markets start to open up.  One more thing to factor in.

I'm expecting to hook up with Bill Votaw of Enron Federal Solutions today to 
talk about Langley's "sole source" procurement strategy with DOE.  I hope to 
get Votaw on the phone with Langley's D.C. govt. contracts lawyers to discuss 
their theory.  We should be in a better position to raise a flag if the sole 
source strategy is really a high risk approach.  I'm not sure where that 
would leave us because the only other approach I can think of is to steer DOE 
into opening the power plant up for bids.  Langley does not appear interested 
in trying to win an open bid for the power plant, although frankly we would 
probably have about as good a chance as anyone of winning.

Once we clear up the government contracts issues (if ever) it seems to me 
that it would be time to expand the team to include Federal Solutions 
(potentially, if they see an angle to help them with their Kirtland 
outsourcing strategy) and ENA.  The ENA involvement would be particularly 
important so we could get a line of specific turbine availability and the 
specifications/economics that would result.  I'm probably engaging in wishful 
thinking again, but my hope is that the economics on a specific turbine/heat 
exchanger configuration work out a little better than the generic economics 
from the model that James ran.   If we think this thing is a potentially 
viable deal after I talk to Votaw and the Langley DC team, we need to grab 
Bill Cordes and discuss whether we go to ENA "from the bottom up," or through 
Stan "from the top down" to get hooked into a deal team over there.  Kevin, I 
still intend to hook you into the Votaw-DC call if you are available.  
Thanks. DF

I'll be in Houston so no need to dial me in!  DF

 Time:  2:30 PM-3:30 PM

 Location:   Omaha and Houston Video Conference Rooms

I just talked to Tino Monaldo, Dennis Langley's lawyer/project manager for 
the Pueblo project.  I explained Bill and Bill's credentials and concerns and 
Tino suggested that a sit down between Enron and their government contracts 
team might be helpful.  He offered to do it in Houston, probably late next 
week or the following week.  Attending would be Dennis, Tino, and their 
outside lawyers, Jim Slattery and Rick Harrington.  Harrington is the key--he 
is a retired military guy and one of the lead govt. contracts lawyers at my 
old firm in DC.  The would basically put on a dog and pony walking us all 
through their sole source strategy,  including their legal interpretations 
and the allies they have lined up within DOE/DOD.  Bill and Bill--does such a 
meeting sound productive?  If so, should we have outside govt. contracts 
counsel present and if so, who do you suggest?  

On a related note, Tino explained (without me asking or really caring) that 
he was in the middle of a "big drafting project"--revising Dennis' joint 
venture agreement with the Isleta.  I took the opportunity to express my 
concern at how far down the road Dennis is getting on the overall deal, 
including structure issues, without knowing whether Enron is even on board.  
I reminded Tino that GPG has not committed to participating in the pipeline 
or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ENA's agreement to commit 
turbines.   Apparently Dennis believes that if the economics pans out, Enron 
or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with 
money, turbines, etc.   If Enron does eventually decide to get into this 
deal, the agreements and promises that Dennis has already made may need to be 
revisited.   Thanks for your patience on this project.  DF

Per our discussion last week, this is the status on Pueblo.  I think we need 
to establish to our satisfaction the bona fides of Dennis' government 
contracting scheme before we pitch hard to have ENA get into the deal and 
scrub down the numbers on the power plant.  If our govcon gurus (Bill Votaw 
and Bill Gang--both ex military guys working on DOD outsourcing deals for 
Enron Federal Solutions) buy off on it, then I think we brief Stan at that 
point.  You, Stan and Steve will then need to decide the best way to pitch 
ENA to verify the economics and potentially get into the deal.  Either we'd 
have Stan push from the top down or have Kevin and  Steve go directly to the 
ENA deal guys.  More to follow.

I'm currently scheduled to meet with Kevin Madden and other members of OMTR, 
including hopefully Mike Coleman, Rob Cupina and Alice Fernandez, next Wed. 
May 31 to give them a heads-up on GPG's upcoming use of EOL.  I also hope to 
meet with several of the Commissioners' assistants.  The timing of the 
meeting is to ensure that we get to them prior to a press release.

The approach is decidely low key.   There is a feeling that if we make a big 
deal of this with FERC, then they will ask a lot of questions about why we 
aren't filing for permission.  Hopefully, if we explain that it doesn't 
change any of our current practices, that its just a new computer tool, they 
will chalk it up as another ecommerce story.  

I hope to talk about the GPG's use of EOL generally and not get deep into the 
mechanics of the specific TW auction.  The advantage of me doing the FERC 
briefing is that I can talk generally and claim that I'm not privy to the 
details of each of the pipelines possible EOL products.

Attached is a rough outline of my message points and a few Q&As that I have 
thought of thus far.  Please send me your feedback (by noon on Tues. May 30) 
and any other Q&As that you think I should be prepared for.

include.

I recall that we set up a warning flag approach with market services last 
year to make sure that Sempra never "goes physical" without us manning the 
battle stations and deciding what to do.  Do you guys know who the noms would 
come in to in Market Services if Sempra ever decided to try to take their gas 
out of Cunningham and move it off system?  Care to venture a guess as to what 
that person would do if a 100,000 nom by Sempra into an IT contract for a 
haul from the Cunningham storage point to Demarc hit their desk?  Sempra 
couldn't nom the gas into a transport contract without first giving 
Kent/Sue/Morgan a physical delivery nom under the SF agreement, correct?  At 
which point we would immediately nom the SBA, correct?  

These issues may be important to our closing this year's deal if TCEM can't 
come up with the corp. guarantee.  I.e., if we can retain absolute control of 
the noms, do we really have any "go physical" risk???  We need to think this 
through.  DF  

Thanks for the heads up--I'll talk to him tomorrow.  DF

They nominate the SF to market services also, in addition to any transport 
they have?  Dari, please follow up on this with market services and verify 
what the procedures are and let us all know.    Again, this may relate to a

addition to my first reply:

Also, Sempra does not nominate to Kent/Sue/Morgan.  They nominate to Market 
Services.  Sempra's scheduler would not even think to call any one of us.  We 
would only hope their deal maker, David Otte, would be in the loop on their 
side and notify one of us if they ever decided to go physical.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Please review the attached non-standard discount letter to Southwest Gas 
Corporation (SWG).  SWG shall enter into a 10 year agreement  for 14,000 
Dth/d of seasonal (November through March) capacity effective November 1, 
2000.  The transport rate of $.15/Dth/d shall increase annually by 
$.005/Dth/d.  The primary path shall be from Tranwestern's  East of Thoreau 
(EOT) Area  to the SWG Interconnect located in the East of California Area.  
Alternate receipt point rights shall be from Tranwestern's EOT Area and from 
the Bloomfield Compressor.   SWG ROFR rights shall be wiaved. In 
additionTranswestern shall propose  to retain revenues generated by capacity 
release at rates higher than the effective contract's discount rate.

(Please note that the FTS-1 Appendix A - not shown here with the discount 
letter-  specifically indicates 0 MMcf/d capacity for the April through 
October period.  Therefore, even though the $.1500/MMBtu rate in Paragraph 3 
of the discount letter does not indicate the rate is a "seasonal rate", the 
effective billing to SWG shall be seasonal.)

Please indicate your approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.   All Officer approvals 
shall be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Officer approval.

This is a problem your people should be aware of because I think our usual 
practice when we want to verify ownership structure is to call the corporate 
secretary's office.  If they are behind, I don't know who we should go to in 
the future.  Maybe we need to run everything by corp. tax from now on.  Ugh.  
DF  
Alicia Goodrow

The erroneous statements found in the Form 2 related to Transwestern today 
are traceable in part to the fact that the Corporate Secretary's Data Sheets 
are months behind in their accuracy.  This is not the first instance where 
serious and costly errors have been made by persons who were relying on the 
data sheets for accurate ownership information on Enron Corp. subsidiaries.

If you have any creative ideas on finding a remedy for the extremely long lag 
time between the submission of final documentation to the Corporate Secretary 
and the updating of the sheets, please let me know.  In the meantime, be 
aware that the information is not necessarily reliable.

Thanks

Alicia

Drew,

I just finished leaving you a voicemail message in response to your question 
about a contact in the state tax area.   I'm not sure the voicemail system 
saved my message, however, because it didn't respond in the same manner as 
the system here.
Just in case, I thought I would leave you this e:mail message as well.   

The person whose name I left you in the last message was Jerry Moore (713) 
853-1712.   Another person who might be helpful is Carol Brantz (713) 
853-7180.   I'm not sure which of these folks is more apppropriate for 
purposes of obtaining an answer to your question.   Good luck.

Regards,
AnnMarie

Is that point the receipt point Sempra would have to use to take the base gas 
volumes away from Cunningham?  Thanks.  DF

If someone tries to nominate POI 61243 they will receive a message saying 
"Invalid point".  The market service rep will then notify me because they 
cannot nominate on the point.  I will then notify Jan.  Jan and I will notify 
Sue, Morgan, Kent and yourself.  Let me know if we need to change anything.

Linda

   
	
	

Jan and  Linda, the issue is how does anyone know for last years base gas 
deal if it has "gone physical" (if Sempra nominates the SF agreement for 
delivery).  My answer subject to your verification is that the POI that they 
have to nominate to is flagged as not available, so when they nominate Market 
Services is aware of it and is to call Kent/Sue/Morgan.  Could you fill in 
any missing details.  Thanks, Dari

   
	
	

They nominate the SF to market services also, in addition to any transport 
they have?  Dari, please follow up on this with market services and verify 
what the procedures are and let us all know.    Again, this may relate to a 
counterproposal we make to TCEM if they barf on the corporate guarantee 
issue, so time is of the essence.  Thanks.  DF

   Sue M Neville                05/31/2000 11:14 AM

addition to my first reply:

Also, Sempra does not nominate to Kent/Sue/Morgan.  They nominate to Market 
Services.  Sempra's scheduler would not even think to call any one of us.  We 
would only hope their deal maker, David Otte, would be in the loop on their 
side and notify one of us if they ever decided to go physical.

Sue

Drew - Just wanted to follow up on our discussion on Monday about new

our team does not see a need to create or offer this service at this time.   
However, we did not get a chance to discuss the merits of going forward 
anyway to act on the receptivity of FERC to these services.   Please give me 
a call or let me know when we can stop by to discuss briefly.  I would like 
Tim to participate in the discussion as well.  He is out today meeting w/
GRE and will be back on Friday.

Thanks.  John 

PS - I could give you a quick update on Hubbard at that time also.

I am obviously not y2k complaint.   The agreement does read as Charlie 
indicated 

? 2.3  TW shall own, operate and maintain facilities. "...capable of 
delivering no less than 200,000 MMBtu of gas per day..." and PG&E facilities 
"...capable of receiving no less than 200,000 MMBtu per day...".

There are also pressure obligations - a minimum delivery pressure of 600 psig 
and a maximum of 700 psig.   

otherwise, there are no volume restrictions...

Michel Nelson

Charlie is doing some more digging, but hasn't found anything in the 
operating agreement to limit us to 250/d yet (other than the July or August 
99 letter related to '250/d limits until all PCB issues are resolved'..
	
	

Mike,

At your request I reviewed the June 27, 1995 Operating Agreement between PG&E 
and TW looking for any volume commitments and found only the following 
reference:

? 2.3  TW shall own, operate and maintain facilities. "...capable of 
delivering no less than 200,000 MMBtu of gas per day..." and PG&E facilities 
"...capable of receiving no less than 200,000 MMBtu per day...".

The Operating Agreement references an Interconnect Agreement between TW and 
PG&E dated 3/16/92.  It does not appear that the Operating Agreement canceled 
or superseded the Interconnect Agreement.  I am trying to find a copy of that 
Interconnect Agreement to see if any quantity language is in it.

Vig, do we have a certificate limit regarding the quantity we can deliver to 
PG&E at Topock?

Charlie

REVISED CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Attached is a revised non-standard discount letter for Southwest Gas 
Corporation (SWG).  SWG shall enter into a 10 year agreement for 14,000 Dth/d 
of seasonal (November through March  period) capacity from Transwestern's  
East of Thoreau (EOT) Area to the Southwest Interconnect located in the East 
of California Area.  The $.10/Dth/d transportation rate shall increase 
annually by $.005/Dth/d for the term of the agreement.  Alternate receipt 
point rights shall be from Transwestern's EOT Area and from the Bloomfield 
Compressor.  SWG ROFR rights shall be waived.

Paragragh 6 has been revised.  Transwestern is proposing the ability to 
retain any capacity release revenues which SWG may realize for capacity 
released at rates above the applicable discounted transportation rated 
provided by Transwestern to SWG.  This paragraph now stipulates that in the 
event that the FERC does not grant Transwestern the ability to retain these 
defined revenues, then this provision, provided in Paragragh 6, shall be 
deleted and the remaining contractual agreement and applicable discount 
provisions agreed upon between Shipper and Transwestern shall be kept in 
place.

Please indicate your approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  All Officer approvals 
shall be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Officer approval.

I'd drop the dash in "rate-bid" but otherwise am OK.  Thanks. DF

Maria Pavlou
06/06/2000 02:51 AM
We have modified the last sentence of the rate paragraph on p. 3 and have 
added another sentence as follows:  The one-part rate bid shall be inclusive 
of all applicable reservation, commodity, and surcharges, and exclusive of 
applicable fuel.  The shipper with the accepted bid will be billed the 
product of the rate-bid and the total contract quantity for the term of the 
agreement."  

Pls. provide any comments to me ASAP.  Thanks, Maria

New language:  The one-part rate bid shall be inclusive of all applicable 
reservation charges, commodity charges, and the ACA surcharge, and exclusive 
of fuel.  There are no other surcharges.  The shipper with the accepted bid 
will be billed the product of the rate-bid and the total contract quantity 
for the term of the agreement.

Two answers:  1.  Just yourselves.  Sandra has laid in an excessive quantity 
of vittles and libations.  2.  Good idea.  Tryiing to launch an effort like 
that now would be a nightmare, but after Conoco, we'll have a lot of 
organizational work anyway.  Thanks.  df

Kathy Ringblom
06/12/2000 08:54 AM
#1 - Is there anything we can bring Saturday night?

#2 - Regarding the "record retention" problem, I was thinking that when this 
Conoco case is over, that might be a good time to go through all of the boxes 
we have pulled (probably close to 150) and weed out all of the stuff we don't 
need anymore  - which in the case of many of the boxes, may be the entire 
contents - instead of sending them all back to storage.  Maybe we could 
distribute copies of each department's record retention policy, figure out a 
way for the "owner" of the boxes' contents to come into the box room, review 
them and make a decision at that time.  

I don't think I gave you George Briden's number in my voice mail today.  Its 
401-934-1433.  Just out of curiosity, please let me know if they are as eager 
to move forward as George said they were.  Thanks. DF 

If that's all we need commercially, I'm fine with it.  I'd be more 
enthusiastic if we thought that their removal of the protest would clear up 
all FERC's issues and result in cancellation of the tech. conf. and prompt 
approval of the filing, but I suspect that is too much to ask for.  DF 

   
	
	

Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably 
(i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would 
amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can 
acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent TW from 
becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never 
been our intention).  Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether 
this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same 
concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our 
proposal too.  Comments?  let me know.  

Carmen, please print out memo and attachment.  Thanbks. DF

06/15/2000 06:53 PM
Bill,

Yesterday, we decided to look at two options for Pueblo; a 60 MW case and a 
140 MW case.  In order to match these outputs as closely as possible with 
available equipment, I made the following selections:

Case 1
Equipment     3 X GE LM 2500 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 22 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   67 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  73.4 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  8170 Btu/kWh (HHV)

  
Case 2
Equipment     3 X GE LM 6000 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 44 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   130 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  143.7 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  7900 Btu/kWh (HHV)

There is a wide fluctuation in ambient temperature in Albuquerque and I sized 
the blocks based on 95 deg F but used the annual average output at 60 deg F 
for estimating power sales.  I have attached files that show the build-up of 
the estimated EPC price for the plants. 

The required power prices are projected in a simple-minded economics file 
attached.  The projections are based on:

70% debt financing at 10% rate.
10-year project and debt life.
8500 hours per year at average output (97% capacity factor).
Gas at $4.40/MMBtu.

The results turn out pretty much as anticipated.  Even with the larger plant, 
we'd have to sell the power for over 6c/kWh.

Give me a yell when you are ready to call Golub back--he's an old Baker and 
Botts colleague of mine and I'd like to be on the call just to say hi.  
Thanks. DF

   
	
	

Spoke with PNM's counsel (Jay Golub) this morning.  He recognizes that PNM 
needs to get the relevant info to FERC in some form or fashion and would like 
us to tell him who at FERC is assigned to this proceeding so that he can talk 
with them, find out what exactly they need, etc.  He said they would probably 
be willing to send FERC something in writing if it might eliminate the need 
for a technical conference.  Donna--as I've indicated in my voice mail to 
you, just let me know who Jay needs to contact, and I'll call him back.  
Thanks.

   
	
	

Drew, Susan, Frank K/Steve S.   can we have Donna check next Monday after 
Dynegy has withdrawn, whether we still need the Tech Conf?

 - rp00-249.now.set.doc

Thanks for the extremely helpful analysis Steve and John.  I'm getting a 
pretty clear sense that this project isn't going anywhere as it is currently 
configured.  Just to satisfy myself, though, let me throw out a couple of 
observations for the group to react to, along the lines of Steve's "However" 
section of his memo:

1.  Running this thing as a baseload unit won't work.  The fuel cost is a 
killer.  However, I keep thinking about the $200/mwh 4 Corners spot price 
someone mentioned on the phone.   Is there enough volatility at 4 Corners to 
support a peaking merchant plant?  How often are those types of opportunities 
available, and could a power plant in Alb. capture that upside by 
transporting power to 4 Corners over PNMs system?  
  
2.  We have been assuming that the power plant should be a baseload plant.  
Someone on the phone last week had some numbers indicating that the DOE/DOD 
electric load at Kirtland had a fairly high load factor.  I think we have all 
assumed further that the plant should run at a high load factor to sell 
surplus power into the grid (either at 4 Corners or, after N.M. elec. 
restructuring, into the Alb. area).   I just found the numbers I was 
remembering on the conf. call--1998 peak load was 63.6 mw, and total annual 
1998 consumption was 334.5 million Kwh.  By my lawyer-math, that is about a 
60% load factor for DOE.  If the DOE load is only 60% L.F., and the plant 
only generates surplus power when it can capture profit opportunities that 
arise when the market clearing price at 4 Corners or in Albuquerque exceeds 
some benchmark rate ($.05/Kwh?  $.10/Kwh?  higher?)  the plant might run at a 
30-40% load factor on an annual basis.  The question is can we reduce the 
capital cost significantly by building a peaker instead of a baseload unit?

3.  Could we get debt financing for a 140 mw plant that had a baseload demand 
charge contract for only 65 mw (i.e., DOE) but sold the rest of its output 
into the grid only when profit opportunities arose?      

4.  If the answer to 3. is no, would ENA backstop the debt financing by 
signing a demand charge contract for all surplus power over and above what 
the government needs?   At what price?  Based on its knowledge of volatility 
and profit opportunities currently available at 4 Corners, and future profit 
opportunities that will be available in Albuq. is that just a dumb bet, or 
would ENA get interested if someone else (i.e., DOE) split the risk and 
reward?  

John, how much of the information in your analysis could be sanitized in a 
way that we could provide it to Dennis Langley?  If we pull the plug on the 
project, I'd like to be in a position that we could let him in on some of our 
information on why the turbines we would use can't provide acceptable 
economics.  I don't expect that we'd want to disclose the swap value analysis 
in Steve's memo, however.  

Thanks again, and I'd appreciate anyone's reaction to the above questions.  
DF  

Stephen Thome@ECT
06/16/2000 06:12 PM
John's proposed plant costs are consistent with what we have seen for our 
ongoing LM6000 development.   I have priced 130 MW at Four Corners  assuming 
Permian gas plus 50 cents for transport.  This also assumes $4.70 per MWh for 
O&M and an 8000 heat rate.

For an hourly 7x24 product, the intrinsic value of the gas-power swap is 
$52.5 million on a 20 year deal, well below the $108 million estimate of 
constructing the facility.  A ten year swap is worth only $42 million (NPV = 
-66 m ).  That implies a market mid-price of $34 per MWh levelized over the 
period.  

Using the ENA Power and Gas structuring model and curves, we can determine 
the following:
1.  New build gas turbines cannot compete against the New Mexico market on 
price.  
2.  LM6000 CCGT efficiency gain does not pay for HRSG and ST over a ten year 
period.

However:
1.  Transmission constraints could create market value in Albuquerque that 
does not exist at Four Corners.
2.  ENA's power prices typically undersell the market.
3.  Commodity pricing does not accurately value capacity or reliability in 
constrained markets.

If Enron wants to do a deal in Albuquerque, we should be selling capacity and 
reliability.  Given the number of power- critical industries in the area, we 
could look at siting several remote units at different locations in the 
city.  Numerous chip manufacturing facilities and the Kirtland base could 
support several LM6000's for power reliability that is specific to their 
installations.  

I might also suggest that peaking units would have advantages over CCGT 
units.  Existing generation already provides ample baseload supply, however, 
the production of peak and intermediate energy is not necessarily well suited 
to existing units.  LM6000's have exceptionally good ramp rates that provide 
real value to a utility customer.  Not only can the HRSG/ST hinder the 
flexibility of the units, it can add substantial capital and operating 
expense with little real market benefit.  

We should also explore the ability to schedule load.  If the DOE wants to 
peak for a test, would it be willing or able to schedule a test for the 
off-peak hours?  Under those circumstances, we might be able to cut them a 
break on power and provide reliability of supply.

There is a wide fluctuation in ambient temperature in Albuquerque and I sized 
the blocks based on 95 deg F but used the annual average output at 60 deg F 
for estimating power sales.  I have attached files that show the build-up of 
the estimated EPC price for the plants. 

The required power prices are projected in a simple-minded economics file 
attached.  The projections are based on:

70% debt financing at 10% rate.
10-year project and debt life.
8500 hours per year at average output (97% capacity factor).
Gas at $4.40/MMBtu.

The results turn out pretty much as anticipated.  Even with the larger plant, 
we'd have to sell the power for over 6c/kWh.

Ha!  I appreciate the complement but I like my current job just fine--all I 
have to do is crap on a contract now and then and argue with Mary Kay all day 
long.  Piece of cake!  DF

Excellent questions! Are you sure you don't want a job in the Commercial 
Group? You talent as a deal maker is definitely underutilized.

   
	
	

Thanks for the extremely helpful analysis Steve and John.  I'm getting a 
pretty clear sense that this project isn't going anywhere as it is currently 
configured.  Just to satisfy myself, though, let me throw out a couple of 
observations for the group to react to, along the lines of Steve's "However" 
section of his memo:

1.  Running this thing as a baseload unit won't work.  The fuel cost is a 
killer.  However, I keep thinking about the $200/mwh 4 Corners spot price 
someone mentioned on the phone.   Is there enough volatility at 4 Corners to 
support a peaking merchant plant?  How often are those types of opportunities 
available, and could a power plant in Alb. capture that upside by 
transporting power to 4 Corners over PNMs system?  
  
2.  We have been assuming that the power plant should be a baseload plant.  
Someone on the phone last week had some numbers indicating that the DOE/DOD 
electric load at Kirtland had a fairly high load factor.  I think we have all 
assumed further that the plant should run at a high load factor to sell 
surplus power into the grid (either at 4 Corners or, after N.M. elec. 
restructuring, into the Alb. area).   I just found the numbers I was 
remembering on the conf. call--1998 peak load was 63.6 mw, and total annual 
1998 consumption was 334.5 million Kwh.  By my lawyer-math, that is about a 
60% load factor for DOE.  If the DOE load is only 60% L.F., and the plant 
only generates surplus power when it can capture profit opportunities that 
arise when the market clearing price at 4 Corners or in Albuquerque exceeds 
some benchmark rate ($.05/Kwh?  $.10/Kwh?  higher?)  the plant might run at a 
30-40% load factor on an annual basis.  The question is can we reduce the 
capital cost significantly by building a peaker instead of a baseload unit?

3.  Could we get debt financing for a 140 mw plant that had a baseload demand 
charge contract for only 65 mw (i.e., DOE) but sold the rest of its output 
into the grid only when profit opportunities arose?      

4.  If the answer to 3. is no, would ENA backstop the debt financing by 
signing a demand charge contract for all surplus power over and above what 
the government needs?   At what price?  Based on its knowledge of volatility 
and profit opportunities currently available at 4 Corners, and future profit 
opportunities that will be available in Albuq. is that just a dumb bet, or 
would ENA get interested if someone else (i.e., DOE) split the risk and 
reward?  

John, how much of the information in your analysis could be sanitized in a 
way that we could provide it to Dennis Langley?  If we pull the plug on the 
project, I'd like to be in a position that we could let him in on some of our 
information on why the turbines we would use can't provide acceptable 
economics.  I don't expect that we'd want to disclose the swap value analysis 
in Steve's memo, however.  

Thanks again, and I'd appreciate anyone's reaction to the above questions.

John's proposed plant costs are consistent with what we have seen for our 
ongoing LM6000 development.   I have priced 130 MW at Four Corners  assuming 
Permian gas plus 50 cents for transport.  This also assumes $4.70 per MWh for 
O&M and an 8000 heat rate.

For an hourly 7x24 product, the intrinsic value of the gas-power swap is 
$52.5 million on a 20 year deal, well below the $108 million estimate of 
constructing the facility.  A ten year swap is worth only $42 million (NPV = 
-66 m ).  That implies a market mid-price of $34 per MWh levelized over the 
period.  

Using the ENA Power and Gas structuring model and curves, we can determine 
the following:
1.  New build gas turbines cannot compete against the New Mexico market on 
price.  
2.  LM6000 CCGT efficiency gain does not pay for HRSG and ST over a ten year 
period.

However:
1.  Transmission constraints could create market value in Albuquerque that 
does not exist at Four Corners.
2.  ENA's power prices typically undersell the market.
3.  Commodity pricing does not accurately value capacity or reliability in 
constrained markets.

If Enron wants to do a deal in Albuquerque, we should be selling capacity and 
reliability.  Given the number of power- critical industries in the area, we 
could look at siting several remote units at different locations in the 
city.  Numerous chip manufacturing facilities and the Kirtland base could 
support several LM6000's for power reliability that is specific to their 
installations.  

I might also suggest that peaking units would have advantages over CCGT 
units.  Existing generation already provides ample baseload supply, however, 
the production of peak and intermediate energy is not necessarily well suited 
to existing units.  LM6000's have exceptionally good ramp rates that provide 
real value to a utility customer.  Not only can the HRSG/ST hinder the 
flexibility of the units, it can add substantial capital and operating 
expense with little real market benefit.  

We should also explore the ability to schedule load.  If the DOE wants to 
peak for a test, would it be willing or able to schedule a test for the 
off-peak hours?  Under those circumstances, we might be able to cut them a 
break on power and provide reliability of supply.

Bill,

Yesterday, we decided to look at two options for Pueblo; a 60 MW case and a 
140 MW case.  In order to match these outputs as closely as possible with 
available equipment, I made the following selections:

Case 1
Equipment     3 X GE LM 2500 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 22 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   67 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  73.4 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  8170 Btu/kWh (HHV)

  
Case 2
Equipment     3 X GE LM 6000 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
X 44 MW Steam Turbine Generator
Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   130 MW
Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  143.7 MW
Heat Rate at avg. conditions  7900 Btu/kWh (HHV)

There is a wide fluctuation in ambient temperature in Albuquerque and I sized 
the blocks based on 95 deg F but used the annual average output at 60 deg F 
for estimating power sales.  I have attached files that show the build-up of 
the estimated EPC price for the plants. 

The required power prices are projected in a simple-minded economics file

Gas at $4.40/MMBtu.

The results turn out pretty much as anticipated.  Even with the larger plant, 
we'd have to sell the power for over 6c/kWh.

It's against my nature, but I'm getting pretty close to giving up.  Attached 
is a draft letter to Langley punting the project.  I've tried to sugar coat 
it as much as possible so he doesn't get pissed off and automatically go to 
El Paso if he does somehow get the project built.  The letter is based on the 
assumption that we will call them first to explain where we are.   Also, I've 
assumed that we won't send Dennis any of the data from EE&CC or ENA.  I think 
we can chat generally on the phone and give them the ballpark results without 
actually sending the schedules to him.  Please give me a call so we can help 
Steve with his script for when he calls Langley.  (did you notice how I 
disappear when things start to go south?)  Talk to you soon.  DF

pls print up on letterhead and format correctly for me to send out.  thanks.

Great--Steve, what's your phone no. ?  The operator didn't have it and I'd 
like to talk for a few minutes on this.  Thanks. DF

Here are some peaker data points:

Two LM6000's in simple cycle configuration can be installed for between $43 m 
and $50 m, providing a total of 80 MW.  Looking at a 10 year deal, there is 
no way to recoup this value and ENA would not be willing to take the back 10 
years on its books without an offtaker.  If EES or DOE were willing to step 
up for 20 years, there might be an opportunity.   Assuming a 9700 heat rate, 
$3 per MWh O&M, and NYMEX plus $0.39 for gas, the spread option for a peaker 
at 4 Corners would be worth between $33 m and $47 m.  The first number 
represents the intrinsic value, and the second is inclusive of an option 
premium.  ENA's desk (EPMI) would pay somewhere in between.  Having just 
inquired with the desk regarding their appetite for taking positions (short 
65 MW, long 80 MW) in Albuquerque, they were luke warm.  Considering 
transmission constraints into Albuquerque, their bid offer spread might run 
the range of the extrinsic value on the 65 MW load.  

Depending on site conditions (available infrastructure), a barebones LM6000 
plant could make economic sense.  The plant host would likely need to pay 
some sort of premium for generation reliability.  EES could sell fixed priced 
energy with a reliability premium to the DOE.  ENA would back-to-back the EES 
contract, managing market price risk and economically optimizing the 
peaker.   

As a stand-alone market play, a peaker is marginal at best.  By receiving 
value for reliability, the project might have merit.  Based on the thin 
margins, I am skeptical that we would want to build a plant larger than the 
host's load... that is more MW than that amount on which we could expect to 
receive some sort of demand charge.  Ultimately, the demand charge needs to 
make up the shortfall between EPMI's swap value and the cost of the plant.

Richardson says FBI has determined drives did not leave Los Alamos
June 21, 2000 
Web posted at: 3:00 PM EDT (1900 GMT) 

By Ian Christopher McCaleb/CNN

WASHINGTON -- Two highly sensitive computer hard drives that were missing 
from the Los Alamos National Laboratories earlier this year never left the 
premises, and the FBI has uncovered no hints of espionage in the case, Energy 
Secretary Bill Richardson told a Senate committee Wednesday. 

  
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson    
 
The two hard drives, each smaller than a deck of playing cards, held vital 
nuclear weapons secrets and were stored in a secured vault at the storied New 
Mexico nuclear weapons laboratory. 

In a statement opening a lengthy and touchy hearing of Senate Armed Services 
Committee, Richardson said: "Based upon the investigation by the FBI so far, 
there is no evidence of espionage, nor is there evidence the drives have ever 
left Los Alamos." 

Richardson added that the FBI seems to be on the verge of reconstructing what 
happened to the drives, saying, "Latent fingerprints were found on the scene, 
and on the external wrappings of the drives themselves." 

The FBI continues to comb the "crime scene" -- a room housing a copy machine 
-- and a grand jury has been convened, Richardson said, punctuating his 
statement with a declaration that a handful of so-called Los Alamos 
"X-Division" employees have offered conflicting statements to investigators. 

The secretary speculated that the disappearance of the hard drives may have 
been an unintentional mistake by a lab employee, who feared coming forward 
when alarms were raised. 

"I will not take (disciplinary) action until I have all the facts before me," 
he said, vowing, "I will not rest until I know what happened -- when, where, 
why and by whom." 

The FBI has said the drives disappeared "at the tail-end of March of this 
year, March 28," Richardson said. Should the FBI's timeline prove correct, 
reports issued at the beginning of this week that the drives have been 
missing since January could be called into question. 

The two hard drives were discovered missing on May 7, when weapons scientists 
took an inventory of the drives stored within a vault at the laboratory's 
X-Division as a massive wildfire approached the facility. The section is 
perhaps the most sensitive area of the facility, and is where the most 
classified nuclear weapons research, design and development is undertaken. 

The scientists had been tasked with checking to assure that all of the 
division's drives were safely within the vault in the event that the lab 
would have to be evacuated. An evacuation was ordered the next day because of 
the fire threat, but no one reported the drives missing until May 31, 
sparking a massive search of the area -- and deep anger in Washington. 

The drives contain vital information on the makeup of U.S., Russian, Chinese 
and French nuclear weapons. They mysteriously reappeared last Friday in a 
room at the lab that already had been searched several times. 

Richardson taken to task early, and often
Richardson's pledge to bring accountability to bear on those responsible for 
the missing drives was met with cold stares from committee members of both 
parties. Members of the Senate have awaited the secretary's appearance for 
several days, after he last week declined an opportunity to offer Senate 
testimony, saying he wanted to wait until he had more information. 

  
Sen. Strom Thurmond    
 
The safety of weapons secrets has dogged Richardson for much of his tenure as 
Energy Secretary. During his watch, Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee was 
removed from his position amid charges of spying. He has been formally 
charged with mishandling classified information -- not espionage -- and 
awaits trial. 

Members of Congress have also raised red flags over the reported sale of 
computers once used at the Savannah River nuclear weapons facility in 
Augusta, Georgia. Those computers, two senators intimated Wednesday, may have 
once contained classified information that could have been reconstructed by 
their new owners. 

Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-South Carolina) suggested at Wednesday's hearings that 
some of the Savannah River computers may have been sold to the People's 
Republic of China. 

  
Sen. John Warner    
 
In his opening statement, Armed Services Chairman John Warner (R-Virginia) 
lined Richardson himself up for accountability, saying that although 
Richardson has worked to change the security culture at the Energy Department 
and the national laboratories, ultimately, responsibility for ongoing lapses 
rests with him. 

"Mr. Secretary," Warner said directly to Richardson, "On June 23rd of last 
year you told this committee, in this room: 'The secretary of Energy,' and I 
quote you, '...must be accountable and must be responsible" for such security 
failures. 

" ... We are holding you accountable," Warner said. "These incidents happened 
on your watch. Like the captain of a ship, you must bear full 
accountability." 

Appearing at the hearing, Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Alabama), chairman of the 
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, repeated his earlier calls for 
Richardson's resignation, saying, "I think it's time for you to go." 

Harsher still was the criticism leveled by Sen. Robert Byrd (D-West 
Virginia), a member of Richardson's own party, who said Richardson's pledges 
to get to the bottom of the case would not sway the opinion of the Senate, 
whose trust he had lost permanently. 

  
Sen. Richard Shelby    
 
"The horse is out of the barn," Byrd said. Referring to Richardson's refusal 
to testify last week, Byrd said, "You've waited and shown contempt of 
Congress that borders on supreme arrogance." 

Speaking directly to Richardson, a one-time congressman and former Ambassador 
to the United Nations, Byrd said, "You had a bright and brilliant career, but 
you will never again receive the support of the U.S. Senate for any office 
you seek. You have squandered your treasure." 

Richardson, who at times looked stunned by the tone taken by many committee 
members, sought to defend himself -- arguing that he wanted to have "all the 
facts" in hand before making a congressional appearance. He added that he had 
made vast changes in the security culture at the department and in the 
nation's weapons laboratories, and had put off a good many longtime employees 
as a consequence. 

"I've been excoriated, but if you go into the scientific and academic 
community, I am driving scientists away." He also said he has been accused of 
racism in the Wen Ho Lee case, and has had to battle members of own party who 
saw regular polygraph tests for employees as a violation of civil rights. 

Sen. James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) suggested that the "captain of the ship" 
wasn't Richardson, but President Bill Clinton, who Inhofe said was 
responsible for a variety of security policy changes and leaks to the media 
that have led to a relaxed, careless attitude among those charged with 
overseeing the nation's weapons secrets. 

'Serious loss of control over classified information'
Also appearing before the panel was Dr. John Browne, director of the Los 
Alamos facility. 

  
Dr. John Browne    
 
Browne, while attempting to illustrate for panel members -- with charts -- 
just how difficult it is to gain access to the X-Division, admitted that his 
security operatives have lost control over how classified information is 
handled -- mainly because there is no set procedure to determine who handled 
much of the material and when. 

"This is not an environment one can easily get into," he said. 

Still, Browne said, "there is a serious loss of control over classified 
information at my laboratory," adding, perhaps for the benefit of committee 
members, that he had "no knowledge that the information has been compromised 
or tampered with. 

"From a national security perspective, these are positive indications." 

Richardson was congratulated by Sen. Pete Domenici (R-New Mexico) for ceding 
all weapons security issues to a newly confirmed director of a 
semi-autonomous agency formed to assess and reformulate all security 
procedures. 

  
Sen. Pete Domenici    
 
Air Force Gen. John Gordon, confirmed by the Senate to helm the agency but 
not as yet sworn into the post, will report to Richardson, but will not be 
directed by anyone else at the Energy Department. 

The Senate had held up Gordon's confirmation for months for unspecified 
reasons, but he was unanimously confirmed last week after news of the hard 
drives' disappearance was released. 

"The best thing you could do to leave a legacy for America in terms of 
nuclear weapons is to [get this agency operational]," Domenici said, scolding 
Richardson not to engage in any "dual-hatting," and let Gordon make the 
changes he needs to make. 

Warner was less congratulatory, warning Richardson outright that he must 
honor the 1999 law creating the agency and allow it to go about its business 
unfettered. 

The panel closed its session to the public and members of the media just 
after noon on Wednesday so specifics of the case could be discussed. Domenici 
predicted earlier in the day that a closed session would yield much more in 
the way of disturbing information. 

"We could go into a closed session, and you wouldn't believe the things you'd 
hear in there," he said. "These things have to be corrected too." 

When proceedings ended at mid-afternoon, Richardson told reporters he just 
wanted "to do his job" and conclude the investigation. He said the fallout 
from the security breach was "too political," adding, "I did not utter one 
partisan word in that committee." 

'Conflicting statements'
Initially, Air Force Gen. Eugene Habiger, the Energy Department's top 
security officer, and Los Alamos Lab Director John Browne said in 
congressional testimony that a scientist had reported seeing the two devices 
in the vault on April 7, a month before they were found missing and seven 
weeks before senior lab officials were notified. 

  
Gen. Eugene Habiger    
 
But sources familiar with the investigation told CNN on Tuesday that this 
account has come under suspicion because of "conflicting statements" made 
during interviews and polygraph tests. 

Another individual has told investigators he went into the vault on April 27 
and would have noticed if they had been missing then, but does not recall 
actually seeing them. 

What's clear, said Goss, is that there was inadequate tracking on paper of 
the use of the two drives, which belonged to an emergency nuclear response 
team. Members of the team, known as NEST, have been the focus of the FBI 
criminal investigation. The team is trained to be ready to find and disarm a 
nuclear device on short notice. 

The disks, or drives, are designed for use in a laptop computer and are part 
of an emergency response "kit" available to team members . 

All 26 individuals who had unescorted access to the vault have been given 
polygraph tests, according to Richardson. 

Browne, the lab's director, has testified that security rules for the 
tracking of items classified as secret were eased government-wide in 1992 to 
reduce the cost of handling the large amount of documents carrying this 
designation. 

In early 1993 it was extended by then-President Bush to government 
contractors such as the University of California, which runs the Los Alamos 
lab. The policy was continued by the Clinton administration. 

The President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board a year ago cited 
inadequate tracking of secret nuclear materials in a stinging rebuke of 
security at the Energy Department and its weapons labs. 

While the current Los Alamos security break likely did not involve espionage, 
"in some ways it's worse," former Sen. Warren Rudman, chairman of the 
advisory board, said in an interview. "Espionage is very hard to guard 
against. You win some and lose some. Here you've got a situation where there 
is just sloppy accountability and record keeping."

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.

I got this from outside the company.  Thought you might be interested.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement
said to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.  In the deal, Enron will
provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades' facilities throughout
and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former CEO of energy
monopolist
Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy management division.  Said
Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant heating demands.  While eternal
flames are a great idea in concept, they require vast and reliable fuel
resources.  Enron was the only supplier willing to make a deal with my
boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just
like the way they do business."  A spokesperson for Enron said the two
cultures were able to work easily together during negotiations.  According
to the company, "The deal fits both companies exceptionally well.  With
Hades' ability to attract and retain new customers, we see this as a
fabulous
growth opportunity for millennia to come."  According to several energy
industry insiders, Hades' high heating demand with very little need for
summer air conditioning make it a very attractive energy portfolio addition.
Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide
and approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained
high growth rates over the last two thousand years.  Enron is one of the
world's leading energy and communications companies.  The company owns
approximately $37 billion in energy and communications assets.  Enron
ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best 100 Companies to Work For
if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A Week," and
is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by customers
with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply contracts.

I reviewed the latest draft of AA's management rep. letter and caught a few  
innaccuracies in the way AA described the deal.  I attach a revised draft of 
the letter, with a redline version to highlight for you the changes I think 
we need to make to keep it accurate.  First, AA only listed two of the four 
agreements that comprise the deal.  They apparently forgot that we had 
created a second SBA.  Additionally, at Transcanada's request, we put the 
transaction fee into a separate letter agreement this year.  You will recall 
that last year, Sempra wanted the transaction fee put right in the SBA.  

Second, AA's bullet no. 4, as originally drafted, states that Northern does 
not intend to enter into an option to purchase any base gas during the term 
of the agreement.  That statement is confusing given that Article VI.B of the 
Monthly Pack Agreement includes an account balance cash out mechanism that is 
a form of purchase option.  That cash out mechanism was in Kent's bullets 
describing the deal and has been in every draft of the documents that AA 
looked at, so I assume they are OK with the mechanism and were just inartful 
in drafting bullet no. 4.   My simple fix was to leave AA's language alone 
but to add an "except for" reference at the beginning of bullet no. 4.    

Third, AA's draft of bullet nos. 5 and 6 includes the somewhat ambiguous 
references to "other agreements" and "additional agreements" respectively.   
Since AA's list of the agreements in the intro paragraph was incomplete, 
these references in bullet nos. 5 and 6 were also innacurate.  Now that I 
have made the list of agreements in the intro paragraph complete, I've 
clarified the bullets by adding the "other than those agreements referenced 
above" language to both bullets.  The couple of other changes in bullet 5 
simply clarify the meaning.  

Finally, I've modified the signature blocks per conversation with Bill to 
delete MKM and myself.  I am certainly willing and able to sign this letter, 
but MKM is not up to speed on the deal and has not reviewed the agreements.  
Getting her up to speed enough to sign the letter would take some time.  
Additionally, Bill's thought was that MKM and I are his direct reports 
anyway, so it doesn't serve much purpose to have the subordinates sign if the 
top guy has signed.   

Please give me a call if you have any questions or want to discuss these 
matters.

Per our discussion, I've modified the letter to remove reference to the 
monthly pack agreement and made a couple of other minor changes.  I wasn't 
able to get ahold of Bill on Friday afternoon to discuss who will sign, so 
for now I've left it with signature blocks for Bill and Rod only.  I hope we 
are getting closer to the target here and look forward to discussing it with 
you further on Monday.  Thanks again for the illumination on AA's intent on

Steve filled in the detail for me on the LG&E issue mentioned in the Law 
bullets this morning.  A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and 
Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent).  LG&E's 
gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into 
Northern was approx. 180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000.   Rockey 
and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good 
arguments for avoiding the liability.  The unexpected (and unmetered) 
deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance 
during the referenced 3 month period.  Accordingly, I assume the cost of 
replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should 
not affect earnings.   I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this 
matter.  DF  

A bit more detail in the bullets and a heads up call on this would have been 
a good idea.  DF

I need you guys to jump back into your files on the Topock issue asap.  Tony, 
I assume Lou briefed you on the situation.  I think the most recent liquids 
sample had pcbs in excess of 50 ppm.  That is well in excess of the 
contractual limit that I recall to be 1 ppm.  Our research a few months ago 
was about options to force the interconnect back open above 250 mm/d if the 
samples came back clean.  Now, the issue is, given dirty samples, what can we 
do to keep PGE from slamming the interconnect shut.  We need to complete our 
research/thinking immediately and have a spectrum of options ready to 
discuss.  Seriously, I am reviewing with Lou the option of a preemptive shut 
down of the interconnect, but that looks like an unwise strategy so far.  ALL 
ideas are worth considering.  Frank, Steve, and Maria, anything in your 
memory banks on TW or FERC jurisprudence that would prevent a Hinshaw from 
refusing to schedule transport volumes through a point even if the Hinshaw 
seemed to have clear contractual rights to refuse to schedule volumes based 
on gas quality/contamination concerns?  I don't think TW's tariff has a 
specific PCB spec.   DF   

ok.  DF

13th.  Please get me a flight and hotel (I should arrive early PM on the 12 
the and leave in the pm on the 13th.   Thanks.df

The mock trial event will be held the evening of July 12th in Midland. Joy
and Nancy will call us back with the time and place so that we can make
appropriate arrangements. 

Excellent!  I hope Briden's project attracts fewer vultures than Dennis 
Langley's.  I need to go to Midland on the afternoon of the 12th, so could 
meet in Houston conveniently on the morning of the 12th or anytime 10 am or 
later on the 11th.  I could meet on the 10 th after 10, but less 
conveniently.  Just let Martha know what the plan is and she'll deploy me.  
Also,  when you say they want TW to "build, own and operate the plant" you 
mean the gas pipeline facilities, not the power plant, right?  Must be 
because $20 mil. would be a pretty cheap power plant.  Thats a pretty cheap 
pipeline also for the length--about 40 miles, right?  DF

The project's consultant, George Briden, of Snake Hill Energy, called me 
today to say that Caithness Corp. has decided to move forward with plans for 
the Big Sandy, LLC. Project.  To refresh your memory, the project is a 
proposed IPP to be located about 40 miles south of TW's pipeline along 
Highway 93, about 2 miles outside of Wickieup, Arizona.  I've attached a 
simple bitmap below (click on it and hit "view") indicating the location of 
the project relative to Transwestern's facilities.  Ultimately, the project 
would be built for approx. 1,000 MW of generation in two phases.  Phase 1 
will burn approx. 80,000 Dth/d, and phase 2 will burn an additional 120,000 
Dth/d.  Initial indications are for the project to be in service in early 
2002, with the lateral pipeline and gas service required as early as Q2, 2001.

Caithness Corp., based in New York, is a privately held company with diverse 
interests including geothermal (renewable) electric generation facilities 
(Coso Plant) in California.  George reported that Caithness would like for 
Transwestern to build, own and operate the plant with facility costs (current 
estimate, $20.3MM) to be amortized vis-a-vis a throughput/rate commitment.  
Caithness would also like the project to be interconnected to El Paso's 
system and the Questar Southern Trails Pipeline if that project should ever 
be completed.

Obviously, we'll have to wade throught the legal/regulatory issues 
surrounding this deal structure, as well as the requisite credit assurances.  
With respect to the former, I think if we view this pipeline 
ownership/operation structure more as a financing mechanism with associated 
operating agreements, then we're probably OK.  With respect to the later, 
George assured me that Caithness can/will set-up a funding mechanism that 
would give Transwestern sufficient assurance of payback.

George would like to bring down a couple of representatives from Caithness to 
meet with Transwestern sometime the week of July 10.  He suggested either 
Omaha or Houston for the meeting, inasmuch as he'd like Drew Fossum to be 
present.

Drew, I'm thinking it might be easier/better to have the meeting here in 
Houston given our immediate access to maps and engineering data regarding the 
lateral pipeline.  If you concur, what day(s) do you have open that week and 
is there an opportunity for you to hop Bill's plane for either one or both 
legs of the trip down here?  I'll ask Ron Matthews and maybe one or two 
others to join us so we can cover a fairly broad base of functions in one 
sitting.

Will you get back with me as soon as you can?  Others on the distribution, if 
you can sit tight we'll get you more information as this meeting date/time 
comes together.  Thanks.

Here's the memo I mentioned.  Obviously, we have already used up all the good 
ideas and are down to the fall back plans.  DF
	
	

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL: ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Here's an idea:  PG&E's world has changed a bit since they executed the '97 
interconnect agreement.  Back then, I think the majority of Line 300 capacity 
was held by PG&E for the benefit of the core customers.  Some of the capacity 
was held by contract transport customers, but not that much.  (maybe 
100,000-200,000 dth out of 1.14 bcf/d??)   Now, I understand that PG&E still 
retains some line 300 capacity for the core, but a lot more of it is 
allocated out to contract transport customers.  Do you guys know how much was 
in each of those buckets then and now?  My theory is as follows:

1.  As to the capacity that it retains in its own name for the benefit of its 
core customers, PG&E has absolute discretion as to how to use the capacity.  
They can nominate and schedule volumes at TW/Topock some days and nom. and 
schedule zero on others.  They can be totally arbitrary and not schedule 
anything for extended periods even though they are paying demand charges on 
TW and may incur costs on their gas purchase contracts in the San Juan or 
elsewhere (eventually this would get the CPUC's attention, I guess).  Even if 
there were no interconnect agreement or operating agreement with TW on the 
pcb issue, there is just not much we can do to control how PG&E dispatches 
gas supply.

2.  PG&E's transport contracts with third parties are a different story.  
Those parties, not PG&E,  decide how much to nom. every day.  If PG&E is 
going to refuse to schedule a valid nom. from a transport customer, PG&E has 
to declare force majeure on its system or declare a capacity 
constraint-related curtailment.  PG&E has some discretion as a prudent 
operatory of its system, but not nearly as much discretion as it does as to 
its own portfolio.  

3.  If 1 and 2 are correct, then the question arises:  Does PG&E have to 
declare force  majeure on its own system in order to shut us down at Topock?  
If the amount of capacity they have in bucket no. 1 above exceeds 300 
million/d, they may be able to shut us down and continue to honor all of 
their transport contracts.  But what if PG&E's transport customers continue 
to nominate TW/Topock even though PG&E is making alternative receipt point 
capacity available for them at El Paso Topock or somewhere else?  If TW 
stands by ready to confirm those customers' noms, then I think we can force 
PG&E to declare force majeure on its own system.  

4.  I'm not sure no. 3 above makes any difference for us.  At minimum, it 
focuses the attention on PG&E and not us.  Remember Erin Brockovich?  They 
will hate that.  I'm sure their spin doctors will point the finger at us, but 
once they declare force majeure, the PR damage is done.  Also, and more 
importantly, the standards applying to PG&E's declaration of force majeure 
are much more stringent than the standards under the operating agreement.   
We will probably have a much stronger position in litigation if the issue is 
"did PG&E have adequate basis for declaring force majeure" than if the issue 
is "did TW violate the 1 ppm standard under the operating agreement."  

Please let me know what we know about the capacity situation on Line 300 and 
give me any reactions to this idea.  Thanks. DF

Good point on the timetable.  If we can get to the letter of intent stage 
Caithness soon after this meeting Jeff is setting up--by mid July maybe--what 
would a realistic timetable be?  It looks from the map like the ROW would be 
all along existing hiway--not virgin territory.  If this thing is a "lateral" 
not mainline, and if we can keep project cost below the 2001 prior approval 
blanket cost limit (whatever that is--around $21 million I think) can we 
build under the blanket???  Lets talk before the meeting in Houston so we can 
have a complete reaction for the Caithness guys on cost, timetable, etc.  DF

Jeff, I realize you plan to bring the Certificates group in at a later date.  
But if they want gas service by the second quarter of 2001, we are most 
likely in trouble already.  Unless there has been ROW work and environmental 
surveys completed.  From the time we get approval to move ahead on the 
project, the certificate process will take approximately one year.

Please call, if you would like to discuss further.

operating agreements, then we're probably OK.  With respect to the later, 
George assured me that Caithness can/will set-up a funding mechanism that 
would give Transwestern sufficient assurance of payback.

George would like to bring down a couple of representatives from Caithness to 
meet with Transwestern sometime the week of July 10.  He suggested either 
Omaha or Houston for the meeting, inasmuch as he'd like Drew Fossum to be 
present.

Drew, I'm thinking it might be easier/better to have the meeting here in 
Houston given our immediate access to maps and engineering data regarding the 
lateral pipeline.  If you concur, what day(s) do you have open that week and 
is there an opportunity for you to hop Bill's plane for either one or both 
legs of the trip down here?  I'll ask Ron Matthews and maybe one or two 
others to join us so we can cover a fairly broad base of functions in one 
sitting.

Will you get back with me as soon as you can?  Others on the distribution, if 
you can sit tight we'll get you more information as this meeting date/time 
comes together.  Thanks.

Given the overwhelming response so far, I think a meeting may be necessary to 
get this project moving.  Thanks. DF 

   
	
	

So far I have not received comments from anyone on the attached.  
If you think it would be productive to get everyone together (possibly as 
early as Friday?) for about an hour to discuss capacity options, I will set 
up a meeting.   Please let me know one way or the other.
Thank you.
	
	

Attached is a preliminary draft of a filing for capacity options on 
Transwestern.  The attachments include a filing letter, proposed tariff 
language and a proposed form agreement.

Obviously there are still quite a few details to be worked out.  I am 
distributing a draft at this early stage in hopes of initiating a dialogue 
about the larger issues first.  A few that come to mind are whether we want 
to commit to selling options online, how best to explain or justify the 
option fee, and what specifically in the industry has changed such that FERC 
should depart from existing policy and allow TW to essentially reserve future 
capacity for shippers.  Please let me know your thoughts on these and any 
other issues.  

I would prefer to wait to discuss comments on wording, other conforming 
changes to the tariff, and other comments concerning form until after we have 
resolved the substantive issues.  Thanks.

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY 
WORK-PRODUCT

 As requested by Lou, attached for your review is a presuit litigation 
analysis memo.  Don't hesitate to call if you have further questions.

         B.K.D.

    

Britt- great memo.  I'm sure you guys are in the course of discussing these 
very issues, but here's my two cents worth. 
1.  Once we decide on an optimal forum, the key step before filing a lawsuit 
is the assessment of our probability of success--for different reasons than 
is usually the case.  We need to weigh the chances of a favorable judgment 
against El Paso against the probability and extent of collateral damage to 
our defense (not just TW but all of GPG) in Quinque, et al.  
2.  I like our case a lot based on what I've seen so far--if I've got it 
right, our claim is that El Paso breached the 1990 measurement agreement by 
not calibrating the meters as required and therefore by allowing the error to 
arise and remain uncorrected for so long.  Under the NM statute, we may get 6 
years worth of recovery ( or more, I guess, if they did something to toll the 
SOL).  Under the Texas SOL, maybe less.  Do we have a good argument that the 
1% standard in the measurement agreement and the 2% standard in El Paso's 
tariff do not absolve them of conversion or breach liability?  Seems to me 
that El Paso will argue that the FERC tariff preempts our contract 
rights--but I think the law is on our side there.  
3.  The tricky issue then becomes whether our prosecution of the claim 
against El Paso plays into the hands of our adversaries on the Quinque mess.  
If so, how do we quantify that risk to allow a rational balancing of the pros 
and cons.  I'm glad smart guys like you two will have to do that thinking.  
As usual, I'll try to stay on the sidelines and nod intelligently when you 
make a recommendation.  DF 

PS:  I'm ok with the outside counsel recommendation.  

Thanks Bob.  I'm out sick today (my wife made me stay home until I quit 
griping about a sore throat I can't seem to shake), but I forwarded your 
voicemail on item 3 to Kent yesterday.  I'll forward this to him as a 
reminder.  ON the other two items, I'll send you separate emails on each.  DF 

   
	
	

As you know we have been developing a list of possible earnings items to be 
moved out of 2nd quarter.  The list now totals $7.5MM and has been approved 
by Stan and Rod.  We're now in the "make it happen" stage.

We have 3 items that we'll need your assistance with:

Increasing the Conoco litigation reserve from $1.0mm that we now have on the 
books to a new balance of $3.0MM -- a $2MM increase.  To accomplish this we 
need a memo from you to request and support the increase.  The fact that we 
laid $3MM cash on the settlement table is good.  It you mention that it was 
$3MM plus Hobbs 12" line, then please qualify that with an indication that 
the market value of that line is de minimus.

Increasing the accrual for the Duke/Coyanosa obligation from $600,000 to 
$800,000.  I'm not sure what the basis for this increase is (continuing cost 
incurrence?), but your help in supporting the increase is solicited.

Need a copy of the SBA Transaction Fee agreement with TransCanada Energy 
Marketing so that we can accrue (and expense) the obligation in June 
(assuming it's not payable until July).  As we discussed earlier this week, 
we also need this document for AA's final review of base gas sale documents.

There is obviously a distinction between their situation and ours.  I just 
don't know what it is yet.  DF

   
	
	

Drew - notice the CNG filing of a non conforming service agreement because 
the agreement requires the shipper to utilize CNG for its full requirements.  
Northern has determined that such a clause falls under the discount provision 
of "to specified quantities".    Dari

We won our motion yesterday to depose Conoco on the Rensvold documents 
questions so it sounds like they will also depose Steve Gilbert about the 
Imperial plant.  We're deposing the Enerfin rep today - hopefully we'll get 
him to tie the terminated contracts to the wells that were under those 
contracts (Conoco is now saying, "Well, how were they supposed to know what 
wells were tied to what contracts" - duh) and possibly when Conoco took over 
the accounting for the plant - we still haven't been able to locate an 
invoice earlier than Jan. 1990.  Anyway, HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER SOON!!!!!  Try 
a frozen margarita for a sore throat.  Works every time.

These guys don't give up.  I'll forward any information Tino gives me on 
their latest DOE strategy.  Rockey--do you have any interest in following up 
on Tino's Wichita project??  I don't know how far it is from any of our 
lines, but it may be worth a chat.  DF

Sorry you are feedling bad. Hope reading email doesn't hurt. I'll try and be 
brief. 
1. We have an opportunity to acquire a? 35MW? cogeneration facility in Kansas 
that is from the early 1980's and rarely used. We may want to talk about a? 
joint project. Can I borrow some expertise via a phone call fom you to your 
electric gurus to let me know what the spot market into KC and Wichita looks 
like.

2. I met with DML and we intend to propose a deal that has us charging only 
for the generation and for DOE to assumme the risk and or reward of the cost 
of gas.Before you have any conversations with Dennis or your folks give me a 
call so we can flesh this out. We have DOE meetings scheduled for 7/24-25th 
so it is a busy month. Our consultant's are reviewing the DOE data we? 
received. I''l let you? know what we learn.They may have a bigger steam load 
than I would have guessed.

Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.  Bill 
Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members 
of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present.

 1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention 
that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit 
ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be 
posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale.

 2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be 
determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include 
an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year.

 3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a 
shipper exercises its call option.

 4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission 
policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy 
altogether.

 5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages 
for nonperformance.

 6.  Timeline:
  - Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week)
  - Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service 
  - Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a 
producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing)
  - Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require 
Board approval at Enron)
  - Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on)
  - Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet)

If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to 
get a new draft out by next Friday a.m.

Thanks Tony--we'll discuss on Wed or Thur.  DF

the meeting with a slide that is titled "Step One:  Shutting Your Sorry-Ass

Attached is a revised draft of TW's capacity option filing.  I thought the 
comments I received last week were very helpful, and pursuant to our 
discussion I've added language addressing rates, limitation of liability, and 
the necessary exception to Commission policy.  Some of the language will 
probably need to be expanded or changed.  I have also included a section in 
the tariff cross-referencing applicable General Terms and Conditions.  The 
letter and tariff sheets are redlined; I did not make significant changes to 
the agreement.

I have not come up with a projected filing date yet; I believe it is 
important first to plan our pre-filing communication with customers as well 
as informal discussions with FERC staff.  I will be contacting some of you to 
coordinate these efforts, and this should help us decide on a reasonable date.

Market Services:  Because this filing is still just a draft and may change 
based on what we hear from customers, I will just continue to keep you in the 
loop and will leave it up to you to decide when and with whom to meet in 
order to get the information you need.

Please let me know your substantive questions and comments on the attached 
before next Wednesday if possible.  

Thank you.

Here is the info from AA.  Talk to you at 4.  Thanks. DF
	
	

Interesting.  I'll work with MKM and Maria on getting answers to AA's 
questions and comments.  I think we can eliminate the specific cross 
references between the two agreements, but is that the real problem or is AA 
going to choke on our execution of both agreements with the same party?  
(that's a tough one to wire around, if it is their real concern).  Thanks.  DF

Attached is a revised redlined draft of the above-referenced  Agreement which 
incorporates comments from regulatory and Mike Bryant with V&E.  We have 
added a new Appendix 1 to cover the Assets subject to this Agreement rather 
than refer to the Exhibit in the Purchase and Sale, as well as an exclusivity 
provision regarding use of the Assets.  We've also added a reference to the 
arbitration section in the event the oversight committee cannot agree to 
changes necessary or desirable to the assets.   

I'm OK with the new version.  Thanks. DF

Recent negotiations with Southwest Gas Corporation have resulting in the 
deletion of two provisions  contained in the original Southwest Gas 
Corporation discount letter with was routed for Officer Approval.  Several  
minor "sentence structure" changes requested by Southwest Gas have also been 
included.  

Please review the revised Discount Letter and forward any comments 
immediately to either Lorraine Lindberg (x35403) or Susan Scott (x30596).  
The following summarizes the changes to the original discount letter:

1.  Deletion of paragraph which waives ROFR rights.    This paragraph is not 
necessary due to FERC Order 637 rule which states that the shipper's tariff 
right to ROFR for contracts of one year or longer does not apply to 
discounted transportation contracts, only max rate contracts.

2.  Deletion of Paragraph which states Transwestern will retain any capacity 
release revenues which Shipper may acquire from releasing capacity at rates 
above the Discount Rate provided by Transwestern to Shipper.

Please note that the revised discount letter does retain the original intent 
of providing Southwest Gas a 10 year discount rate for seasonal (November 
through March period) capacity from Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) Area 
to the Southwest Gas Interconnect located in the East of California Area.  
The $.10/Dth/d transportation rate shall increase annually by $.005/Dth/d for 
the term of the agreement.  Alternate receipt points rights are in the EOT 
Area as with as within the primary path of the contract.  Southwest Gas may 
also utilize the Bloomfield Compressor on an alternate basis.

Pls get me a printout of this Mon. AM.  I couldn't open it.  Thanks. DF

Here's a thought that didn't occur to me when I marked up the mock trial 
script.  Should we have the consultants prominantly feature "IPEC 
Busters"???  Unless we are pretty sure the judge will keep it out on 
relevance grounds, it might be useful to at least get some juror reactions to 
it.  With or without the specific IPEC Busters stuff, we probably ought to 
assume that Jad's theme will be that Northern's whole philosophy was to 
breach contracts without flinching if it served our commercial interests.  
The vitriol from P&P and the other producers plays into that theme.  Maybe we 
ought to spice that part of the script up a bit also just so we can see how 
our response plays.  DF

I got a call at 10:30 a.m. from George Briden indicating that his client's 
plans were changed over the weekend and they will not be available to come to 
Houston for tomorrow's meeting.  They will be in their Denver offices all 
next week and suggested that we might meet up with them there.  Drew has 
indicated his willingness to meet with them in Denver next week.     
Given this change in events, I'd suggest that we pack-up a small contingent 
to go to Denver and meet with them.  I'm thinking Terry or Ron, plus Steve 
Harris (if available) and myself.  I don't have any dates/times yet.  I'll 
call George and get his thoughts.  Will you EMail me back and let me know

See attached note.  I'm thinking that for a preliminary discussion with this 
[potential] customer, we should high grade the meeting as well as limit the 
number of meeting participants to no more than 5-6 from our side.  Bear in 
mind that Drew has a relationship with George Briden already and he will be 
here in Houston for this meeting.  In addition to Drew, I'd like to see 
representatives from TW Commercial, marketing services, and facility 
planning/engineering involved.  If you feel I've missed a function here that 
should be included, please advise.  Let me know your availability and/or the 
availability of your designee.  

Audrey, will you secure a conference room for us on that date/time:  1:30 - 
3:30 p.m, Tues. July 11th.   Plan on about 8 people.  Can we get a 
coffee/soft drink/snack set-up also?  Thanks.

George,
Thanks.  Let's plan on about 1:30 p.m. CDT on July 11th here in Houston at 
Transwestern's office in the Enron Building at 1400 Smith Street.  Just check 
in at the security desk, ask for me and they'll direct you to the elevators 
leading to our (41st) floor.  I don't think we'll need the whole afternoon, 
particularly at this stage, but I'll plan on at least a couple of hours.  

I'll ask a couple of reps from our engineering/operations group to join us 
and be prepared to answer questions about TW, its operation, as well as the 
estimate and underlying engineering of the lateral pipeline.  I'll forward 
this to Drew so that he can make his arrangements to join us also.

I look forward to meeting you and your client in person.  Call me if you have 
any questions.

Jeff;
We (Larry Carpenter and I) will be there afternoon of the 11th.  We have
left open the period from 1 to 5 PM.
Tell me where you want us to be.

Drew, as you may remember, before Tim Aren abandoned service, he had signed 
TW up as a sponsor the the New Mexico First Townhall on energy issues.  I 
attended as the Enron person.  The Townhall is now in its implementation 
phase and I want to bring you up to date on what is involved.  A number of 
issues were put in our report, and I will get you a final copy this week (I 
think one will be available shortly).  There is an implementation meeting in 
Alb. tomorrow.  From TW's standpoint, a few issues stand out.  First, 
producers and others joined in our frustation with the native American access 
issues (I did not raise them, but they came out loud and clear from the 
producers, which I thought was fine).  Accordingly, the Townhall has 
recommended that our Congressional delegation use their bully pulpit power to 
call a summit with the energy industry and the indian nations to discuss 
right of ways, access, taxes, development and other issues.  I would think 
that TW would want to be involved in this, if not  a leader in this.  Second, 
the townhall noted that pipeline infrastructure may need upgrading in the 
state.  There are other issues that affect TW not as directly, but that you 
should be aware of.

I will continue to be on the implementation team, and I can bring your issues 
along and keep you up to date as well.  At some point, it may be appropriate 
to bring in TW or ETS folks, as the action items move forward.  Tom 
Rutherford is another resource that Tim used and that we can consider as 
things develop.  Let me know if you need anything, have any thoughts or want 
to discuss.  I am mindful of the marketing affiliate rules and I don't want 
to get in trouble with them, but I am an employee of Enron Corp. so I do feel 
that so far we are in the clear.

Cabo's--very hip if you like meat markets (which I do, of course).  I suspect 
that fish tacos are a  very popular dish in London--at least among the London 
surfer crowd.  You can reach me on the cell phone @402-630-8461--I'll leave 
it on all day.  So what brings both of you down to Houston?  Anything going 
on that I ought to know about?  DF

 Just got an update on the project that won't go away.  Dennis has a meeting 
lined up with DOE decisionmakers on the 25th.  He is going to pitch the 
project as an approximately 100 mw power plant, to be owned by (read 
"financed by") DOE, with the gas pipeline owned by Dennis and\or third 
parties (read "Enron"?).  Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get 
a more than 10% cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates, 
even assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas 
load.  How did he do it?  Very easy:  they ran the power plant economics 
using about a $2.00 gas cost instead of current, real world prices.   Dennis' 
argument is going to be:  "I'll take the risk on building the pipeline and 
the power plant at a capped cost, and then sell the power plant to you."

to sign off on the deal now because his chances of being nominated for VP or 
cabinet are dead and he now has nothing to lose in DC.  They think his real 
angle is now to bring home the bacon to New Mexico and then run for governor 
out there!!  Apparently the rank and file out in the home state think he got 
hosed and made a scapegoat unfairly.  
 I've asked  Lorna Brennan to pull some historical San Juan prices together 
to give to Tino to confirm whether his $2 price is wacky.  Other than that, I 
just told Tino that we are potentially interested in the pipeline part of the 
project if the risks and rewards make sense, and that EE&CC might be 
interested in the design/build on all of it.  He said he'd get back to me 
after the 25th meeting and tell me whether the project is undead.  DF    

Tino,  this was easier than I thought!  Just eyeballing the numbers, it looks 
like $2.00 may even be on the high side on a 24 month or 18 month average 
basis.   I wasn't sure which email to use so I used both.  Let me know how 
your meeting goes.  DF

Drew,

I pulled TW San Juan (Blanco) prices off the RDI database for January 1, 1998 
through June 8, 2000 (the most current in the database).  If you need to have 
the remainder of June and the first part of July input, let me know.  The 
file is attached and is saved in Excel so you can edit as needed.

Lorna

Congratulations to you both!  Your designation as V.Ps. is richly deserved!  
Just among us "constrained technical" people, however,  couldn't they have 
come up with a better description of our category?  It makes us sound like we 
are deficient in something other than just career choice!  See you 
soon--beers are on me!  DF

Please plan to attend an in-house training session on an "Introduction to the 
Electric Industry."   Jim Crist, a lecturer with IGT  is preparing a day-long 
seminar customized to our interests and issues.   

Here is my "top 4 list" on why GPG staff need to increase our understanding 
of the electric industry.

First and foremost, gas-fired electric generation is the growth market for 
gas pipelines.  We need to get a sense of why and where generation is being 
built and who the likely customers are.  This involves understanding the 
different between utility generation and merchant plants, the dynamics of 
siting, understanding a little bit about how utilities plan and economically 
justify generation investments.
Second, we need to understand electric utilities as customers.  Who is the 
customer these days -- the generator?  Who should we be dealing with within 
the utility organization.  What types of load patterns should we expect 
various types of electric players?  What types of services do they need?  We 
also need to get a sense of how the timing of their processes 
compare/contrast to our processes on the gas side.
Third, we need to understand the regulatory climate on the electric side and 
the implications for electric generation demand growth.  We need to 
understand the state/federal jurisdictional issues.  We need to learn about 
the debates over ATC, TLR, locational marginal pricing, price caps, and 
control areas.  We need to understand how these issues fit into Enron's 
position in support of restructuring the electric industry, unbundling 
transmission, removing native load exceptions, and avoiding prices caps and 
we need to understand how these debates affect GPG.
 Fourth, we need to understand electric tariffs and practices, services and 
OASIS because the FERC has started to insist on common rules between gas and 
electric.  The recent electric interconnection policy has now been applied on 
the gas side.  FERC is talking about imposing the RTO principles on 
pipelines. And, we hear a lot of comparisons between OASIS and pipeline 
EBBs.  We want to learn how to take advantage of electric best practices 
where it makes sense and on the flip side, know how to argue against the 
imposition of electric rules on our pipelines where there are legitimate 
differences between gas and electric.

I've shared this list of interests with Jim Crist as he prepares a customized 
seminar for us.  Please feel free to email me with any other areas of 
interest for the course.   I will keep you posted on the specific location as 
things progress.  In the meantime, please make sure to save the date!   
Please pass this notice along to others in your organization that may be 
interested.

Thinking about bailing out of the big O for a couple of days w/o rugrats or 
Sandra. Taking Kari out of her native biome is more hassle than its worth 
these days.  Might just blow up for a long weekend and do some fishing and 
beer drinking.  Send me the name of that book on flyfishing in the Hills--I 
want to see if I can get it on Amazon.   AMFDJF 

Sorry, I neglected to forward this to you earlier.   You've gotta give these 
guys credit for being tenacious!  I'll keep you posted on any meaningful 
developments after their meeting with DOE on the 25th.  Thanks for your 
patience.  DF 
	
	

 Just got an update on the project that won't go away.  Dennis has a meeting 
lined up with DOE decisionmakers on the 25th.  He is going to pitch the 
project as an approximately 100 mw power plant, to be owned by (read 
"financed by") DOE, with the gas pipeline owned by Dennis and\or third 
parties (read "Enron"?).  Dennis has run economics that show the DOE will get 
a more than 10% cost savings on the project compared to current PNM rates, 
even assuming a fairly high gas transport cost because of the smaller gas 
load.  How did he do it?  Very easy:  they ran the power plant economics 
using about a $2.00 gas cost instead of current, real world prices.   Dennis' 
argument is going to be:  "I'll take the risk on building the pipeline and 
the power plant at a capped cost, and then sell the power plant to you."  
"You take the risk on gas cost:  if gas cost tracks the 18-24 month average, 
you will realize your 10% cost savings, but if current fuel costs continue or 
escalate, you lose."    Either way, your reliability improves and you kick 
PNM in the shins."  Dennis and Tino apparently think they can sell DOE on 
this.  By the way, their current story on Richardson is that he won't resign, 
and won't be forced out by the administration because that would create even 
more publicity.  You'll love this:  they think Richardson is even more likely 
to sign off on the deal now because his chances of being nominated for VP or 
cabinet are dead and he now has nothing to lose in DC.  They think his real

out there!!  Apparently the rank and file out in the home state think he got

Thanks--excellent news.  DF

   
	
	

FYI
	
	

Good news:  I've just received word that the FERC has issued an order denying 
SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that 
TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to 
disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at 
the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we 
always do).  

If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C. 
Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.  In any event, the pendency of 
an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate.

If you have any questions, let me know.

pls print for me.  thanks df
	
	

Attached for your review is a draft of Transport Options filing that 
incorporates the comments and suggestions I've received since last week.  
Please provide any further suggestions/changes to me as soon as possible, but 
in no case later than close of business, Friday, July 14.  

The timeline I've discussed with TW Commercial for this project is as follows:

Final draft comments   Friday, July 14

Circulate draft to customers,
customer meetings, time for
customers to respond, informal 
discussion with FERC   Mon. July 17 - Wed. July 26

Final internal review/edit of filing  Thursday, July 27

FERC filing    Monday, July 31

Please let me know your comments on this proposed timeline as well.  Thank 
you.

Can't make it, unfortunately.  The agenda sounds great--I believe you have 
seen the latest draft of the proposed options filing for TW, so I have 
nothing else to add on that.  Thanks. DF

Dan Larcamp, Director of the FERC Office of Markets, Tariffs and Rates will 
be visiting Enron on July 18.   I am planning for him to have lunch with a 
group of staff from the GPG at 11:30 (catered lunch in 50M).  Please RSVP at 
your earliest convenience whether you can participate in this lunch meeting 
and/or the topics that you would like to see us discuss.

The lunch discussion will be informal, but I think we should have two or 
three themes that we'd like to steer discussions towards.  Here are some 
tentative ideas.

How to Bring New Ideas to FERC.  Get Dan's suggestions on how to best work 
with FERC on new ideas.  Perhaps talk about capacity options as an example.
What were his Impressions about the Recent Outreach Meetings.  Did he hear 
anything new from any trade groups.   Is there any general feedback he'd like 
to give to pipelines as a group?
Get Dan to Talk about Expectations for the fall Order 637 Technical 
Conferences.  The first conference has been scheduled for Sept. 19.  What are 
the top issues on Staff's mind.  
What Does he expect to see in the upcoming RTO filings.  Are there Staff 
resources concerns that we should be aware of and/or any suggestions for gas 
filings during this time period? 

FYI - Here is an outline of what I tentatively has lined up for Dan's visit.
10:30-11:30 Trading Floor Visit  Christi Nicolay/Kevin Presto/Steve Kean
11:30-1  Lunch (50M)   GPG Staff
1-1:30  Gas Control Tour  Mike Bryant

   

pls grab me when I come in and make me do this.  thanks df

Dear Enron Employees:

 With the addition of communications to our core businesses, it is 
appropriate for us to modify our existing tag line to simply "Endless 
possibilities."  This change is effective immediately and replaces our 
current tag line of "Natural gas. Electricity. Endless possibilities."

 To achieve our goal of a unified Enron brand, each employee has the 
responsibility to make the Enron image a consistent and strong identity.  
This is partially accomplished through correct application of the logo and 
tag line.  A revised Corporate Identity Guidelines Book has been developed to 
assist you in following the correct standards.  You may obain a copy of this 
new book by completing a Forms Request and ordering Item #42629.    These 
guidelines will also be made available electronically on the Brand Site at 
home.enron.com.

 We'd like to take this opportunity to remind all of you about the importance 
of maintaining a consistent look, especially with our stationery and business 
cards.  It has come to our attention recently that some employees are having 
these items produced by outside vendors and are not following the established 
guidelines.  This must stop immediately.  Please use the internal resources 
available to you for these items.  They will ensure that all guidelines are 
followed correctly and consistently.  If you have questions on how to get 
these items or on the guidelines, you may contact Marge Nadasky in Corporate 
Identity at marge.nadasky@enron.com.

 One name, one company....one Enron.  Our recent reorganization brings us 
another step closer to realizing this goal.  Please make sure you do your 
part to protect and strengthen the Enron brand around the world.

 Thank you for your continued support and cooperation.

      Office of the Chairman

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY 
INTERACTIVE OPEN SEASON 
APPROVAL REQUEST

Please review the attached file for the announcement of Transwestern's 
Interactive Open Season (IOS) to be held Friday, July 21, 2000.  The 
following summarizes the bidding rules and capacity definition for the two 
bid packages of East of Thoreau (EOT) to California capacity:

 Package 1:
 Volume: 20,000 Dth/d
 Term:  3 months (August - October, 2000)
 Path:  East of Thoreau to California.  Maximum available delivery capacity 
   of 12,000 Dth/d at Needles, Ca.  Remaining may be chosen between
   PG&E and Mojave.
 
Package 2:
 Volume: 49,000 Dth/d
 Term:  12 Months (November 1, 2000 - Oct. 31, 2001)
 Path:  East of Thoreau to California.  Maximum available delivery capacity
   of 35,000 Dth/d at Needles, Cal.  Remaining may be chosen between
   PG&E and Mojave.

Bidders may bid on either a 1-part or a 2-part rate structure for the entire 
capacity amount posted.   No partial volume bids are accepted.  Bid packages 
are considered mutually exclusive.     No minimum bid rate is posted 
therefore Transwestern is not obligated to accept any bids if the bids are 
valued as unacceptable.  Transwestern shall award capacity based upon Highest 
Rate criteria.

If any questions arise please contact Christine Stokes at x35702.

Please indicated approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.

   

Thanks Susan--I agree with your analysis of the tying issue.  It ain't tying 
if we aren't restricting access to the service--we are just offering 
selective discounts.  Christine--I'm OK with it.  Thanks. DF 

   
	
	

Drew -- I've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what 
we have posted before.

One issue that arose Friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., 
shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000 
or none at all) constitutes tying.  The 49,000 package includes 35,000 to 
North Needles and 14,000 to Topock.  So if a shipper wants the Needles space 
it has to take the Topock space too.  This looked like a clear case of tying 
to me until I remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and 
available and any shipper can bid on any part of the Needles space right now 
if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the 
Topock space.  That'll be true during the IOS too -- i.e., nothing can stop 
shippers from bidding on the Needles space outside of the IOS process.  This 
is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with 
the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable 
Topock space is part of that package.  

Does this make sense to you?  If not, give me a call.

As I have mentioned already a couple of times, the Commercial Group feels it 
is important to have something to present to customers.  My concern is that 
if we just tell them about it over lunch or over the phone, something is 
going to be ignored or lost in the translation, and then we'll have a dozen 
protests to contend with.  Surely we've presented new services to customers 
before in advance of filing...if so, how did we go about it?

Also, are you OK with filing July 31, or just as soon as we can get a 
prefiling conference with FERC?

   
	
	

I'm going over it and hope to have comments to you shortly-  we don't usually 
share the draft, just the concept which I don't see any hold up on that, but 
since we're still working on it, I don't want to give them a hardcopy-  MK

   
	
	

I spoke with Steve Stojic about this and he had the same concern.  Even 
though I was trying to keep this out of the new rate schedule requirements by 
not making it a rate schedule, I believe I still managed to cover many 
checklist items.  One that is not covered is testimony similar to what might 
be filed in a rate case, in order to justify market based rates.  We are 
planning to include a revenue estimate.  I'll go over these and make sure 
everything is addressed before filing.

Are you OK with this filing from a general conceptual standpoint?  The 
marketers want to start giving a draft to customers for them to review

Susan, 

 In reviewing the proposed filing I had some questions.  On page 2 in the 
discussion of ensuring sufficient capacity we offer to establish position 
guidelines, do we need to outline these and either include them as an exhibit 
or have them ready for reply to either protesters or a staff data request?  
Secondly, if we regard this as a new service does our filing comply with all 
aspects of 154.202 (a) (ii), (iii), (iv) (A) & (B), (v), (vi), (viii) and 
(ix)?  In recent filings the staff has challenged our filings in terms of 
addressing each of these requirements.  I believe many our covered but 
thought you might like to double check for compliance.  What about a revenue 
estimate? Seems like we need one, even if its still very speculative.

Glen 

   
	
	

Attached for your review is a draft of Transport Options filing that 
incorporates the comments and suggestions I've received since last week.  
Please provide any further suggestions/changes to me as soon as possible, but 
in no case later than close of business, Friday, July 14.  

The timeline I've discussed with TW Commercial for this project is as follows:

Final draft comments   Friday, July 14

Circulate draft to customers,
customer meetings, time for
customers to respond, informal 
discussion with FERC   Mon. July 17 - Wed. July 26

Final internal review/edit of filing  Thursday, July 27

FERC filing    Monday, July 31

Please let me know your comments on this proposed timeline as well.  Thank 
you.

Leslie Lawner called and asked if TW could help with the funding of this 
organization.  As you will recall, the "NM First" group has taken positions 
on right of way issues that are consistent with TW/Enron's view on Indian 
right of way issues.  Leslie asked if we could kick in $1000.  I leave this 
to you guys to weigh in on--If you think it's worthwhile, let me know and one 
of us can get back to Leslie.  I'm happy to help out with the funding if you 
think it would be useful.  DF

Thanks for the update--Other than the Gallagher Boland $$$ I can't think of 
anything that we might be squirreling away and capitalizing.  (Grynberg $$ go 
to a work order also, but are expensed, right?).  Also, I absolutely trust 
you, but in the Ronald Reagan sense:  "Trust, but verify."  Adios.  DF

DREW - SINCE I DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON I SPOKE WITH ELAINE.   

WE HAVE CAPITAL CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC PROJECTS - SUCH AS AN 
EXPANSION PROJECT.  I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY OF THOSE AND I HAVE PROVIDED 
MS. PATEL A LIST OF ET&S PROJECTS THAT FIT IN THIS CATEGORY (I ONLY HAD A 
COUPLE AS WELL).

THERE COULD BE OTHER CHARGES WHICH ARE ALLOCATED TO A GENERAL OVERHEAD AND 
CAPITALIZED.  THE ONLY MATTER THAT MIGHT FALL INTO THIS CATEGORY WOULD BE THE 
GALLAGHER/BOLAND (OUTSIDE COUNSEL) COSTS.  WE HAVE THESE GOING TO A WORK 
ORDER FOR THE YEAR 2000 (A TOTAL AMOUNT OF ABOUT $425,000 FOR NORTHERN).  I 
BELIEVE WE WERE PLANNING TO ESTIMATE THE COSTS AS THE SAME FOR 2001 AND TREAT 
THEM THE SAME (ASSUMING ELAINE AND OTHERS GIVE US THE GO AHEAD).

ELAINE - ANYTHING TO ADD?  ALSO, I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE COLLECTING THESE 
CHARGES FROM ALL GROUPS AND WILL GET BACK TO US??  (AND YOU WILL PUT ME ON 
YOUR DISTRIBUTION LIST SINCE I DON'T TRUST DREW AND HE'S TOO SMART TO TRUST 
ME.) THX.

TW and Caithness met in Denver this week for the first face-to-face meeting 
between the parties.  The purpose of the meeting was to review the status of 
the Caithness Big Sandy Project and to establish the next steps for moving 
the project forward.

Caithness Corporation
Caithness Corp. is a privately held company based in New York with a variety 
of business interests.  The company is essentially a financial vehicle for 
private investors.  Their energy segment currently owns 1,200 MW of 
generation through renewable assets in California (geothermal at Coso, wind 
in Tehachapi and Palm Springs) and a gas fired plant in South Carolina 
jointly-owned by Florida Power & Light.

Big Sandy Project
The Big Sandy Project is a proposed power plant to be located near Wickieup, 
Arizona.  The project would be built in two phases- first phase would be 550 
MW, with a gas load of approx. 80,000 MMBtu/d, and phase 2 would add another 
170 MW for a total of 720 MW with a gas load of 120,000 MMBtu/d.

The proposed location of the plant is approximately 40 miles south of 
Transwestern's pipeline.  The take-off point on Transwestern would be at/near 
valve station #1008, approximately 15 miles downstream of compressor Station 
#1.  The current estimate includes an alignment that follows Arizona state 
highway 93 south to a location 2 miles southeast of Wickieup in the S/W 4 of 
Section 5, T15N, R12W, Mohave County, Arizona.  There is a 500 KV 
transmission line owned by WAPA that crosses the property.  This line is one 
of the principal electric transmission systems in the Southwest and extends 
from the Phoenix area to the Mead substation near Boulder City, NV.  I've 
included a WAPA map below which indicates this line.  Also, on the site is a 
water pipeline owned by the Cyprus Amax Bagdad mine.  Water for the plant 
will come from an encapusulated water table through deep wells.  They have 
currently dug the first two test wells, each capable of 500 cfm.  The power 
plant will require approximately 3,500 cfm of water.  In addition to the 
wells, the plant has several thousand-acre feet of water rights to surface 
water from the Big Sandy River.  The project may also purchase water from the 
Cyprus Bagdad water pipeline.

The chief geological feature of this area is the Big Sandy River and 
associated wash.  The highway 93 roadbed follows along the river.  The area 
includes rolling hills and is principally desert terrain, with some limited 
agricultural and ranching interests.  Wickieup is a very small town with an 
estimated population of 200.

Project Schedule
Gas Turbine(s) ordered Westinghouse-Seimens  May 2000
Submit Environmental Impact Statement (EIS)  August 2000
Arrange financing     December 2000
EIS approval      March 2001
Construction begins     April 2001
Testing begins      July 2002
Commercial Operation     November 2002

There are two lead agencies for purposes of the project's EIS- the Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM Kingman office) and the Western Area Power 
Administration (WAPA).  There is only one endangered/threatened species known 
to be present in the area.

Lateral Pipeline Alignment
The most critical path item is the alignment of the lateral pipeline.  The 
alignment (lateral pipeline route) must be included in the EIS to be filed 
next month.  Caithness has spoken preliminarily with the Arizona Department 
of Transportation (ADOT) and the agency is amenable to granting an easement 
for the pipeline.  The problem appears to be in the limited amount of right 
of way available.  Measured from the shoulder to the fenceline, there is only 
a 70 ft. right of way available for construction.  Typically, pipelines 
require a 100 ft. temporary construction easement and 50 ft. of permanent 
right of way.  Preliminary discussions indicate another problem with this 
alignment may be the roadway's routing within the wash of the riverbed.

If the highway 93 corridor is unsuitable for the pipeline, the second 
alternative appears to be running the pipeline down the adjacent N/S section 
line.  The problem with this approach is that as the line nears the site, the 
routing would have to contend with the river bed and wash areas, possibly 
necessitating deep burial and anchoring.  The other route would involve 
following along the WAPA electric transmission corridor.  The only issue 
there, aside from whether WAPA would permit the pipeline encroachment, is 
whether there are safety and/or corrosion concerns associated with a high 
pressure gas line located under a high voltage transmission system.

Other Preliminary Project Issues
There are other fundamental issues to address.  The original concept was to 
interconnect the proposed Transwestern lateral with El Paso's northern 
mainline and the yet-to-be-constructed Questar Southern Trails Pipeline, both 
of which lay adjacent to Transwestern's mainline.  Transwestern's original 
estimate to construct a 16" lateral pipeline and meter station ($20.3MM) was 
based on the following specifications:

120 MMcf/d
450 psig delivery pressure,
900 psig inlet pressure

The meeting resulted in a revised set of specifications that now include a 
higher 550 psig minimum delivery pressure (new technology Westinghouse 
turbines).  In addition, our understanding is that EPNG's system operates at 
a pressure 100-150 psig lower than Transwestern's.  In order to accommodate 
EPNG deliveries and to account for the new higher minimum pressure, the 
design will likely change to a 20" pipeline.

Next Steps (responsible party/department)
 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Pipeline Alignment
1. Estimate to plot lateral pipeline route.     8/4  Matthews/Chanley
2. Engineering services agreement    8/4  Scott/Fawcett
3. Final alignment sheets.    8/25  Matthews/Chanley

Misc. Items
1.   Confidentiality Agreement   7/24  Scott/Fawcett
2. Data items to Caithness
 -  Form 567     7/26  Matthews
 -  Gallup FERC filing (flow diagram)  7/26  Scott

1.   Original estimate (16" line) to Caithness  7/24  Matthews
2.  Revised specifications to Transwestern  7/28  Caithness (T.P.)
3.   Revised estimate (20" line) to Caithness    8/4  Matthews/Chanley 

Other Issues
Several key issues need to be addressed concurrently with the pipeline 
alignment and engineering activities:

 Task      Date Due Party/Dept. 
Deal Structuring
1. Financing/cost amortization     9/8  Fawcett/Hayslett
/Centilli/Goodrow
2. Research interconnect policy (EPNG)    8/4  Scott/Regulatory
3. Research 7(c) application requirements  8/11  Scott/Regulatory
4. Rates      9/22  Scott/Regulatory
/Centilli
5. Research open season requirements  8/18  Scott/Regulatory

The above list is certainly not meant to be all-inclusive and a kick-off 
meeting to discuss the project schedule will be put together shortly.  In the 
meantime, if you have any questions regarding this project, please let me 
know.  Also, please feel free to forward this memo to anyone I've 
inadvertently left off the distribution.  Thanks.  

He's not a nazi, he's a commie.  Actually he's a democrat but such subtle 
distinctions escape me.  What MKM is talking about is a conversation I had in 
DC with a buddy of mine who is a commissioner on the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission.  He said there is a move afoot to expand regulation of 
financial products like weather hedges, spark spread swaps and similar 
industry specific instruments that his agency has not regulated in the past.  
(they just regulate the commodity exchanges like the NYMEX, Chicago Board of 
Trade, etc.)  He also made it sound like Enron Online had made his staff 
people more nervous about the lack of regulation over those kinds of 
products.  The current strategy, he explained, was to solve the problem of 
the CFTC's arguable lack of jurisdiction over such products by getting the 
agencies with jurisdiction over the industry to which such products were 
being sold (i.e., the FERC as to energy products) to regulate the stuff based 
on the CFTC's guidance.  I assume that Kean's group is on top of this, but I 
haven't had the chance to check yet.  I talked to a guy in the DC office 
about 6 months about CFTC issues and will follow up with him on Monday and be 
sure they are aware of this leftist plot.  I can't remember his name just 
now, but he works for Cynthia Sandherr, I think.  I'll let you know what is 
going on after I talk to those folks.  DF 

   
	
	

Talk to Drew, he might have an idea--  from his nazi friend.  MK

   
	
	

Dan also made a comment when we were chatting that the trading floor and EOL 
tour was "discouraging in a way" because they were not yet prepared to 
regulate such activities. I thought it was kind of frightening that he feels 
they need to regulate such a free market, although it was not clear exactly 
what he meant and I was not able to pursue it with him.

I just talked to Cynthia Sandherr about this and she was partly up to speed.  
They have been fighting with the CFTC to keep it from extending its 
jurisdiction to Enron Online and to all the financial products Enron sells.   
We apparently have a bill pending to lock the CFTC in and keep it from going 
after energy-related financial products.  Cynthia was not aware of any 
potential collaboration between CFTC and FERC designed to push FERC into the 
role of regulator of these markets (with CFTC pulling the strings behind the 
scenes).  Cynthia was cranky about this possibility and will follow up.

Great--looks like a good start at working through this project.  I've got a 
couple of thoughts, questions, etc. that I'd like to discuss with you all 
before we get back to Tino with any kind of preliminary response:

1.  What is our pulse on a project that ramps up slowly to full utilization?  
This deal will not be 100% subscribed for several years (optimistically) as 
it is designed to gain market share from a combination of market growth and 
bypass of existing GCNM customers (and new power generation load, but that 
part of Tino's story needs more thinking).  The rates on the attached 
spreadsheet would provide full cost recovery only after the project is fully 
subscribed, right?  We need to think about the economics of this thing in 
terms of deferring and recovering in the out years the revenue shortfalls in 
the early years.  Has GPG ever done deals like that?  

2.  On the GCNM discounting issue, it seems we need at least three data 
points to understand our risks:
   a.  What do GCNM's current discounts look like? 
 b.  How much more aggressively could GCNM discount in the future if they had 
to to avoid bypass?   (i.e., are there regulatory or political constraints on 
increased discounts?)
 c.   Will the big industrial loads stick with the low cost provider if GCNM 
tries to undercut the project, or will they be willing to pay a little more 
just to assure that a new pipeline gets built into their backyard?    

3.  Assuming we don't have the risk appetite to get in on a project like 
this, how do we positiion ourselves to be the preferred upstream pipeline for 
Langley's project?  I assume that if neither TW nor El Paso partner with 
Langley he'll interconnect with both.  Do we already have or can we create 
any kind of competitive advantage under that scenario? 

4.  Is the right of way that Langley has negotiated really all that 
valuable?  From Lorraine's memo, it seems that the issue of which route is 
best is half baked at best.  If that's all Dennis brings to the table (not 
counting his big bag of $$$$), does a deal with him really make sense?   

I'm sure there are a lot of other issues we need to discuss, but these are 
the first that come to mind.  Please give me a call when you get together to 
discuss this as I'd like to be involved in how we respond to Tino and 
Dennis.  Thanks. DF

1. The initial study of the Albuquerque project brought to Transwestern by 
Dennis Langley has been completed.

2.  Facility Planning provided Level A (+/- 30%) cost estimates for 3 
separate routes.  (Two of which were brought to us by Langley, the third; 
Facility Planning identified as being a shorter, cheaper route.)

3. Economic Analysis was run on the three options.  The attached spreadsheet 
details project rates and costs.

4. Current PNM tariff transmission rates indicate higher rates than potential 
Albuquerque project rates.  We know that PNM discounts (deeply when necessary 
to keep a customer from leaving its system), but we don't know 
definitively.   We continue to research current discounted rates.

5. The initial take on the feasibility of this project is good enough to 
forge ahead.

Please call me if you have any questions and as to our plan to respond to 
Tino.  Thanks.

No, we are paying them $3 mm in addition to handing them the Hobbs line and 
giving them the option on the Eldo-Spraberry line.  I haven't really thought 
about it, but I guess the transfer price for the Hobbs line should be some 
nominal amount--$10 or something.  I'll give you and Louie a call in a bit to 
discuss.  Thanks.  DF

   
	
	

Drew, thanks for the fax.  Quick question... is the purchase price a flat 
3,000,000 without any adjustments for line pack... Since we are going to sign 
and close same day, we won't need adjustments for cap ex.  I am putting 
together a draft PSA now.  THanks.  Kim

Thanks.  I'm about a 30.  DF

Julie  

lets talk re: this.  I'm troubled.  df
	
	

I understand that this capacity is what was posted on the IOS, however,  
these alternate point rights were not included in the posting as available, 
is there a concern that not all were aware of this and therefore they could

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Please review the attached standard discount letter for Sempra Energy Trading 
Corp.  Sempra was recently awarded 49,000 Dth/d of East of Thoreau (EOT) to 
California capacity via Transwestern's Interactive Open Season Auction 
process.  The capacity was awarded at a one-part rate of $.285/Dth/d for a 
one year term of November 1, 2000 - October 31, 2001.  Sempra shall have 
alternate delivery point rights at the California Border as well as alternate 
receipt point rights in Transwestern's EOT Area.

Please confirm via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  All Officer approvals will be faxed 
to Bill Cordes for final Officer approval.

I'm not sure I understand MKM's comment.  We've all approved this deal so its 
not urgent, but lets talk about it in our meeting today.  df
	
	

This may have been the case in others, but the IOS does say that it bid, if 
less than max is not available.  If Drew and Susan are ok to sign off, I can 
go with that and we do need to be specfic as to what we are going to include 
in the contract in the IOS package.  Lets hope it doesn't come back to bite 
us, assuming Drew and Susan sign off.  MK

Mary Kay -  In all of Transwestern's previous Interactive Open Seasons, the 
only capacity which Transwestern had posted for bid purposes was the primary 
capacity - no associated alternate flexibility was ever posted as being 
available to the bidders.  We have traditionally relied on verbal 
communication, only if asked by the shipper,  of any potential alternate 
rights associated with the primary capacity being auctioned.  I do not feel 
that in this recent IOS process that any shipper had possibly NOT increased 
their bid due to the impression that there was no additional flexibility 
beyond  the primary path rights of the capacity being auctioned.  However,  I 
do think that the TW commercial group should discuss how we communicate to 
any interested party those alternate rights  associated with future IOS bids 
or EnronOnline bids.   Thank you for your comment, please contact me if you 
need any additional feedback.

I spoke to Kim Watson today re the following  1. They will be kicking off the 
science part of the system on August 23  ET&S Marketing and other invitees  
2. Matt Johnson from PROS called Kim yesterday to tell her that some pipeline 
has purchased PROS' storage product  and he asked how we were coming along.  
Kim said we had moved off in a different direction but that we would be 
interested in seeing their product, which we are trying to set up for the day 
before or after August 23.  3.  Since we seem to be rolling along on the 
dashboard and starting the science piece, we plan to get Stuart Ford (V&E) 
over here during the week of August 14th  to make sure we are doing all the 
right things to make sure this being protected as an Enron product which if 
it is sucessful  we will be able to sell to third parties.  OK with you??

Please take a look at this and give me a call.  I didn't know we were 
expecting any agreement from ECS.  DF

Comments?

The tie in line that TW built is not part of the deal.  We are modifying the 
agreements to make that totally clear and I believe Rockey is going to talk 
to Mary Ann Pearce to make sure there is no misunderstanding.  DF

Bob Burleson
07/28/2000 10:40 AM
Thought I would pass this along, I had not heard for sure that this line was 
part of the deal or not. We could make an argument that it is not part of the 
12" line, but could be sold to them along with the conveyance of the 12" 
line.  

This line was constructed to tie the 12" line into the suction side of the 
Maljamar compressor.  I don't think they would need this line for the 
intended purpose of "low pressure gathering" to the inlet of there plant.  
They may need it if they turn the line into residue service.  It would be 
another interconnect with TW (although a redundant one).

Let me know if this line is included, and if we need to get her the ROW info.

Thanks, Bob
I was in a meeting yesterday and found out that there is a 12" pipeline
located in the SW/4 Sec. 29 and SE/4 Sec. 30, T17S, R32E, Lea County, New
Mexico, that is part of the deal.  It is my understanding that this pipeline
was built by Transwestern a few years ago.  I did not see any right-of-way
agreements to cover this line when I was in your office this week.  Please
provide me with the right-of-way documentation to cover this pipeline.

If you have any questions, please call me at 281-293-2165.  I would
appreciate receiving this information as soon as possible.

Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!

Does anyone find it interesting that we've heard nothing but silence from 
Dennis and Tino?  I suspect that their big meeting with DOE on the 25th 
didn't go so well.  If you hear anything let me know, otherwise I'll try to 
get ahold of Tino sometime next week to find out what DOE said.  DF

I didn't know you guys were both in the Moscow office now!  That's a pretty

Assuming we keep Arthur Anderson on board this afternoon and assuming Enron 
is still in the business of doing asset monetizations like this one (which 
better be the case since its in the TW 4th Q plan @$2.5 mm), the following 
things need to happen on roughly the following timetable:

1.  Mike talks to Hanover and we negotiate the price, specific contract 
language, etc.  (hopefully within 2-3 weeks of turning Mike loose?)

2.  Regulatory (assisted by Maria and me) flanges up the FERC abandonment 
filing and tees it up to file the minute Mike finalizes the deal with 
Hanover.  We haven't talked about this for a while, but the story we tell  
FERC has to acknowledge that the monthly O&M cost will be higher under our 
outsourcing deal than it currently is, if load factor and other operating 
assumptions remain constant.   That may be the key to our story line--we 
argue that outsourcing is necessary to creating flexibility in our cost 
structure to protect us and our ratepayors from market changes, gas flow 
changes, and capacity turnbacks.  The Compression Services Agreement, as it 
is currently drafted, has a two part demand-commodity rate.  Thus, if our 
throuput goes to pot on the segments where these outsourced compressors are, 
or if we have big capacity turnbacks, the outsource deal allows us to shed 
costs quickly.  Charlie's preliminary cost spreadsheets seem to me to support 
this strategy.  I'll talk to Maria and MKM's team about this.  Also, we need 
to be able to explain to explain that our deal is not all that new or 
radical.  It is just a tiny bit different from the many deals FERC has seen 
where compression or other services are outsourced from the get-go with new 
facilities.  For example, FERC allowed NNG to outsource compressor motor 
operation and ownership using ECS (and, by tomorrow, hopefully will allow TW 
to do the same at Gallup).  Florida has a similar deal, as well as 
intrastates like HPL.  Maria and I and MKM's folks need to turn over every 
rock to find examples of similary outsourcing that don't involve Enron.  We 
need to let FERC know that the outsourcing train has already left the station 
and we just want to jump on board.         

3.  We get the abandonment order in the 4th Q and do the deal.  (Will we have 
the chance to do some more schmoozing and lobbying of FERC folks before we 
file--i.e., at a prefiling conference???)  

See how easy these deals are when you use assumptions to eliminate the many 
problems!     

That, my man, is the $64 question.  Kim and Rockie are nailing this down 
first thing monday AM.  The result of our conversation on Friday with Conoco 
was that if we own it, they want it, and if we don't own it, we'd better not 
convey it to them.  Clever devils, they are forcing us to determine exactly 
what it is that we own!  Talk to you tomorrow.  DF

Here is the draft letter agreement.  We are still discussing it with ECS and 
can make whatever changes are appropriate.  Note that the letter agreement 
ties back to Article 6 of the Compression Services Agreement.  That article, 
you may recall, is where ECS agreed to create a computerized system that 
would monitor Continental Divide's electric system utilization and warn when 
their system peaks were occurring and then automatically take the compressor 
offline (subject to manual override) so we and ECS could avoid peak period 
demand charges.  Instead of creating such a system, which apparently turned 
out to be mostly a manual system anyway, ECS is going to pay us a monthly fee 
to monitor CD's system peaks ourselves and decide when we need to get off 
line.  The load management service has to do with operational management of 
the load we place on CD's electric system, and is not a jurisdictional gas 
transportation or storage service.  Note that the service goes on for 10 
years (as required by the accountants' 10 year amortization rule) and thus 
may be vulnerable to scrutiny and potential revenue crediting in TW's 2007 
rate case.  Any way to avoid that?  DF    

Speak of the devil.  Tino called, all full of optimism and questions.  They 
have pitched the DOE a deal in which Dennis builds three 50 Mw turbines on 
the Isleta, and a 7 mile power line to DOE's distribution lines.  The project 
will apparently be 100%debt financed, with DOE agreeing to pay a firm demand 
charge rate of between 8 and 9 cents/kwh.  That rate is supposedly high 
enough to service the debt on a 10 year amort. basis (remember, DOE can only 
sign 10 year contracts).  DOE is interested, says Tino, because of the 
redundant, dedicated facilities and enhanced reliability, and because Dennis 
and Tino pitched DOE on all the $$$$ DOE will make from the surplus power 
sales.  Dennis apparently pitched them a "share the upside" deal under which 
DOE keeps most of the revenue from surplus sales.  Tino showed DOE the July 
spot prices at 4 Corners, which Tino said included many days over $200/Mwh 
and they got all excited.  DOE has done a similar share the upside deal at 
one of its facilities in Calif. Tino says and they have occasionally come out 
net positive on elec. costs in some months so they like the approach.  Tino 
had two questions:
1.  Does TW have 30-40,000/d of permian capacity available starting sometime 
in 2001 or 2002?  (I realize we have probably answered this question about 5 
times, but lets do it again for him). 
2.  Is there someone at ENA Tino can talk to about a getting a quote for long 
term and/or short term power purchase prices for Four Corners delivery?   If 
he can get something the DOE thinks is a good price, they m ay just sell all 
the surplus power forward.  If not, they'll just hang on to it and sell it 
into the cash market in monthly and daily deals.  

Thanks.  DF  

pls print--I'll look at it in the am (maybe!) DF
	
	

Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.  Significant 
changes include:

- added definition of Counterparty
- added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect 
compliance with 154.202
- included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated 
rate
- added an example of how options will work

I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option 
fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the 
fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the 
Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate 
because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be 
nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from 
the market.  

Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?  I will 
have Janet call to determine your availability.

I'm ok with the change.  Just curious, but Courtney doesn't get any  time 
value of money recognition on his prepayment?  Also, the prepayment gives us 
a cash, but not earnings, benefit, right?  Thanks.  DF

Since we skipped a board meeting for TW last year, the operating report for 
TW should cover 1998 to the present for purposes of adopting any necessary 
resolutions.  For Northern, we will cover from 1999 to the present.  The 
minutes of past meetings indicate that you used an update of TW's and

By now I'm sure that you've heard about the upcoming electric industry class 
that has been customized for GPG staff.   The purpose of the class is to 
learn about electric utilities as our customers, learn about some of the 
current regulatory and legislative debates and the impact on us, and to learn 
about the economics of electric generation.   

The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel, 
Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with 
remarks on why he believes GPG needs to learns about economics and trends in 
the electric industry.  The class includes a full day of course work and a 
working lunch will be served.   A  workbook is being prepared and will be 
distributed to you a week prior to the class.  

I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per 
student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please 
RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a 
count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG 
attendees.  

Am I the only one having a deja vu experience?  I know you can't believe what 
you read, but the trade press makes it sound like capacity to California is 
worth about a zillion bucks--are we sure we want to do this???? DF

Bill, attached is a memo prepared by Susan Scott that does a good job of 
answering the several questions that you had about the situation at Topock.  
Note that in Susan's first answer, PG&E has no obligation to Transwestern to 
accept gas at Topock.  They may well have obligations to their own 
transportation customers or sales customers that have to be satisfied with 
Topock receipts, but that doesn't give TW any rights against PG&E.  I realize 
these are not comforting answers, but I wanted us all to have a realistic 
understanding of where we are.  I'm running this by Lou in case he has a 
different spin on the history or the agreements.  Thanks. DF 

 

I'm OK with it, thanks to some coaching from Jeff.  I would suggest that our 
marketers specifically mention to all interested bidders (especially Texaco) 
that the lottery tiebreaker is clearly identified in the posting and if they 
want to be there to witness it they better call us because we don't send out 
engraved invitations.  Good luck.  DF

In case you haven't done it already, please cross out the note on your 
calendar that today is the day the Conoco trial starts!  What better day to 
announce a celebration of the settlement, since without it many of us would 
be sitting in a courtroom in Midland wondering whether the trial would last 3 
weeks or 30.   With that image firmly in mind, please plan on joining us for 
a celebratory dinner on Thursday, August 17th at 6:00 at Brennan's.  Again, 
thanks for all of your  efforts on this case, and I hope to see you on the 
17th!  DF

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
PRODUCT, JOINT DEFENSE PRIVILEGE

Dear Larry and Merlin,

 This will confirm our various telephone conversations about the 
above-referenced case.  Again, it is my understanding that we have all agreed 
(me on behalf of Northern/Transwestern, Larry on behalf of Duke, and Merlin 
on behalf of CMS Energy/Panhandle Eastern) to jointly retain Jim Peters to 
represent our respective interests in responding to the defendants' subpoenas 
and recently-filed motion to compel, which I have been advised is set for 
telephonic hearing on Monday, August 14, at 8:00 a.m.  Per this agreement, we 
will share Jim's fees and expenses on a 1/3 Northern/Transwestern, 1/3 Duke, 
1/3 CMS Energy/Panhandle Eastern basis.  As part of this agreement, each of 
us agrees to handle substantially all of his respective client's actual 
document production in-house, in order to hold Jim's fees and expenses down.

 In the very unlikely event that Jim encounters an unanticipated conflict 
between the positions of our respective clients, you additionally agree that 
Jim may withdraw from the representation of your clients in this matter, but 
may continue to represent Northern and Transwestern in this matter.

 Jim is currently working on a draft response to defendants' motion to compel 
for Northern/Transwestern.  By copy of this, I am asking Jim to send each of 
you drafts at the same time that he sends a draft by me.

 I look forward to working with you both.

     Regards,

     Britt Davis

	
	

Drew - 

Attached are the latest drafts of the Northern and Transwestern budget 
templates for your review and comment.  Changes were made to legal fees for 
both cost centers as per my notes from the last group meeting we had on 
budget.  In addition, you should have received the latest consolidated budget 
run and the latest outside counsel spreadsheet for 2001.

Let me know if you have any questions, modifications, concerns, etc.

Eric

pls print.  thanks df
Attached for your review is Jim Peters' rough draft. Jim tried to design it 
in such a way as to be as generic as possible, with the idea that factual 
differences between the parties would be put in the footnotes.  I am 
concerned he may be overreaching with regard to the legal objection, where he 
refers to TW/Northern as a "nonresident", given that (as I understand it) 
Northern and/or TW have facilities in Oklahoma.  There are also some 
grammatical changes that I would make.

I wonder if I could get ya'll to take a look at this and have you participate 
with me in a telephone conference with Jim later this afternoon?  If Drew, 
Jim or Bob could let me know what time would be convenient, I'll get it set 
up.  Many thanks.

Ugh.  We are in for a battle.  Some of this may be OK, but I detect an 
underlying philosophy that pipelines should simply not be allowed into 
markets that unregulated players (using the gray market or financial 
products) currently have monopoly control over.  DF

Lorraine,

Below are some very preliminary regulatory issues that I have identified
regarding Transwestern's
Transport Option Program.  These concerns may not constitute all of our
concerns; I'm sure there will be more as we continue to review this proposal
with our commercial people.  Also, they have not been reviewed with
management, and may, or may not, represent the ultimate positions that
Conoco (or the Indicated Shipper Trial Group) takes in any proceeding before
the FERC.

Thanks again for inviting us to lunch yesterday.  Both Teddy and I found it
to be very helpful and informative.  We look forward to a more detailed
description of your proposal, and the ability to discuss it with
Transwestern in a future customer meeting.  Please forward this e-mail on to
Jeff; I don't have his direct e-mail address.

Tentative Regulatory Issues regarding Transwestern's Transport Option
Program ("TOP").

1. Market Based Rates.  To the extent that TW intends to offer the TOP
service without a corresponding cost based recourse service, under current
FERC policy, TW would need to make a filing that demonstrates a lack of
market power.
2. Comparable Service:  To the extent that TW implements a TOP service,
it would be highly advisable to provide that other FT holders be able to
offer a similar call & put capability in the capacity release market.  As I
remember TW's tariffs, this would likely require specific changes to the
capacity release sections in order to allow prospective capacity releases
with a call or put pricing option.
3. Hoarding:  The TOP service should not be a means for any party
(particularly an affiliate) to manipulate the transportation market and/or
to exert market power by withholding capacity.
4. Reliability:  The TOP service should require sufficient protections
to ensure continued, undiminished service to all of TW's existing and future
FT customers.
5. Standardized Product:  The terms and conditions for the TOP service
should be standardized in order that each TOP service offer is not
considered a "non-conforming" contract under FERC policy.  The call and put
options, and any administrative or operating limitations, should be
specifically defined.
6. Non-preferential Service:  TW must ensure that the TOP service is
offered and administered in a manner that is fair and equitable, and in a
manner that does not convey a preferential right to any party (particularly
an affiliate).
7. Revenue:  Regardless of whether the TOP is a cost or market based
rate, there will be a question as to where the revenue goes.
8. Pilot Program.  Given the precedential nature of this proposal,
perhaps the industry would be more comfortable with the TOP if it were filed
as an experimental program on TW, with a finite life.  This would allow
parties to gain experience prior to having all of the Enron pipelines (and
others) file for similar authority.

Thanks again.

Here is my first draft on the bullets for Steve Winston:  Please comment 
asap.  

Steve, per your followup phone call, here is a bullet point summary of the 
issues discussed in regard to the counter proposal regarding the Stranger's 
Gas contract negotiation.  I do not have George Drakes email address, so 
could you please forward this to him.  

1)   Ethane reimbursement needs to be at a minimum 4%
       If there is incidental ethane extracted, in conjunction with propane 
NNG will be reimbursed with the propane 

2)  In regard to point on netting months,   NNG does not agree with sentence 
one, ok with second sentence

3)  In regard to point on netting products,  NNG does not agree with this.  
This was not the intent nor the practice until KN commenced and is the issue 
being discussed in regard to the audit of the Stranger's Gas reimbursement.  
Per the bid package, Northern is requesting reimbursement by product, but 
does realize that it may receive zero for certain products after 
reimbursement has occurred for others.  

4)  In regard to point on reimbursement of Btu's,  NNG, on behalf of its 
customers, must be kept whole for the volumes.  The amount related to the 
Stranger's gas contract needs to be kept whole.  We are not resolving not 
addressing the measurement issue in the discussion of the Stranger's gas 
contract.

5)  The contract to be utilized is the pro forma included in the Bid package, 
however, Oneok is free to "mark up" with proposed changes to be specficially 
discussed.  All parties that participated in the bid process have utilized 
this contract, not the existing one. (The "mark up" is not to be a wholesale 
delete with the old contract language inserted.)

6)  In the event we are unable to reach agreement on the Stranger's Gas 
contract, NNG requests in writing an assurance of how Oneok is going to 
modify its facilities etc, to assure that it will not unlawfully take liquids 
that belong to others.  

7)  Agreed to meet in Omaha on Sept 6th starting at 9:00 am.  

please print.  thanks df
	
	

Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  After 
our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last 
draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be 
"market-based."   Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a 
built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated 
into a separate option fee.  

The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and 
the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use 
transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they 
buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a 
service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  If 
you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know.

I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some 
examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from 
a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options 
will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll 
circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas 
or questions.

As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing 
in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable 
meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some 
concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final 
tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss 
their questions?  Let me know what you think.

Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting 
first, and when FERC staff is available to talk.

Please take a look at Vig's effort to detect price arbitrage behavior on TW 
using the same method that Steve Kirk used on Northern.  You'll recall that 
Steve's chart on Northern showed an very close correlation between the 
calculated arb opportunity and the direction and size of the aggregate 
customer imbalances, by month.  Proving once again that TW is just a little 
different, that method shows no correlation at all on TW.  I agree with Vig's 
conclusion that we should not use this data in the 637 filing.  

I tried one alternative reading of the data to see if I could find a 
correlation.  Steve's method evenly weights the value of arb opportunities 
that occur early and late in a month.  Please tell me if you agree, marketing 
folks, but I think a more logical approach would risk-weight the apparent arb 
opportunites.  In other words, an apparent opportunity to short TW and sell 
the gas for a $.25/mmbtu profit on the 5th of a month is unlikely to generate 
arb behavior because a trader has no idea on the 5th what the cash out index 
will be at the end of the month.  In contrast, an opportunity to make $.25 on 
the 25th of a month, when a trader can calculate pretty closely what the 
monthly index will be, is basically free money.  Using that logic, I ignored 
any apparent arb opportunites in the first half of the month.   I eyeballed 
the timing and size of the arb opportunites (i.e., there's a $.70-.90 arb 
opportunity to short TW from the 23d to the end of May, 2000) rather than 
using Steve's mathematical approach.   I still didn't see the kind of 
correlation I'd expect.  The correlation is directionally positive in only 4 
out of 12 months, and the size of the imbalances doesn't even make sense in 
the months that correlate on direction.  I give up, and am removing the arb 
argument from the daily imbalance section of the draft.  I'll route that 
separately.  

Thanks to Vig, Susan, Lorraine and Richard for hustling on this analysis.  
"Its better to try [to find a correlation] and fail than never to try at all. 
. .."          

Attached is my redline of your Sat. draft.  In addition to the revisions in 
the doc, I have a few questions and concerns:
1.  On the segmenting section, I think it is a fine legal argument, but it 
lacks something.  What is our "or else" position?  Does the Global Settlement 
give us any FERC-out rights or colorable argument that the entire deal should 
be unwound if FERC screws up the segmenting issue?  I'm not suggesting that 
we should trigger a FERC out if we have one, but if we arguably do, we should 
consider threatening to use it.  I'm afraid we come across as whiny and 
FERC's position will likely be "so what, what are you going to do about it?"  
If we have no arguable "FERC-out" and the only  "or else" we have is that 
we'll take them to Court and force them to adhere to the original deal, I'm 
for leaving the draft as-is.  We can make our appeal threat more direct on 
rehearing if they hose us in the initial order.
2.  On the arbitrage argument, I've taken out any reference to an example and 
softened the verbiage a bit.  I want to leave in the references to the 
arbitrage issue, however, because FERC understands the problem and believes 
it is widespread.  We don't need to prove exactly how big a problem it is on 
our system (although it would have been very effective if we had clear facts).
3.  Do any of the OBA changes arguably conflict with the Global Settlement?  
If so, we'd  better be prepared to eat our words from the segmenting 
section.  Covering ourselves in the sanctity of that Settlement in section 1 
and then fiddling around with it in section 2 won't play well.  It is my 
understanding that the OBA system on TW was not part of the turnback 
resolution deal so I hope this won't be a problem.  
4.  On FN 20, I'd suggest we use Vig's data and chart for May of 2000.  The 
arb opportunity is huge and clear.  We reference in the FN that we use all 
six of the Gas Daily price points, and I think Vig used just 3.  What's the 
right answer?     

Good work everyone--please give it one more careful look on Monday AM and it 
should be good to go.  DF

Everyday heroes are all around us at Enron, living our core values of 
Respect, Integrity, Communication and Excellence in everything they do.  Some 
of these heroes make a big splash while others just quietly make a difference 
in the workplace around them.  Either way, these special individuals deserve 
to be recognized with a nomination for the 2000 Chairman's Award.

As there is more than just one employee living the values at Enron, this 
award program will honor 10 employees as members of the Chairman's 
Roundtable.  From that group, the one individual most embodying our values 
will be presented with the Chairman's Award at the Management Conference in 
San Antonio in November.

The beauty of this award program is that it is completely employee-driven 
from beginning to end.  From your nominations, an international employee 
committee will select the Chairman's Roundtable and eventually, the 
Chairman's Award winner.  Your role of nominating our everyday heroes is 
extremely vital to the program's success.  If someone has made a positive 
impression on you, please take the time to complete a nomination form and 
send it to Charla Reese by October 1, 2000.  You may click here for a 
printable form:  http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom/form3.doc

For more information on the Chairman's Award, including details on last 
year's Roundtable members and previous winners, Repit Suliyono and Bobbye 
Brown, please click here: http://home.enron.com/announce/chairman_nom

Give me a call when you get the chance to look at this and I'll update you on 
the discussion we had yesterday on automating the request for service 
process.  Shelley, Tony and myself got comfortable that with a few changes to 
the verbiage a customer sees before he clicks on a parcel of capacity, and 
with a couple of minor limitations on the capacity we sell (i.e., no Subpart 
B-restricted 311 capacity parcels) Northern will be able to treat a 
customer's click on a parcel of capacity as submission of a request for 
service.

As you are aware, Transwestern is working with a shipper to potentially 
provide service to a new power plant located approximately 40 miles off the 
mainline in Arizona.  Although, the final negotiation are not complete 
certain options are being evaluated, I need some assistance in interpreting 
the regulations regarding the authority we should use for approval of this 
project.  

The facilities that would be constructed include a delivery point and 
approximately 40 miles of pipe.  As these facilities are non-mainline, it may 
be possible to construct the proposed facilities under the prior notice 
provisions of TW's blanket certificate, provided the project satisfies the 
blanket criteria (generally costs and environmental).

With this in mind, I have the following issues and questions:

Preliminarily, marketing is thinking that we may want to develop an 
incremental rate  to recover the cost of the project.

Would a new incremental rate for this service impact our ability to file for 
approval under the prior notice provisions?  Note: Generally, Subpart F of 
Part 157 (blanket regulations) does not address service issues as 
transportation service is provided under Part 284 of the Commission's 
regulations.  However, the regulations (o157.204)  set forth Who may apply 
for a blanket certificate.   The criteria includes, among other things, any 
interstate pipeline that has rates accepted by the Commission.  Therefore, 
would an incremental rate have to be approved by the Commission before the 
proposed facilities would be blanket eligible?

Can a new incremental rate be established through a limit-section 4 rate 
filing or is a case-specific certificate required?

As the facilities will not include any mainline expansion - Is an open season 
required for the project?  My opinion is "NO".  Do you agree?

Your thoughts and assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated.  
Thanks MW

Leslie, I'll follow up with Mike McGowan.  Is there an invoice or something 
floating around that you are aware of?  Shall we just send to you Tom and 
have you get it to the right place?  I'm not sure anyone has been hired yet 
to fill Tim's position, but I know that is in progress.  Mike--please give me 
a call re: this.  Thanks. DF

Drew, Tom has informed me that Enron has never paid for the table that Tim 
Aron got for the Secretary Richardson fundraiser (last April) and the tab is 
$2500.  I know in hindsight we may not want to give Richardson any money 
since he blew his chance at becoming VP (just joking) but we do need to pay.  
Tom's email address is above and perhaps he can tell you where to mail the 
check.

I also have a couple of other obligations that Tim Aron undertook that I need 
to follow up on, has someone been hired, or should I go through you?

Thanks.

OK.  DF

Interesting.  I remember vaguely that we had some concern with how VAR was 
calculated.  I recall that Dave Neubauer didn't think that we were doing it 
right for TW.  Do you remember this issue?  If so, does this change address 
the same issue?  Also, I'll line up a meeting today or tomorrow on  the TW

The Corporate Risk Management Department prepares ET&S's Value at Risk 
calculation.  They recently completed a review of our historical experience 
and correlation on our hedged positions.  Based on this review, we have 
agreed to increase the correlation to .90.  This change has caused the V@R to 
decrease significantly to more appropriately reflect the risk in our

exposures are being appropriately reflected in the V@R calculation.

If there are any question regarding the V@R calculation, please contact Dan

Ugh.  We'll keep working this angle if their new attorney shows up on deck, 
but I think Susan and I have done as much as can be done with Howard H.  Do 
any of you know what the Red Cedar facilities look like?  I.e. how many miles 
of line, any big diameter line, any compression, etc?  Howard must have read 
some old cases and gotten himself spooked that their facilites aren't 
gathering under the modified primary function test.  I'm not sure why he 
thinks signing a transport contract with us will make their situation any 
worse, but that seems to be his conclusion.  If Steve and Bill can't nudge 
Red Cedar's management into doing the deal, I'd suggest that you both or one 
of you ask Tsuri (sp?) to have his new lawyer call me and Susan after Howard 
leaves, maybe with one of the Kinder Morgan lawyers on the phone also, and 
we'll try to straighten this out. 
	
	

I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation 
with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely 
declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to 
conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me 
like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded 
interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at 
FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very 
leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their 
identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned 
that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney 
will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad.  
Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from 
Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder 
Morgan lawyers.

pls set up an hour on this sometime tomorrow am if possible.  thanks df

I'm OK with this agreement.  Christine, I appreciate your explanation of how 
we developed the rate.  Hopefully, once FERC approves our purchase and sale 
of options, we can price them as a stand alone service.  For now, including 
the optionality as a bundled component of the total discounted rate--as we 
did here--is appropriate.

I called Tino today to let him know that our affiliates are sniffing around a 
power plant opportunity and potential gas bypass pipeline in Albuquerque.   
Kevin, you should be getting a call from a guy in Portland whose name I can't 
seem to find right now.  He had gotten my name from Thome out there and 
called to let me know that ENA is interested in pitching either PNM or some 
outfit called "Delta" on development or expansion of a gas-fired power plant 
in the south part of Albuquerque.  It didn't sound to me like ENA was very 
far along in their deal.  I explained to this guy what we were involved in 
and swore him to confidentiality.  I also told him he need to call either 
Kevin or Steve before he talked to PNM.  I thought it was a little curious 
that ENA is interested in generation in Alb. all of a sudden.  

On the Tino front, he apologized for not calling after their big DOE 
meeting.  He said it went very well and that DOE is considering their 
offer--$.085/Kwh power less revenue sharing for all surplus power sold.  Tino 
and Dennis offered DOE 70% of the $$ from the surplus power sales until a 
certain target is hit (probably a target equivalent to DOE's current PNM rate 
less 10%) and then 30% of any additional $$.   Tino and Dennis really blew 
some smoke by showing the DOE guys this summer's Four Corners spot prices 
(generally in the $200-400/mwh range) and doing the math for them. On that 
basis, the net delivered power cost after rebate comes pretty close to zero.  
Even using a more reasonable sampling of Four Corners prices, the DOE price 
is apparently better than their current PNM price.  The big issue is whether 
DOE can figure out how to keep the rebate $$ at Sandia, rather than lose the 
$$ to treasury.   Sounds like the Dennis and Tino show is still flogging this 
deal pretty hard, so I reminded Tino that we are eager to do anything we can 
to help. 

Bill or Kevin, please forward this to Bill Gang--I couldn't get my computer 
to recognize his name.  

Please call if you have any questions.  DF      

pls print asap.  df

Attached for your convenience find the latest drafts of the Transport Options 
documents.  These documents were sent to our workshop participants late 
yesterday as a means to facilitate our discussions tomorrow.  I suspect we'll 
have small changes to incorporate based on the comments we receive in the 
workshop.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

In case you haven't already marked your calendars, tomorrow will be my two 
year anniversary with the company.   The good Lord willing (and with Stan's 
and Mike's continued acquiescence) I may even surpass the tenure of my two 
most recent and very illustrious predecessors.  Given your meteoric career 
tracks, however, I'm not sure you guys would view that as a huge 
accomplishment.  Hope all goes well with you both.  Adios from the big O.  
DF    

Looks good to me--and I agree that we ought to use if for internal purposes 
only.  If people at the customer meeting want more detail than you guys are 
able to provide orally, we could consider adding detail to the FERC filing or 
even sending them some additional explanation that we may or may not decide 
to file with FERC.  Good luck today!  DF

I'm distributing [internally] the brief answers we've crafted for each of the 
customer's questions.  I think we're on pretty solid ground in each case.  As 
mentioned below, we won't be distrubuting these answers during the workshop.  
We'll use them for our own purposes in answering the questions orally.  If 
you have any questions regarding this issue, please let me know.

Susan,
You hit the ball right down the middle.  I think we've answered these 
questions [more than] adequately.  I do not intend to distribute these 
answers in written form.  Rather, we'll answer them orally during the 
presentation, and use your work product as a guideline for our answers.  
Thanks for your hard work here.

   
	
	

Jeff, here's a slightly revised version of my bottom-line answers to Conoco's 
questions.
Am I remembering correctly that this is for internal distribution only?  
Again, I'll be out until around 10:30 tomorrow but you can reach me on my 
mobile (713.494.5002) before 9 or after 10 if there's anything you want to 
discuss.  Drew -- same goes for you.

AQUILA ENERGY NAMES LEADER OF ITS COMMODITY SERVICES GROUP

  recently named  Kevin Fox senior vice president and general
  manager of its Commodity  Services group.

We are now addressing the distasteful task of sorting through the mountain of 
files accumulated during the Conoco litigation.  Kathy is taking the lead on 
reviewing our document retention policies and advising Britt and I of what 
she thinks we can destroy and what we need to keep.  In some instances, the 
appropriate approach is not entirely clear.  Have you folks run across any 
"document retention policy specialists" that she ought to talk to?  We have a 
fairly detailed policy applicable to "Interstate Law" (which I guess means 
GPG law--the policy document is fairly old) but I'm less clear on what 
authority or right Legal has to enforce the doc. retention policy as to other 
groups.  Rod Hayslett suggested during Conoco that it would be good if Legal 
followed up now and then and made sure that pack rats were following the 
policy.   His comment arose from a little situation in which we were served 
with requests for "3 year plans" and Rod was displeased  to learn that some 
folks had kept old plans from 10 years ago.  He (and I suspect all of us)

Edison Charges Gas Market Manipulation

Southern California Edison filed a motion late last week with the California 
Public Utility Commission seeking emergency relief from high spot gas prices 
on which its power purchase rates are based. The company told the CPUC that 
Southern California Border (Topock, AZ) prices in the last month have risen 
by $2.50/MMBtu possibly because of market manipulation, in particular the 
withholding off of the market of pipeline transportation capacity between the 
supply basins and the California border. 

"[T]here is substantial and compelling evidence that the basis differential 
has been and continues to be grossly distorted by market power abuse, 
collusion and affiliate self dealing of out-of-state gas suppliers and 
merchants," Edison told the CPUC. 

The company noted the CPUC already has filed a Section 5 complaint with FERC 
regarding this issue and is seeking a recision of "certain allegedly 
collusive contracts which it contends have permitted out-of-state natural gas 
suppliers and their affiliates to drive up artificially California border gas 
prices by wrongfully withholding capacity." It notes the complaint 
"conservatively estimates that the anti-competitive manipulation of the basis 
differential has already damaged California gas and electricity users by $100 
million annually since the beginning of 1998." 

Edison seeks an expedited order authorizing it to use the posted gas price of 
$4.5133/MMBtu, which was applied to SCE's August 2000 avoided cost posting, 
to calculate its payment obligations to qualified power producers for the 
month of October and every month going forward. It estimated September 
bidweek border prices would average $7/MMBtu. If such prices were used in 
Edison's September avoided costs posting, its Transition Formula payments to 
certain independent power producers will be $29 million more than the month 
prior, the company told the CPUC. "No mechanism exists to recapture the 
increase in such payments if it is later determined by this commission or in 
another forum that the Topock border indices are unreliable at this time." 

Does this fit our understanding of the policies?  DF

On Conoco, I would think athat drafts of the settlement agreement -- to the 
extent there could be future disagreement over what was done/meant, etc. 
might be important.  Otherwise, with agreements that are terminated/expired, 
the retention policy is to retain them for 10 years (last time I saw a 
retention policy on contracts, that is; also, the reson behind the 10 years 
was that, although the gen'l stat. of limit. in Texas was 4 years, the stat. 
of limit, in Nebraska was, I think, 6 years, and then some additional time 
was thought to be appropriate).

For copies of contracts, no retention period is required, as I recall.  Since 
you had outside counsel, they will likely retain all the documents from the 
case itself.

--Dot

Jeff,
Is it possible for TW to get a copy of the Edison filing at the CPUC?  While 
the article [shown below] doesn't provide any details, I suspect Edison's 
complaint echoes earlier allegations against El Paso regarding their sale of 
the 1.2 Bcf/d block of capacity to their affiliate.  I don't think 
Transwestern and/or Enron affiliate marketing companies are implicated in 
this deal at all.  

Can you confirm this is an "El Paso only" problem and not something Enron is 
being drawn into?  I really appreciate your help here.

Well, I'm not sure how responsive Dot's response was to your initial 
communication, but I agree that there is a 10 year retention policy on 
contracts and agreements and their backup.  This to me would only apply to 
all of the gas purchase contracts we pulled from storage, most of which are 
probably close to the end of the 10 years.  Litigation workpapers, which to 
me would include all of the pleadings, correspondence, discovery, exhibits, 
depositions, etc., have a six year retention.  The other documents we pulled 
from storage but didn't produce, such as Mike McGowan's and Mary Kay's old 
files on take-or-pay issues, FERC orders, etc., would have different 
retention policies depending upon their content.

2 questions :

- I assume if we produced an old 3-year plan, even though it should have been 
destroyed long ago, it would now fall under the 6 year litigation workpaper 
retention policy? 

-Do you think documents from the first trial have to "start over" and be kept 
for another 6 years?

I don't know what she is even talking about.  Why does MKM have someone 
"coordinating" the migration to Windows 2000?  Doesn't the IT dept. do that, 
or has MKM taken over the IT dept?  What "issues" could we possibly have????  
Even if we had issues (which I most certainly do not, in spite of what 
everyone says) how could we possibly get the IT juggernaut to pay attention?  
We are all helpless to stop it in spite of our puny efforts to "coordinate" 
or "raise issues".    DF

Are you coordinating for legal on migrating to Windows 2000?  Mary Kay asked 
me (at her staff meeting) who was in charge for legal and I had no idea what 
she was even talking about.  Do you know anything about this?   If so, can 
you pls. coordinate with Naomi regarding possible issues that she has already 
identified.  Thanks, Maria

Here's the deal--I just talked to my guy out in Kennebec S.D. and got a 
glowing report on the situation.  His opening day group is down to 6 guys so 
he is only giving them access to half of his fields--we get first shot at the 
rest.  He's got so many pheasants he's worried about us limiting out to fast 
and getting mad.    I assured him that the way we all shoot that wouldn't be 
a problem.  
When:  Friday-Sunday, Oct. 27-29.  
Where:  Kenebec S.D.  (about 2 hours east of Rapid City, about 5 hours from 
Omaha)
$$:   $75 per guy per day if we have at least 8 guys.   If we dwindle to less 
than 8, its $100 per guy.  (he will cut us some slack on this if some of you 
can only hunt 2 days.)
Fish:  Walleye fish fry on Sat. PM included
Lodging :  Super 8 in Chamberlain--about 30 miles away if the weather is 
cold, possible camping in Kennebec if people are up for it.  Super 8 is a 
lovely place:  motto is "Labs sleep free."  $100 per night, 4 guys per room+ 
$25/head/night.

So far, I think we've got 5 or 6 guys locked in solid. Another 6 or 8 have 
been invited but are obtaining spousal consent.   I'd like to get 10 locked 
in solid by end of Sept.  More than that would make the hunting a little 
clumsy.  Bay, my wife says you can't come because your new kid is due around 
this time.  What a lame excuse!!  You were there for the first 4, right?  
Doesn't a guy deserve a bye eventually?  If you guys have anyone else that's 
interested other than the folks that have already been invited, let me know 
as we may want to invite a few more just to make sure we have around 10.  
Talk to you.  DF
  

You apparently didn't get this because my computer refuses to recognize your

call himself) that he actually held the Gen. Couns. and Marketing VP jobs 
simultaneously for 3 months so I'm still way short of matching his record.DF  
	
	

In case you haven't already marked your calendars, tomorrow will be my two 
year anniversary with the company.   The good Lord willing (and with Stan's

tracks, however, I'm not sure you guys would view that as a huge 
accomplishment.  Hope all goes well with you both.  Adios from the big O.

Check with Steve and Lorraine re: whether we should call their lawyer.  I 
don't want to call FERC except as a last resort.  Thanks. DF

   
	
	

Drew -- HH did leave me the new lawyer's name and # so let's discuss whether 
we should phone him once Howard is safely on the plane to Costa Rica.  In the 
meantime, Lorraine already asked Meaders for the cases Howard cited, but he 
said he'd have to consult with his lawyers in order to do that, so I'm sure 
the answer will be "no."  Snooping around at FERC is starting to sound like a 
good idea, but I'm in uncharted territory here so won't do any of that before 
discussing it with you.

   
	
	

Ugh.  We'll keep working this angle if their new attorney shows up on deck, 
but I think Susan and I have done as much as can be done with Howard H.  Do 
any of you know what the Red Cedar facilities look like?  I.e. how many miles 
of line, any big diameter line, any compression, etc?  Howard must have read 
some old cases and gotten himself spooked that their facilites aren't 
gathering under the modified primary function test.  I'm not sure why he 
thinks signing a transport contract with us will make their situation any 
worse, but that seems to be his conclusion.  If Steve and Bill can't nudge 
Red Cedar's management into doing the deal, I'd suggest that you both or one 
of you ask Tsuri (sp?) to have his new lawyer call me and Susan after Howard 
leaves, maybe with one of the Kinder Morgan lawyers on the phone also, and 
we'll try to straighten this out. 
	
	

I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation 
with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely 
declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to 
conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me 
like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded 
interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at 
FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very 
leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their 
identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned 
that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney 
will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad.  
Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from 
Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder 
Morgan lawyers.

Awesome!  Tell Brother Dick that we're thinking about the camping deal--he's 
macho enough to groove on that.  Bummer about your dog rule--I was looking 
forward to sneezing all night.  DF

Dick and I are in for Saturday and likely Sunday.? My guess is we'll stay 
over for the fish... fry.? And, no you cannot sleep with my dog.

I have inquiries out to two other guys.? Let me know if you get short, 
because I can scare up other prospects. 

Here's the deal--I just talked to my guy out in Kennebec S.D. and got a 
glowing report on the situation.? His opening day group is down to 6 guys 
so he is only giving them access to half of his fields--we get first shot 
at the rest.? He's got so many pheasants he's worried about us limiting out 
to fast and getting mad.??? I assured him that the way we all shoot that 
wouldn't be a problem. 
When:? Friday-Sunday, Oct. 27-29. 
Where:? Kenebec S.D.? (about 2 hours east of Rapid City, about 5 hours from 
Omaha) 
$$:?????? $75 per guy per day if we have at least 8 guys.?? If we dwindle 
to less than 8, its $100 per guy.? (he will cut us some slack on this if 
some of you can only hunt 2 days.) 
Fish:? Walleye fish fry on Sat. PM included 
Lodging :? Super 8 in Chamberlain--about 30 miles away if the weather is 
cold, possible camping in Kennebec if people are up for it.? Super 8 is a 
lovely place:? motto is "Labs sleep free."? $100 per night, 4 guys per 
room+ $25/head/night. 

So far, I think we've got 5 or 6 guys locked in solid. Another 6 or 8 have 
been invited but are obtaining spousal consent.?? I'd like to get 10 locked 
in solid by end of Sept.? More than that would make the hunting a little

Great--Texans know the difference between a dog and a bird.  Still unclear 
whether they recognize the distinction between a hen and a hun!!!  (Read 
John's email more carefully!)  Of course, at Pheasant Haven you can shoot 
both (and probably the dogs too) so the difference doesn't matter.  Kevin, 
I've been thinking about your original reqeust and may need to exercise the 
Legal Dept. veto.  These customers of yours are the same ones that can't 
drive a jet ski without paramedics around, right?  And now you want them 
wandering around Nebraska heavily armed???  What the hell are you thinking?

Tell you what, just to make sure I can tell the difference between the lab 
and the Hen, I'll bring my own Lab!  Besides, when I hunted there last, we 
couldn't shoot hens.

PS-- I have my personal duck lease down here that we can also make 
available.  There are overnight quarters if we need them.  (Last year we took 
over 600 ducks off the properties).

 We just received the renewal notice for 2000/01.  I recommended to Dave N. 
that we renew the membership.
 I will ask Rosemary to give both of you notice when she gets the approval

Drew, attached are my notes from our meeting today. The AA people provided a 
list of questions for us to review and asked us to get back with them on the 
questions. We agreed get back with them in two weeks. Also, Dan and Bob want 
to pow wow on the questions and the policy early next week. It appeared to 
Bob and me that to achieve AA's recommended objective of broadening and 
generalizing the policy along the lines of the Enron Corp policy, the best 
course of action would be to junk the existing one and start from scratch. I 
think you and I have previously agreed that the policy is too narrow. I have 
volunteered to create a new draft policy.

I am also attaching the existing draft policy with my comments.

 

Here is my suggested mark up (in bold) of Greg's paragraph.  I haven't sent 
it to him yet.  My tiering thing will follow shortly for your review.  Dari, 
please take a look and let me know if you have any heartburn about deleting 
Par. 7.   It is in the standard form OBA, but it is inconsistent with the new 
letter agreement.   DF
Drew, I will send the agreement over shortly.  I wanted you to review the
following.  I suggest inserting it as a new paragraph.

 MidAmerican and NNG understand and agree that the original November 29, 1994 
Cedar Rapids and Quad Cities Operational Balancing Agreements ("the OBA's") 
provide for volumetric resolution of imbalances and were not intended to be 
subject to the mandatory cash out provisions of NNG's Ferc Gas Tariff.  
MidAmerican and NNG further understand and agree that the Agreements, as 
clarified
herein, reflect the exclusive manner in which imbalances applicable to NNG
Station Nos.'s 54227 and 62858 will be incurred, valued and resolved.
MidAmerican and NNG acknowledge Northern has filed previously (e.g., Docket
No. RP00-404) and may file from time to time hereafter, to modify or
otherwise affect the manner in which imbalances are valued and resolved on
NNG's system.  Unless otherwise mutually agreed by written amendments to the
Agreements, MidAmerican and NNG expressly agree that any such modifications
or changes, whether approved by FERC or not, shall not modify or affect the
manner in which imbalances applicable to MidAmerican's OBA's are incurred,
valued or resolved.  Consistent with this agreement, MidAmerican and NNG 
agree that Section 7 of the OBA's is hereby deleted in its entirety.

Attached is a draft set of slides and notes for Dave Neubauer's remarks at 
the Sept. 19 FERC Technical conference.  The presentation is built around 
Dave's outline of the six elements of making pipeline capacity "tradeable" 
that he described at the last regulatory roundtable. {Look at powerpoint 
presentation in notes view to see the text}

As you'll see, we are not  advocating for specific regulatory changes in the 
presentation.   Our message is that the Commission does not need to force 
segmentation and one-size-fits-all policies to make capacity trading a 
reality.   Rather,  some minor adjustments, together with growing industry 
acceptance of capacity trading are all that is necessary to make it happen.

Dave's Other Panelists:
Altra will also be on Dave' panel and will talk about trading (most likely 
why their exchange model is superior to EOL). 
Jeff Holligan of Amoco will likely speak about the need for forced pipeline 
capacity auctions as a means to eliminate marketing affiliate concerns and 
the need for standardization to promote liquidity.  
Diane McViker of Salt River Project will talk about why pipelines should be 
willing to keep supplier records for shippers as part of the recent GISB 
cross-contract ranking 
Robert Levin of NY Mercantile Exchange will talk about factors that improve 
liquidity and whether gas markets are liquid today.
Jon Wilems of the Wisc. Distributor group will also speak about greater 
commodization of capacity to develop trading of capacity.

pls print.  thanks. dF

Drew, I thought you might be interested in being a part of this. Does this 
meeting fit your schedule?................Tony
	
	

We will meet on 9/18/00 at 2:00 pm in 4262 to discuss Risk Management Policy.

Lee, if you and your staff would like to come, please join in on the fun.

Tony has agreed to move the Policy forward to the next level.  I summarize 
some of the key information below.

The current policy is too restrictive.

We need to better define the type of transactions and who has authority to 
execute and manage. 

Do not include procedures and only discuss policy much like the Corporate 
Risk Management Policy.

Positions will be managed in a portfolio of Gas Commodity positions, however 
not all positions are included in the position limits measurement for this 
policy.  For example the pipelines are long capacity and this can be managed 
in a portfolio without a limit requirement.  Also, TW is long over-retained 
gas and this is a position which does not have to be part of our risk 
management limits.  These positions were created by building a pipeline or 
entering into transport service agreements and seperated approval guidelines 
apply.

North American Natural Gas is the only Commodity Group approved.  

Transport Service Agreements are approved in accordance with ET&S policy #1 
and #2.

Financial Risk Management Agreements are approved within the guidelines of 
this policy.  Financial Risk Management Agreements that create risk are 
allowed by the Corporate Policy but not allowed by the ET&S draft policy.  We 
need to think about limits on the creation of risk from Financial Risk 
Management agreements.

 

take a look and we'll send it to Greg.  DF

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY
CONTRACT APPROVAL FORM

Please review the attached revised non-standard discount letter to Duke 
Energy Trading & Marketing (DUKE) and the associated letter from Transwestern 
to Duke which outlines the conditions of Transwestern's Contribution in Aid 
of Construction (CIAC) payment to Duke for certain facility upgrades.

The revised discount letter eliminates the reference to actual fuel 
(calculated at 1.5% for the EOT Area) which Duke shall provide to 
Transwestern.  All fuel which Duke shall provide Transwestern shall be at the 
Tariff fuel rate.  Bob Burleson has decided not to monetize the difference 
between actual fuel and Tariff fuel (difference being only .19%) and revise 
the rate given that the current economics of the deal already provide for a 
24% rate of return (not including any fuel retainage "value added" factor).

Transwestern shall pay Duke $750,000 for Duke facility upgrades in order to 
increase gas receipts into Transwestern from Duke's Artesia plant and Big 
Eddy gathering system by an incremental 20,000 Dth/d.  Duke shall 
subsequently subscribe to a five year transportation contract for 20,000 
Dth/d of East of Thoreau  (EOT) capacity at a $.05/Dth/d one-part rate 
effective November 1, 2000.    Duke has been given alternate receipt and 
delivery rights in Transwestern's EOT Area.  Duke has also been granted the 
ability to flow to California on an alternate basis at a total rate of 
$.09/Dth/d. 

Please indicate approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.  Please contact me at x5702 
if any questions arise.

pls remind me of this.  thanks df

laptop. This will not effect those that dial in with their "home" computer. I 
need your laptop and the following information,,, RC#, last four numbers of 
your SS, and the company number. The process takes about one hour to load the 
software and test the dial-up connection. We need your info now so we can get 
the account setup, so that when you bring your laptop to me all I have to do 
is load the software and test. Have a great weekend......Steve Welch...

to SD firm, I've almost hired Lynn Jackson Schultz and LeBrun a couple of 
times and then ended up not needing them.  I think its the biggest firm in SD 
(big whoop)  and is pretty well thought of.  I went to college with a partner

This list looks much better than the other one.  Please make sure that we are 
clear with the FERC people that this is a list of AA projects related to CWIP 
and not a list of everything under the sun that AA does for us.  I want to 
avoid any appearance that we misled the FERC people.  Thanks. DF

Gary -

Revised to include SAP projects related to property.  Let me know if you have 
any changes.

Heather

Now that the celebrating has died down, lets decide whether to seek rehearing 
or clarification of the order.  If there is anything in it that disadvantages 
us, we should consider rehearing, particularly since it is a nearly certain 
that our friends at SoCal will file a nasty one. (It might be good for Steve 
H. or Bill or whoever has the best relationship with SoCal to make a high 
level courtesy call to extend the olive branch and tell them that we'll work 
with them to minimize their concerns blah blah blah.  At minimum, we'll 
probably learn if they do intend to seek rehearing)  

I see two things that may be worth seeking rehearing on:

1.  The requirement that we disclose our discount agreements in 15 days.  
FERC really punted this issue.  They say that "since the expansion capacity 
is fully subscribed we see no reason why Transwestern should not publicly 
disclose the agreements. . . . "  This is the first time I've heard of any 
rule that if your project is fully subscribed you therefore lose your right 
to confidential treatment of sensitive pricing info.  At minimum, we could 
argue that the requirement is arbitrary and capricious because FERC didn't 
even mention its normal regulations and procedures governing filing of 
discount reports.  It just cited the certificate regulation that requires an 
applicant to "file" its rate information with the Commission (which we did) 
and ignores the regulation (Sec. 284.7(c)(6)) that doesn't require a pipeline 
to publicly disclose its discounts until 15 days  after the close of the 
billing period to which the discount pertained.  The commercial people need 
to decide if we care about this issue--i.e., how upset will the customers 
with the high rates be when they learn about the low rates?    Also, Frank 
and Steve and Susan--since the order imposes a 15 day deadline on this issue, 
do we need to file for a stay first and then rehearing? 

2.  The ECS issue.  
I think we can work around this for the Gallup project, by filing a report 
describing the operational control TW has under the O & M agreement.   I've 
talked to Mark Knippa of ECS and he is running the idea by Courtney and will 
get back to me today.  My real worry is what the "operational control" 
requirement does to our future outsourcing/ monetization projects.  I think 
ECS and Hanover need to have operational control over the assets in our other 
deals (i.e., TW compressor monetization) in order for both of us to get the 
accounting treatment we need to monetize the forward revenue streams.  If we 
agree that TW will keep absolute operational control on this deal, FERC will 
use it as precedent when we come in with the TW compression deal.  Arthur 
Anderson will crap on the monetization part of that deal (which is, after 
all, the whole point of doing it) if TW retains too much control over the 
asset.  I'm not sure how to solve this yet, but lets all put some thought 
into it.  

3.  Any others???

I'll turf to MKM the question of whether we need to set up a meeting on this 
and when to chat.  DF

I heard there was an article in the WSJ a few days ago on Blockbuster and 
that mentioned the Enron deal--could you send it to me?  Thanks. dF

Drew, 

This was in today's WSJ, but I don't see anything prior to that that isn't a 
month old or more on the Blockbuster deal.  There was an announcement on the 
wires on September 6 dealing with the n-Cube technology that will be used in 
the Blockbuster deal.  Let me know if this is it!

Blockbuster hasn't enjoyed a great market reception. 

In fact, it has fared so poorly since going public 13 months ago that today 
you can pick up a share of the Dallas video-rental giant for the price of a 
video rental and a couple of late fees. 
 
  
But analysts who have promoted the stock from its initial public offering in 
August 1999 say now is a better time than ever to bet on Blockbuster. They 
say the company is poised to capitalize both on its ubiquitous stores and the 
emerging market for delivering movies over the Internet. 
"There are a lot of factors that make it incredibly attractive," says Patrick 
J. O'Hare, an analyst in Chicago with briefing.com, an online market-analysis 
firm. 

For starters, Blockbuster, with 5,000 blue-and-yellow stores in the U.S. 
alone, is the leading video retailer and one of the country's best-known 
brand names. Its stock, which closed yesterday at $9.188, looks inexpensive. 
Blockbuster is also moving beyond its storefronts. In July, Blockbuster 
signed a 20-year agreement to sell movies over the growing broadband network 
being built by Houston-based Enron. 

There's more. Mr. O'Hare notes that the company's earnings are expected to 
grow at a 20% annual clip over the next five years, while the stock trades at 
a relatively inexpensive 14 times earnings. In 2001, the company's earnings 
are projected to grow by 28%. So by one measure, Blockbuster trades for about 
half that rate. The stock also trades for less than one third of its book 
value. 

Of course, the stock price has been depressed for a long time, ever since 
majority owner Viacom sold 18% of Blockbuster in an IPO. (New York-based 
Viacom plans to distribute the rest to its shareholders, but is waiting for 
the price to rise.) Blockbuster ended its first day of trading at $15, its 
offering price. It went down from there and bottomed out at $8.88 on June 27. 

Not even a better-than-expected second-quarter financial report on Aug. 2 
helped much. The company lost 16 cents a share, compared with a 28-cent net 
loss a year earlier. Excluding losses from new-media initiatives, such as 
development of its Blockbuster.com Web site, it posted cash earnings of $24.1 
million, or 14 cents a share, which beat analysts' expectations. 

Analysts say the news will improve, with a consensus estimate that 
Blockbuster will earn 64 cents a share before charges this year. The company 
also expects its market share to reach at least 35% this year, four times 
that of its nearest competitor, Hollywood Entertainment's Hollywood Video. 

It adds up to rosy projections. Briefing.com's Mr. O'Hare says the stock 
could double in the next 12 to 18 months. Salomon Smith Barney analyst David 
Riedel in New York has a $26 target price, also in 12 to 18 months. (Mr. 
Riedel's firm was an underwriter for Blockbuster's IPO.) 

So why has the stock languished? One culprit is the new-media initiatives, 
which are obscuring the company's profits elsewhere. And, as Blockbuster 
Chief Executive John Antioco noted recently when warning that third-quarter 
revenue would be slow, there have been few recent big hits among the new 
video releases. 

Mr. Antioco also acknowledges there may be confusion over how well 
Blockbuster is mixing its traditional retail business with the advent of 
movies-on-demand and other new-media ventures. Indeed, for all Blockbuster's 
talk about new media, it doesn't yet deliver movies electronically and 
customers still can't do things like reserve movies by using Blockbuster.com. 
Thus far, customers can do little more than buy videos and digital videodisks 
on the Web site. 

"Perhaps the story may be more complicated than some people have time for," 
Mr. Antioco says. "People who buy retail stocks don't fully understand our 
story, and people who buy media stocks may not totally understand the 
transition." In the end, the company will be a mix of new media and 
traditional retailing. But until that picture becomes clearer, the result, 
Mr. Antioco says, "is the stock malaise." 

But Mr. Antioco says Blockbuster is now in an ideal position. The company has 
delivered solid earnings from its core video-store business and has struck 
potentially big deals to bring movies to consumers in their homes. 
"Blockbuster, as a pure retail play, has done what it said it's going to do," 
Mr. Antioco says. "Now we have several [new-media] plays beyond that." 

Indeed, just this year Blockbuster has entered into five deals to supplement 
its in-store rentals through showings of movies on outlets such as DirecTV, a 
unit of Hughes Electronics, El Segundo, Calif. 

The agreement with the most potential, analysts say, is the Enron deal, in 
which Blockbuster will distribute movies over the energy giant's broadband 
network to set-top boxes in consumers' homes. Mr. Antioco says Blockbuster 
will be delivering movies in a couple of markets served by Enron's network by 
the end of the year and predicts that will be just a prelude to a wider 
rollout in 2001. 

Certainly, there are potential stumbling blocks. To make the deal work, Enron 
and Blockbuster need digital-subscriber-line providers to step up enrollment 
and solve the spotty service and technical glitches that have plagued large 
numbers of users. 

"The issue for Blockbuster is going to be availability," says Mike Goodman, a 
senior analyst with Yankee Group, a market-research firm in Boston. Yankee 
projects there will be 1.45 million DSL users by the end of this year, 
increasing to about 8.4 million in 2004. 

That's a substantial number of subscribers, but it's also just a potential 
customer base for Blockbuster. Mr. Antioco says the digital future is a ways 
off -- it may be 10 years before revenue from electronic delivery of movies 
catches up with video-store revenue. 

Even the beginning of the DSL-dependent rollout will take up to a couple of 
years, according to Forrester Research of Cambridge, Mass. It says movies 
won't be delivered to more than a few markets until sometime in 2002 -- not 
2001, as Blockbuster predicts. But Mr. Antioco says agreements with the 
regional phone companies that provide DSL will bear fruit sooner and that the 
company will soon announce other partners such as a maker of the set-top 
boxes needed to order movies. 

Briefing.com's Mr. O'Hare argues that now is the time to buy because 
Blockbuster's stock could move fast once investors grasp the possibilities of 
the company's plan for multimedia distribution. 

Both Mr. O'Hare and Salomon Smith Barney's Mr. Riedel classify Blockbuster as 
particularly risky but say the company's outside-the-store initiatives should 
serve as a catalyst for the stock over the next 18 or so months. 

Mr. O'Hare says that time frame may not be compatible with investors' "notion 
of instant gratification." But, he says, "it's worth it 
in this case."

$2.5MM SAP accrual which I will use to offset the increase in the Corp 
charges for this year instead of charging to the pipelines.

$5.0 -$6.0MM I hope to be able to carry over to next year.  It depends on the 
$ some costs really come in at.  We did some things in the second quarter to 
hold income back.  I can't  really reverse this year.  If our GPG target does 
go up to $401MM, I will have a $35 MM hole at my level.

I wrote off business development projects and some other things.

The inventory deal is still up in the air.  Rod will know more tomorrow.

At this point in time, even if it happens higher, we will still have a hole.

Maybe they can try the structured products???

Tracy,

Can you tell me what the ($10.2) for Enron Pipeline Company is in the 3CE 
(primarily in Q1 & Q2)?  That seems to be creating the remaining GPG hole for 
the year.

Our officers had been counting on having more reserves to carry into 2001 to 
help fill the NNG and TW gaps.  I also heard from Bob that the inventory deal 
may still be viable at a higher amount - more like $20MM.  Do you have any 
updates on that?

Thanks,  Elaine

Some of you may have seen the article in the WSJ already, but for those of us 
in Omaha (who don't typically get the Texas Edition) it was news to us.  Not 
only is the article relevant because it apparently caused the stock to dip by 
$10, but the article elaborates on concerns that apply to a form of 
accounting that some of our commercial people would like to have apply to our 
business.  I'm not sure the accounting rules would permit mark to market 
treatment for transport or storage contracts, but it may be appropriate for 
financial or commodity deals.  DF

Energy Traders Cite Gains, But Some Math Is Missing
By Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

09/20/2000
The Wall Street Journal
Texas Journal

Volatile prices for natural gas and electricity are creating high-voltage 
earnings growth at some companies with large energy-trading units. But 
investors counting on these gains could be in for a jolt down the road. 

Shares of these companies have been on a tear lately. And some of the biggest 
players are in Houston, the center of the energy-trading industry. Dynegy 
Inc.'s stock is up more than fourfold so far this year at $53.438, and now 
trades for 41 times what analysts project the company's 2000 earnings will 
be, according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Enron Corp., the 
largest trader of gas and electricity in North America, have nearly doubled 
this year to $84.875, or 60 times earnings. Meanwhile, El Paso Energy Corp.'s 
stock has jumped 61% this year to $62.375, or 24 times earnings.

Traders at these and other companies are capitalizing on the wild price 
swings and supply fluctuations that have accompanied deregulation in some 
regional markets. Natural-gas prices have more than doubled in the past year, 
while supplies have tightened. And the rapid price fluctuations for 
electricity have prompted many large businesses to seek price protection 
through hedging or fixed-price contracts, generating large premiums for 
traders. 

But what many investors may not realize is that much of these companies' 
recent profits constitute unrealized, noncash gains. Frequently, these 
profits depend on assumptions and estimates about future market factors, the 
details of which the companies do not provide, and which time may prove 
wrong. And because of minimal disclosure standards in these kinds of cases, 
it's difficult for investors to assess whose assumptions might be too 
aggressive, or what market changes might invalidate the assumptions -- and 
force earnings revisions. 

"There could be a quality-of-earnings issue," says Tom Linsmeier, an 
associate professor of accounting at Michigan State University, who 
co-authored the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's rules on 
market-risk disclosures for financial instruments. "There certainly might be 
great volatility that could cause what now looks like a winning, locked-in 
gain to not arise sometime in the future." 

The companies reject any suggestion that there may be quality problems with 
their earnings. 

But at the heart of the situation is an accounting technique that allows 
companies to include as current earnings those profits they expect to realize 
from energy-related contracts and other derivative instruments in future 
periods, sometimes stretching over more than 20 years. 

So-called mark-to-market accounting is mandated by accounting-rule makers 
when companies have outstanding energy-related contracts on their books at 
the end of a quarter, such as agreements to sell electricity or buy natural 
gas over a period of time at certain prices. Under those rules, companies 
estimate the fair market values of those contracts on their balance sheets 
each quarter as assets or liabilities. Changes in the value of a contract 
from quarter to quarter then are either added to or subtracted from net 
earnings. 

If, for instance, the market price for natural gas rises above the price 
specified in a company's contract to buy gas, generally the company will 
record an unrealized gain. That gain is recognized as income and recorded as 
an asset on the company's balance sheet. At the end of each quarter, the 
contract is revalued. The value of the previously recorded asset is 
increased, and any increase in unrealized gain is recorded as additional 
income. Conversely, if the market value for gas falls, and the value of the 
contract has declined, any change in the contract's value is recorded on the 
company's balance sheet, and a loss is recorded on its income statement. e 

Yet in their financial reports, the companies only vaguely describe the 
methods they use to come up with fair-value estimates on the contracts. 
Increasingly, quoted market prices offering independent guidance are becoming 
readily available for several years into the future. However, with some 
long-term derivative instruments, particularly electricity contracts, future 
market prices don't extend far enough to cover the full life of those 
contracts. And in those cases, companies are allowed to base valuations on 
their own undisclosed estimates, assumptions and pricing models. 

"Ultimately they're telling you what they think the answer is, but they're 
not telling you how they got to that answer," says Stephen Campbell, an 
analyst at Business Valuation Services in Dallas. "That is essentially saying 
`trust me.'" 

Accounting-rule makers at the Financial Accounting Standards Board have 
debated the subject of how to value energy-related contracts extensively in 
recent months. "Two companies in similar circumstances might apply different 
methods to estimate the fair value of their energy-related contracts and may 
arrive at widely different values," an FASB task force studying the issue 
wrote in a June report. "Those differences lead to the question of whether 
some of the methods in practice yield estimated amounts that are not 
representative of fair value." 

Despite this concern, FASB isn't inclined to offer any explicit guidance for 
how such contracts should be valued. "There are just too many models and too 
many different types of instruments for us to have a one-size-fits-all type 
of model," explains Timothy Lucas, FASB's director of research in Norwalk, 
Conn. 

One way to determine the size of a company's unrealized gains is to compare 
the change in the values of net assets from risk-management activities from 
quarter to quarter. Some companies also disclose how much they're adjusting 
their cash-flow statements to reflect unrealized gains that have been booked 
as earnings. That's how one can determine the size of the unrealized gains at 
Dynegy and Enron, for example, the two companies confirm. 

A reporter's examination of Dynegy's financial filings shows the company's 
earnings are highly dependent on unrealized gains from risk-management 
activities. For its most recent quarter, ended June 30, Dynegy reported 
earnings of 38 cents a diluted share -- 71% of which came from unrealized 
gains, the company confirms. (The company's per-share earnings would have 
been 20 cents higher if not for a one-time stock dividend.) For all of 1999, 
Dynegy recorded $115 million in unrealized gains, accounting for 51% of its 
earnings. 

Enron confirms it booked $747 million in unrealized gains from 
risk-management activities during the second quarter, more than the company's 
total $609 million in earnings before interest and taxes. Absent unrealized 
gains, the company would have reported a quarterly loss. For the quarter, the 
company reported earnings of 34 cents a diluted share, up 26% from a year 
earlier. 

But not all companies disclose enough information for investors to calculate 
how large their unrealized gains are. El Paso says that's the case with its 
own quarterly reports, which disclose short-term assets and liabilities from 
risk-management activities -- but not long-term risk-management assets and 
liabilities. 

For the second quarter, El Paso reported that its energy marketing and 
trading unit earned $152 million before interest and taxes, 24 times what it 
earned a year earlier. In an interview, El Paso's chief financial officer, 
Brent Austin, says unrealized gains represented about a third of that total. 
He says most of the cash from those gains will materialize within a year. 

In its financial reports, Dynegy highlights the uncertainties with some 
contract valuations. It explains that with some long-term contracts for which 
market-price quotes aren't available, "the lack of long-term pricing 
liquidity requires the use of mathematical models to value these commitments 
. . . [using] historical market data to forecast future elongated pricing 
curves." Dynegy cautions that actual cash returns may "vary, either 
positively or negatively, from the results estimated." 

But like Enron, El Paso and others, Dynegy provides scant details about its 
mathematical models -- such as the assumptions they use for market volatility 
and long-term price forecasts for natural gas and electricity. Nor is the 
company required to disclose more. 

"The disclosure mentions risks," says John Cassidy, an analyst who tracks 
Dynegy for Moody's Investors Service in New York. "But I don't know that the 
disclosure offers enough detail for you to be able to quantify how much risk 
there is." 

El Paso's filings warn that "because the valuation of these financial 
instruments can involve estimates, changes in the assumptions underlying 
these estimates can occur, changing our valuation and potentially resulting 
in financial losses." Enron cautions that the values it assigns to various 
transactions are based on "management's best estimate." 

The companies are required to disclose what they think their maximum 
potential single-day risk-management losses might be, figures that also are 
based on various undisclosed market assumptions. But energy traders cite 
competitive reasons for not disclosing more. 

"You don't necessarily want to tip off everyone to what you're doing," says 
John Harrison, chief financial officer for El Paso's merchant-energy unit. 

Echoing remarks by executives at other energy traders, Enron's executive vice 
president and chief accounting officer, Richard Causey, says Enron runs a 
relatively balanced portfolio and that the estimates factored into his 
company's valuations are conservative. In large part, he says, those 
estimates are based on quoted market prices where available. Where they're 
not available, Mr. Causey says Enron bases its estimates in part on long-term 
pricing trends, as well as the company's own trading experience, which dates 
to 1990. 

Further, Mr. Causey says, Enron's unrealized gains don't depend heavily on 
gains from long-term contracts that extend beyond the periods for which 
market quotes are available, reducing the potential for significant earnings 
revisions. The average length of Enron's risk-management contracts is just 
two years, he says. To be sure, though, some of Enron's electricity contracts 
extend for 25 years. 

"We're getting the cash in quicker than you might think," Mr. Causey says. 
"They don't stay unrealized very long." 

El Paso says its contracts have an average life of six years, with some 
running as long as 20 years. Dynegy says the longest risk-management 
contracts for which it uses mark-to-market accounting are 10 years, though it 
doesn't disclose an average length. Dynegy's chief financial officer, Robert 
Doty, says 96% of the company's gas contracts close out by 2002, while 75% of 
its power contracts expire by 2003. "The cash will come in," he says. 

As for why the company doesn't disclose the extent of any bias, bullish or 
bearish, it has in the market, Dynegy executives say that information, like 
the estimates behind its mathematical models, is proprietary. Such 
disclosures may be outdated anyway by the time they could be included in 
public financial filings, says Michael Mott, a Dynegy vice president. Mr. 
Mott further explains that Dynegy could be realizing more cash earnings now 
if it wanted to. But "we don't see that would be in the best interests of 
shareholders," Mr. Mott says, because the company figures it can earn more 
later by leaving much of its gains unrealized for now. 

Mr. Linsmeier of Michigan State compares the current situation for energy 
traders with the accounting controversies that engulfed subprime automobile 
and residential lenders during the late 1990s, though he emphasizes it's too 
far early to tell whether the consequences will be similar. Using so-called 
gain-on-sale accounting (a form of mark-to-market accounting), those lenders 
booked earnings from loans as soon as they were made, rather than having to 
wait for them to be paid off, as banks typically do. 

But as interest rates fell in 1998, many customers paid off their loans 
earlier than expected, slashing lenders' profit margins. Compounding matters, 
the market for mortgage-backed securities dried up in the wake of financial 
chaos in Russia and other foreign markets, leaving lenders to bear the higher 
risks of many new loans. 

Many investors complained they were blindsided, in part because these lenders 
generally hadn't disclosed their assumptions about prepayment rates and other 
variables. After the crash, subprime lenders routinely began disclosing the 
key assumptions used to value their mortgage portfolios. 

At New York University, accounting professor Baruch Lev says investors would 
be better served if energy traders' financial filings explained the effects 
of hypothetical commodity-price movements on the values of their 
risk-management assets, and disclosed the basic assumptions about future 
commodity-price movements ingrained in their mathematical models. Says Mr. 
Lev, "I would like to see much more disclosure, particularly given that this 
is now becoming a significant component of their earnings."

I've redlined the outline to address what I believe is the most important 
risk you guys will face out there:  the risk that FERC will listen to your 
presentation and conclude that the embedded optionality that some pipelines 
are currently offering in transport contracts is a negotiated term and 
condition and therefore must be stopped.  I think we need to tailor the 
presentation and filing to minimize the chance that FERC will take away 
flexibility we think we now have (i.e., the flexibility to embed shipper puts 
in transport contracts).   Even if the TW approach on unbundled options goes 
nowhere, several of the strategies we may want to implement next year depend 
on continued ability to sell embedded options.   Susan, Shelley,a nd MKM, I 
still think it is a good idea to push this proposal, but am concerned that 
FERC might squirrel and go the opposite direction we are trying to push 
them.  Your thoughts?  DF

Nancy, I've prepared the attached outline in response to FERC Staff's request 
that we provide "something in writing."  This is basically just a description 
of our proposal.  I've tried to keep it brief so that staff members are not 
reading while we're trying to talk to them.  It should be enough information 
to raise a lot of questions.

Please wait until Shelley or I give you the go-ahead to pass this along to 
the relevant Commission people; I'd like to give the other addressees the 
opportunity to comment on this to the extent possible.  

Everyone else:  please give me your comments ASAP as Nancy has been asked to 
provide something to them tomorrow.

the bid/asked spread narrows as you go out in time also--weird.  I'll come 
down and grab you guys in a minute as I have a few questions.  Thanks.  DF 

   
	
	

Why the drop in prices in '02?  Did the person who gave you the quotes 
explain that?  That is a surprise to me......

The Market Services bullets listed a capacity release deal between MUD and 
Oxy at 102% of max. rates.  Please let me know whatever we know about that 
deal--points, term, etc.  Very interesting.  DF

Thanks for the prompt info!!  I hope we can help this guy get his power plant 
built.  DF

   
	
	

I was not able to get the bid offer spread but I was able to get the mid 
market for 8 years out:

2003           50.25
2004           43.5
2005            43.5
2006             43.50
2007             43.65
2008            44.25
2009             45
2010             45.75

I also checked with my buddy about why the value of Pale Verde value tails 
off in the out years.   He says it is because a large part of there power 
supply is generated by hydro plants and part of the spike this year was 
created by the lack of moisture this past winter.

Sorry, just got back from Houston and my duties require me to be in the big O 
for a few days.  Enerson and I were just talking about you on Friday--I'm 
forwarding this to him so he can take you out and feed you.  Hope all goes 
well.  Give me a ring if you have a few minutes and I'll give you the update 
on what's going on up here (dial 87-7449 in case you've forgotten how to dial 
us from world headquarters).  DF

John, great to hear that you are still doing the Lord's work on this case!

We argued the Bath appeal in the Second Circuit last Friday.  Bath's
counsel went first for 10 minutes; I was second for 8 minutes; Alan Knauf
was next for CREST for 2 minutes; David Connors took 2 minutes for TPC; and
Bath's counsel took the final 2 minutes for rebuttal.  The panel took the
matter under advisement when the argument was finished.

The panel was Judge Jacobs (who was on the recent Primetime 24 Joint
Venture case dealing with the "access barring" sham exception to Noerr-
Pennington), Judge Straub and Judge Sacks.  All three are from private
practice with large firms.

The argument went reasonably well, although the panel played it pretty
close to the vest.  Bath's counsel was not brilliant and received a lot of
hard questions from the bench.  The panel seemed to have no trouble with
the fact that the District Court reviewed the administrative record in
addition to the allegations in Bath's complaint.  They got close to getting
a concession from Bath's counsel that the complaint alleges damages from
long delays in the administrative process, which necessarily puts at issue
the overall course of the agency proceedings and requires the judge to
review the record.

The panel also seemed uninterested in Bath's argument that Noerr-Pennington
immunity only applies to antitrust cases.  The panel recognized that the
First Amendment protections must apply to all types of causes of action.

The biggest issue for the panel appeared to be the "fraud" sham exception
to Noerr-Pennington.  During argument, Bath's counsel suggested that, if
only he had discovery, he would be able to prove that MHP's experts had
"doctored" the geological data as part of submitting their fraudulent
affidavits.  I countered that this was the first we had ever heard of such
allegations, that they were never part of Bath's complaint, and that the
only allegation was that the expert's "opinions" were wrong and without
basis.

The court came back to the question of what to do if a party claims that
there has been clear fraud committed during the agency proceeding.  I
argued, and Judge Straub agreed, that such fraud is only relevant under the
case law if it goes to the very core of the proceeding and deprives it of
its legitimacy.  The district court's opinion establishes that noting like
that occurred here.

Finally, both I and David Connors argued that the lower court's alternative
proximate cause ruling was independently fatal to Bath's complaint, in that
the alleged "fraud", even if it had occurred, did not cause any of Bath's
alleged damages.

Please call me (202-719-7038) if you would like further details regarding
the argument.  Otherwise, we will just have to wait for the decision.

Here's the form Tana sent me. Let's look at it and finalize an intra-company 
contract between NNG and TW.
Per our conv., attached is form of master.

the former--an extension of the 15 day deadline on disclosing the prices 

   
	
	

I'm confused -- are we asking for an extension of time to comply with the 
Commission's conditions, or an extension of time to file a motion for 
rehearing?  

Eric, I think it would be good for you to join us for this meeting.  We're 
following up on some concerns that arose during the Conoco case about 
inadequate compliance with Enron document retention policies.  I'm not sure 
that this subject is within your turf down there, but your historical 
experience may be useful.      
	
	

Great!!  Here's my question--what responsibility does the legal department 
have to publicize/enforce the Enron document retention policy in other 
departments?  If it isn't our responsibility, whose is it?  I'm concerned 
based on our experience in the Conoco case that most departments 
(occasionally including law) simply ignore the policy.  

I think this subject matter is so interesting that I'm asking the regulatory, 
marketing, and market services departments to send a designated 
representative to attend.   Mary Kay and Julia--please have someone on your 
staff whose responsibility includes managing your inventory of paper join us 
in the VCRs on Oct 10 at 1:30.  We'll be reviewing the Enron document 
retention policies and how to improve our compliance within NN and TW.  
Julia, for your group Rick or someone in his group would probably be best.  
MKM, I'm not sure who is the best person from your group.  Steve, I suspect 
you are the right guy from marketing mostly because you've got more 
experience in the regulatory/legal discovery area than most of your 
colleagues down there.  Sorry. If each of the Marketing, Mkt Services, and 
Regulatory representatives could bring what they believe is the current 
document retention policy/schedule for your group, that would be helpful.   
Thanks.  DF

Yes, it's only one week away!  A riveting and thought-provoking discussion on 
document retention!  (Drew's staff meeting on October 10th)   Please submit 
your questions early so that Colleen and I can provide a thorough answer at 
the meeting.

(Seriously, if there's anything specific you would like to know or if you 
have any questions about document retention, let Colleen or me know.  Thanks!)

Great to hear from you!  I'll forward this to the smart guys and see if they 
have any interest.  Let me know which pipes you'll interconnect with and 
we'll have a better sense of who else in the organization might be 
interested.  Kent and Morgan, when we get Tony's response on the 
interconnects, can you think it through from Florida's perspective also?  
Thanks.  DF

 Stan is now the president of Northern.  Dari, have you seen any changes to 
the org. charts etc. to reflect this?  DF  

   
	
	

Question:
Under the Standards of Conduct for Northern, Section III ("Merchant 
Function"), Paragraph 284.286(a), last sentence reads "The Pipeline Sales 
Division reports to the President of Northern."  We all know that this is now 
Dan McCarty.  However, whereas Bill Cordes' title was 'President', every 
announcement about Dan refers to him as 'Managing Director and Chief 
Commercial Officer for ETS'.  Does the word "president" exist anywhere in 
Dan's job description so as to make this sentence imply the presidency role 
rather than inferring it?

In order to reduce net O&M by $7.9MM on NNG and $3.8MM on TW, I propose the 
following additions to overhead.  Per Rod, we will leave Gross O&M where it 
is and increase the overhead allocations.  These dollars will be added to the 
Capital Budget via an increased overhead rate.  Once finalized, I will 
calculate the new overhead rate and send it to you so we can add these 
dollars to the construction projects.

Please review this proposal and let me know by Friday if we need to make 
adjustments.  There is still a hole of $1.2MM on TW that we need to fill in 
order to cover the Environmental Remediation/PCB costs without reducing them.

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE COMPANY
CONTRACT APPROVAL FORM

Please review the attached standard discount letter to Agave Energy Company 
(Agave).  The discount letter provides Agave a $.05/Dth/d one-part rate for 
10,000 Dth/d of East of Thoreau capacity beginning 3/1/2001.  Alternate 
receipt and delivery rights have been granted for the East of Thoreau Area 
only.

Please reply via REPLY WITH HISTORY.

I agree with your concern but I've gotten comfortable that the pleading does 
a good job of finessing the issue.  Technically, you are right and PNM's 
service is neither "firm" or "interruptible."  It is my understanding that 
PNM  assigns priority based on a number of factors including whether the 
customer is a core customer or not, et cet.  I think that PNM is capable of 
determining on a contract by contract basis whether the capacity will be 
firm, even though the rate schedule may not say "firm."   Explaining all that 
complexity would make it unlikely that FERC would approve the rehearing.  
Nevertheless, I believe its accurate to say that we will only repackage as 
firm service the capacity that we buy from PNM and that they tell us is 
"firm."  I think the draft does that, without going throught the unhelpful 
detail on how PNM handles its own priority system.  If I misunderstand the 
facts or if anyone disagrees with this approach, lets talk about it.  DF  

   
	
	

I have a concern with this overall argument about firm and interrupitble as 
we stated we would only buy firm service from PNM, but moreso, when we looked 
at the detail of the PNM service when preparing for the technical conference, 
it is only best efforts-  does this argument fit?  and can we really buy firm 
service from them??  MK

I don't see any immediate problem.  As long as the advertising didn't 
interfere with the effectiveness and efficiency of Hot Tap as a tool for 
satisfying our posting and notice obligations, FERC shouldn't care.  The 
revenue would be nonjurisdictional and would be treated as such in Northern's 
or TW's next rate case.  As to the "type of advertising," I can't think of a 
legal or regulatory reason we need to be picky, but we may want to exclude 
certain types of services that seem to rely heavily on internet advertising 
if you know what I mean.  DF

Steve Hotte
10/18/2000 01:06 PM
Shelly/Drew,

We  get quite a bit of customer activity on our Hot Tap internet site.  Do 
you think there would be any legal or regulatory restriction on us offering 
advertising on that site.  We can be selective on the type of advertising, 
but would obviously want to choose a vendor that would benefit from exposure 
to the Hot Tap audience. 

The revenue from such an idea varies.  If it passes the legal and regulatory 
test I will look into potential customers and firm up some figures.

Thanks,
Steve

As Enron continues to tackle communication issues and address employee 
feedback, we are in the process of implementing a decision-making/problem 
solving tool throughout the organization.  This tool is called Participation 
& Dissent (P&D).  This process is aimed at:

- Bringing the right people together
- Speeding up decisions
- Acting on the suggestions of employees 
- Fostering channels of communication so that employees can speak their minds 
openly 
AND 
- Delivering business results at the same time!  

To ensure that P&D sessions remain productive and timely, each session is led 
by a facilitator.  Throughout the Enron organization, heads of business units 
have identified top rated, high performing individuals to serve as 
facilitators for all of Enron.  

For ETS, the following individuals have been identified for this 
developmental opportunity:

John Dushinske
Don Hawkins
John Keller
Sue Neville
David Odneal
Colleen Raker
Bob Hill
Shelley Corman
Mary Kay Miller
Drew Fossum
Wilson Barbee
Janet Place

To ensure that the facilitators are comfortable with the P&D process, they 
will be asked to participate in a training session in early November.  
Two dates have been established for facilitator training:

Thursday - November 2,  2000 - At the Woodlands - 8:00 am to 5:30pm
or
Monday   - November 13, 2000 - At the Woodlands - 8:00 am to 5:30pm

You can select either of these dates to fit your schedule. This assumes we 
will be able to get a reasonable sized group for each of the two days.  The 
training will be one day long.  Cheryl Austin Brown and Howard Morgan of 
Keilty, Goldsmith & Company (the people who conduct the Executive Impact & 
Influence Program) will be conducting the program. 

Please have someone from your office contact my administrative assistant,  
Debbie Nowak either by email or telephone (713)853-3304 and let her know your 
availability for these dates.

Please feel free to contact me directly at Ext. 33972 and I will be happy to 
brief you on the status of the effort.

           Dick Amabile

I think the safest and most efficient way to comply with this request is to 
have Keith and Ray briefed and ready to answer all FERC's questions without 
deferring any to other people.  Ray and Keith, please talk to Gary Zahn and 
make sure you are up to speed on everything FERC has asked for and focused on 
so far.  You don't need to be an expert on all that, but a basic 
understanding of what they have already looked at will help you be more 
responsive to what they want to ask you about.  If you do get stumped, try to 
defer the question by telling FERC you need to check on a fact or two and can 
answer that question after a break or at the end of the interview.  By doing 
that , you should be able to get them the information they need without 
having them cross examine a bunch of other people.  Inevitably, if you ask 
enough people the same question, you may start getting different answers.  
Lee, I'd like you to be on the phone call with Ray, Keith and Gary to discuss 
generally what to be ready for and what FERC has already looked at.  Please 
let me know if anyone has any concerns about this approach.  DF

FYI
PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
ATTORNEY/CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Lee:

Since we spoke last night I have talked to Ted.  We all come out the same
way, I think, that this episode is probably best left alone.

First, unless Kim has information to the contrary, I think we would have a
hard time establishing that the only way the alleged "failed" Enron system
became known to PROS was via the PROS/ET&S relationship.  If it could have
become known independently via a source not protected by a nondisclosure
agreement, then we have no real complaint.

Second, if the statement in the Gas Daily is actually true, then we have no
axe to grind about defamation or related issues.

It is unfortunate that a casual reader might think that the statement
actually refers to a failure in the PROS/ET&S RM work rather than to a
failure in the prior Enron capacity management project.  Perhaps we are more
sensitive than most, however, knowing what we know.  I would guess that
there are probably a lot of readers out there who are unaware of the ET&S RM
project and thus would not know to mistakenly attribute the statement to the
ET&S RM project.

Further, the mistake that a casual reader might make might also be
attributable to sloppy journalism as much to what McCracken at PROS may have
actually said.

Finally, the longer we do not hear from PROS, the more their "case" weakens
in the future complaining about the genealogy of our RM product.

In summary, probably best left alone.  But I do recommend that we continue
to monitor for this stuff.  It appears the PROS RM products are now
available and we can only guess what Enron information is inside them to
make them work, or was used to sell them or make them work.

Excellent idea!!  There is ample opportunity for all three of us in the hot 
air business.  I talked to Dave yesterday and I think this is a great fit for 
him.  He's back to doing what he does best--convincing investors and 
customers to pour money into a hole in the ground!  

I was in Houston Wednesday and got a chance to catch up a little with the 
hooker&cooker tandem.  You may know that David has started into a new venture 
selling either compressed air or energy from compressed air (he's not sure 
which yet).  We agreed that his only concern is that you might want to enter 
the market because with all your hot air, the market would be saturated!

MidAm advised us they intend to call the enforcement hotline, probably today, 
to get enforcement staff involved in resolving the Carlton timing problem 
(i.e., the absence of an order approving or not approving the settlement).  
If Midam does so, Enforcement will then contact Northern for a 
response--probably Dari or MKM or I, but who knows who they'll call.
If they do, the following bullets are important to convey as our preliminary 
response to MidAm:

1.  Midam, and all of our customers, are aware that a Commission order on the 
June 2, 2000 Settlement is necessary before the precise flow obligation for 
this Nov-March period can be determined.  The flow obligation for sourcers 
like MidAm will be slightly higher--by about 3%--if the settlement is 
approved.  For all customers that have asked what the precise flow obligation 
numbers would be under the two scenarios, settlement approval or settlement 
non-approval, we have given that information.  We gave that information to 
MidAm also.  We can't file the tariff sheets setting out the specific number 
for this heating season until the Commission addresses the settlement.

2.  The true financial impact of the current uncertainty on MidAm is 
minimal.  We believe many of the sourcers have locked in their supply based 
on the lower flow obligation number, but with an option to increase their 
purchase quantity if the Commission approves the settlement.  MidAm may have 
done that, but we don't know.  If not, and if the Commission approves the 
Settlement, their only real "cost" would arise if they have to buy the 
additional flow obligation volume--about 1100 MMBtu/d for MidAm--now at a 
higher price than they would have paid if they bought it earlier when they 
locked up the bulk of their flow obligation supply.    Given the large drop 
in gas prices the last several days, there may not be any increased cost.   

3.  The bottom line is that we really need an order on the Settlement.  The 
majority of Northern's customers support it as a fair solution to the Carlton 
problem.  MidAm is the only opponent that has raised substantive issues.  
MidAm is clinging to a financial windfall it gets under the old Carlton 
mechanism and has no reason to oppose the settlement other than preserving 
that windfall.    

That's the end of the proposed script.  The last bullet may go to far, but I 
like it.  Frank and Steve, MKM suggested that you guys get Doering and Gorak 
and others to call FERC (hotline or otherwise--I don't think it matters) and 
express their concern that the order is not on the agenda.  DF  

As soon as I know, you'll know.  DF

Kevin Hyatt
10/24/2000 02:14 PM
My thoughts are this:
 those plants under development (i.e. past the planning stages and into 
permitting or construction) will continue to move forward.  Their fuel costs 
are most likely already locked in or there is a pass thru mechanism to the 
power buyer.  

It is really only the near term gas prices that are high in this 
backward-dated market.  The 10 year gas price curve is still relatively 
inexpensive.  Those power plant projects in early planning stages or those 
with higher merchant risk will likely be delayed but that depends on where in 
No. Americal they are located.  Those plants slated for severely constrained 
NERC territories will probably continue to move forward, as evidenced by 
recent announcements for new plants in the MAIN and WSCC regions.

just my thoughts, you get what you pay for.

When we originally decided to use my staff meetings for "graduate education" 
one of the hot topics was the electric industry.  We all had a first lesson 
on this topic in Shelley's electricity seminar last summer.  Now, John and 
Kevin have graciously agreed to join us Tuesday at 1:30 to discuss recent 
developments in electric markets and NN's and TW's efforts to attract power 
generation load to the system.  Specific topics I hope to cover include the 
following:
1.  What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer 
puts his plant?  
2.  Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various 
utilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much 
the same all over? 
3.  How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy 
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc.  
separately)?
4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care? 
5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?
 Depending on how deeply we get into these topics, we may need to schedule a 
follow-up session at a later date.  I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.

to our Errors in Billing tariff provision, I was torn between backing up my

mistake"), but figured they would ask for the tariff provision so I included 
it.  Also, Elsa really attacks us for not billing them previously so I

A MEMO FROM DICK AMABILE

Thanks for enrolling in the upcoming P&D Facilitation training.  In order to 
make the best use of our limited time at the meeting I am attaching a copy of 
the "draft" material which will appear on the Intranet Site regarding P&D 
(Participation & Dissent).   The intent is for you to review the material 
before the session to gain some insight into what P&D is all about.  This 
will save us the time of having to review this material at the session and 
allow us to focus specifically on facilitation skills for the P&D process.  
We apologize for the somewhat disjointed format.  At the moment it is the 
only complete draft that is available, albeit in pieces.  I suggest you start 
with the last one listed below P&D Site maps.ppt and then progress through 
them in order 1,2,3,4,5.

P&D  was develop as a response to three of the 5 core ETC (Now known as the 
Pulse) questions identified by Enron for improvement. They are: 

  Most employees feel free to voice their opinions openly 
  My operating company does a good job acting on suggestions of employees
  Employees are encourage to challenge established 
procedures/policies/guidelines

Participation & Dissent know as "P&D" is an unique Enron created tool that is 
designed to provide our employees with a creative, free wheeling, 
non-bureaucratic vehicle for solving problems, addressing issues, enhancing 
decision making and developing new business ideas/opportunities.   One 
purpose of "P&D" is to create an atmosphere where employees can feel real 
ownership for decisions and express their views in a challenging and 
passionate way. "P&D" sessions are meant to focus on results and assist in 
producing measurable performance improvements.  "P&D" sessions are to assist 
our employees in driving change in an organized, efficient and effective 
manner.  It will help us leverage off our own best practices to produce 
faster results that positively impact our return on invested capital. At 
Enron we give our employees the power to dissent and with that power comes 
the obligation to participate in providing solutions/ideas. 

If you have any questions about this material, please feel free to contact 
Kirk McDaniel or myself.  We will be happy to answer your questions and 
provide additional context for the effort.

The only other thing we would like you to do prior to attending the session 
is to identify a potential P&D intervention within your own organization.  
This will provide you with a "real" effort to begin planning for at the 
session and make the application of the ideas directly actionable for you.

We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.
            Dick Amabile

To synthesize what I'm hearing from you and MKM (and Mr. Ni),  our story is 
that we will post for sale an option with a specific MDQ, type (i.e., 
European option or American or whatever), flow period, and points.  For 
example, we'd post  a European call on 10,000/d of Nov. 01--March 02 Permian 
to Topock firm capacity with an exercise date of Jan 1, 2001.  the customer 
would bid an option price and a transport rate.  We'd look at both components 
under a publicly posted evaluation method to decide who wins.  I.e., we may 
post a method saying the winner is the one who pays the highest option fee so 
long as the transport rate bid is above "x".   Seems pretty straightforward, 
and we ought to be able to clarify this adequately in our answer to 
protests.  DF

In our pre-filing discussion, we explained the awarding of call options as 
follows:

Because call options are only sold after we have tried to sell the underlying 
capacity and there were no takers at max. rate or an acceptable price, there 
is really only 1 variable -- the total rate (consisting of the option 
component and the strike price).

The call option is posted for a specific quantity, start date, etc.  There 
are no other variables.  It's just price.

From our discussions with Mike Coleman and crew on this topic -- I think is 
it absolutely key that we keep the award variables to a minimum.  My take is 
that the transmittal letter referring to highest price is the right way to 
go.  The concept in the tariff about posting the evaluation criteria 
(implying that there are more variables) could kill the deal.

Steve Anderton called today and has cleared the arbitration with his firm's 
conflict committee.  He's sending an email tomorrow describing the specific 
results of his conflict check.  I'll forward it to you both for review.  From 
my discussions with Steve, I think he'd do a great job as our arbitrator.  
Are we all in agreement on using Steve or are there some other competing 
candidates?  Do you guys want to talk to him or meet with him first?  Britt, 
do we need a retention agreement with Steve if we decide to use him?   A 
self-serving retention agreement may be a good idea if we think OneOk might 
challenge our arbitrator based on alleged bias.  Also, if we are good to go 
with Steve, I'd like to send him a package of the key documents and then meet 
with him to discuss the case sometime in the next week or two.  Britt, any 
concerns with my doing that as long as I don't send him anything privileged?  
(I'm assuming for the sake of safety that the attorney client privilege 
doesn't apply to our communications with our arbitrator unless instructed 
otherwise).  He is down in Houston two days a week so we could do it there.

I consulted with Kevin before I took the oars in trying to answer your 
question, as well as the questions raised in Drew's e-mail.  Here's what we 
found out...

Steve's question:

What economics would determine if a developer could site a power plant in New 
Mexico (maybe 3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us 
expanding to deliver the gas to a power plant in California?

What you're really asking here is "What are the comparative economics of 
energy delivered by wire versus energy delivered by pipeline?"  In this 
analysis, there are a few considerations -- (1) original capital cost to 
construct facilities, (2) the operating cost of the facilities, including 
energy loss, and (3) environmental and other permitting considerations. 

 Engineers tell us that, as a rule of thumb, high voltage transmission lines 
and tower facilities cost approximately $800,000 to $1MM/mile to construct 
turnkey.  This figure is comparable to the $1MM/mile "rule of thumb" we use 
for turnkey construction of mainline diameter (30-36") high-pressure steel 
pipeline.  

In terms of operating costs, for anything over 100 miles in length, there are 
three (3) basic sources of energy loss in electric transmission: (1) 
transformation loss, (2) radiation loss (EFM) and (3) heat loss across the 
conductors.  A rule of thumb for electric transmission loss is 3%.  This 
number is comparable to the actual fuel used for compression on 
Transwestern's pipeline.   

The most critical issue impacting construction of high voltage transmission 
lines is in the area of permitting.  There just aren't many new transmission 
lines being approved.  It was suggested by more than one source that an 
electric transmission project on the order posited in your example, could 
take anywhere from 6 to 10 years to secure authorization.  The issues of 
electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation around high voltage power lines, along 
with other wildlife endangerment concerns, are significant obstacles in 
securing permits for right-of-way.

In short, the answer is that while the economics on face appear to be 
comparable for construction and operation of both natural gas pipelines and 
electric transmission lines, the protracted permitting process for electric 
transmission lines tips the scale considerably towards the more immediate 
returns available on investment in natural gas pipeline infrastructure.

Drew's questions:

1. What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer puts 
his plant?

For purposes of this exercise, I'm assuming we're talking gas-fired 
generation.  Developers generally describe four considerations in deciding 
where to site a new electric power plant:
 1. Market area demand (distributive) and/or Transmission access to market
 2. Water rights for turbine cooling
 3. Ease of permitting (environmental, encroachment, fed/state/local 
regulations, affected agencies/jurisdiction)
 4. Proximity to natural gas pipeline/supply infrastructure  

2. Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various 
utilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much 
the same all over?

FERC Order 888 and 889 require public utilities to commit to standards of 
conduct and to file open access tariffs affecting transmission among and 
between other utilities and/or power pools in the various operating regions.  
FERC ordered public utility transmission owners to provide transmission 
access and comparable service to competitors and to functionally separate 
their transmission/reliability functions from their wholesale merchant 
functions. The rulemaking is analogous to the open access requirements under 
FERC Order 436/500/636 affecting interstate natural gas pipelines.  It's 
pretty obvious from the California example this past summer, that with 
respect to the overall operation of a deregulated power market in individual 
states, particularly as concerns the establishment and regulation of 
Independent System Operators (ISO's), there is substantial room for 
improvement (and possible further FERC involvement).
 
"In the open access final rule (Order No. 888), the Commission issues a 
single pro forma tariff describing the minimum terms and conditions of 
service to bring about this nondiscriminatory open access transmission 
service.  All public utilities that own, control, or operate interstate 
transmission facilities are required to offer service to others under the pro 
forma tariff.  They must also use the pro forma tariffs for their own 
wholesale energy sales and purchases.  Order No. 888 also provides for the 
full recovery of stranded costs--that is, costs that were prudently incurred 
to serve power customers and that could go unrecovered if these customers use 
open access to move to another supplier."  

3.  How do IPP's decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy 
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc. 
separately)?

In my experience, there is no "one size fits all" formula or strategy.  For 
example, in the past we've seen Calpine take a very hands-on approach to 
supplying its IPP projects.  In the mid to late '80's, during the build out 
of several QF's (cogens), Calpine bought natural gas reserves in the ground 
and dedicated them to the project.  In today's market, Calpine has scavenged 
the gas and basis traders from Statoil and set-up a natural gas desk for the 
purchase and transportation management of gas supplies needed for its western 
U.S. power projects.  In other projects, developer/owners and their lenders 
are satisfied with a less active role in securing gas supply/transportation 
to the project.  In short, projects look at the liquidity of the gas supply/ 
transportation market in deciding whether they can achieve project economics 
and secure reliable supply by taking bids or RFP's for gas 
supply/transportation, or whether to take a more hands-on approach ala 
Calpine.

4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care?

Last December, the FERC issued Order No. 2000, a final rule on Regional 
Transmission Organizations (RTO's).  Order 2000 builds on the foundation of 
Orders 888 and 889 (issued in 1996).  According to FERC Chairman Jim Hoecker, 
Order 2000 makes "a persuasive case for separating control of grid operations 
from the influence of electricity market participants."  Therefore, Order 
2000 can be seen as a natural outgrowth of the perceived limitations on the 
functional unbundling adopted in Orders 888 and 889, continuing balkanization 
of the electric transmission grid based on corporate, not state or regional 
boundaries, as well as pressure to provide guidance on acceptable forms of 
privately-owned transmission companies.  

FERC prescribes a voluntary approach to RTO participation.  The order 
initiates a regional collaborative process to foster RTO formation.  The 
Order also imposes filing requirements on the privately owned "public 
utilities" that are subject to FERC jurisdiction, and requires these private 
utilities to describe in their filings how they have attempted to accommodate 
the needs of transmission owning state/municipal, cooperative and federally 
owned systems.  FERC believes that, regardless of format, RTO's will offer 
the following benefits: (1) alleviate stress on the bulk power system caused 
by structural changes in the industry, (2) improve efficiencies in 
transmission grid management through better pricing and congestion 
management, (3) improve grid reliability, (4) remove remaining opportunities 
for discriminatory practices, (5) improve market performance, (6) increase 
coordination among state regulatory agencies, (7) cut transaction costs, (8) 
facilitate the success of state retail access programs, and (9) facilitate 
lighter-handed regulation. 

Critics point out that with its emphasis on flexibility, voluntary RTO 
formation and transmission rate reforms (i.e., incentives), Order 2000 defers 
for case-specific disposition many of the tough issues that must be resolved 
in order to create an operational RTO.   Moreover, Order 2000 does not compel 
any transmission owner to join an RTO, but provides only regulatory guidance 
and incentives for willing participants, as well as a veiled threat of 
further consequences for the hold-outs. 

As to the final part of the question ("why should we care?"), presumably, the 
development of a fully-functioning RTO network will promote both the 
efficiency and market transparency goals of the original FERC orders.  As 
FERC reads it, the future of gas-fired generation for both merchant and 
utility systems, depends on an efficiently operated open access transmission 
system.  Therefore, the promise of the RTO is to stimulate competition and 
the ongoing investment in new generation infrastructure.  Unfortunately, 
sources tell me that the voluntary nature of the RTO program may ultimately 
cripple its effectiveness in meeting its stated goals.  

5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?

Natural gas prices of $5/MMBtu can only "kill" gas-fired power plants in 
those instances where (1) there are more economical alternatives to natural 
gas fuel, (2) demand for electric power is offset through demand side 
management or (3) natural gas in an environment of short supply is expressly 
prohibited from use as a power plant fuel.  In the Western U.S. marketplace, 
particularly in California, I see no viable alternative to natural gas fuel 
for electric power generation.  Renewable resources currently meet less than 
5% of the total electric resource requirements.  $32/barrel oil prices give 
fuel oil no clear economic advantage over natural gas (even at a $5/MMBtu 
price).  Moreover, California environmental and permitting regulations make 
the installation of new electric generation based on anything other than 
natural gas fuel or renewable resources virtually impossible.   While demand 
side management programs are the politically correct approach to meeting 
resource needs, historically, they have served only a minor role in 
offsetting the growth in electric power.  As to the final point, I'm unable 
to comment on the risk of future legal/regulatory restrictions governing the 
use of natural gas as a boiler or turbine fuel.

Since you are the "expert" in this area, I need to know what economics would 
determine if a developer could site a power plant in New Mexico (maybe 
3,000MW) and build a line to the grid in California versus us expanding to 
deliver the gas to a power plant in California. If you could let me know by 
next Friday I would appreciate it.

When we originally decided to use my staff meetings for "graduate education" 
one of the hot topics was the electric industry.  We all had a first lesson 
on this topic in Shelley's electricity seminar last summer.  Now, John and 
Kevin have graciously agreed to join us Tuesday at 1:30 to discuss recent 
developments in electric markets and NN's and TW's efforts to attract power 
generation load to the system.  Specific topics I hope to cover include the 
following:
1.  What are the key factors that determine where a power plant developer 
puts his plant?  
2.  Do the transmission access and pricing rules of the various 
utilities/power pools vary all that much or are Order 888 tariffs pretty much 
the same all over? 
3.  How do IPPs decide what fuel supply strategy works best (i.e., buy 
bundled delivered fuel from someone vs. buy gas, storage, transport, etc.  
separately)?
4.  What is the RTO Rule and why should we care? 
5.  Has $5/mmbtu gas killed the gas fired power market?
 Depending on how deeply we get into these topics, we may need to schedule a 
follow-up session at a later date.  I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday.

Electronic Filings/Demo of FERC home page and search functions might be a 
good topic for one of our staff meetings.  Nancy Bagot could present in 
person or via Video Conference.   Also, I gathered the Koch and Dominion 
materials regarding standards of conduct in electric proceedings.   I'd be 
happy to present but I also thought Tony would be a good choice as it would 
help him get up to speed on the Marketing Affiliate Rule.  Let's discuss.

On Friday I attended an industry luncheon with Fernanda Young, FERC's Chief 
Information Officer.  She discussed some of the electronic filing and 
research changes coming to FERC.  The crux of the discussion is that within a 
few years (by 2003), FERC's internet website will include a searchable 
database that functions very much like Lexus/Nexus (except for the exorbitant 
fees).

For electronic filing, the first step begins tomorrow with comments (without 
service lists) being filed electronically.  Filers do not have to duplicate 
with a paper copy.  All filings, which can be received by FERC in almost any 
format, will be converted to Adobe Acrobat (.pdf files) by FERC for viewing 
online and available within minutes of being received.   The electronic PDF 
version will be the official copy for pagination citations.  The next round 
of filings to be accepted electronically will include interventions and 
protests.  Coming on line further down the road are documents with extensive 
service lists, as Fernanda is intent on cleaning up those lists of duplicate 
or "stale" names, companies and parties before going forward with electronic 
service of parties.  That process could be very involved, since each party 
will have to be contacted with a chance to respond before being removed or 
changed from a service list.

Another sticking point with major filings is the issue of electronic 
signatures, which is a security issue rather than a legal issue.  Electronic 
signatures demand the highest level of security and will be very costly to 
implement.  Fernanda believes that encryption offers sufficient security and 
she will urge the Commission to make an initial recommendation that does not 
include electronic filing.  This will be discussed with industry through a 
series of informal outreach sessions over the next few months; Fernanda 
expects some pushback on electronic signatures from some industry members, 
especially attorneys and law firms.

As for internet access and research capabilities, the FERC homepage will be 
revamped to include better design and more accessible information for 
non-FERC watchers (ie, the general public).  RIMS and CIPS will eventually be 
combined into one database that will be searchable (by words contained in a 
document's Abstract) and easy to use for researching and printing documents.  
All documents will be in PDF format.  The timeline for these changes is 
relatively short, with the full transition of the database and electronic 
filing requirements completed by 2003.

Attached for your review and comment is a draft of a policy to be distributed 
to EOL/ENA employees. While the policy may seem over-restrictive, the fact 
basis upon which the policy is based is that the activities identified in the 
policy are currently performed by ENA employees. Of course, we still need to 
talk about this issue.

I'd be happy to give you some specific feedback on this project.  I think you 
did a good job of bringing some focus to a project that badly needed focus.  
I was particularly pleased with how you vectored off from what started out as 
a computer system enhancement project and instead you brought home a solution 
that allows us to improve things immediately with manual processes and then 
upgrade to a system if we choose.  You showed a lot of creativity and 
flexibility in adapting to the changing project focus.  I really valued your 
thoroughness in getting input from all interested parties.  Your legwork up 
front made it a lot easier to get needed buy-in when we finally brought 
management in.  The product was timely and I expect it to deliver on my 
expectations, although the implementation will be the key.  Thanks again for 
the good work, and expect me to be a frequent customer.  DF

Now that the investigation of documents has been completed and a general plan 
of action has been agreed upon by the various departments involved, the 
Document Controls Investigation Project has drawn to a close.  As I have 
indicated to Contract Administration, I am available to assist them as they 
deem necessary in further detailing and implementing the new enhancements to 
the contracts process.

At the close of a project, it is always good to gain feedback from the 
project sponsors and look for ways that Business Consulting/Business Services 
can be even more effective within the ET&S organization.  With this purpose 
in mind, Drew and Julia, would you be willing to send your comments to myself 
and/or Mike McGowan on the following:

Did the end result of the project meet your expectations?
Did the end result meet the objectives outlined in the project scope?
Were you able to accomplish what you intended as a sponsor of the project?
Was the project delivered in a timely manner?
Any other comments that might be valuable for leadership or participation in 
future projects by Business Consulting/Business Services?

Paul Bieniawski's phone number is 713-345-8641.  Go ahead and give him a call 
just as a courtesy  to let him what you guys are looking at at Bushton and

Attached is a draft of an answer to protests received in Docket No. RP01-56.  
Please let me know your comments before noon tomorrow if possible.  Thanks.

Ugh.  Do we need to say "from storage inventory" or can we just mention gas 
sales?  I seem to recall that we already discussed that and the accountants 
wanted to mention the source of the sold gas, but if I'm wrong, lets make the 
reference less specific.  Thanks. DF    

   
	
	

Here are the paragraphs in the 3QTR 10Q relative to ETS that contain 
references to our base gas sales.  We have suggested the change shown to 
de-emphasize the fact that there were sales in both years.   Do you want to 
suggest any further changes in the next draft we receive for review?

Mike,

Finally talked to Steve Winston.  Oneok will meet with us in Omaha on the 
afternoon of Monday November 20th.  They will bring representatives from 
Business Development, Engineering, and Operations but no attorney's.  The 
meeting will be limited to CO2 mitigation.  They would like us to provide 
them with:  1) all facility or operational alternatives that we have or would 
considered including their cost, and what we would charge to provide them as 
a service,  and 2) any contractual or tariff actions we could take (like 
getting the CIG gas receipt moved to Dumas). 

Steve indicated that Prax Air (s.p.?) is challenging Oneok's "force majeure" 
contention and is holding Oneok accountable for nonperformance.  Steve will 
fax me a copy of the notice they received if Oneok's attorney's approve.  
Steve also indicated that since the CO2 level has come down this month, they 
will try to put the Helium plant back on today.

Charlie

Great--please make one change for me--change  "influence it" to "comment on 
it"  at the end of the first par. of B.  thanks DF

Here is what I think is a final draft...I'm going to give it one last read 
thru...if you have further comments let me know immediately.  Thanks.

A couple of issues strike me as particularly important to report on tomorrow: 
(1) the TW train wreck--possible insurance coverage and strength of any claim 
against the railroad.  We ought to talk to Lou to make sure we have the 
latest info as I haven't talked to him since Thursday.  (2)  Status of 
possible litigation involving OneOk.  I don't think anyone has reported to 
Stan on the threatening noise from ONeOk about Praxair's rejection of the 
OneOk force majeure letter.  I'm sure MKM (or Dan on her behalf) will report 
that we are getting the strangers contract ready to send out, but she may not 
mention the Winston conversation with Charlie Graham.  I'll check the bullets 
again to see if anything else jumps out.  Talk to you at 8:30.  DF 

I'm good with Maria's changes.  Thanks both.  DF

Tony, I need your review and approval asap for the attached E.Dubuque 
delivery products that are "daily" in nature (one is for receipt at Ventura 
and the other is for receipt at Demarc).  The rate aspect is the same 
language as the one-part rates we have already used (designated as "R+C).  
This "Dly" designation means that the term is one day which will be rolled 
over day-to-day unless either party cancels the rollover.  The term language 
shown here is the same as the "daily" language we have been using.  Call me 
with your questions. Thanks. x7067.

Looks good to me--I think you ought to have them file it asap.  Then we need 
to get a couple of additional shippers to respond to Edwards' thing.  DF

We need to make sure this upside doesn't get taken in 2000.  It is part of 
the 2001 plan.  What ideas do we have for reserving equivlaent dollars?  the

hundred thousand there?  we need to discuss how we want this treated for when 
it gets to Rod-  MK

I had a meeting with El Paso the afternoon of Nov. 6th to discuss the 
abandonment, and the "next steps"

El Paso agrees to shoot for a November 30, 2000 close, with them assuming 
commercial and revenue responsibility on December 1st.  I requested funds 
transfer to NNG on the first business day of Jan 2001.

All exhibits to the P&SA are collected and being made available to legal for 
incorporation into closing documents.  These include MMS ROW's, space lease 
agreements on  three platforms, and a surviving NNG/Sea Gull transport 
agreement.

Robert Newman with EGC has contacted El Paso field operations and they have 
developed a list of information operations will transfer to El Paso regarding 
pipeline Ass Builts, maintenance information,. metering activity, MMS safety 
inspections, corrosion control, leak histories, etc.

Preliminary worksheet showing the "Adjusted Price" was developed and agreed 
to with El Paso.  Estimate of proceeds at the time of closing will be 
$1,357,107.00.  This was developed using estimates for the last three months 
revenue stream, and four month of O&M.  The final number will be developed 
and routed internally once actual variable are known.  Due to the transition 
to SAP, queries be expense code are more difficult to obtain.

If you should have any questions or need any information please let me know.

Thanks, Bob

EHS Corporate has asked we verify this inventory of services/products  from 
all of the various companies that fit under the very broadest form of the ETS 
umbrella.  I offer the following thoughts:  I don't believe EOTT has any 
relationship with the Mt. Belvieu storage operations; I don't know if we 
purchase natural gas except for fuel purposes; do we currently have any gas 
gathering facilities?? or just transmission??; EOTT Fleet Vehicles could be 
better defined; Risk Management services??

Feedback would be extremely helpful before the 17th
Lou,

This is a follow-up to a meeting we had about 2 months ago on Life Cycle 
Impact Assessments.  The 1st phase of the assessment involves completing an 
inventory of Enron's products\services and volumes.  I am currently 
requesting each business unit to verify the products and services we have 
identified and make any modifications to the list.  I am enlisting your 
assistance to do this for ETS, including EOTT.  I need to have the 
verification completed by 11/17. Please advise if you have any questions.

Below is ETS Risk Management Policy, which we would like Corporate to review 
before it is presented to management for approval and limit establishment.  I 
have also attached a 1st draft of the Risk Management Procedures and Controls 
that while not all are fully in place we expect them to be operational once 
transactional active increases. 

Rudi, who would be the person to check with on this policy.

I've talked to Lee Ferrell about this, and it sounds to me like there are 
serious business reasons (i.e., cost and functionality) not to use the ENA

if the right people are in Networks instead of ENA.  I'll call you tomorrow.

Lee,
Just to recap the meeting with Richard Burchfield and Steve Stock, based on 
the requirements that you and Vernon have identified, we would need to use 
several of the system components including TAG, ERMS, GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, 
CREDIT, and UNIFY for settlements.  All of these applications are tightly 
integrated.  We considered moving them into the ETS environment which would 
separate the applications, but this would be a very large undertaking and 
would be a resource intensive effort.  Therefore, due to the size, complexity 
and integration of the applications, the group came to the conclusion that it 
would be more timely and cost effective from an inception as well as 
maintenance standpoint that ETS would have to share these systems with the 
marketing group, and that porting them to the ETS environment as separate 
application images would not be good from an overall migration as well as 
support standpoint.  Additionally, we considered the EnPower System which is 
also integrated into GLOBAL COUNTERPARTY, CREDIT and UNIFY.  We are planning 
on a demo Friday morning, but there may be some functionality that you all 
are looking for related to gas that EnPower cannot provide at this time and 
would require some customization.  We'll know more tomorrow after the demo.

Regarding security, these applications are secured to segregate the data, but 
we need an approval from Legal that it would be ok to use shared resources 
from the IT standpoint.  This would include application developers and 
database administrators.  Additionally, we would have to go through the 
process of verifying that there would be no security leaks where it would be 
possible for a marketer to run a report on pipeline related data, etc...  If 
we can get an ok from Legal regardinig sharing of resources, then one of 
these options can be explored further, but if we cannot get approval on 
sharing of resources, it doesn't look like porting either of these 
applications into the ETS environment as standalone apps would be the most 
timely or cost effective way to go at this time.  Can you get a stand from 
Legal regarding this issue?  Thanks.

As we discussed, based on this email and the other information you have given 
me, I have significant concerns about our ability to use the ENA products 
discussed below.  Having ENA IT people involved on an ongoing basis in 
maintaining the software and assisting us in using it would probably 
constitute a violation of the marketing affiliate rules or would at minimum 
create the appearance of marketing affiliate violations.  As I understand the 
risk books, etc., confidential information on our various capacity positions 
would be all over the place and difficult or impossible to firewall off from 
ENA people working on those books.  If there is some firewall strategy that 
the ENA folks have in mind, i.e., if those IT people are or will be employed 
by Networks or Corp., I am eager to listen, but from what I have learned so 
far, I am not comfortable with our use of the ENA system.  DF

As you requested, following are the facts for the media regarding the 
negotiated rate deals that TW has recently done at rates in excess of the 
tariff max rate.   Please note that the first two transactions are already 
public and the following information can be disclosed now.  The third deal 
has not been filed yet and will not be public until it is.  That filing will 
be made before Dec. 1, 2000. 

General:  TW has done three deals in the last week at rates in excess of TW's 
maximum tariff rate.  Each of the deals was done pursuant to TW's negotiated 
rate authority, which FERC granted TW in 1997.  (Order issued April 11, 1997, 
Transwestern Pipeline Co., 79 FERC Par. 61,021).  Pursuant to that authority, 
TW has filed negotiated rate tariff sheets with the FERC, which are docketed 
at Docket No. RP97-288.  Details on the specific transactions are as follows:
  
Deal 1:  Counterparty:  PG&E Energy Trading
 Rate Schedule:  ITS-1
 Volume:    30,000/day
 Rate:  $.90/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges
 Term: the one day period of November 15, 2000
 Receipt points:  NNG Halley, West Texas Pool
 Delivery point:  SoCal Topock

Deal 2:  Same as Deal 1,  except term is one day period of November 16, 2000 
and rate is $.75/MMBtu  

Deal 3:  Counterparty:  Sempra Energy Trading
 Rate Schedule:  LFT
 Volume:  10,000/day
 Rate:  $1.00/MMBtu, inclusive of surcharges
 Term:  Dec. 1-Dec. 31, 2000
 Receipt point:  Bloomfield
 Delivery point:  PG&E Topock

All of the above information is contained in TW's FERC filings on these 
transactions.  No other information is available as TW does not comment on 
specific customer transactions.    

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df    

Hey, got my facts together on our Houston gig--we'll be down Sat. Dec. 2 
through mon the 4th.  Any chance we could swing by on Sunday and see  you 
guys?  DF

That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing 
I'm remembering, but I think there is some more specific law related to 
market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on 
market power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, you 
better not use it.  DF    

Susan Scott
11/21/2000 10:08 AM
I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

Attached for your review and comment is a broad outline of a rate proposal to 
Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you

Caithness for the construction and operation of the 40-mile lateral to the 
Big Sandy project.  This non-binding proposal was requested by Caithness' 
consultant, George Briden, as a starting point for modeling the economics of 
the project's gas supply and a basis for further discussions aimed at 
designing an appropriate deal structure.  For your information, James 
Centilli calculated the transport rate based on the (+/- 30%) $20.33MM cost 
estimate with a ten-year (contract) amortization.  

I plan to put this in the mail by the close of business tomorrow.  If you 
have any suggestions, please let me hear from you by mid-day.   Thanks.

Excellent reading of the legal authority issues as well as the political 
winds.  I think your sense of the likelihood of trouble is accurate.  I also 
agree with your implicit premise that if FERC or anyone else wanted to make 
trouble regarding our negotiated rate deals, the easiest approach, and the 
most direct one, is to challenge the deals as unjust and unreasonable under 
NGA section 4/5.  To challenge the deals under some state law "gouging" 
theory would give rise to preemption defenses on our part, etc.  I'll talk to 
you and Kathy further tomorrow AM and then we can grab Mike to discuss.  
Thanks.  DF

As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some 
reading and here are my thoughts.

The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission 
ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the 
Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.  
Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that "any rate, 
charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, 
regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or 
classification" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the 
just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, 
or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain 
areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but 
"fixed" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California 
governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of 
wholesale electricity prices is questionable...

In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate 
the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its 
authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly 
authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just 
and reasonable.  "Just and reasonable" has been interpreted in many different 
contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.  
As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.  
However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 
above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated 
rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and 
unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire 
communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their 
electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous 
across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's 
transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices 
and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not 
widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer 
issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have 
already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just 
about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do 
need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the 
same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of 
monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew, 
obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a 
more in-depth report.

   
	
	

That is by far the best line of the day!!  Unconscionability may be the thing 
I'm remembering , but I think there is some more specific law related to 
market dislocations--i.e., the Hurricane example.  Its sort of a twist on 
market power law--i.e., if the fates hand you short term market power, you 
better not use it.  DF    

Susan Scott

I know there is some case law out there on contracts being voided because 
they are "unconscionable."  There are several examples in consumer law and 
employment law, in which one contracting party is a corporation and the other 
is a West Palm Beach voter.  However, if my memory serves me correctly, none 
of them involve contracts between 2 sophisticated business entities such as 
TW and Sempra or PG&E.  Absent evidence of fraud, courts uphold bargains 
struck at arms length.  
Kathy, I'd be happy to take the oars on this but if you've already done some 
looking, please let me know if you've found anything.

   
	
	

Stuck on the phone so I thought I'd email you.  Stan has asked Mike Moran if 
TW has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under "anti 
gouging" statutes or common law.  You know, the laws that say you can't 
charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of 
water during a drought.  I think we need to research two things:
1.  are there any such laws applicable to our business?  (Cal. state law 
would probably be the best place to start)
2.  could the political/regulatory fight in Cal about power and gas prices 
ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?  I.e., if the CPUC whacks 
the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its 
not a big leap for the CPUC or FERC or even U.S. congress to whack gas 
sellers for jacking prices up to $14/MMBtu, as happened on Friday.  If that 
happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for 
transport, or so the logic goes.  I'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 
Monday am so I can talk to Mike before Stan's staff meeting (no written memo 
necessary).  Based on that prelim. research, we can decide what else need s 
to be done.  Thanks df    

Here is a good example of the problem to which your research project 
pertains.  This info. could be devastating in the next rate case ( or sooner) 
if disclosed.  How comfortable are we with our privilege arguments?  DF

Kathy Ringblom

Drew, I will try to summarize the research I did today on the referenced 
subject.  The bottom line is that I did not find any California statutes that 
appeare to be applicable to what we're doing.  I looked at California's 
General Business Regulations, Unfair Trade Practices statute, the Public 
Utilities Code, an ALR annotation that discussed cases in which courts have 
reviewed acts or practices prohibited by state deceptive trade practice and 
consumer protection statutes, and I searched case law and statutes using 
terms such as gouging, unconscionable, pricing practices, etc.  The 
California Unfair Practices Act is "... not a price-fixing statute, but seeks 
to regulate conduct of those engaged in business in order to eliminate such 
unfair practices as price discrimination indulged in for purpose of injuring 
competitors or destroying competition.  It does not make every difference in 
price unlawful, but only those differences that cannot be justified after 
proper allowance has been made for differences in grade, quality, quantity or 
cost of transportation."   It appears that the statutes and cases that are 
anywhere close to what we're looking for deal with protection of the ultimate 
consumer and not sophisticated energy companies.  

I did find a price gouging statute in New York that states that its purpose 
is to prohibit conduct that could occur during periods of abnormal disruption 
of the market caused by strikes, power failures, severe shortages or other 
extraordinary adverse circumstances when parties have taken unfair advangage 
of consumers by charging grossly excessive prices for essential goods and 
services.  I reviewed two cases, People v. Two Wheel Corp. and State of New 
York v. Strong Oil Company, that deal with a company that sold portable 
electric generators at unconscionably excessive prices during a power failure 
caused by a hurricane and a company that sold home heating fuel at an 
unconscionably excessive price during a period of abnormal disruption of the 
market, respectively.  (The Strong Oil case discussed Federal pre-emption of 
state law due to the Federal Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act.)  I will put 
copies of these cases as well as some of the other documents mentioned above 
in your in-box in case you want to review them.  

I looked briefly at Texas law but didn't see anything.  I obviously didn't 
get every state covered.  If you want me to look further, please let me 
know.  

fyi.  df

This morning I raised a concern regarding TW's sale of excess fuel at 
downstream points.  Here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to 
tender fuel to us at their receipt points.  With rare exceptions, those 
receipt points are not at the Cal. border.  Order 636 mandates that pipelines 
unbundle transportation from storage.  It also requires that pipelines that 
make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.  That 
latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point "x", it should 
resell the gas at point "x" and not haul the gas to point "y" and then sell 
it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product.  My concern this morning was 
that our receipt of fuel gas in the San Juan or Permian and shipment of that 
gas to the Cal. border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement 
(because the Cal. border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the 
transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the "furthest 
upstream point" requirement or both.  Susan and my recollection was that when 
ECS wanted to receive the Gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than 
Permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where 
they wanted it.  I haven't confirmed that recollection but I am recalling 
that we told Courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around 
whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.

Irrespective of what we did with ECS, I think the following is the correct 
way to look at this situation:  We receive fuel at the shippers' receipt 
points.  Once we receive it, however, it is no longer "fuel."  It becomes 
line pack until it is burned.   Line pack moves around based on a lot of 
reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  It also, obviously, has to move 
to the compressors where it is burned as fuel.   It is our job to  manage 
line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, 
and sell it at locations where we are long.  If we end up long at the Cal. 
border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack 
back to optimal levels.  I wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are 
consistently buying line pack in the San Juan and Permian and selling line 
pack at the Cal. border, but  thats not what we are talking about here.  I 
can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with 
this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.  MKM--OK 
with you?  DF  

I'm not aware of any legal or regulatory prohibition on our performing such a 
service for Citizens.  We can't actually buy the assets without a FERC 
certificate, but that's not what you are suggesting.   I can think of one 
example on NN in which Northwestern Pub. Service owns a some branch lines and 
we operate them.  Whether we do it as a separate legal entity or as TW is a 
strategy call that will depend on whether we want to keep the revenue stream 
out of the regulated pipeline entity.  Since TW doesn't have a rate case 
until 2006, there is probably no reason to put the contract in a separate 
entitiy until we get down the road a ways.    

Jeffery Fawcett

Citizens Utilities is in the process of selling off all of its 
non-telecommunications businesses throughout North America.  One of their 
principal assets, Louisiana Gas Service (LGS) is one of those companies 
recently sold by Citizens.  LGS provided gas control and operations services 
to other non-LGS companies, including the Citizens Utilities LDC assets in 
Arizona.  With the consummation of the sale of LGS, Citizens has told me 
confidentially that they have no reasonable way of operating the 
interconnect, metering and 1.5 mile lateral pipeline facilities that 
interconnects TW and EPNG to the recently constructed Griffith Energy Power 
Plant.   Therefore, Citizens is looking to possibly have a 3rd party provide 
contract operations services under an operating agreement.  TW has been asked 
in writing by Citizens to consider making a proposal to operate these 
facilities. 

Does TW have an interest in providing contract operations services for 
Citizens?  In a related legal/regulatory question, does TW have the authority 
to conduct contract services on behalf of others, or would we have to perform 
these services as a separate legal entity?  If we do, does this present an 
affiliate problem for us if we "share" operating employees?  If these 
threshold questions can be accommodated, and TW is not only able to provide 
contract operations services for Citizens, but has a commercial desire to do 
so, what would we charge Citizens for this service?  Although it would appear 
at first blush to be a relatively simple matter to operate these facilities, 
remember that Citizens will be receiving gas (potentially) from both TW and 
EPNG simultaneously, presenting not only a challenge to balance pressure 
between the pipes, but to account for and reconcile deliveries and receipts 
from both pipes as well as the plant site. 

Although I'm the principal commercial representative for Citizens as regards 
transportation matters, I'm certainly willing to step out of the middle of 
this negotiation if Operations desires to handle it themselves.  I will be 
happy to provide you a copy of the brief 1/2 page letter Citizens sent to me 
on the 17th soliciting TW's interest.   Given the relatively short lead time 
until LGS operations is sold, Citizens has requested expedited 
consideration.  Please let me know how you want to proceed.  Call if you have 
any questions.

Tino called this morning with a quick report.  They are still negotiating 
with DOE on a power plant deal, but it looks pretty shaky.  The size of the 
plant has grown to 380 MW, for reasons that are unclear to me.  Tino has been 
ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls 
apart.  He says Dennis has about $3 mm in the project so far, most of it 
related to the pipeline right of way.  The have a binding 20 year agreement 
with the tribes for the ROW that calls for a $100,000 minimum monthly 
payment.  I'm not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the 
ROW agreement includes fiber optic rights etc.  The question is whether we 
are even interested enough to justify a closer look, since the rights Dennis 
has pulled together will probably be available for cents on the dollar.  I 
told Tino I'd give him a call next week to let him know.  At minimum, I'd 
suggest we have one of our ROW guys take a look at whatever they've got and 
advise us on what its worth.  Your thoughts?  DF 

Tino implied that it was transferrable, but we'd need to look at the 
documents to be surre.  DF

A perfected (or nearly perfected) ROW may have some merit, especially as ENA 
continues their negotiations to further develop that power plant in 
Albuquerque.  I'll have Jeff call ENA, and without giving anything away, find 
out how their negotiations are progressing.  I wonder to what extent Dennis' 
agreement with the tribe is transferable?

 First, congratulations to all five of you and the others on your staffs who 
were involved for working together to get the excess line pack deal done 
today.  As I understand it, TK was able to sell 10,000 MMBtu at the Cal 
Border for something like $15 thanks to your efforts.  This thing went from 
Dave and Kent's idea to you guys' execution in about two days, even with a 
(slight) delay due to my panic attack on whether we can make downstream 
sales.   Great job!   Second, I think TK, Kevin, Maria and Glen and I have 
come up with a workable set of guidelines on when similar deals can be done 
in the future.  The key, as I expressed in the attached email, is that the 
sales be driven by a legitimate operational basis.  If Gas Control verifies 
that we have excess line pack at a location and that making the sale helps 
get line pack to optimal levels, such sales are appropriate.  Gas Control 
should also verify that the operational basis for the sale can be documented 
if the need ever arises.  Today's deal is a great example of that as we 
actually communicated to outside parties that we anticipated some pressure 
management issues.  If there are ever any questions about when such deals are 
appropriate, or about how to document the operational basis, please give me, 
Susan, or Maria a call.  Again, great job!  DF

The note below was a portion of Terry Galassini's Weekly Report.  I wasn't 
sure if either of you have been a part of the test information.

**Gallup Compressor Station & Mainline Expansion
A field test was completed and initial results indicate a compressor 
efficiency around 80 - 82% which is within Cooper's guarantee.  A not to 
exceed cost of $3 Million was provided to Marketing for station modifications 
to facilitate an incremental mainline (West of Thoreau) firm capacity of 10 
MMcf/d.    Additional work by E&C to fine tune the not to exceed estimate is 
targeted for completion by December 8th.  The mainline expansion potential is 
directly related to Gallup since the discharge pressure must be increased to 
970 psig to achieve an additional 10 MMcf/d on the mainline.  The San Juan 
Lateral firm capacity would remain at 850 MMcf/d.

I had a problem approving one from home a couple weeks ago, but I think it 
works OK now.  May have been a bad phone line.  Thanks.  DF 

Drew -- are you having problems approving contracts?    Thanks.  Jean

Great--we ought to be able to about close this effort out at this next 
meeting I hope.  DF

   
	
	

I have included Drew's recommendations and have amended the 11/6/2000 drafts 
of the ETS Risk Policy and Risk Procedure.  The significant change made was 
to take out references to Hedging and Non-Hedging Transactions (II A. & B. 
have been taken out).  We will just call them all Derivative Transactions.  I 
would like Tony Pryor to arrange a meeting with all parties to move these 
documents forward, an alternative is to continue to use the Corporate Risk 
Management Policy and just set the trading limits as part of the Corporate 
Policy. 

Cassandra Schultz in RAC has not responded to the policy and I plan to 
follow-up with her after we meet to discuss.

Looks OK to me, subject to approval from MKM's group.  Should we also solicit 
turnback in the East of Thoreau area in addition to soliciting it from Cal. 
border to Thoreau?  Is it our theory that since Thor.-Cal is the constrained 
segment, thats the only area we need to solicit turnback on?  DF

Tony Pryor recommended that I put back into the policy section II A &B so 
that at our meeting tomorrow at 10:00 A.M. we can discuss them.  Please use 
this copy of the draft dated 12/5/00 to discuss from tomorrow.

   
	
	

I have included Drew's recommendations and have amended the 11/6/2000 drafts 
of the ETS Risk Policy and Risk Procedure.  The significant change made was 
to take out references to Hedging and Non-Hedging Transactions (II A. & B. 
have been taken out).  We will just call them all Derivative Transactions.  I 
would like Tony Pryor to arrange a meeting with all parties to move these 
documents forward, an alternative is to continue to use the Corporate Risk 
Management Policy and just set the trading limits as part of the Corporate 
Policy. 

Cassandra Schultz in RAC has not responded to the policy and I plan to 
follow-up with her after we meet to discuss.

Should we respond to PNM's protest of the dollar valuation of imbalances 
prior to netting and trading?  Did we already respond to this issue when they 
filed their protest of the 637 filing?  DF 

Congratulations on the move!  Its great to see a reorg that actually seems to 
make so much sense!  Thanks again to you and Terry for watching the three 
stooges on Saturday night.  It was great seeing you guys again and getting

Effective immediately, Joe Jeffers, Manager of Technical Training and Skill 
Based Pay Administration, and his team of Dick Heitman, Cliff McPherson, 
Andrea Woody and Lupi Trevino will move from ETS Human Resources to ETS 
Operations Technical Services.  Joe will report to Steve Klimesh.  

This move will better align Technical Training and SBP Administration with 
Operations and enhance the interfaces that take place between this group and 
ETS Operations management and the field teams. 

Joe and his team have provided outstanding support to Operations in the past, 
and it is expected that this high standard of customer service will 
continue.  We will be sending more information in the very near future with 
regard to the individual support accountabilities of the team members.  

Please join me in welcoming this team and helping to make their transition a 
smooth one.  

A team of folks including Dari, Glen Hass, Don Vignaroli, etc have beaten 
these issues to death--we have a very detailed set of materials summarizing 
the findings of the group.  Bob Burleson should know that, as I think he was 
at the meeting when we went over this stuff.  Viggy, did we get the info from 
our briefing on the matrix to the no-shows like Steve Harris and John 
Dushinske (and Bob if he was a no show?)  If not, we ought to send it to them 
and ask them to call for follow up.  DF

Who in certificates has looked at the issues of using our compreesor turbines 
to generate electricity??
Also has anyone in Legal done any research on PUHCA issues.
I was just speaking with Bob Burleson and Rod Hayslett about these issues.  
Rod said that Danny is very interested and is considering power generation on 
the Florida system.  Do you know who from legal is on that team?
i assume there may be marketing affiliate isues also ??

I'm inclined to agree that its not worth responding to.  They also argued 
that imbalances should not be dollar valued before netting and trading are 
available, but that strikes me as an industry wid e policy issue and not a TW 
specific issue.  Any other thoughts?  DF

We did not answer protests to our Order 637 filing.

The gist of PNM's protest in RP00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge 
a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.  I 
agree with PNM that our tariff language is vague in this regard.  What 
exactly do we mean by "no additional cost...unless through the allocation 
process, quantities may be subject to transportation and fuel"??   Can 
someone help me with this?

Since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, I would 
say we probably wouldn't mind if FERC rejected our tariff sheet outright.  
However, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our 
language.  Or they could tell us to remove the "subject to transportation and 
fuel" provision.  If we want to preserve our right to charge transport and 
fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer.  
However, I am going to need some assistance in understanding what the 
language means and why we think we can do it, so I can justify it to FERC.  
Any comments you have in this regard would be appreicated.

Please Note:

We have changed the correlation of the Transwestern's hedges to the same 
index(El Paso Permian) that the derivatives were transacted.  We feel it is 
appropriate to make this correlation change due to management's anticipation 
to make the 2001 sales at an El Paso Permian index.  Due to this change TW 
has a perfect correlation, therefore the associated Value at Risk  will be 
zero.

What a mess.  Keeping discovery at bay should, obviously, continue to be a 
very high priority for us.  Let me know if these strange events signal an 
increased likelihood that Gynberg will be able to pursue discovery.  Thanks.

FYI.  (I have not yet had an opportunity to talk to Charlie about any of 
this.)
There was a lengthy status conference this afternoon, lasting about an hour
and a quarter.  It was marred by extremely poor telephone connections.  The
technical difficulties frustrated the parties and the judge and made the
conference a mess.

Without trying to summarize the conference, I note a few things that the
Court decided to do based on the discussions.

1.   Quinque.  Judge Downes agreed to have oral argument on the motion to
remand in Quinque on January 3, 2001 at 1:15 p.m. in Casper.  One hour was
set aside for argument.  He declined Mike Beatty's suggestion of an
additional executive summary of the briefing.  The judge was the first one
to suggest the oral argument.  The plaintiffs suggested that the Court rule
on the papers, but quickly acquiesced to the Court's suggestion when the
defendants said that they wanted argument.

2.    Osterhoudt.   Osterhoudt appeared pro se.  Motion to disqualify
Wright's counsel (Phillips & Cohen) and estopping Mr. Wright on some claims.
Both Osterhoudt and Wright want oral argument.  Wright defendants and DOJ
didn't object.  Osterhoudt was appearing pro se, and so there was a long
rambling discussion of the matter.  The judge was reluctant to cut off a pro
se party, but ultimately did.  Regrettably, the rambling discussion set the
tone for the rest of the call.

3.   Osterhoudt.   Government's motion to dismiss Ousterhoudt's case.
Government wants its motion to dismiss Grynberg's valuation claims to be
heard at the same time.  The government claims these relator status issues
are holding up the Shell $56 million settlement and any future settlements.
Grynberg objected to having the motion in Grynberg heard at the same time.
Grynberg wants discovery from Wright and the government.

4.    Pending Motions.  The Court, of out frustration at the inability to
hear the parties and at the attempts by some to argue the merits of things
that the Court was not prepared to address, set down two hours for oral
argument on February 22, 2001, at 10:00 a.m. on all pending  motions in
Wright and Grynberg that address the jurisdictional issues discussed on the
call and the motions to dismiss.  This obviously will create some problems.
It was far from clear precisely which motions that the Court had in mind.
While there are not that many motions pending, some of the pending
government motions likely could affect public disclosure / original source
motions that the defendants could, but have not yet, filed.  The defendants
have not filed those motions yet because of a desire to first test the
complaints on Rule 9(b) grounds.

5.   Discovery.   Parties who want discovery on those issues (Grynberg and
probably the Wright defendants) were given one day to present their position
by letter to the Court.  Other parties then will have two days to respond.

6.    Liaison Counsel.   The Court designated Tom Nicholas as Liaison
Counsel for the defendants in the Wright case and Don Schultz as Liaison
Counsel for the defendants in the Quinque case.

7.    February 22 hearing.  Phil Figa, one of Grynberg's lawyers, was given
the task of leading the consultation among counsel concerning how the
pending motions should be addressed at the hearing and how the time should
be divided.

Thanks Bob.  I feel a lot better, particulary since the year end documents 
won't have to have all the detail.  DF

   
	
	

Thanks for your comments below. 

We consulted our AA folks in drafting the disclosures.  It wasn't a big deal 
for Enron's 10Q because the positions between NNG and TW are eliminated in 
the consolidated statements.  As for the Form 2 and the Brown Covers, there 
are specific GAAP disclosure requirements that we have to include on a 
stand-alone basis.  Since most of these positions will be gone by year end, 
it won't look nearly as massive as it was at the end of the third quarter.  
In fact, if Roger Willard had given us his final word about the transactions 
in time, we would have booked the ultimate net transactions in September and 
we wouldn't have had all these gross positions.  I don't feel quite as bad 
about not getting it right in the unaudited third quarter financials as I 
otherwise would, since we did review the transactions and the noteholders 
disclosures with AA before the 3rd quarter was released and before the 
noteholders reports were distributed.  

As always, Legal and Regulatory will have ample opportunity to comment on 
Brown Cover and Form 2 disclosures before they are finalized. 

   
	
	

I've reviewed the draft NN and TW quarterly reports to noteholders.  I 
haven't had a chance to compare these to prior quarterly filings, but I have 
three questions/concerns.  First, the discussions of "Price Risk Management 
Activities" seem overly detailed and cumbersome given the true commercial 
impact of the deals involved.  For example, we disclose the total notional 
amount of gas involved in the Transcanada deal, the "fair value" of the 
trades, and a variety of  other details, even the total economic impact of 
the deal to us is pretty small (about a million dollars if I remember 
right).  The base gas deal, by comparison, was discussed in one sentence.  
Can we avoid making the thing look bigger than it really is by disclosing 
something more meaningful like VAR (which I assume would be a much smaller 
number)?  Second, disclosing TW and NN trading activity separately makes the 
Transcanada deal look like a bigger thing than it really was, since the TW 
and NN portions offset one another.  I know we need to disclose deals 
separately for each operating company, but is there a way things like 
notional value and "fair value" (or VAR) can be aggregated to more accurately 
reflect the total impact of the deal--currently it looks like both TW and NN 
were out doing huge commodity deals.  Third, I have never been that concerned 
about overly broad disclosures in the noteholder reports because of the 
limited distribution.   However, if these disclosures will be Arthur 
Anderson's template for the Enron Corp. 10Q or the FERC Form 2s, I have a 
real problem.  

Please let me know if I can be of help in talking through these issues.  DF

Drew - I visited with the Senate sponsor (it is now officially SB159) in New

You correctly predicted my reaction.  I think we should let sleeping dogs 
lie.  Also, was it just an oversight that the FERC ignored the unsold 
capacity that TW controls in evaluating how much of the available capacity 
that Enron controls?  That conclusion is good for us, if it was intentional.  
DF  

Shelley Corman
01/24/2000 11:40 AM
I'm sure you've seen the order approving the El Paso/ENA transaction.  For 
the most part the order is a good one.  It observes that ENA holds little 
capacity on TW, and that PG&E and Socal control a larger portion of capacity 
on TW.   With respect to policy matters, the order is good in the sense that 
it reaffirms that a pipeline can withhold capacity to maximize the value of 
services if shippers are not willing to pay maximum rates.

My only concern with the order appears in the last paragraph before Section 
C.  Here the Commission cautions that its will address on an expedited basis 
future allegations that TW is not allocating capacity on a non-discriminatory 
basis.  Certainly the Commission has always had this authority anyway.  
Nonetheless, I am a little bit troubled that the Commission is addressing 
Transwestern at all in an El Paso order.   TW shouldn't have to read the 
orders of other pipelines for any directives that apply to it.    My knee 
jerk reaction is that we would want clarification that the Commission is just 
reiterating its general willingness to take up any bona fide complaints and 
is not imposing any directive on TW.  But, I'm guessing you'll probably say 
we should just let that sentence pass in an otherwise good order that does 
not involve TW.

Please review this final draft at your earliest convenience and get back to 
Britt or me with your comments.  Thanks.  Martha, please print it out for

I agree with you that par. 4 doesn't give NMNG anything beyond what the 
tariff and general contract law gave them.  The "subject to agreement by 
Transwestern" language is redundant since the previous clause says " by 
mutual written agreement."  Additionally, its confusing and innacurate 
because the "provided, however, that" clause isn't even binding if we 
mutually agree to eliminate it.   I therefore think we ought to take par. 4 
out, or at least remove the "provided however" clause.  I don't agree that we 
can only decrease their MDQ by using capacity release.  We can mutually agree 
to terminate their contract or reduce their MDQ without using cap. release.  
I suppose we would need to use cap. release if the termination or reduction 
of their MDQ was a sham designed to get the capacity from NMNG to another 
shipper, however. 

I would propose one change to Par. 3 just to make the discount more clear.  
The par. talks about primary delivery points but is silent on primary 
receipts.  I'd add this, after the words "Appendix A" at the end of the 
current first sentence:

"and receipts at the primary points of receipt set forth on Appendix A.  The 
discounted rate shall also apply to receipts at alternate receipt points in 
Transwestern's East of Thoreau (EOT) area."

I'm a fan of being extremely clear when we limit availability of discounts, 
and think we should always fully explain what the discount applies to at both 
the receipt and delivery end of the deal.  

Susan, please work with Christine to get these changes made.  I'd like to 
eliminate par. 4 entirely, but I can live with it if the business people want 
to leave it in, as long as we eliminate the "provided however" clause.   With 
these changes, I'm OK with the contract.  Thanks.  

   
	
	

The only problem I can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed 
to encourage NMNG to request amendment not only to increase the MAXDTQ but 
also to decrease it (if the MAXDTQ has been increased by a previous 
amendment).  I worry that this might mislead NMNG that the parties can 
decrease the MAXDTQ by agreement rather than NMNG using capacity release 
procedures.   However, the paragraph does not obligate TW to do anything & 
doesn't give NMNG any rights, since any change in the MAXDTQ must be by 
mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity).  Since it does not 
seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff, 
I think I would recommend we omit it.  However, NMNG might insist on this or 
similar language to reflect the "deal" --- or at least the conversations of 
the parties.  If that's the case, I suppose I would advise the marketing 
folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in MAXDTQ and 
explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release.  Comments?

The below note outlines the changes I made to the Enron Machine and 
Mechanical Services, Inc. (Clifton machine shop) Subcontract Agreement with 
Instromet per Instromet's requested changes that Randy Rice and Rick Craig 
accepted.  In the course of editing this Agreement, I rearranged certain 
provisions to clarify the indemnity obligations of the parties, and the 
representations and warranties of the parties. The latter changes are 
described below.  

Instromet has not yet seen this revised Agreement.   GPG Procurement and 
Supply will be meeting with Instromet this Thursday, January 27th, and would 
like to execute the agreement that day.  The plan is to send the attached 
agreement to Instromet no later than the close of GPG's business today.  
Please review the below changes as well as  Exhibit A, Scope of Work, and 
Exhibit B, Unit Price List, and advise me as soon as possible today of any 
concerns you may have.  Thank you for your help in finalizing this agreement.
Colleen Raker
01/25/2000 11:45 AM
Part II, Section 1, Definitions.

Modified to replace the definition of "Test Period" with "Warranty Period", 
and to define the latter as "the period of time up to 30 days from the date 
Instromet receives the shipment of Work at Instromet's first point of 
destination".  Instromet's right to reject the completed Work by notifying 
Enron Machine and Mechanical Services, Inc. (EM&MS) in writing of the alleged 
defect must be exercised by Instromet during the Warranty Period or this 
right is waived.   Instromet's sole remedy for defective goods is the repair 
or replacement by EM&MS.

Part II, Section 6.2, Instromet Furnished Information, Data, Material, 
Equipment Services.

Modified to limit Instromet's liability for consequences of defects in 
manufactured spools to defects in the data, material, equipment, supplies or 
services furnished by or through Instromet.  Original draft also made 
Instromet liable for defects in supplies or services furnished by Enron 
Machine and Mechanical Services, Inc.

Part II, Section 11, Title and Risk of Loss to Work.

Modified to transfer title and all risk of loss in the Work to Instromet as 
of the date of Enron Machine and Mechanical Services, Inc.'s invoice 
statement to Instromet (whether or not Instromet has arranged for the 
shipment of the completed spools).  Original draft placed risk of loss in the 
Work with Instromet at all times, and identified the Point of Delivery 
(Clifton machine shop) as the place of title-transfer.  

Part II, Section 12, Changes.

Modified to provide for the completion of a Work Change Order form (attached 
to the Agreement as Exhibit C) to document changes in Work agreed to by the 
parties.

Part II, Section 13, Standards of Performance and Limited Warranty.

Modified to integrate the new Warranty Period definition discussed in the 
first bullet item above.  Also modified to treat as a separate numbered 
section (Section 9, Indemnification for Third Party Claims) the indemnity 
obligation (regardless of the presence or absence of insurance coverage) of 
Instromet to EM&MS  for third party claims for personal injury or property 
damage arising from EM&MS' Work .  Section 9 is further modified to expressly 
exclude from Instromet's indemnity obligation the percentage of any claim 
that results from the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith of 
EM&MS. Section 9 is also modified to state the right of EM&MS to assume its 
defense of a third party claim if Instromet fails to assume the same per its 
indemnity obligation on being notified of the claim.  

Please note that under Section 8, Liabilities and Indemnifications for Other 
Than Third Party Claims, Instromet and EM&MS have agreed to release and hold 
each other harmless for claims of injury or death of person or loss or damage 
to property in favor of each party or its employees or its agents arising 
from the Work of EM&MS at the Clifton machine shop.  Claims by Instromet's or 
EM&MS's independent contractors would be third party claims coverd by Section 
9.

Part II,  Hazardous Materials, Waste, Pollution Section.

This  section was deleted in its entirety.  Section 9, Indemnification for 
Third Party Claims, will cover the respective responsibilities of the parties 
for such claims.

Part II, Intellectual Property Rights Section.

Instromet was to provide EM&MS with its proposed alternate language for this 
section.  EM&MS has not received this.  Therefore, this separate Section was 
deleted by EM&MS and two of its provisions integrated elsewhere in the 
Agreement.  The first, the provision concerning Instromet's representations 
and warranties of ownership of the processes and methods that Instromet 
requires EM&MS to use in its manufacture of the spools has been set out in a 
separate section, Section 14, Instromet's Representations and Warranties.  
Section 14 now stipulates that Instromet warrants that either Instromet, Inc. 
or its "Affiliate" own such processes or methods used in the Work and that 
all products provided by Instromet are free from third party claims of 
infringement of intellectual property rights.  The second, the provision in 
the original "Intellectual Propery Rights" section concerning Instromet's 
obligation to indemnify EM&MS from third party intellectual property 
infringement claims has been removed and integrated into Section 9, 
Indemnification for Third Party Claims.

Lastly, please note that Section 22.5, Confidential Information,  now states 
that the parties' obligations of confidentiality and non-disclosure shall 
continue for a period of 3 years after the termination of this Agreement.  
The original draft had stipulated that the confidentiality obligations shall 
terminate ___ years after the date of the disclosure of such confidential 
information.  The change was made based on the difficulty of tracking 
different disclosure dates through the term of the Agreement.

You guys probably don't remember this (I didn't until I checked the file) but 
there were a couple of exhibits to the Transwestern Gallup contracts that we 
left to be attached to the final contracts after execution.  My recollection 
is that we were in such a hurry to get the Compression Service Agreement 
signed and sent to FERC that we left a couple of these things to do later.  
Now that we have the FERC order, I want to get these contracts off my desk 
and off to Corporate Records or whereever original contracts go to die.   On 
my originals, I'm missing Exhibit B to the CSA (which is the CDEC Rate 
Schedule No. 21),  and Exhibits A and C to the O&M Agreement.  

Susan, please coordinate with Gerald to get these exhibits in our respective 
files and we can send these contracts off to the central rathole and be done 
with it.  Thanks to you all.  DF

EES is a marketing affiliate, so we do need to be careful about shared 
computer systems, phone systems, staplers, paper clips, etc.  If Rich and his 
office have no "confidential transportation-related information"  we might be 
able to do it, otherwise, the hassles and expense of building marketing 
affiliate firewalls might make it counterproductive.   I'm forwarding this to 
the experts for a quick yup or nope on this.  Thanks. DF

market affiliate rules (if they apply here).

Drew - Saving $ for Enron. Any issues I'm overlooking?

I'd love to see us keep the capacity release upside above the discounted rate 
on all these deals but if we can't get it, we can't get it.  Approved.  DF

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL FORM

Various revisions have been requested for the five year New Mexico Natural 
Gas (NMNG) contract.  Please review the revised discount letter which 
includes the following revisions:

1) Clarification of Shipper's alternate rights at discount rate.

2) Deletion of paragraph granting NMNG the ability to change monthly MAXDTQ 
quantities subject to a floor level.  (Tariff already provides this ability 
subject to mutual agreement of Shipper and TW).

3) Addition of language which waives Shipper's ROFR rights.  

4)  Addition of language which would allow TW to apply a possible additional 
future surcharge if TW were to file for authorization to recover Y2K costs 
through a new surcharge.

In this particular discount letter I did not include language which allows TW 
the ability to retain capacity release revenues above the discount rate as 
this issue was not a part of the original negotiations. However, this 
language as well as the language overviewed above in 1), 3) and 4) will most 
likely be adopted as "standard" discount letter language in the future.

Please indicate approval via REPLY WITH HISTORY.
All officer approval will be faxed to Bill Cordes for final Presidential 
Level Approval

Bummer.  Never hurts to ask.  I'll cycle on this and get back to you with=
=20
follow up if any.  Thanks for your help on this.  DF=20

  =20

=09
Per your request to ask AA where the chokepoint might be on renegotiating t=
he=20
electricity contract at Cunningham to backload the payments and expense the=
=20
payments as made; the response is attached below.

First, it was difficult to point them in exactly the right direction withou=
t=20
tipping them off as to exactly what you had in mind.

However, they thought I might be talking about the TW compressor monetizati=
on=20
project...and even though I denied it...that is what they were thinking whe=
n=20
they did the research.   To make a long story short, they indicate that=20
straight line amortization of the total contract payments is the way it=20
should be booked unless there are circumstances to the contrary that would=
=20
indicate a different allocation over time. =20

I don't believe we'll be able to get any good feedback from them on the=20
chokepoint issue.  It boils down to how blatantly you want to skew the=20
payments and whether they or FERC compliance auditors ever stumble across i=
t=20
in an audit.  If Accounting is not aware of such a contract with skewed=20
payments, then we would not be in a position to accrue expense on an=20
appropriate straight line basis over the life of the contract. =20

As to the issue of whether or not ENA should be a party to the transaction,=
 I=20
did not seek AA advice on this issue, but I do believe that use of ENA as t=
he=20
counterparty would double the chances for having the issue brought up in an=
=20
AA audit, since the issue could also surface in conjunction with AA's audit=
=20
of ENA.

1-12. Facility Management Arrangements
In a typical facilities management arrangement, the vendor purchases from a=
=20
company ("customer") its existing data processing equipment and hires all o=
r=20
some of the customer's data processing personnel. The vendor is then engage=
d=20
to provide information technology services to the customer for an extended=
=20
period of time (typically 5 to 10 years).

Company's Obligation Under the Service Contract
Obligations under executory agreements that are contingent upon services to=
=20
be rendered in the future are not liabilities and should not be recorded=20
except to the extent losses are inherent in such commitments. No liability=
=20
should be recognized for a customer's future obligation under an informatio=
n=20
technology services contract unless it becomes probable that the customer=
=20
will incur a penalty or loss from termination of the contract.

An issue arises as to whether the sale of existing data processing equipmen=
t=20
or facilities to a vendor that uses the purchased property to provide=20
information technology services to the seller is, in substance, a sale and=
=20
leaseback transaction that should be accounted for separately under SFAS No=
s.=20
13, 28 and 98. An information technology services contract typically can be=
=20
distinguished from a lease for the following reasons:

The vendor is responsible for the financing and operation of the data=20
processing equipment and facilities.
Data processing personnel are employees of the vendor.
The vendor is not required to use the equipment purchased from the customer=
=20
to provide service to that customer and may use the equipment to serve othe=
r=20
customers.
The vendor provides guarantees regarding performance and retains risks=20
related to the operating costs.
The vendor is not entitled to payment unless the required services are=20
provided to the customer in accordance with specified standards.

As a result, generally we believe the sale of data processing equipment or=
=20
facilities pursuant to a facilities management arrangement should not be=20
unbundled and accounted for separately as a sale and leaseback transaction.=
=20
However, because of the customer's continuing involvement with the equipmen=
t=20
of facilities sold, we believe any gain or loss on the sale should be=20
recognized in a manner consistent with the guidance prescribed in paragraph=
=20
33  of SFAS No. 13 for sale-leaseback transactions.

Some outsourcing arrangements may involve dedicated equipment (so called,=
=20
"exclusive use equipment") that is physically located on the company's=20
premises and cannot be used by the vendor to service other customers. For=
=20
example, a significant amount of the equipment may consist of terminals or=
=20
work-stations operated by the company's personnel, such as point-of-sale=20
registers in a department store or design terminals in an architectural fir=
m,=20
and the vendor may have only limited ability to replace or remove that=20
dedicated equipment because of contractual provisions or practical=20
considerations. In these situations, the customer effectively contracts to=
=20
use the terminals or workstations for a specified period =01* a lease. Such=
=20
dedicated equipment should be unbundled from the information technology=20
services contract and accounted for separately as a sale and leaseback=20
transaction. In unbundling the equipment from the information technology=20
services contract, the portion of the fee paid to the vendor applicable to=
=20
the equipment lease should be estimated using whatever means are appropriat=
e=20
in the circumstances and the lease accounted for separately according to it=
s=20
classification (capital or operating)

If significant, the customer should consider disclosing its commitment unde=
r=20
the outsourcing arrangement. The disclosures required for any portion of th=
e=20
arrangement determined by the customer to be a lease are set forth in=20
paragraph 16  of SFAS No. 13.

Gain or Loss on Sale of Equipment or Facilities
Because of the interdependence of terms, there is no practicable and=20
objective way to separate the sale of data processing equipment, software,=
=20
facilities or "know how" from the service contract. For that reason, we=20
believe any gain or loss from the sale of data processing equipment,=20
software, facilities or "know how" pursuant to a facilities management=20
arrangement should be recognized similar to a sale and operating leaseback=
=20
transaction as prescribed in paragraph 33  of SFAS No. 13. That is, gain fr=
om=20
the sale should be recognized currently only to the extent such gain exceed=
s=20
the present value of the minimum payments due over the term of the service=
=20
contract, discounted using the seller's incremental borrowing rate. Any gai=
n=20
not recognized at the inception of the contract should be deferred and=20
amortized ratably over the term of the service contract as an adjustment to=
=20
the minimum annual fees expensed in each period. Further, if the fair value=
=20
of the property at the time of the transaction is less than its undepreciat=
ed=20
cost, a loss should be recognized immediately for the difference between th=
e=20
undepreciated cost and fair value, regardless of the amount actually receiv=
ed=20
from the vendor for the property transferred.

Expense Recognition
Payment terms may include fixed annual fees that increase or decrease over=
=20
the term of the service contract. These payment terms may be structured in =
a=20
high-to-low pattern (that is, to recognize the favorable price/performance=
=20
curve of data processing equipment/capabilities) or a low-to-high pattern=
=20
(that is, to recognize the estimated effects of inflation on future costs).=
=20
Further, there may be payment escalation provisions in the service contract=
=20
indexed to inflation and/or the volume of transactions processed by the=20
vendor. We believe total minimum fees to be paid pursuant to an information=
=20
technology services contract should be charged to expense on a straight-lin=
e=20
basis over the term of the contract unless the level of service performed b=
y=20
the vendor is not uniform over the term of the contract. If the level of=20
service is not uniform over the term of the contract, the amount of fees=20
attributable to the additional services to be rendered by the vendor should=
=20
be expensed ratably over the time periods the additional services are=20
provided by the vendor. The amount of fees attributable to the additional=
=20
services should be based on their relative fair value, as determined at the=
=20
inception of the contract, to the fair value of all services to be provided=
=20
by the vendor over the term of the contract.

The "term" of the information technology services contract includes the fix=
ed=20
non-cancelable term of the contract plus all periods, if any, for which=20
failure to renew the contract imposes a "penalty" on the customer in such a=
n=20
amount that a renewal appears, at the inception of the contract, to be=20
reasonably assured. The expression "penalty" should be interpreted broadly =
to=20
include requirements that can be imposed on the customer (a) by the vendor=
=20
(for example, a monetary penalty for not renewing the contract) or (b) by=
=20
factors outside the contract to disburse cash, forego an economic benefit o=
r=20
suffer an economic detriment. Factors to consider in determining if an=20
economic detriment may be incurred include the uniqueness of the equipment =
or=20
software, the "know how" of the vendor, the availability of comparable=20
replacement systems and data processing personnel or vendors, the disruptio=
n=20
to the company's business or service to its customers if the contract were=
=20
not renewed and the willingness of the customer to bear the cost associated=
=20
with replacing the vendor (either by bringing the functions in-house or by=
=20
engaging another vendor). The term of the contract should also include all=
=20
periods, if any, (a) covered by bargain renewal options, (b) preceding the=
=20
date at which the customer can exercise a bargain purchase option to=20
reacquire the equipment, software, facilities or data processing personnel=
=20
(see Interpretation 5(d)-3, "Bargain Purchase Option 'as Encumbered' by Fix=
ed=20
Price Renewals "), and (c) during which a loan from the customer to the=20
vendor or a guarantee of the vendor's debt, directly or indirectly related =
to=20
the leased property, is expected to be outstanding or in effect.

Future fee increases that depend upon a factor that exists at the inception=
=20
of the agreement, such as the consumer price index or the volume of=20
transactions processed by the vendor, should be included in the computation=
=20
of fixed fees to be recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of th=
e=20
contract based on the factor at the inception of the agreement. Increases o=
r=20
decreases in fees that result from changes occurring subsequent to the=20
inception of the agreement should be included in the determination of incom=
e=20
as they accrue.

Incentives Offered by the Vendor
A facilities management arrangement may include incentives for the customer=
=20
to sign the service contract. For example, an incentive implicit in a=20
facility management arrangement may be the vendor's assumption of the=20
severance liability for existing data processing personnel not retained by=
=20
the vendor. Other types of incentives include up-front cash payments by the=
=20
vendor, below market financing, excessive rental paid to lease space from t=
he=20
customer, equity transactions (purchase or sales/grants) with the customer =
at=20
off-market terms, and so forth.

The fact that the vendor "assumes" a loss or cost does not negate the=20
customer's need to immediately recognize the loss or expense. The amount of=
=20
the loss or cost assumed by the vendor should be estimated by the customer=
=20
using whatever means makes sense in the particular facts and circumstances.=
=20
The customer should recognize the loss immediately by a charge to income an=
d=20
the offsetting deferred credit (incentive) should be recognized ratably ove=
r=20
the term of the service contract in proportion to the fixed contractual fee=
s=20
expensed in each period. Similarly, incentives that result in the recogniti=
on=20
of an asset or a deferred charge should be reported on the balance sheet at=
=20
the amount received or fair value, and the offsetting credit (incentive)=20
recognized ratably over the term of the service contract.

Again, we may want to take advantage of the recent bump in gas prices due to 
the cold snap, to minimize our fixed gas payment and heat rate with ECS.  At 
the very least someone should have the mandate to keep their eye on prices 
and determine when to lock-in.  

Take a look at the attached presentation.  Effect of changing gas prices on 
Gallup is demonstrated on the first page lower left table.  Give me a call if 
you have any questions.

For those of you who didn't have the patience/patriotism to listen to your 
president for the whole hour and a half last night, let me share a 
highlight:  Clinton announced a new $1 billion program for economic 
development on the reservations.  Langley may be onto something.  If he/we 
can get the first deal done in New Mexico and assuming Gore wins, there may 
be opportunities to replicate the deal elsewhere.  I'm thinking of tribal 
lands in Minnesota, Wisconsin, S. Dakota, etc.  Perhaps Bill should call 
Chairman Ken and talk to him about changing sides.  Notice that I'm not 
volunteering to make that phone call. DF

For those of you who didn't have the patience/patriotism to listen to your 
president for the whole hour and a half last night, let me share a 
highlight:  Clinton announced a new $1 billion program for economic 
development on the reservations.  Langley may be onto something.  If he/we 
can get the first deal done in New Mexico and assuming Gore wins, there may 
be opportunities to replicate the deal elsewhere.  I'm thinking of tribal 
lands in Minnesota, Wisconsin, S. Dakota, etc.  Perhaps Bill should call 
Chairman Ken and talk to him about changing sides.  Notice that I'm not 
volunteering to make that phone call. DF  

I'm not sure if this is automatic or if you have to actually do something to 
make sure it happens, but either way, THANK YOU!  Flying on this flight 
stinks and it would be even worse in the back of the bus!!  DF

Great!  We've got a meeting set for 9 am on Wed on the regulatory structure 
of the pipeline.  Also, I talked to Kevin and Tim separately today on the 
market research issue.  I think Tim could probably identify the specific 
electric rate PNM charges DOE at Sandia and DOD at Kirtland as well as the 
general tariff rate for large industrial service.  If we are lucky, there 
might be some info in PNM's last rate case on the discounted electric rates 
it gives specific large industrials (if any).  Obviously, any info on gas or 
elec. loads and rates would be useful.  Kevin, I told Tim you'd give him a 
call to convey further thoughts, but this is probably enough to get Tim 
started.

I got a call this afternoon from Tino.  He asked our help on right of way 
issues with BNSF.  Could Steve, Kevin or Lorraine take point on trying to 
find out if we or anyone within Enron has a good contact at BNSF that we 
could use?  Lets keep all such external contacts very discreet to avoid 
tipping PNM that Enron is involved.  Just in general on the confidentiality 
issue, Tim reminded me of an important date we all need to keep in mind--the 
current leglislative session in Santa Fe ends Feb. 17.  We need to be 
absolutely sure that we don't tip PNM off that we are talking to Langley 
before then so we don't get them interested in the leglislative fix we are 
supporting on the Plains-Tri State merger.  Tim believes PNM could spike that 
leglislative fix in a heartbeat if they wanted to.  That issue is real 
immediate dollars, so lets not let a future deal screw up a present deal 
(even a lawyer like me can figure out the cost benefit on that situation).

Tino had a new fact to work into the economics:  DOE has 6000MMBtu/d of pure 
gas load at Sandia in addition to elec. load.  No number yet on Kirtland gas 
load.  Also, Tino has heard that a guy named Jeff Sturba will likely replace 
Montoya at PNM before the end of the year.  Has anyone else heard that?  Do  
we know him?     

I told Tino that one of us would give him a call back by the end of the week 
just to report in on our analysis.  At minimum, we can probably pass on the 
name of a contact at Enron Wind for Tino to bother on the windmill thing.  
Turned out that the wind pilot project is on the Rosebud reservation in S.D. 
and has nothing to do with the Albuquerque project anyway.  Sorry about the 
random message but thats how my brain is working today.  DF

Attached please find the "To Do" list for our Albuquerque project - 
tentatively named Pueblo.  I will summarize the meeting notes and forward 
them soon.

Attached is a draft of an "operational control agreement" designed to address 
the concerns stated in FERC's order approving the Gallup project.  We may or 
may not actually file it as part of the required compliance filing, but will 
describe it in detail in the "report" FERC ordered us to file.  The 
substantive terms track the language that is already in the O&M Agreement.  
Please give me or Susan a call with any questions or comments you may have.  
We expect to file this by I believe the 12th of Feb.  or so.  Thanks.  DF

Mark, I understand we need to act very quickly once we have turned you loose 
to price the swap.  I think this is a Harris and Nelson call, so lets talk 
tomorrow.  I'll look at the contracts again to verify our risks in locking in 
before we are 100% sure we are going ahead with the project.  DF

Mark Knippa@ECT
01/31/2000 04:27 PM
Just wanted to communicate that I contacted Drew earlier today to suggest that
we check the pricing and execute the Conversion Agreement for Gallup.   As you
guys know, the recent price valuation for deliveries associated with Gallup 
have been 
well below the earlier market quotes.  

 Given the short term market reaction to the colder weather, we may be able 
establish
prices similar to the earlier market quote.   Based on the response from Dave 
and Drew
I have requested the pricing and hope to have that information by mid-day 
tomorrow.

If the cost savings are worth a little bit of hassle, we can do this.  We'll 
need to make a FERC filing by the end of the 1st Q 2000 to identify the 
"shared facilities."  Also, if you decide to go forward, don't do it until 
1-1-2000 so we don't have to scramble to get the info in front of FERC this 
quarter.  Let me and Maria know what you decide to do and we'll arrange a 
briefing on the specific rules to be aware of and we'll make sure we 
understand the situation fully so we can properly disclose to FERC what is 
up.  Please call with any questions. Thanks.  DF   

Rich Jolly on 12/15/99 06:38:43 PM
Drew are we OK to go with this? We don't have any "confidential 
transportation-related information in our office. We do have some operating 
agreements and contracts but they aren't confidential that I know of.  
Rich

Drew Fossum
12/08/99 05:18 PM

EES is a marketing affiliate, so we do need to be careful about shared 
computer systems, phone systems, staplers, paper clips, etc.  If Rich and his 
office have no "confidential transportation-related information"  we might be 
able to do it, otherwise, the hassles and expense of building marketing 
affiliate firewalls might make it counterproductive.   I'm forwarding this to 
the experts for a quick yup or nope on this.  Thanks. DF  

Michel Nelson
12/08/99 05:24 PM
Rich - Per your phone mail, I see no reason why an EES employee couldn't 
office in your Region Office, providing he/she pays rent and we not break any 
market affiliate rules (if they apply here).

Drew - Saving $ for Enron. Any issues I'm overlooking?

Its a railroad.  Now known as BNSFCN (Burlington Northern Santa Fe Canadian 
National).  DF

   
	
	

Drew, what is BNSF?

??????  I thought our folks had a pretty clear understanding of their 
respective jurisdiction and expertise.  Apparently not.  Lets talk about the 
specifics of this incident when I get back to the office.  Actually, I'll see 
you tomorrow Lou and maybe we can dial Dot in.  Thanks. DF

Drew and Dot,
 It appears that one of our commercial/regulatory lawyers signed off on a 
right-of-way agreement that they simply should not have, and in my opinion is 
outside their area of expertise and practice.  I am going to follow up with 
the individual on this and it also appears that they were at least in part, a 
victim of a calculated "snow-job" by our brethern over at Enron Northern 
America as well as a misunderstanding of the marketing affilate rule.  Along 
these lines, I am concerned that some of our folks in an effort to be 
responsive to our clients may feel that they have to provide advice in areas 
where they should be seeking the advice of those who practice in that area on 
a routine basis.  I think it would be helpful for the three of us to 
establish guidelines for our folks on when we would expect them to seek 
guidance from others who practice in certain primary areas of 
responsibility.  For example, if an environmental question comes up, I would 
expect any lawyer in our group to talk to Mr. Reich or myself.  If an issue 
arose with respect to Northern's tariff, one would expect that the lawyer 
would speak to Maria, Drew or Dari.  

 Let me know what you think and we will go from there.

Lou

I'm good on this.  DF

TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST

Phillips Petroleum Company's discount letter was recently approved by 
Transwestern's Officer group.   However, Phillips has now requested that 
Transwestern include language in the discount letter which guarantees the 
applicable discount rate in the event that Transwestern's minimum Tariff rate 
were to be higher than the discount rate.  I have underlined the additional 
language  in the attached revised discount letter (language will not be 
underlined when provided to Phillips).  The inclusion of this language would 
require Transwestern to file the discount as a negotiated rate prior to gas 
flow under the term of the amendment.  Transwestern would file this discount 
on January 31, 2001.

Please review the attached document and indicate approval via REPLY WITH 
HISTORY.
All Officer approvals will be sent to Bill Cordes for final President Level 
approval.

The problem is back.  For a while I couldn't send an email to the wrong Steve 
even if I tried, but now the computer's doing its own thing again.  I'll try 
to remember to use "steven" but my recollection is that that didn't always 
work either.  Thanks.  DF
Steve Harris@ECT
02/01/2000 08:33 AM
Drew, I've forwaded the "real" Steven Harris this e-mail.  I think the main 
problem w/ the e-mail 
confusion is the name ending (i.e. his is Steven and ends with an "n", and 
mine is just Steve w/ 
an "e").  Please update your address database for this change.

Thanks,
Steve

   

Mark, I understand we need to act very quickly once we have turned you loose 
to price the swap.  I think this is a Harris and Nelson call, so lets talk

How much time did you say you will have????  If you can get through  a tenth 
of that in 5 minutes, you are much quicker than I!  Also, in an amazing 
coincidence, your outline looks very similar to MKM's speech for the Canuck 
gas conference next week.  Good job on both!  DF

Lorraine Cross has invited me to participate in an "outreach meeting" with 
Dan Larcamp and his team on February 10.  Also participating in the outreach 
meeting will be Williams (Judy Neason/Scott Turkington); El Paso (Peggy Heeg) 
and Coastal (Dan Collins).    

The meeting comes at Larcamp's request and is part of a series of outreach 
meetings that OMTR is having with other industry groups including producers, 
gas and electric utilities and marketers.

The purpose of the meeting is not to discuss positions in the current gas 
NOPR (as OMTR is assuming that the 
Commission will take action on the gas NOPR in February).  The purpose of the 
meeting is discuss how markets are changing and talk about upcoming 
regulatory issues.

There will be no formal presentations or slides.  Lorraine will give a 5 
minute overview on INGAA's themes on regulatory policy (these theme's are per 
the Board of Directors' Task Force on FERC Policy):

Competition 
Re-contracting challenges
Rate discounting

Each of the four participating companies will have 5 minutes to relate their 
pipeline experiences to these themes.  I would propose to focus my remarks on 
topic of the continuous contracting state of the pipeline capacity market.  
The point is to tell Larcamp that we are not looking for a regulatory answer 
to this short-term, continuous contracting environment.  What we are seeking 
is the rate and service flexibility we need to meet these challenges.  
Examples will be the new services flexibility that we continue to seek on TW 
(Enhanced Firm Backhaul, Limited Firm).  And, the pricing changes we seek on 
NNG, including seasonal rates.  Again, I don't plan to have any formal 
slides, but here is the outline of the message.  I would also propose to add 
some specific examples/data on capacity release, recent auction experiences 
and re-contracting statistics.

FYI: 

El Paso plans to talk about the role that negotiated rate transactions will 
increasingly play in the market place, citing their experiences in placing El 
Paso capacity and their negotiated rate contract extensions on Tenn/E. Tenn.

Williams tentatively plans to talk about additional flexibility on offshore 
pipelines, about the need for more self-implementing flexibility, and the 
impacts of regulatory delay.

Please let me know by Monday, February 7 is you have any concerns about the 
general direction of my remarks or about any other issues that you would have 
me bring up with Larcamp and team.

  

pls print.  thanks. DF

02/02/2000 03:35 PM
Now given the close of business today and the concern regarding price movement
since Monday I have requested new pricing information again.  The appearance 
is
that the numbers have moved.  I suspect that we have missed the upward price 
movement
associated with the "Winter of 2000" the last few days.  

I hope we can get a defined process to capture a short term price movement or 
we may 
be faced with gas prices between March and April (which is the in-service 
targeted) that 
we don't even want to mention.  

Let me know.

How bout 1?  Thanks. DF

pls give that copy of Gorak's sba filing to maria.  I think I left it with 
you and Mary.  df 

Randy, this is the issue I left you the voice mail on.  Article 6 of the 
Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) 
with ECS obligates ECS to "work in good faith with CDEC" to establish an 
automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading 
conditions on CDEC's system.  We had a pretty good idea when we signed the 
contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start 
date, so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to 
"assist [Transwestern] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same 
result and will hold harmless and keep [Transwestern] whole for all cost and 
expenses" associated with the manual system.  We will fight with them about 
who owes the $200k that James mentions below based on their failure to 
"assist" us in managing the cost.  In the mean time, we need to make sure 
that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to 
mitigate future costs.  Do we have someone who is watching this out there?  
We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to 
manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.  James 
had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement--I 
guess between ECS and Transwestern--that would permit ECS to communicate to 
us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC.  That sounds like a 
BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we 
can figure out a solution.  Thanks.  DF 

James Centilli
12/14/2000 02:49 PM
Would you please contact Gerald Nemec and review the Gallup Compression 
Service Contract in respect to the Load Control Management.  My understanding 
was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC's online profile in order 
for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC's peak 
load periods.  We have not received access to this information which has 
resulted so far in additional electric cost of $200,987.33 for the period of 
July through September.  Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder 
of this year, that I have not been able to review yet.  This cost is 
averaging $79,000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have 
in August and September.

Great--the front running ideas now are (1) an operational sale in the San 
Juan of the 20,000 we recieve there and an offsetting operational purchase 
(less basis differential) at some other location (i.e., the permian) thus 
freeing up 20,000/d of physical space on the lateral; or (2) an exchange 
agreement under which a party takes our 20,000 in the SJ and gives us back 
the same amount, less basis differential, in the permian.  The SJ 20,000 
would still physically flow down the lateral, but it would have to move under 
someone's transport agreement--in other words it wouldn't be incremental to 
our 850,000/d of firm transport obligations.  I don't know if this will work 
yet, but it was a creative idea by Keith and Donna.  I'm eager to talk to 
Steve Harris and Susan about this because it sounds similar to a scenario 
that Susan researched  a while ago and that Lindy explained to me--maybe 
there are problems or solutions yet to be considered.  DF     

Keith Petersen
12/14/2000 04:07 PM
Today we had meeting to discuss the filing for the 10 MMcf/d expansion.  
Donna covered her needs so that a filing draft can be sent out on 12/15/00.  
There was discussion on the possibility of having an Open Season.  Drew 
covered his thoughts of not having an Open Season and building the project At 
Risk.  Once we are ready to put the changes into service we would post the 
capacity.  At this time Donna has received all of her information is putting 
into a draft.

After our meeting this morning, we discussed the possibility of moving only 
the 850 MMcf/d on the San Juan lateral and not include the 20 MMcf/d of 
fuel.  If we are to only move the 850 MMcf/d, the changing of horsepower may 
not be needed (I have a call into Ron Matthews for the answer).  The reason 
we are asking this question is save capital dollars and speed up the in 
service date.  Planning has said that any change we make at the Gallup 
station will not work for the main expansion.  Drew and Maria are looking for 
a way to bring the fuel or a portion of the 850 MMcf/d in at another point 
(Drew to explain in more detail).  The reason we are asking these questions 
is that engineering says the project will not be ready for service until the 
third quarter of 2001.  We may miss an opportunity.

I will be in early tomorrow or you can reach me at home tonight after 9:00 PM 
(896-1025), if have any questions.

Keith

I think that is exactly right.  I suspect that the marketing guys could work 
up a simple formula for determining our course of action depending on the 
size of the revenue opportunity vs. the power cost/penalty.  Thanks. df

Drew, I plan to discuss this with Rich Jolly, and will call you with our 
thoughts. I would suggest our plan be such that we do not just aoutomatically 
shut down during these periods but work with marketing to create a cost vs. 
benefit profile of when/if it may make sense to operate even when in a peak 
state?

We are asking the Marketing VPs to review the policy and accompanying 
procedures with an eye toward recommending the trading limits as allowed by 
the policy.   Also, please note the last page of the procedure document which 
provides an example of the Hedge Documentation, (provided to us by the 
Corporate SFAS 133 team) that will be required to maintain hedge accounting. 

Drew, Tony, Lee, Bob and myself thank you for your input before the documents 
go for final approval.  If you feel a meeting is needed to discuss the 
content, it will be arraigned.

Sack, lets see you try this with United flight #1292 from Memphis to Peoria.  
Hope all goes well in the airline bidness and hope to see you soon.  It won't 
be on one of your flights, however, as I've instructed my travel staff to 
avoid United just in case I get you and you decide to try out your old top 
gun moves on a DC10 or whatever the hell you fly!  DF

My group is frequently asked to provide the top ten or twenty five customers 
(based on revenues) on our pipelines.   Attached are two files that we just 
provided to general accounting based on 1999 revenues.  If you recall being 
asked these questions, you may want to print off the attached spreadsheets or 
save this lotus note to a file for future reference.

Nice thought,  but Lay spiked the Treasury rumor right after I started it.  
Bummer, that bag boy job would have been a lot of fun.  And to think I 
started out as Dave Hooker's bag boy!!!  DF

Ken will likely require professional counsel as Sec. Treas. Could be an
opportunity for the Fossum's to return to the toilet bowl, I mean DC, as
Ken's bag boy.

Dammit Jenkins, don't even joke about stuff like that!  If the market ever
realized that I worked here, the stock would go down $10!!!  You think Lay
is taking the first step toward Sec. Treas. in the new Bush admin???
That's the rumor I heard a month ago.  Hope all goes well for you in sunny
hotlanta.  Its 5 below zero here today so your whole Georgia good ole' boy
lifestyle thing sounds pretty attractive.  AMF  DF

I trust you guys saw this on the wires today:

Enron's stock was off $3-3/16 or 4.1 percent in afternoon trading at $74,
following an announcement that Jeff Skilling will become its new chief
executive officer on Feb. 12. An analyst, who asked not to be named, said
that it had been widely assumed that Drew Fossum would be named CEO;
therefore, the company's stock traded lower on the news.

here it is.  df 
	
	

Attached is a draft application, including exhibits, requesting FERC approval 
to replace the existing 10,000 HP driver at the Gallup Compressor Station 
with a 15,000 HP (Service factor 1.1).  Please review, provide coments, and 
sign and fax the FERC authorization form (7592 in Omaha) to me no later than 
3 P.M. on Tuesday, 12/19.  Any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.  Donna

On Thursday last week the Commission eliminated the old "Texas Eastern" rule 
that required pipelines to obtain prior FERC approval before contracting for 
transportation and storage capacity on upstream or downstream pipelines.  The 
new rule allows pipelines to acquire and use such capacity without going to 
FERC first.  The rule does reiterate that bundled sales of gas are still 
prohibited, and further provides that the acquiring pipeline will be 
financially at risk for the costs of the acquired capacity.  Interestingly, 
the acquiring pipeline apparently has the option of selling the acquired 
capacity under its own rate schedules or of releasing the capacity pursuant 
to its capacity release program.  The order is silent on whether the price 
cap applies to short term releases of acquired capacity.   While we are still 
reviewing the order and may provide additional guidance at  a later time, I'd 
emphasize for now that our normal contract approval procedures and authority 
thresholds should be deemed to apply to capacity contracts.   For example, 
the "Approval Authorization for Cash Expenditures" dated Feb. 3, 2000 
provides Dave and Steve with authority up to $250,000 on operating expense 
obligations.  

Please contact me if you have any questions on this matter.  DF       

I agree with Danny's email that the key timetable issue for the incremental 
10,000/day appears to be lead time on fabrication and delivery of the 
15,000hp motor.  It was my understanding that the long lead time items were 
going to be ordered shortly (if they haven't been already) and that we'd take 
the financial risk.  If that is our approach, the regulatory approvals won't 
be the critical path item they usually are.  I've reviewed the FERC 
application and we should be able to file it shortly, perhaps with a request 
for temporary emergency certification if we decide that would expedite 
things.  Additionally, we are looking at transactions that would allow us to 
avoid physically hauling the 20,000/day of fuel down the San Juan lateral.  
If we could unload our fuel requirement from the San Juan, the additional 
horsepower at Gallup might provide some additional flexibility or additional 
capacity.   I'll talk to Steve today to make sure we are doing everything 
possible to expedite these efforts.  DF

I believe that Phil Lowry is looking at ways to get some additional capacity 
out of the system as well.  We want to expedite these efforts too..  I would 
like to see an application filed filed by January 31st to get 30 to 50 
MMCF/D. 

Steve Harris and Phil Lowry should have the lead to get this done.  I am 
willing to construct at risk but want to see the financials as well.

Here is the latest on timetable on Gallup.  Susan, please get your edits on 
the draft to Donna and me by tomorrow.  (call me if you need more guidance on 
what I have in mind).   Donna or Keith, please let me know what additioonal 
information you are waiting on and what the likely timetable for filing is.  
Also, Keith, what was the answer from ops/planning on whether unloading the 
20,000 of fuel from the San Juan would help with more flexibility or 
capacity?  If you haven't been able to get a meaningful answer, let me know 
who to call and I'll try.

Danny, I'm resending as I had the same problem Cindy did.  I'll give you a 
call later today after I've talked to Harris to discuss the various Gallup 
scenarios to make sure you and I are on the same page.   The plan that makes 
the most sense in my mind is to ram the 10,000/d  project through asap, with 
no firm contracts to preserve our options on a NEWCO structure.  We'll 
simultaneously implement a new approach on San Juan fuel transport if 
possible and then throw the big expansion into the hopper at FERC in January 
as Stan suggested.  I hope that timetable is doable--it all depends on 
planning/ops deciding what they want to build and then clearing our financial 
hurdles.   DF

Latest Tino-gram:  Apparently high power prices at 4 Corners have DOE excited 
about the project all of a sudden.  The latest configuration is in the 
300-380 mw range.  Tino needs us to check if the ENA guys would be interested 
in buying the surplus capacity on a demand charge basis (I think these are 
basically tolling agreements--ENA would pay a monthly capacity reservation 
charge per KW of capacity and then pay actual fuel and variable cost for 
power that is actually dispatched)  $7/kw if the thing is simple cycle or 
$10/kw if combined cycle.  Variable cost would be $.005/kwh and fuel is 
whatever it is--ENA's problem.   I'm trying to get ahold of Tino to confirm, 
but I think these are prices at the plant, not FOB 4 Corners.  

Please give me a call and see if you can get a quick reaction from our ENA 
guys.  Thanks.  DF 

Cool.  Do we have any most favored nations problem when we start doing 
backhaul service or have we already crossed that bridge with the EFBH deal?  
DF

   
	
	

PG&E wants to buy backhaul service!

Is the difference between the first two cases and the second two cases the 
higher 775 lb suction pressure that we hope we could get from pigging the 
line?  If so, does this email say anything about whether we could get 
10,000mmbtu/d to the Cal. border assuming the pigging successfully gets us to 
775 lbs?  Lets talk to McShane tomorrow.  Thanks.. DF

Drew, the information below is the same as Terry Galassinni gave me.  It 
looks though as the HP is still short, but I maybe reading it wrong.  

Keith

Bob McChane
12/19/2000 03:44 PM
The following is information requested by Terry Galassini:

Operating Points 1A and 1B have a 750 Psig line inlet pressure and differ 
only in gas suction temperature, 75 Degrees F for 1A and 80 Degrees F for 
1B.  Both conditions can operate with the current wheel at Gallup; however, 
Rolls would have to agree to a faster spin of the current compressor wheel as 
explained in the cases.  Without approval from Rolls, a new aero, $125,000, 
would be required.The motor horsepower is the crital component.  Mr 
Eisenstein will have to comment on motor capability.
 
Operating Point #1A

750 Psig - Line Suction Pressure
75 Degrees F - Gas Suction Temperature
970 Psig - Line Discharge Pressure
850 MMcfd - Compressed Volume

Head = 12,442 Feet
Acfm = 10,827 Actual Ft3/Min?Gas Horsepower Required = 12,300 @ 80% (Required Power to Motor = 13,369 ?Hp/9,970 KW *)?Gas Horsepower Required = 12,456 @ 79% (Required Power to Motor = 13,539 ?Hp/10,100 KW *)?* Represents an 8% total motor, gearbox and compressor bearing losses.??Two options exist for this case.??The first is to increase the compressor wheel speed from its current maximum ?continuous 9,450 Rpm speed to 9,922 Rpm (+5%).  The wheel was shop tested to ?10,868 Rpm (+15%).  Rolls would have to advise the warranty and saftey ?considerations.  If agreed to by Rolls, the current wheel would need to ?operate at the following conditions to meet the above head and Acfm:??Compressor Speed = 9,625 Rpm (Approximate)?Motor Speed = 1,528 Rpm (Can the above horsepowers into the motor be acheived ?at this speed, Arnold????) ?Inlet velocity to compressor = 102.11 Ft3/Sec
Maximum Design is 120 Ft/Sec
Gallup Test Had 4 Points at or Above 102 Ft/Sec w/No vibration or Noise 
Problems.

The second is to purchase a new aero assembly, $125,000 and 20 - 24 weeks 
lead time.  A new aero would probably spin a little slower than the 9,625 Rpm 
suggested above.  This would put more emphasis on motor horsepower at a speed 
less than 1,528 as calculated above.  Again, Mr. Eisenstein would have to 
comment on motor capability.

Operating Point #1B

750 Psig - Line Suction Pressure
80 Degrees F - Gas Suction Temperature
970 Psig - Line Discharge Pressure
850 MMcfd - Compressed Volume

Problems.

The second is to purchase a new aero assembly, $125,000 and 20 - 24 weeks 
lead time.  A new aero would probably spin a little slower than the 9,675 Rpm 
suggested above.  This would put more emphasis on motor horsepower at a speed 
less than 1,536 as calculated above.  Mr. Eisenstein would have to comment on 
motor capability.

Operating Points 2A and 2B have a 775 Psig line inlet pressure and differ 
only in gas suction temperature, 75 Degrees F for 2A and 80 Degrees F for 
2B.  Both conditions can operate with the current wheel at Gallup at the 
current speed limit.  Whether or not the current motor at the site is capable 
of meeting the 2A and 2B conditions without modifications is left up to Mr. 
Eisenstein.  

Operating Point #2A

775 Psig - Line Suction Pressure
75 Degrees F - Gas Suction Temperature
970 Psig - Line Discharge Pressure
850 MMcfd - Compressed Volume

Head = 10,841 Feet

The current wheel would ?operate at the following conditions to meet the above head and Acfm:??Compressor Speed = 8,900 Rpm (Approximate)?Motor Speed = 1,413 Rpm (Can the above horsepowers into the motor be acheived ?at this speed, Arnold????) ?Inlet velocity to compressor = 98.57 Ft3/Sec

Absolutely.  I got a report yesterday on the 30-40 million/day that Phil and 
his guys may be able to squeeze out of the system with debottlenecking etc.  
We'll be ready to go to expedite any approvals that may be necessary on that 
project.  On the quick 10 million/day that we've been working on, there's a 
potential alternative to building more Gallup horsepower that may get us the 
10 million much quicker and at a lower cost.  Steve Harris and I talked about 
it yesterday and I hope we can run it to ground in a day or two.  We will be 
ready to file at FERC shortly on the 15,000 hp at Gallup if the alternative 
doesn't pan out.  We'll look at combining the 30-40 mm/d project with the 
Gallup compression for FERC filing purposes.  DF  

Stanley Horton
12/19/2000 06:15 PM
Lets make sure we are picking-up on the other ideas Phil has for getting 
additional capacity on Tw.  If any of his ideas require regulatory approval 
we will probably want to include in the same certificate application.

Pls get me in on the meetings with Galasinsi and Mcchane. df

Keith Petersen
12/20/2000 07:48 AM
Apparently, someone has told Stan that they can make some changes to the 
horsepower and some of the piping and increase thruput by 30 to 50 MMcf/d.  
Steve Harris told Drew that the theory had not been proven as of yet.  Steve 
was surprised with the announcement.  I'm told that Stan believes that 
operationaly we can be ready by the end of the first quarter of 2001.  
Apparently Stan has talked with someone at FERC about expidited treatment (I 
do not have confirmation on this. It is all hear say.).  Terry Galasinni and 
I have a meeting tomorrow (12/21/00 in the PM) to discuss what is happening 
and how we are to get the information quicker.

Donna is continuing to work on the 10 MMcf/d expansion.  Once we know exactly 
what is happening we will modify our filing to match.

An update on the possibility of moving 20 MMcf/d off the San Juan Lateral and 
the cleaning of the lateral.  I have talked with planning and they have 
confirmed that if we only flow 850 MMcf/d on the lateral and by cleaning the 
line they can increase the suction to the Gallup compressor to 775 psig, the 
existing equipment will work to gain the incremental 10 MMcf/d from east of 
Thoreau to the California border.  We are going to meet with Bob McChane 
today to discuss.

Keith

Absolutely.  I got a report yesterday on the 30-40 million/day that Phil
and his guys may be able to squeeze out of the system with debottlenecking
etc.  We'll be ready to go to expedite any approvals that may be necessary
on that project.  On the quick 10 million/day that we've been working on,
there's a potential alternative to building more Gallup horsepower that may
get us the 10 million much quicker and at a lower cost.  Steve Harris and I
talked about it yesterday and I hope we can run it to ground in a day or
two.  We will be ready to file at FERC shortly on the 15,000 hp at Gallup
if the alternative doesn't pan out.  We'll look at combining the 30-40 mm/d
project with the Gallup compression for FERC filing purposes.  DF

Lets make sure we are picking-up on the other ideas Phil has for getting
additional capacity on Tw.  If any of his ideas require regulatory approval
we will probably want to include in the same certificate application.

I'm glad to have Tino talk to him direct--tee it up that way if you can.  
Tino's new number is 913-441-1800 (ext. 109).  Thanks Kevin and have a great 
holiday!!

I left Steve Thome (503-539-2340) in Portland a voice msg on this.  He is 
travelling.  I'll check my voicemail while I'm out next week or feel free to 
have Tino call him direct.

Latest Tino-gram:  Apparently high power prices at 4 Corners have DOE excited 
about the project all of a sudden.  The latest configuration is in the 
300-380 mw range.  Tino needs us to check if the ENA guys would be interested 
in buying the surplus capacity on a demand charge basis (I think these are 
basically tolling agreements--ENA would pay a monthly capacity reservation 
charge per KW of capacity and then pay actual fuel and variable cost for 
power that is actually dispatched)  $7/kw if the thing is simple cycle or 
$10/kw if combined cycle.  Variable cost would be $.005/kwh and fuel is 
whatever it is--ENA's problem.   I'm trying to get ahold of Tino to confirm, 
but I think these are prices at the plant, not FOB 4 Corners.  

Please give me a call and see if you can get a quick reaction from our ENA 
guys.  Thanks.  DF 

I'm out the 28th but am glad to discuss today or the 27th if there is 
anything else I can add on the subject.  Thanks. dF

I thought I'd get the ball rolling and try to get this small group together 
next week to begin discussing the idea Drew had about selling the fuel on the 
San Juan Lateral to "free up" space which we could sell.  Is everyone 
available Thursday 12/28 at 10 am?  Please let me know.  Thanks.

Colder than shit on Fri-Sun.  Nice tomorrow.  I'm getting the urge to play 
hooky.  DF

Do we need to give notice to customers before we shut in receipt points due 
to off-spec gas?  Sec. 44 of the NN tariff implies to me that if a customer's 
gas has too much water, for example, we can shut it in at any time without 
notice.  Please confirm ASAP.  DF

Lets talk about this on the 4th or 5th.  I'll have Martha set up a meeting.=

Hi Rhonda,

 I know you are not the one who is working on this but I forgot who was....Can you tell me who and forward this email to that person.  I'm a little concerned about my State Income Tax deduction.  I have not yet seen any withdraws from my check and I know State of Oregon will charge you penalties if you exceed a certain amount per quarter.  Please look into this as soon as you can.  Thank You.

Virgina, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe BPA has special rules when energy is curtailed.  Instead of us charging them with liquidated damages, BPA will not bill for the hours curtailed.  I track and record the cuts by modifying the deal in deal scheduling so that settlement is aware of the cuts.

lisa  

I assume that on all cuts on COB deliveries that we are charging BPA liquidated damages. In this case $3.50/MWhr for 6/18. Please let me know if this is not the case. Also, how do we track and record COB non-delivery LD's for BPA's? 

We were cut 40 MW today by BPA for peak hours on 6/18 at COB on enpower deal number 305699. Lisa purchased replacement power from Avista at $30. Enpower 897712

We presold power to Avista at $33.50 for the month and are now buying it back from them at $30 to book out.  Of course, BPA should not charge us for the 27.25 supply price under their contract.

According to the scheduling sheet, deal#380414 is 400mw total.  This is a 50 mw deal.  25mw was booked out and 25 mw was physical under pwx tag.    Deal#381345 should be 600mw.

Hope this helps...

Lisa:

Houston found another small dispute for Dec. 2001 with BPA.  

Please see the attached.  

In sum, based on BPA's figures, it looks like we doubled up by adding numbers from the 25th to numbers for the 26th (hence, doubling the 26th)
According to them:

12/26
Deal 381345 = 600 MW total (not 1200) 
Deal 380414.1 = 200 MW total (not 400)

Please check the scheduling sheets and let me know if you agree.

Thanks!  Jenny

Portland Employees-

At this time Enron Portland has 5 parking spots allocated based on floor space and number of employees.  As UBS employees leave we do not automatically have the ability to take over their spots.  However, in renegotiating our lease with PGE we will address the possibility of taking over more that the 5 allocated spots.  We will keep you updated as to the progress of this.  For now, Khymberly Booth is checking into the availability of 1 or more of our spots and will offer any available spots to Portland employees based on Portland office seniority.  We will contact you individually if a spot becomes available.  If you have any questions please contact Kathy Sheppard or Khymberly Booth.

Thanks-

Thanks.

$2.00 is a fixed rate per MW.  It is a semi daily and monthly purchase.  In other words, we buy it daily, however they understand we need it on a monthly basis.  The price is the same for daily or monthly.  It seems rare we get cut on this transmission.  I've been here for about 4 months now and we have yet to be cut on this transmission.  This coming summer may be a different story.    Air Products is a Monday-Thursday deal.  We are currently purchasing at Midc to fill the position for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Hope this helps.

Lisa       

Thanks Lisa.  Is the $2 a fixed rate for every month or does it vary.  Also, do we buy that daily, monthly, or longer term than that?  Are there ever any problems with availability of the transmission (history of curtailments)?  Finally, what do we do with the extra power on the days Air Products doesn't take it (I think I remember the deal being for every day but Tuesdays and Wed or something strange like that)?  I know that is a lot of questions... Thanks for your help.

Steve

here you go
I purchase Snohomish Transmission to deliver power from MID C to Montana sys. The Transmission cost is $2.00 per mw. This cost is added in addition to the power price at MID C. The Air Products deal is at MID C.  We fill this position by purchasing at MID C.  I hope this helps. 

Lisa     
Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?
We are actually a little long (960 MWh) b/c of the Air Products deal that is a little unique ... what happens to this length?

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

If it's easier to explain over the phone, please give me a call at 713-853-4748.  Thanks for your help.

NUT AND HONEY....just being retarded again...sorry, didn't see your name on the last e-mail...so do you have any dirt to share with me?  What's up with the exec at EPME?  

lisa
already have it...........what kind of trouble are you getting into today?????
Thanks.

$2.00 is a fixed rate per MW.  It is a semi daily and monthly purchase.  In other words, we buy it daily, however they understand we need it on a monthly basis.  The price is the same for daily or monthly.  It seems rare we get cut on this transmission.  I've been here for about 4 months now and we have yet to be cut on this transmission.  This coming summer may be a different story.    Air Products is a Monday-Thursday deal.  We are currently purchasing at Midc to fill the position for Tuesday and Wednesday.  Hope this helps.

Lisa       

Thanks Lisa.  Is the $2 a fixed rate for every month or does it vary.  Also, do we buy that daily, monthly, or longer term than that?  Are there ever any problems with availability of the transmission (history of curtailments)?  Finally, what do we do with the extra power on the days Air Products doesn't take it (I think I remember the deal being for every day but Tuesdays and Wed or something strange like that)?  I know that is a lot of questions... Thanks for your help.

here you go
I purchase Snohomish Transmission to deliver power from MID C to Montana sys. The Transmission cost is $2.00 per mw. This cost is added in addition to the power price at MID C. The Air Products deal is at MID C.  We fill this position by purchasing at MID C.  I hope this helps.

Hi Lisa,

I am working on a Hedging Activity Report that will be sent to E&Y on a weekly basis.  I think Mo is out of the office so I heard that you might be the right person to ask for help.  For the first week, I am using a spreadsheet that Mo sent where he bought some July power at MID C.  It looks like the MID C power along with our NW Del length makes us flat for July at MID C and Montana System Border as well.  My questions are:

How does power flow between MID C and the other delivery points (like Montana)?
Do we incur a transmission cost on top of what he bought the power for?

  We are having a going away lunch for Susan Rance tomorrow, Thursday May 9, 2002 at the Rock Bottom Brewery.  The reservations are for 11:45 am and under Susan Rance's name.  They have requested to have only one check for the table.

On April 21st and April 22nd, Pat Kelley from BPA prescheduling group called and informed me we were curtailed by a total of 12 mw for HE 7-22 for April 22nd at COB.  Accordingly, we purchased 12 mw from Avista to cover our position.  At 1:00 p.m, April 22, Rob called from BPA and informed me they made a mistake with the hours of the curtailment and that it was only supposed to be cut HE 7-20 and not HE 21-22.  Therefore, BPA will not charge 12 mw for 2 hours on April 22nd.

The deal numbers are as follows:  deal#153325(2mw),153327(2mw),305699(4mw) and 305700(4mw)

If you have any questions, please see me.

Lisa:

Do you know if this issue was resolved ---did we verify how we charge BPA for LDs?

Thanks!  Jenny

What matters is what the contract indicates. What is the Enpower deal confirmation number? I will have someone pull the contract to determine EPMI's rights as it relates to charging BPA LD's.

Virgina, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe BPA has special rules when energy is curtailed.  Instead of us charging them with liquidated damages, BPA will not bill for the hours curtailed.  I track and record the cuts by modifying the deal in deal scheduling so that settlement is aware of the cuts.

lisa  

I assume that on all cuts on COB deliveries that we are charging BPA liquidated damages. In this case $3.50/MWhr for 6/18. Please let me know if this is not the case. Also, how do we track and record COB non-delivery LD's for BPA's? 

We were cut 40 MW today by BPA for peak hours on 6/18 at COB on enpower deal number 305699. Lisa purchased replacement power from Avista at $30. Enpower 897712

We presold power to Avista at $33.50 for the month and are now buying it back from them at $30 to book out.  Of course, BPA should not charge us for the 27.25 supply price under their contract.

Mo Elafandi 

I'll do it for a small fee :-) Hope all's well.

DUDE, I'LL MEET YOU AT YOUR HOUSE.  I WANT TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.
Right on, works for me, just call me when you get off and I can meet you there, or we can meet at the house, I live a couple blocks from there.
Just take Macadam south all the way out, it turns into Highway 43, and follow it through Lake Oswego.  Once you pass Marylhurst College, you'll see a Burgerville on your left, Buggati's will be just past the Burgerville about a block and 1/2 on the left. It has a green and white sign in front.  If there is no parking available in the front lot, you can park in the Starbuck's and McDonald's lot.

If you want to come to house  - go about a half a block past Buggatti's, you will see McDonald's, that's Walling Way, turn left and follow the road down to Old River Rd., turn left onto Old River and go over 3 speed bumps.  Robin View Drive will be the next street on your right, turn right and we are the third house on the right, 3680 Robin View Dr.  Blue/Green house with white trim and bricks lining the yard.

	Market Participants:

	Please assure that this information is forwarded to your respective
Pre-Scheduling, Real Time Dispatch and Metering Operations!!! 

	The transition to Daylight Savings Time is rapidly approaching.  In
preparation ISO Market Operations has provided the following Scheduling
Procedure to help assure a smooth transition.  The Scheduling Procedure is
the same one used in 2001. 

		CAISO Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time
Transition 

		The following is a brief explanation of how SC's should
prepare schedules for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI)
system for the upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on
4/7/01.

		When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for
Trade Date 4/7/01, which is considered a "Short" day, SC's should  schedule
all 24 hours of information with the data for HE03 being zero.

		The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data
from/to the SI database for the "Short" day's HE03.  Therefore, no data will
be sent to settlements for this hour.  Consequently, settlements will have
only 23 records for this "Short" day, Trade Date 4/7/01.

		If you have additional Scheduling questions for this trade
date, please contact Alek Kandybenko, ISO Market Operations, @
(916)351-2213.

		CAISO Metering Procedure for Daylight Savings Time
Transition 

		The ISO receives all Settlement Quality Meter Data (SQMD) in
PST, year around.

		Therefore, the transition to DST should require no
modification to meter data submission.

		However, please confirm and assure that all SQMD meter data
continues to be submitted to ISO MDAS in PST.

		If you have additional ISO Metering questions for this trade
date, please contact  ISO MDAS OPERATIONS, @ (916) 351-4431.

	For any other questions please contact your Client Representative.

We are still having some problems.  Julie Sarnowski will be autoscheduling everyday from now on.  Please call Julie if you have any problems.  Her phone number is (503) 464-8122 or you can e-mail her.  Thanks!

Lisa

Lisa, 

Are you still having problems with Enpower?  It is essential that every day is scheduled in Enpower, for us to report the correct MTM P&L, which we are doing on a daily basis.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do.

Julie, this is about autoscheduling.  Can you make sure everything is autoscheduled.  Ask Paul if system is not working.

Maybe God wants us to meet a
few wrong people before meeting
the right one so that when we finally
meet the right person, we will know
how to be grateful for that gift.

When the door of happiness closes,
another opens, but often times we look
so long at the closed door that we don't
see the one which has been opened for us.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/door_carpet_md_wht.gif>

  <http://www2.flowgo.com/images/bt/trans.gif?page_id=10005>

The best kind of friend is the kind you
can sit on a porch and swing with,
never say a word, and then walk away
feeling like it was the best
conversation you've ever had.

It's true that we don't know what we've
got until we lose it, but it's also true
that we don't know what we've been
missing until it arrives.

Giving someone all your love is never an
assurance that they'll love you back.
Don't expect love in return; just wait
for it to grow in their heart.
But if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/heart.gif>            <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/heart.gif>

It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone,
an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone,
but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.

Don't go for looks; they can deceive.
Don't go for wealth; even that fades away.
Go for someone who makes you smile because it
takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.
Find the one that makes your heart smile.

There are moments in life when you miss someone
so much that you just want to pick them from
your dreams and hug them for real.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/hug.gif>

Dream what you want to dream; go where you
want to go; be what you want to be,
because you have only one life and one
chance to do all the things you want to do.

Always put yourself in others' shoes.
If you feel that it hurts you,
it probably hurts the other person too.

The happiest of people don't necessarily
have the best of everything;
they just make the most of everything that
comes along their way.

The brightest future will always be based
on a forgotten past, you can't go on well
in life until you let go of your past
failures and heartaches.

When you were born, you were crying and
everyone around you was smiling.
Live your life so that when you die,
you're the one who is smiling and

Are you working there again?

Thanks Rhonda.  Yes you are right, it is 55 hours.  Sorry. 
 
Lisa 
Lisa,
I know you are busy. I thought I would email you, so you don't have to call me back later..
 
Rhonda wanted me to let you know that we are checking into the state tax question you had yesterday. She had to call Oregon Tax Commission and she is waiting for them to call her back. She said that it won't go into effect this paycheck, but we should hopefully know something soon. 
 
Also, I wanted to clarify your hours on last week's timesheet. I am coming up with 55 hours instead of 57. 
 
Have a good day!!
Talk to you later!

Here is a recap of what happened for April 1st.  

NCPA, scheduling coordinator for City of Oakland called 3/30 and 3/31 regarding the 5MW flat schedule we sold to them at NP15.  They informed me that the subject contract is terminated and therefore will not submit it through ISO.  I called Mo and Murray and they informed that the contract is still valid and therefore keep the schedule in.  ISO called 3/31 A.M and informed me NCPA and Enron will have to settle it.  Murray called NCPA and they agreed to put in the 5MW schedule for April 1.  For April 2nd and through the end of the month, we will not submit the 5MW until we hear different from legal.

It looks good now.  If we ever have this problem again,  could you please call and let me know.  (713-853-4873).  We use the numbers for the power reports every morning and we do not know if they numbers are not correct.

I can see every day except yesterday.  Are you completely done with the autoshcedule process for that day?  Is so can we rerun it?

Laurel, I just auto scheduled through the 29th.  We have had major system problems, We apologize for the delay.  Let me know if this worked.  I'm still not 100% confident regarding our system.

I am not sure what you  are asking, but we run this report everyday for the east and west performance books and there is always liquidations.  Today (for 3-26-2002) we are only able to see liquidations for the east book and I am certain there are liquidations for the west book also.

Laurel

    I am looking at that.
The last schedule strip for that desk has ToDate  3/24/2002.

Do you have an estimate of when we can run the PSCNA for West?  (East ran with information, it was just west that was a problem.)  We need to send out our reports that include that information in the next hour.

I apologize for the inconvenience.

Greetings:
 
The following e-mail was just returned to me. Is Todd Perry is no longer with Enron?  Todd was our most recent contact along with Carolyn Emmert.  Who is our contract now?  Who can respond to the questions noted in my e-mail to Todd - as shown below?
 
         Earl Bouse 

Hanson Permanente Cement

Dear Todd:
 
Brad Carson and I contacted you by phone last week, but we were only able to access your voice mail. Our voice mail message asked you to contact us as soon as possible.  We need to have a conference or meeting to begin the true up of your invoices with the ISO charges that should be available on our November 2001 bill by this time.
 
In addition, the cement plant is no longer able to access anyone at Enron with our daily power forecast. This morning, we received this report from the Permanente cement plant:
 
 Over the last two weeks, each of the three Enron recipients of the our daily power forecast have been dropping off line.  What I mean is that the E-mails return to me as undelivered.  Chris Foster (503-464-3822) no longer works for Enron, but he was kind enough to inform me that the other two recipients, Lester Rawson and Serena Bishop, also longer work for Enron.  Foster related that as far as he knows, the program was cancelled and we are buying or selling power based solely on our historical usage with no forecasting at all. 
 
Todd, please call me.  We must determine who the contact is going to be for the cement plant and how we are going to resolve (true up) the billing.
 
Sincerely, 

         Earl Bouse

Paul,

We need to make a small change in Edwards, AFB schedule for March 2002
for the Excess hourly schedule (accounting line # 4783).  Since we will
not be having any excess energy to schedule in the month of April 2002
the HE 24  for March 31st will need to be changed from 2 MWs to 0 MWs. 
I would suggest that HE 5 and HE 6 be increased by 1 MW each hour to new
total of  2 MWs each hour.  The reason for doing this is for control
area check out between WAPA in Mountain Standard Time and SCE in Pacific
Standard Time.  We cannot have any excess energy accounted for in April
by SCE in its control area.  

I've attached a revised schedule with the March 31 adjustment described
above.  We need to make this change and provide to SCE no later than COB
Thursday, March 28th.  Let me know if you want to implement the change
in the manner that I've done.  Thanks for your help. 

PRETTY POWERFUL...THANX...
 
LISA

 
 
 

Maybe God wants us to meet a
few wrong people before meeting
the right one so that when we finally
meet the right person, we will know
how to be grateful for that gift.

When the door of happiness closes,
another opens, but often times we look
so long at the closed door that we don't
see the one which has been opened for us.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/door_carpet_md_wht.gif>

  <http://www2.flowgo.com/images/bt/trans.gif?page_id=10005>

The best kind of friend is the kind you
can sit on a porch and swing with,
never say a word, and then walk away
feeling like it was the best
conversation you've ever had.

It's true that we don't know what we've
got until we lose it, but it's also true
that we don't know what we've been
missing until it arrives.

Giving someone all your love is never an
assurance that they'll love you back.
Don't expect love in return; just wait
for it to grow in their heart.
But if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/heart.gif>            <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/heart.gif>

It takes only a minute to get a crush on someone,
an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone,
but it takes a lifetime to forget someone.

Don't go for looks; they can deceive.
Don't go for wealth; even that fades away.
Go for someone who makes you smile because it
takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright.
Find the one that makes your heart smile.

There are moments in life when you miss someone
so much that you just want to pick them from
your dreams and hug them for real.

  <http://www.funnygreetings.com/camel5/hug.gif>

Dream what you want to dream; go where you
want to go; be what you want to be,
because you have only one life and one
chance to do all the things you want to do.

Always put yourself in others' shoes.
If you feel that it hurts you,
it probably hurts the other person too.

The happiest of people don't necessarily
have the best of everything;
they just make the most of everything that
comes along their way.

The brightest future will always be based
on a forgotten past, you can't go on well
in life until you let go of your past
failures and heartaches.

When you were born, you were crying and
everyone around you was smiling.
Live your life so that when you die,
you're the one who is smiling and
everyone around you is crying.

Lisa, here is a sample of what Jesse Bryson was doing on the monthly
schedule activity, basically just took the applicable Enron monthly schedule
from the contract package and added it to the WAPA hydro monthly schedule, I
have given your Name/number to Lynn Garrett who is our WAPA POC for this,
the Enron allocation (per contract) must be 25% green energy, certifable
with green tags for use at Edwards.  
I'll be in touch,

Paul,
Attached is the December model  which shows EAFB approx. 574 MWh short
on Mid-Peak and 1345 MWh long on Off-Peak. I intend to monitor it every
couple days to see how this years load compares to last year and perhaps
we can make an adjustment accordingly. I have also attached the Hydro
schedule I sent to WAPA and SCE. As Elliot mentioned, we will continue
to keep you posted as developments occur here at Enron.

Lisa,

Paul asked that I relay the contractual information for developing the
Edwards AFB Parker-Davis hourly schedule for April that will need to be
completed no later than COB Thursday, March 28.  

Contract Rate of Delivery for April = 18,285 kW
Firm Electric Service = 8,809,000 kWh (Energy Accounting Line # 4782)
Non-Firm Interuptable Service = 0 kWh (Energy Accounting Line # 4783)
Minimum Off-Peak Firm Electric Service = 4,571 kW
Minimum Off-Peak Firm Electric Service Energy = 1,389,660 kWh

I've attached a Firm Electric Service Schedule that would meet the
above contractual requirements for your review.

Please contact me at (602) 352-2678 or lgarrett@wapa.gov if you have
questions.  Once you have the hourly Parker-Davis Firm Electric Service
schedule prepared please forward to CBristow@wapa.gov and
presched@sce.com and myself.  Thank.

Hi Rhonda,

 I know you are not the one who is working on this but I forgot who was....Can you tell me who and forward this email to that person.  I'm a little concerned about my State Income Tax deduction.  I have not yet seen any withdraws from my check and I know State of Oregon will charge you penalties if you exceed a certain amount per quarter.  Please look into this as soon as you can.

informative as to my where abouts this year.  I am collecting similar lists 
from the folks who report to me.

Updated as requested. Thanks

I definately would not discuss this with Petrobras.  Simply confirm that 
there is no credit requirement for the Bank or that the Bank we want to use 
exceeds any credit requirement and arrange the L/C required with Robin 
Verial.  Lets not make this a bigger task than it is.

Marcus Stephan
01/10/2001 12:18 PM
Tracee,

As I told you by phone, I don't believe it is a good idea to talk to 
Petrobr?s about the l/c before delivering it to them because they may require 
a bank's name that we don't have margin to work with right now. Since there 
isn't any limitation on location of the l/c bank on side letter or on the 
fuel contract, we don't have any other options besides Arab Bank and its 
correspondent bank in Brazil. 

If Petrobr?s have any restrictions on the l/c during our meeting or some days 
later (when we will be delivering the l/c), we can argue that there was no 
restriction on location/names of the l/c bank on contract/side letter and ask 
more time to obtain a new one or with another financial institution later.

Rick/Rob - We would like to have your opinion on this. If you believe we 
should consult Petrobr?s prior to deliver the l/c, I can talk to them and get 
their point of view on this issue.

Unfortunately, our meeting has not been confirmed yet.

Regards,
Marcus.

Tracee Bersani@ECT
01/10/2001 01:17 PM
Marcus,

Please have a look at the side letter and contract to see if there is any 
limitation on location of the L/C bank.  ABN Amro had a local branch in 
Brazil so the $R draws would have been relatively straight forward.  However, 
with Arab Bank's New York Branch, the way a draw would work is this:

-Petrobras sends fax to Arab bank indicating a draw request
-Arab Bank will send funds to Brazil through its Brazilian correspondent bank 
and convert dollars to $R.  There would be an FX trade and fee associated. (I 
assume that Enron would pick up the cost of this.)  

The one issue we need to consider is that any draw request would take 
approximately 24 hours as it involves a correspondent bank and FX trade. 
Please confirm that Petrobras would not have a problem with this. 

Regards,
Tracee

Marcus Stephan@ENRON
01/10/2001 08:34 AM
Tracee, Hi!

I was talking to a Tozzini lawyer and he said that that language on the side 
letter (" reputable institution") is a kind of standard in Brazil for such 
kind of contracts but that it doesn't have any correlation to any  credit 
rating standard. So, I believe we won't have any problems with the l/c from 
Arab Bank.
I also read the fuel contract and realized that there is no restrictions or 
requirements for the  letter of credit except for its amount.

How is the l/c issuance going?  Will we be able to have it on Friday?

Regards/Marcus.

Thanks for allowing me to have a say, Joe.

guarantee that I can be reviewing?  I would like to present this along with 
the other things to the lenders next week. 

In light of numerous construction delays, increased sponsor contributions, 
unusual central bank exposures etc. we would like to conduct a comprehensive

Thanks, Guys

I have just finished reviewing the docs which provide a pretty clear picture 
of  how the negotiations are going.  This looks to be a pretty good outcome 
from a financing standpoint.  I have not explained it to the lenders yet but 
will appraise them that a settlement is in progress and though there are some 
concessions, on balance we still have a strong package.  The one area where I 
would suggest a change is with respect to the way you are handling the noise. 
I would suggest that instead of writing it with no test on gas, just relax 
the requirement to where they have to meet the World Bank Guideline on gas.  
Other than that it looks good but I have a few questions and clarifications, 
so maybe you and Cliff could call when you have a break in the action.  
Thanks

 Don't know if you have spoken to the banks or owners eng about the Siemens 
EOT settlement?  Tried to set something up with you on Friday but did not 
hear back.  In any case attached is the latest version of the document that 
covers the issue.  This should not be sent to the banks since we are still 
negotiating with SCC however it gives a good indication of where we are 
going.  If you need more information pls give Cliff a call or I can be 
reached tomorrow in Cuiaba.  In any case next week we plan on closing this 
issue with Siemens and need bank sign-off real time as discussed.

Attached are (i) clean and black-lined drafts of the letter agreement among
SCC and Contractors regarding Siemens' EOT claim, reflecting comments from
V&E and Owner, and (ii) the initial draft of the letter agreement between
EPE and Siemens AG regarding the TAA.

 I am available to call the Banks Eng and/or OPIC today after 11 am your time 
until say 2 pm your time.  Does this work for you?  I can be reached at 55 65

I don't need to be involved in the wording of the L/C as long as Rick Lammers 
is involved and it should probably be the same or substantially similar to 
the existing one from ABN.  If we have to do some free form work let me know 
and I will take a look at it.

Cliff,

Can you e-mail me the contract between Siemens and SCC?

Laine, Rob and I spoke late last week about this as well.  Given the
impracticality of bank involvement on a short time frame, we determined that
EPE should proceed to negotiate what we believe to be a commercially
reasonable agreement.  We will present the negotiated agreement to the banks
later and deal with them in due course.  Rob, it think, was going to discuss
this issue (among others presently facing the project) with the lenders this
week.  Rob, feel free to chime in if I've misstated anything.

Rob -

     Don't know if you have spoken to the banks or owners eng about the
Siemens EOT settlement?  Tried to set something up with you on Friday but
did not hear back.  In any case attached is the latest version of the
document that covers the issue.  This should not be sent to the banks since
we are still negotiating with SCC however it gives a good indication of
where we are going.  If you need more information pls give Cliff a call or
I can be reached tomorrow in Cuiaba.  In any case next week we plan on
closing this issue with Siemens and need bank sign-off real time as
discussed.

Laine

Attached are (i) clean and black-lined drafts of the letter agreement among
SCC and Contractors regarding Siemens' EOT claim, reflecting comments from
V&E and Owner, and (ii) the initial draft of the letter agreement between
EPE and Siemens AG regarding the TAA.

If you have any difficulty opening the attached, please let me know by
reply
to this message.  Thanks.

We just had a call with Novak, Barquin (V&E) and Tozzini on options for next 
Monday such as economic equilibrium, arbitration, litigation etc. We will be 
putting all the results together for you by Friday Morning.  In the mean 
time, it may be helpful for you to reflect on the following (particularly the 
table). This is really starting to bring it into focus for me.  We will try 
to do the same for our options on Monday's decision.

I contacted Graham Lofts and he was shocked and surprised.  He is going to

Dresdner KB is currently advising Petrobras on their evalution of purchasing 
equity interests in Transredes and the Cuiaba project. As you know DKB was 
also hired by Enron as the financial advisor to the Cuiaba project. We have 
about 800k to pay DKB at financial closint. Can you check to see  how DKB 
does not have a conflict of interest in this work. They need to either cease 
all work on the Petrobras transaction or terminate their work and rights to a 
fee for Cuiaba. Let me know what you think or if you need any more info

Dan,

Sorry I forgot. Things have been intense lately on Cuiaba.  Below you will 
find a summary which addresses your request. Please let me know if you want 
more details.
Rob G Gay
12/19/2000 10:59 AM
Britaldo Soarez would like to have a brief note indicating all of the things 
you are currently working on.  Thanks

Britaldo,

In summary, this is what is left on our plates:

Cuiaba I - Rob Gay

RioGen - unassigned (sale with Elektro planned)

WestLB CAA - Peter Anderson, Cheryl Lipschutz

Elektrobolt - Peter Anderson, Runabir Dutt

Cuiaba II - Peter Anderson

GTB Expansion - Brian Swinford

Transredes Expansions - Brian Swinford

Bom Retiro - Eduardo Camara

Arcor - Guille Atenor

Donna Francesca - Billy Mullville, G. Atenor

G. Atenor keeps a weekly list which provides the level of detail you will 
need for our merchant activities.

Tracee Bersani (associate) is helping out on Cuiaba I and the CAA.  G. Atenor 
can give you the details of Diego Holovik's activities.

Cliff,
Did we ever produce this?  I thought we decided to wait and see if we were 
going to use bonds.  If it exists, is there any reason why a potential buyer 
of Cuiaba should not see it?

Tracee - There is documentation on the KFW hedge as you know.  The only thing 
we could provide on the OPIC loan is a requirement of the lenders to be fixed 
which would be in the CTA if it was required in this instance (or the other 
OPIC documents).  It could be that the only requirement was in the OPIC FOGA 
which originally required us to be fixed within 12 months of funding.  
However, we modified this and now we must select either a Citibank bank loan 
which would be fixed prior to funding by a swap or if we issue bonds they 
will be fixed rate.  Please see FOGA.

Richard A Lammers
01/17/2001 03:32 PM
Just a reminder that I need you to describe the interest rate hedging in 
place for the KFW and OPIC loans.Petrobras has asked for these agreements and 
Rob said there are no agreements in place so we need to provide a written 
description of the arrangements in lieu of the agreements.

In addition we were asked to provide a copy of the Citibank offering memo for 
the OPIC bonds if one exists

Dan

I just re-read this memo.  I can respond for Cuiaba but I need to enlist 
Eduardo, Brian & Peter to obtain status and issues on their projects.  I will 
forwrd a recent summary of issues on Cuiaba.

Also, by projects do you mean major infrastructure transactions or do you 
mean everything thhat is going on?

Happy New Year!  I am compiling a list of projects already financed,  under 
financing, or soon to be under financing during 2001.   Could you provide me 
with the following information:

1) List of projects in your area already financed
 i) List of issues that may require bank involvement
 ii) List of issues that may require ENE financing personnel but not banks 
involvement

2) List of project currently under financing
 i) List of key issues (Cuiaba- please  be kind)

3) List of project to be finance during 2001
 i) Main issues to be expected.

Thanks in advance for this information.

Dan

A little greater  minutia 

How could I forget you. Are you well?

The picture you sent was distorted so I could not see you. Could you try and 
send it again?

Love

Pete,

The F/M relief sited may not apply in all instances because technically we 
may have failed to preserve our rights by not notifying Furnas for 6 months.  
They have responded as such although they have not assessed any penalties to 
date.  The real test is may 4 when we are supposed to be in Phase 3 on Gas.
Christiaan Huizer@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
01/17/2001 02:04 PM
Pete,

 There are two types of penalties under the PPA for the account of EPE (the 
latter can be used as a hedge to diesel cost exposure and we don't have any 
penalties right now)

(1) Delay penalties in being unable to provide the guaranteed capacity of 480 
MW on gas starting May 4, 2001 (this is where the Force Majeure extension is 
able to provide relief). The penalties here are calculated as R$ 400 per 
delayed MW per day. 

(2) Penalties due to capacity shortfall (basically - are we able to meet 
dispatch requests). If the moving average of the monthly average of the 
projects equivalent availability, calculated in accordance with provisions of 
annex-7 of the PPA, is less than 92%, a penalty shall be assessed in the 
amount of monthly capacity portion of the tariff for each phase times the 
guaranteed capacity for the phase multiplied by (92% - moving average of the 
monthly availability).

Penalties type (1) does not apply in the concept analyzed as it relates to 
delay in gas (Force Majeure Claim issue). 

Refusing a dispatch request above 220 MW has an impact on penalties type (2) 
(guaranteed capacity is 300 MW). Given that the plant currently has a moving 
average of the monthly availability of about 99.7%, there is a margin built 
up that can be used to accept an availability hit by refusing a dispatch 
request above 220 MW. Therefore, to avoid the huge fuel costs associated with 
being dispatched above 220 MW, the PPA availability penalty concept can be 
utilized as an alternative. If we continue to decline to be dispatched above 
220 MW for a long period however, the built up margin will be reduced and 
eventually we'll have to pay penalties because the 12-month moving average 
moves below 92%.

Please let me know if additional questions

Christiaan 

Peter E Weidler@ENRON
01/17/2001 09:41 AM
Why do we have penalties - I thought we had force majuere extension until 
september or so.

Christiaan - please clarify thanks

Pete

I was just trying to touch base after the lender call this morning and 
debrief.  I thought you and John were great, particularly John's step-in on 
the heat rate/degradation issue.  Thanks to both of you.

I also wanted to visit on the latest plan for the ridges.

Thirdly, I wanted to discuss your thoughts on the achievability of our 
positions with SCC and Siemens.

Finally, we should circle up on the TAA once we get Cliff's response.  He led 
me to believe that we really had little to fear in the discussion I had with 
him.

Graham just called back and said that the Rio M&A people were engaged by 
Petrobras to review other Enron asset sales ( I think this implies Elektro 
and the LDC's) and it was only recently that we requested that Petrobras 
consider Cuiaba as well. In any case he assured me that there is a strong 
Chinese wall between the project finance group and the M&A group so it is 
unlikely that they could obtain any info as a result. He assured me that they 
will make everyone aware of the need for increased care on Cuiaba information 
handling due to this situation.  Let me know if you require more.  It is my

Rick,

In preparation for the meeting with the lenders on Tuesday I was reviewing 
the GSA and I wonder if YPF has any force majeure claims which could impede 
our rights to terminate.  I know they indicated at least verbally that they 
had encountered some problems in Argentina.  Although a stretch has Dean or 
Novak indicated that this could be a defense?

I will be bringing all of the details of our sponsor support as back-up 
materials including the details of the purpose and amount of each item and  
the fall away provisions.

Interesting piece of history - my notes from a lecture I gave Bannantine 
Circa 2/00-4/00

The matrix with the implications of arbitration will be done this afternoon. 
We received Tozzini's input over the weekend

Peter E Weidler
01/20/2001 09:50 AM
Rob - I reviewed this matrix - I added some of my thoughts into the attached 
matrix below.

Our goal is to get as much of Enron's money out as soon as we can.  How we do 
that is the difficult part and complex decision tree.  We don't have any idea 
at this point in time which course of action is likely to be successful - so 
we can not base our next step with Furnas (assuming tuesday's meeting with 
Furnas is unproductive) on which of those paths we take.   I was hopeful we 
could pursue an arbitration course or some other course with Furnas, to 
increase the pressue - possible get a favorable outcome, and provide 
political ramifications - and retain our other course of actions by being 
able to stop the arbitration when it is opportune time to begin our final 
push (after gas arrives).

We need to be close to final decision on what we do next with Furnas on 
wednesday.  John and Rob - please make sure we know if and what we can 
arbitrate on Wednesday, and lets also make sure we have assessed  all other 
possible/feasible next steps with Furnas ahead of Wednesday.

Thanks

Pete

I noticed that for construction and cost overruns you inserted the words 
"Must Complete" even if we sell EPE or in the case of Petrobras alll of the 
project.  Is it your view that the gas suppliers will not consider 
participating in any overrun support?

I like this conceptually as an approach to manage costs but see the potential 
problems with Shell if EECC is paid on time.  I think it may also be 
extremely difficult to rework the LD's because the EECC wrap does not match 
up with the subs very well (in some cases EECC's protection exceeds the subs 
and in other is less).  I also wonder who is the credit for contractor 
obligations in this scenario for the lenders?

Peter E Weidler
01/20/2001 09:31 AM
I would like you all to consider the following concept and send back 
feedback.  Especially John Novak or Eddy - on whether or not we have 
significant exposure with Shell by using this approach. 

If EECC is not neccessarily in the "for profit" business and Enron's goal is 
to conclude the construction with as least cost as possible.  We need to 
eliminate the negotiations between EECC and the project.  Right now - we get 
change orders from EECC which include a markup of 10 %, and are "fluffed up" 
because they know the project is going to object and negotiate and Shell is 
not going to be happy until we reduce the cost of the proposed change orders 
- this is a waste of time but has become part of the continuous 
contractor/prjoect dance.   EECC also has some profit within the turnkey 
portion of the job (pipelines and powerplant)  and is also asking for early 
completion bonus on some things.  My concept is for Cuiaba team and EECC to 
go complete open book.  Let us analyze and categorize all of EECC's actual 
costs so we understand where we stand currently with respect to work 
performed under the turnkey and outside of turnkey - and then we go straight 
to final negotiations with Conduto and Bolinter.  EECC and us will both 
jointly negotiate best deal possible, using our combined knowledge.   Get the 
debate on EECC profit and whether or not it was appropriate to commission 
certain work, or whether or not it was their fault or our fault, out of the 
picture so everyone can focus on minimizing the total cost of this project - 
from Enron's perspective.

We we conclude the process = the project gets charged all direct costs and 
third party costs.  For those items which is clearly not the responsibility 
fo the project - we offset those against profit and present the results to 
Shell. We go to Shell and say here it is - please audit and either approve or 
object.   Whatever the dispute - we will negotiate and as a result $10mm 
profit may get decreased.

The advantage of this route is - we work together to minimize overall cost of 
project, we eliminate an intercompany debate which will cost time and money 
and Enron can undertand what the cost of this thing really is.  Right now I 
do not actually know how much of the capex is profit and could and should be 
deducted from our capex budget number as it relates to Enron's position in 
the project.

Downside is - Shell may consider that Project management has violated its 
fudiciary responsibility to the project  Although I think this can be 
mitigated by audit and prior explanation of what we are doing to Shell.  I do 
not really want Shell directly involved until we are done - because I do not 
know what we will find or conclude.  Need help on fine tuning this part of 
the strategy.

Let me know if I have rocks in my head.  If this is a good idea - I would 
like to run it to ground this week with EECC.

Pete

Maggie Li @ EES   01/18/2001 02:02 PM

Rob,

I'm sorry to bother you again. I just decided to add Yale to my list in order 
to get more chance. Would you mind to write me another recommendation letter? 
Yale asks you to describe specific activities or accomplishments which can 
demonstrate my strength and weakness in a separate page in addition to the 
ranking. I think this will demand more of your time to give some examples. I 
can think of the examples for you if you need. 

I would appreciate if you can take more time to write me this last 
recommendation letter.

Maggie

Rick, Laine, and John, please add any comments or subjects which you think 
Jim should address with Munoz. He would like to call him some time today.

I spoke with Dick Vincent who indicated that we will have no problem 
obtaining 12 mos renewable business interruption insurance when we go 
operational on gas.  This should solve the warranty issue with the banks 
because it covers defects, design, and workmanship on the turbines and 
includes lost profits, etc.  Incidentally, for insurance purposes the 
turbines are designated DE3 which is not a new technology designation. 

Typically we will always have this coverage in place but if their is a 
supplier warranty then the party providing the warranty pays ahead of the 
insurer.  In the case where the supplier does not pay or the warranty has 
ended then the insurer will pay.

Now we just need to come up with a fix for the drop dead date.

Regards,

Rob

I will be out on Th & FRi because my wife is having surgery.  I can't have my 
cel on in the hospital but I will have it with me and will check voice mail 
from time to time.

Shelly Butler with the Associate program HR indicated that by giving Tracee 
the short term employment we will be responsible for her termination package 
at the end of that time (approx. 6 mos or $40,000).  We probably need to do 
some structuring here, no?

Thanks, same to you.

I was not here on the day so this is late but best wishes.

Happy Birthday! Please tell everyone that you are 29 so you don't blow my 
cover since we were born on the same day! Hope you have a great birthday. 

The lenders would like a list of the potential producers in Bolivia for 
Cuiaba I and if info is available on their holdings please provide that as 
well.  Can we also give the details of the Vintage transaction as an example 
of our capabilities?   If their consent is required can you obtain?

KFW is ok on relying solely on the back-up fuel supply support but OPIC is 
not there yet.

Also, KFW is offering to allow us to go back to floating on interest rate. 
They will provide the cost within the next 24 hours, but they have indicated 
that it will be significantly less than US$250,000 for a current estimated 
annual savings of 60 bps.  This sounds like a good move to me.

John can you give me some feedback on this before it goes.  I am waiting on 
input from Rick concerning the Vintage deal.

  

Thank you Frank.

I am preparing the written version now and hope to have it today. 

Rob,

we talked yesterday about a couple of thinks, one of which was the interest
rate reservation. To this end I am still not clear with our treasury about
the amount it would cost, if you would not use our refinancing. I am afraid
that I will need some more time to discuss this with our treasury.

In terms of the points we discussed in Washington we would very much
appreciate receiving your concrete requests in writing (gas, Furnas consent,
Eletrobras consent / guarantee), since parts of these issues have to be

Two agreements have been negotiated with Siemens as part of the plant 
turnover for Provisional Completion Phase III on oil: 1) the EOT Claim 
Agreement between Siemens and SCC and 2) modifications to the TAA between 
Siemens and EPE.

The changes which the lenders should review are as follows:

EOT Claim Agreement

14 Day Availability Test with respect to Provisional Completion Phase III on 
oil, on a look-back basis over 6 months, required as a specific performance 
requirement
After PC on oil, Siemens can demobilize
Compensation for commissioning on oil $5,720,000; $30,000 per day for owner 
delay
Bonus of $15,000 per day that PC achieved before 17 Feb
Phase III Substantial Completion on gas
60 days prior written notice on gas availability
If sound level guarantees demonstrated on oil, only need to demonstrate far 
field sound on gas
Owner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on 
oil; if not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's 
commissioning obligations
Performance guarantees remain in tact per EPC
Long stop date on Phase III Substantial Completion on gas of 31 Dec 01
Substantial Completion on gas - punchlist limited to deficiencies from Work 
performed to achieve Substantial Completion on gas
Risk of Loss remains with owner during commisioning on gas
Siemens agrees to enter into negotiations to provide operational assistance
Degradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during 
commissioning
Compensation for commissioning on natural gas $1,220,000 lump sum; $20,000 
per day for owner delay
Warranty - 6 months after Provisional Completion on oil
Option to buy extended warranty for up to 6 months at $175,000; must elect 60 
days prior to expiration of Primary Warranty Period
Performance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven 
by owner
Delay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas
Payments to be paid (including EOTof $5,720,000): 15 Feb  $5,446,141; 28 Feb  
$14,353,401 with offset of $4,000,000 for Phase I LD payment due from Siemens 
to SCC
Late payment interest rate of 14%

TAA Agreement

Effective date Provisional Completion Phase III on oil
No 12 month look back
12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas 
commissioning unless owner delay. 

Additional Insurance

In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if there 
are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated that we 
will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business interruption 
insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve the issue over 
the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects, design, and 
workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.  Incidentally, 
for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which is not a new 
technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18 months per event 
with US$150,000 deductible.
Typically we will always have this coverage in place but if their is a 
supplier warranty then the party providing the warranty pays ahead of the 
insurer.  In the case where the supplier does not pay or the warranty has 
ended then the insurer is the primary.

We will need to execute these agreements immediately.  Please advise with 
your thoughts as soon as possible..

John can you give me some feedback on this before it goes.  I am waiting on 
input from Rick concerning the Vintage deal.

  

Chris,

Nancy and Mary took the budget news well.  Their response was "I don't care 
what the number is as long as the sponsors are stepping up for it."
Frank also did not object.  Unfortunately, they are saying that the CCT/CUST 
interconnection issue must be resolved before funding.  Their concern is that 
if we sign then EPE will be subject to third party liability with members of 
the grid.  They are willing to meet with us next week on the budget and the 
ECA but Cliff is not availble until Thursday.  Can you make it later in the 
week?

I'll keep you posted.  

Rob,
I will be in a meeting most of the day but do call as it sounds urgent.  My

FYI
Created 01/30 10:55 AM   Modified 01/30 12:55 PM
Title: Meeting With Furnas - Jan 29 01 - Tariff until Gas Commisioning

Furnas:  Celso Ferreira, Roberto de la Nina
EPE: Jose Bestard, Laine Powell, Christiaan Huzier
Consent.- Before entering into the purpose of the meeting, I told Celso that 
we were sending him a letter to confirm our understanding from the previous 
meeting, that they are linking the approval of the Anex 4/Consent to changes 
in the contact. and that they refused to sign the original consent language. 
For avoidance of doubt, the text of both versions are included in the letter.
He said that our understanding was correct and that he would answer in the 
affirmative.
He was not familiar with the original text. I showed him my copy with the 
three initials. He asked whose initials were from Furnas. (I don't know - was 
not present at that meeting. Rick  and John may know).
Roberto de la Nina gave him the background from Furnas side.
Tariff and Commissioning. 
Celso started the session by drawing a diagram of the Contractual Obligation 
provisions compared to the Current Situation. He wanted to lead us  to pay 
the fuel differential, from 100% dispatch or alternatively buy from the MAE 
(lower cost to us).  
[Comment.- Irrespective of  the Force Majeure arguments that we have, the MAE 
make up possibility has to be used carefully to avoid  falling into the trap, 
by precedent, or assuming a market exposure that we presently do not have.]
I replied that his reading of the Contract was correct, except that he did 
not read the Force Majeure section.  We had the obligation to change to gas 
on the dates he mentioned, except that we have a Force Majeure due to the 
Government Actions, and therefore we have the right to change the schedule.
Celso replied that his people did not think this fit the case; i.e. 
"additional difficulty of drilling through rocks"; I replied that we have a 
strong case that everyone  knows about, including the regulator Aneel, which 
extended the use of the CCC until June 2001.
[Comment.- I expect Furnas to challenge our documentation to calculate how 
many days we are entitled due to FM causes. At the end there will be a 
"negotiated agreement", or the result or arbitration.]
Aneel Authorization.-  I told him that we needed to bring him up to date 
about Aneel's approval.
 Aneel sent us a letter that we were not authorized to operate in Combined 
Cycle, not that we had CCC account coverage during for CC operation.
Gave him a copy of the letter of our request to Aneel asking for both ; CC 
and CCC coverage. We were ready for 480 MW, but on diesel.
Celso asked what we would do if we got CC authorization but not CCC 
coverage.- I told him that we did not have the money to pay for the fuel, 
that we would have to convert back to Simple Cycle, use the current 
authorization for minimum use and wait  for the gas to be available to go 
through commissioning.
He said that under the contract we are obligated to provide power; that he 
would buy from the MAE and sent us the bill. I told him that under the 
Contract we can change the gas-change-over date because of FM. During a FM 
period our mutual obligations would cease, except that they in this case they 
had a capacity payment obligation given that the cause was Government 
action.  
He understood that they have a right to cancel the Contract after 12 months 
[Comment - but they would have the MAE exposure as well for the Initial 
Contracts]
Laine gave him an update of the ridge contruction and the parallel path that 
we will take on Ridge 10; drill and also seek a permit for a partial crossing 
of the first crest, drilling through the second crest, all withing the 
existing ROW.
Laine explained the processes and limitatios of returnind to SC operations 
and then back again to CC gas comissioning.

Our Proposal.-  Our proposal is that we get authorization to enter into 
operation as combined cycle unit; the CCC administration pays for the diesel, 
and receives the gas revenues as compensation. This keeps us and Furnas at 
the Contract equilibrium, and the Brazilian electric system has 480 MW 
combined cycle plant; providing stability to that area.
Under this proposal, until the gas gets there to start commissioning, ONS 
would dispatch the power plant according to economic dispatch at R$110/Mwhr; 
minimum 290 MW. The CCC covers the actual dispatch the MRE cover the dispatch 
to the Initial Contracts with Furnas.
I suggested that they join us for that petition to Aneel. He called Mario 
Santos to set up a meeting, to enlist the help of ONS in that petition as 
well.
The meeting is set up for Wednesday at 9:30 AM.   To prepare we need to 
provide the factual information, heat rates, costs, etc.

I need the PPA reference for the Eletrobras performance guarantee.  Quickly 
please - this has to go out tonight.

In preperation for our call, the memo which was requested.  I will also be 
able to brief you on this week's progress with Furnas.  I have a lawyer 
tracing the section reference for the Eletrobras performance guarantee which 
appears as brackets in the memo.  I should be able to advise you of the exact 
reference tomorrow morning when we talk.

Regards,

Rob

I've updated the memo to insert the missing references.  I also learned that 
he meetings with ONS and ANEEL are scheduled for tomorrow.  Thanks

The banks have given us the  green light on gas.  That means that they will 
be prepared to fund with the back-up agreements only, even if the YPF GSA is 
being re- negotiated or if we are in discussions with other suppliers. 

All the Best. Jim 

You have meant a lot to countless people and their families.  The Gays in 
particular will be forever in your debt.

Cliff Rankin has indicated he won't be available until Thursday so I think we 
may need to shoot for the budget on Wednesday and the ECA on Thurs.  Will 
this work?

According to Cliff Shedd, we would be covered by insurance if we terminated 
the contract with Furnas and Furnas failed to pay the termination payment.  
However the insurers will only pay after we receive an arbitration judgement 
against them and the refuse to honor the judgement.  I assume we would also 
have to exhaust our remedies against trhe guarantor (Eletrobras).

Also, we are required to notify the underwriters immediately of a material 
default.   

I believe that is correct.

02/01/2001 05:02 PM
Rob,

Didn't he say we were only covered up to $200 MM (e.g. the limit of our 
contract frustration cover?) With the current Shell/enron sharing 
percentages, it would seem that we are entitled to 72% of the $360 MM payment 
or $259 MM, thus we would only be out by $59 MM.

I noticed on your web site that you have a number of Joana Zjawinska's for 
sale including "Love, Life  & Money Suite 2"  (which we currently own) and 
"Startled".

I was wondering if you would consider a trade where we would provide "Love 
Life & Money" (framed) and we would receive "Startled"?

As far as I know only the Hermes fee is refundable (less a small, unknown 
admin cost).  We may also have some fees payable, we will have to check.

Celso

Hi, we have been missing each other on the phone.  Were you able to trace the 
package?

My home Email is RGGDEE@AOL.com

The insurance has been purchased by Enron exclusively to cover our equity and 
our subd debt through our commercial program (not OPIC).  We  have covered 
the following investments to date on Cuiaba.

EPE                 $235MM
GASMAT $  60MM
GASBOL $132MM

Up to US$200MM could be reimbursed for an insuarble event.  However, that 
$200 may be limited by draws associated with insurable events at other 
projects.  This $200MM could be further limited by draws from other projects 
because the program has a cap of $250MM total, but the cap can be reinstated 
following a draw with an exclusion for the country where the previous hit 
occurred.

Mariella Mahan@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
02/02/2001 11:27 AM
Rob,
Isn't the $200 million the cap of OPIC and doesn't that apply to 100% of the 
equity covered by OPIC, which means that, I guess (and I don't know if Shelll 
qualifies or if we structured around this) we share with Shell the $200 
million on the basis of equity percentages held by each?
Thanks

I just spoke to Mike Banks at Milbank who said payment has not yet been
received re: their invoice.  He has had some conversations with Robert
Novak and others at Enron and undertands that payment has been approved
but for some reason not yet made.  I would appreciate if you could look
into this to see what the status is.

Mike understands that we are in a holding pattern on the permanent
financing until the changes in the project are completed.

Rob - can you or Blanca send me the latese ECA so I can sent the exact 
covenant language regarding development costs on to Shell . We also need to 
decide if we need to revisit this with both Shell and the Lenders .Thanks.

I think this will take about 1-2 hours.  It can be done by phone but in 
person would be better.  I would like to make sure that our documentation is 
clean before we start.  The specs have a lot of discrepencies with the 
drawings, the Bordeaux, and our contract.  Also, I am not sure that we each 
have a drawing of the electrical which matches and conforms to the lists we 
are working on with Bill.  I would also like to see whatever supplement we 
are going to sign to the contract so we can make sure that there are no 
misunderstandings on what is included. I think we have everything worked out 
but there are a lot of players and we all need to be on the same page.  I can 
make time to finish all of this just let me know what your schedule is (and

terrific,thanks

Rob - I just received your message about the loan extensions and Central
Bank registrations. I have been working with Celso Bernardi, Rafael Rangel
and Rick Hopkinson of Enron and Fabio Yamada and Irenne Yamanaka of Machado
Meyer on this. Also, I am preparing sort of a "critical path" items
checklist on the sub-debt that John Barquin and I are going to discuss with
John Novak tomorrow at 9 a.m. After we work through it, I would be glad to
forward it to you.

In short and in answer to your specific question, as advised by Machado
Meyer, I think that we will either be reissuing new promissory notes for all
of the sub-debt with new maturity dates or entering into loan agreements
between EPE and GasMat (as Borrowers) and then the respective Enron and
Shell lenders to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2001 as the note
from Celso below explains. Then we will just deliver request for extension
letters to the Central Bank to request them to amend the registrations to
reflect the new maturity date. This should all be done before the existing
loans mature on December 31, 2000.

Please let me know if you have any further questions for now and I will keep
you apprised of any developments. Regards, Melissa

Melissa,
as agreed in the Cuiaba Owners Meeting yesterday, by Rick (Enron) and
Johannes (Shell), we need to extend the maturity date of the shareholders
loans to     Dec. 31st, 2001 and keep all the other conditions.
I am sending  a confirmation to Shell of this and request a letter from the
borrower talking about that.  Also I have been in contact with Fabio and
Yrenne about this issue.
Please let me know if you need anything else.
rgds
Celso

FYI - Regarding Rick's note about the default interest, I have spoken to
Fabio Yamada and Irenne Yamanaka of MMSO regarding what we need to do to
document the extensions. Fabio says that we can have a simple loan
agreement
(I would assume there would be one between each Lender and the Enron/Shell
borrowers) where the various parties agree to the extension. The notes
would
not have to be reprinted/replaced and can remain as they are. We would just
send notification letters to the Central Bank requesting that the existing
registrations be amended to reflect the extension. Rick Hopkinson is
checking with Raquel Novais and Fabio Yamada of MMSO regarding any possible
Brazilian tax issues that would arise from this transaction/extension. I
will let you know when I receive that information. Regards, Melissa

Rick et al.

     Pls include Celso Bernardi on all these emails.

the notes to add the default interest provision if this will jeopardise our
central Bank approval or cause other significacnt delays. Please advise as
I will try to clear this with Celso tomorrowI

John Novak
11/28/2000 09:51 AM

Gents - let's add this to our list to discuss on the call this evening.

John - What do you think? Can I go forward with this extension of the
sub-debt until June 30, 2001?

John/John -

We have a new sub-debt issue -- The existing shareholder subordinated loan
promissory notes have a maturity of the earlier of December 31, 2000 or the
closing of third-party financing, and the Central Bank registrations
reflect
that. Celso has requested MMSO to draft letters to the Central Bank asking
for an extension of the maturity to June 30, 2001. He says that Johannes
Walzebuck has agreed to the extension of maturity for Shell but that he has
had no response from Enron (I think he sent a message to Novak, Powell,
Lammers, Rangel, Walzebuck and Dutton on Nov 13). The A&R SFA doesn't have
an explicit maturity date for the loans but it has a form of note attached
which carries the maturity date -- the notes are to be considered a part of
the agreement. The form of note attached to the A&R SFA carries default
interest but the simple form notes that are actually in existence (the ones
that were just printed) do not have default interest provisions (we had to
match the original registrations and default interest was not a registered
payment condition). Unless you all want to just leave the notes and hope
that we can collect default interest, I have asked MMSO what we need to do
-- I assume we have to issue replacement promissory notes with the new
maturity date. We would then send the notification letters to the Central
Bank notifying them of the extension. We also need to address this in the
2nd A to the A&R SFA. My note below tries to explain what all is going on
with the various assignments and notifications.

The main thing I need from you is to let me know what your thoughts are
from
an Enron perspective and how you wish for me to proceed. Do you need to
talk
to Lammers/Powell/Gay? Let me know. Regards, Melissa

Celso - I apologize that I have not been able to speak with you about this.
I do not recall receiving a message from you about this previously, and I
have been out of the office without access to my e-mail or international
service all day today. The Amended and Restated Shareholders Funding
Agreement will have to be amended (there is a 2nd Amendment in draft form
right now that has not been finalized) to include a new form of note with
the new maturity date. We will also have to draft some form of letter
agreement/waiver to address the fact that the maturity of the previously
issued promissory notes is being extended (perhaps this can just be an
additional provision in the 2nd amendment).

Fabio and Irenne - Will we need to issue replacement promissory notes with
the new maturity date for all of the existing promissory notes or is there
any other way to address this effectively under Brazilian law?

Also, Fabio and Irenne - with respect to the notification letters for the
TR
Buyout loans, I wonder if it might be easier to go ahead and deliver the
notices of assignment to the Central Bank because the loans that were
assigned (and the loans mentioned in the letters) do not encompass all of
the shareholder loans. The Shell assignment agreement for the SGL to SCHL
assignment for EPE should be complete within the next few days and is dated
"as of September 30, 2000". I assume Shell has notification letters to
deliver as well for that assignment. Did you receive my fax with the
mark-up
of the notification letters?

Maybe we could do this in two steps:

1) Deliver the notification of assignment letters and schedules for the
Transredes Buyout and for the Shell assignment of EPE loans from SGL to
STDCL.

2) Execute 2nd Amendment to A& R Shareholders Funding Agreement with new
form of promissory note with new maturity and approving extension of
maturity date of existing loans, complete the Enron assignments of the
replacement notes (for EPE and GasMat credits) to Enron Netherlands
Holdings
B.V., and notify the Central Bank of the extension of the maturity date on
the existing promissory notes and of the Enron assignments.

The reason I suggest this breakdown is that the items in number 1 are
basically complete and have been approved. The others are not complete yet
and could be done in the next week or two.

I know this is a lot to coordinate; you can let me know if you have
suggestions about the different steps we should take and in what order.

I will try to speak to John and John about the Enron approvals on this and
get back to everyone.

Regards, Melissa

Renata,
I have been triyng to talk to Melissa on this issue, but she is not
responding to me.  I sent an email about this to Laine, Lammers, Rafael
Rangel, Novak and Miguel Mendoza from Enron and Johannes from Shell.  I
only got answer from Shell approving my suggestion for extension.  Also I
need from someone to confirm that there is no restriction in the
shreholders agreement about this extension.
I requested Irene to send me the draft to save time in the near future.
Let me know if you need aything else.
rgds
Celso

Dear all,

I have spoken with Irene and she will get the remaining copies from Ricardo
Pinto (from Machado Meyer), and Sandra Vassel.

Irene has told me that the change in the dates of the certificates is due
to
the fact that the loans that are going to be used to repay the amounts
reflected in the certificates are not going to be granted this year, but
only mid next year. Therefore, the current date (12/31/2000) would be
changed to June 30th, 2001. Celso, I would like to ask you to kindly
confirm
this understanding, since Irene has told me that you asked her to make the
letters to the Central Bank notifying the date change, but she had not had
more details about the matter.

Finally, Melissa has asked Machado Meyer whether the current drafts of the
letters to the Central Bank notifying the two assignment of credits (from
Transredes to Enron and Shell, so called "Transredes Byout", and from Shell
Generating to Shell Treasury) have to change due to the date change
reflected in the new letters circulated below.

Thank you for the attention.

Regards,

Renata

I guess you got tied up on some real work.  Call me back when you have time.  
Are you happy?  The London job sounds great and sometimes the best things 
happen to us unexpectedly.   It was nice to hear your voice briefly.  I miss

I need to take a day off if you do not mind Tomorrow, Friday Feb 9 to look 
after my son who will be out of school. Dee will be traveling with Chelsea to 
a dance competition. Call me on my cell if you need me.

On Friday we distributed  RFPs for securing bridge gas.   Letters went today 
to Chaco, TotalfinaElf, Andina, Maxus, BritishGas and Petrobras for them to 
quote us 6-month gas with our option to extend for another 6 months.  We have 
given them until March 2nd to respond.

Pete Weidler will meet with YPF (hopefully with Ernesto Lopez Anad?n) the 
week of the 19th.

Last Friday, I learned from an Enron employee who is currently enrolled in 
the Rice's EMBA program that I had great chance to get admitted to the 
program. So I decided not to apply to Yale. If you haven't started working on 
the recommendation letter, please discard it. I appreciate your previous help 
and will keep you posted.

Thanks again.

I'm not sure what I'm supposed to say about the Ridges and completion of the 
gas line in  connection with the financing. Also on the Interconnection issue 
we are still waiting on the Tozzini memo.  We either need to have someone 
riding herd on Tozzini on this (I thought it was Jose) or I need to go to SP 
and make this happen.

There are prepayment penalties associated with IFC loans.  As to the lender 
Veto, the Veto should only apply to the banks covered by their umbrella and 
should not be applicable to the relationship to other MLA's or uncovered 
lenders.  For instance if OPIC is lending $50MM, FMO $10MM, and the B banks 
$40MM, the voting rights should be 50% for OPIC and 50% FMO (since FMO is the 
lender of record for the B banks).  Unanimous consent items would then 
require both OPIC and FMO to consent.

Peter,

As you might know, we are in the midst of discussions with a group of lenders 
on the Bulacan project in the Philippines. The lender of record if the FMO 
(Netherlands Development Finance Corporation) and the structure is modelled 
on the IFC "A" and "B" loan structure. As the "A" loan lender, FMO is saying 
that they want veto rights over all decisions that are to be taken by the 
lenders. Do you know if the IFC has such veto rights in their facilities - 
will greatly appreciate your feedback on this asap. In addition, does the IFC 
impose prepayment penalties?

Regards,
Richard

Bradley.Barta@swec.com on 02/14/2001 09:43:16 AM
Rob - We've reviewed your memo which sets forth general points of your
negotiations with Siemens.  Following are comments and questions regarding
certain negotiated points:

EOT Claim Agreement

Owner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on oil;
if not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's 
commissioning
obligations

We observe that while this point places reasonable responsibility on the Owner
to correct problems that were a result of their commercial operations, it is
introduces an opportunity for the Contractor to place unfounded blame on the
owner for affecting the Contractor's ability to commission.

Risk of Loss remains with owner during commissioning on gas

We understand that the Facility is under the care, custody and control of the
Owner and that the Facility is currently operating under the insurance 
coverage
intended for the commercial operating period (versus the construction period).
Please confirm that there is no reason to be concerned about insurance 
coverage
if a problem arises resulting in material damage attributable to Contractor
action during commissioning on gas.  We are also advising the Lenders to have
this point reviewed by an insurance advisor.

Degradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during
commissioning

During our last conference call it was indicated that the first choice was to
test to determine degradation and the alternative was to agree on a set of
curves.  It appears that Siemens was unwilling to agree to the test approach.
We observe that the curves used to determine owner credit may be biased to the
benefit of Siemens.  We trust that your operations experts will diligently
review the basis for the curves.

Performance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven by
owner

Please explain the rationale behind forgiving $4 million of Contractor LDs.

Delay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas

During our last conference call it was indicated that there would be a stand
down until 7/1/01 when gas is available, no LDs would be paid related to oil
firing performance, and that the LD clock would start if gas commissioning is
not complete within 60 days.  We do not understand the above negotiated point.
Please confirm that our understanding is correct or clarify your negotiated
point.

TAA Agreement

No 12-month look back.

We assume that this negotiated point is related to the time period factored 
into
the availability calculation for purposes of determining whether or not an
extension or additional work by the Contractor has been triggered as a result 
of
dropping below the availability standards.  Please explain how this negotiated
point affects the mechanics of the TAA and also please explain how 
availability
will be calculated.  As we noted during our last conference call, we are
concerned that Siemens believes that the availability value is not reduced if
maintenance work is being performed during periods when the Facility is not
being dispatched.

12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas
commissioning unless owner delay.

We interpret the above negotiated point to mean that the 12-month clock for 
the
initial guarantee period stops during commissioning regardless of how long it
takes the Contractor to commission on gas (unless delays are attributable to
Owner) and re-starts after Contractor has successfully completed the 
performance
testing on gas.  Please confirm that our understanding is correct.

In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if
there are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated
that we will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business
interruption insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve
the issue over the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects,
design, and workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.
Incidentally, for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which
is not a new technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18
months per event with US$150,000 deductible.

Stone & Webster is advising the Lenders to have an insurance advisor review 
this
point.

Thanks in advance for your response.  Hope all is well.

Regards,

Bradley

We will provide the appropriate clarificatiions ASAP.

I have not been able to find out any details except that apparently he 
decided long ago that he would take some time off after becoming a partner 
and so now he is going to do it.

I have never received a call from Bob Draggon.  Should I still be expecting 
one or have you already convinced him?

Dan Castagnola is being requested as my replacement on Cuiaba and Peter 
Anderson is also being discussed.  I will be involved primarily to provide 
history and guidance, but it will be from my home or parts unknown.  You can 
feel free to call me at any time (281-334-2360).  I will be in the office 
here thru March 1.

Kindest Regards

Rob

   

What's with John?  Is he OK?

Thanks. Same here.

Best of luck with your new endeavour.  It's been a pleasure working with you.

we celebrated mine there too.  Got your very nice phone message also -
thanks for cheering up my tired mind & body.  Your voice sounds wonderful &
i breathed in all the telephonic kisses.  Hope all is well on the road to

Rebecca has asked for a review of the Cuiaba project.   Her current thinking 
is that it should be under one shop - not split responsibility.   Which shop 
is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon.

The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight 
forward  decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.  I am 
thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.  In attendance are Rob and 
John.     Can divide the presentation up into - 

getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - 
Laine 
Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick 
YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick
MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose
Current economics. - Rick

Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics 
on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we 
send the page per topic around by this friday.  

I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.

Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think 
Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.

Hello my darling.  It is great to hear from you.   The photo brought back 
memories of a wonderful day with you. You are so beautiful.  I want to kiss

In non-default situations the Lenders allow the banks to have rights and 
typically substantial input on waivers modifications etc.  As you can imagine 
the IFC would not want the liability of being responsible to B banks if they 
changed the deal without their consent and the B banks would e uncomfortable 
turning over that right to a third party.  They would lose control of the 
credit process.

Richard Quek@ECT
02/18/2001 11:50 PM
Rob,

Thanks for the feedback. Does the IFC veto cover all waivers, consents, 
approvals, etc (except for those that require unanimous approval like changes 
to pricing, tenor, security, etc, of course)?

On the prepayment penalties (other than the customary break-funding costs), 
what have you seen, in terms of the levels imposed?

Regards,
Richard

Rob G Gay@ENRON
02/15/2001 03:48 AM
There are prepayment penalties associated with IFC loans.  As to the lender 
Veto, the Veto should only apply to the banks covered by their umbrella and 
should not be applicable to the relationship to other MLA's or uncovered 
lenders.  For instance if OPIC is lending $50MM, FMO $10MM, and the B banks 
$40MM, the voting rights should be 50% for OPIC and 50% FMO (since FMO is the 
lender of record for the B banks).  Unanimous consent items would then 
require both OPIC and FMO to consent.

Peter,

As you might know, we are in the midst of discussions with a group of lenders 
on the Bulacan project in the Philippines. The lender of record if the FMO 
(Netherlands Development Finance Corporation) and the structure is modelled 
on the IFC "A" and "B" loan structure. As the "A" loan lender, FMO is saying 
that they want veto rights over all decisions that are to be taken by the 
lenders. Do you know if the IFC has such veto rights in their facilities - 
will greatly appreciate your feedback on this asap. In addition, does the IFC 
impose prepayment penalties?

Regards,
Richard

Once again you made my day. You are really a wonderful person, you know?

Don't worry I'm not falling off a cliff - you will hear from me again.  Also 
I'll give you a call before I get out of here next week.

thanks for the very sweet message.  You can never be more delinquent than i
since i only mailed your b-day gift a few days ago.  There is nothing worse
than trying to find a gift for a married retiring millionaire. Hence, the
weird gift combination - but i was thinking fishing. Work continues to be
stressfully busy because i'm preparing for a number of trials.  I'm going to
go to Vegas next week anyway bc i need a break.  Thanks for thinking of me -
I'm doing fine. The only time i cried recently was at my arbitration hearing
yesterday - my client's testimony was so touching that i cried (how
embarassing!) - hate when that happens!  It's not the 1st time & i'm sure
not the last.  I know you are very busy during these last few weeks and am
touched that you even had time to think of me.  I thought about you too on
V-day & should have done something special since it probably will not be
possible again. Ok, stop rolling your eyes - you think i'm a flake.  That's
one of the greatest things about you - you are never flaky.  lots of love,
sue

Bradley.Barta@swec.com on 02/14/2001 09:43:16 AM
Rob - We've reviewed your memo which sets forth general points of your
negotiations with Siemens.  Following are comments and questions regarding
certain negotiated points:

EOT Claim Agreement

Owner must operate and maintain per O&M manuals and industry practices on oil;
if not, owner must correct items materially affecting Contractor's 
commissioning
obligations

We observe that while this point places reasonable responsibility on the Owner
to correct problems that were a result of their commercial operations, it is
introduces an opportunity for the Contractor to place unfounded blame on the
owner for affecting the Contractor's ability to commission.

Risk of Loss remains with owner during commissioning on gas

We understand that the Facility is under the care, custody and control of the
Owner and that the Facility is currently operating under the insurance 
coverage
intended for the commercial operating period (versus the construction period).
Please confirm that there is no reason to be concerned about insurance 
coverage
if a problem arises resulting in material damage attributable to Contractor
action during commissioning on gas.  We are also advising the Lenders to have
this point reviewed by an insurance advisor.

Degradation - agree to use curves with credit to owner for degradation during
commissioning

During our last conference call it was indicated that the first choice was to
test to determine degradation and the alternative was to agree on a set of
curves.  It appears that Siemens was unwilling to agree to the test approach.
We observe that the curves used to determine owner credit may be biased to the
benefit of Siemens.  We trust that your operations experts will diligently
review the basis for the curves.

Performance LD's on gas per the EPC contract with first $4,000,000 forgiven by
owner

Please explain the rationale behind forgiving $4 million of Contractor LDs.

Delay LD's on gas do not start until 60 days after performance test on gas

During our last conference call it was indicated that there would be a stand
down until 7/1/01 when gas is available, no LDs would be paid related to oil
firing performance, and that the LD clock would start if gas commissioning is
not complete within 60 days.  We do not understand the above negotiated point.
Please confirm that our understanding is correct or clarify your negotiated
point.

TAA Agreement

No 12-month look back.

We assume that this negotiated point is related to the time period factored 
into
the availability calculation for purposes of determining whether or not an
extension or additional work by the Contractor has been triggered as a result 
of
dropping below the availability standards.  Please explain how this negotiated
point affects the mechanics of the TAA and also please explain how 
availability
will be calculated.  As we noted during our last conference call, we are
concerned that Siemens believes that the availability value is not reduced if
maintenance work is being performed during periods when the Facility is not
being dispatched.

12 month Initial Guarantee Period, with the clock suspended for gas
commissioning unless owner delay.

We interpret the above negotiated point to mean that the 12-month clock for 
the
initial guarantee period stops during commissioning regardless of how long it
takes the Contractor to commission on gas (unless delays are attributable to
Owner) and re-starts after Contractor has successfully completed the 
performance
testing on gas.  Please confirm that our understanding is correct.

In order to provide the lenders an adequate warranty period on gas (if
there are additional delays on the P/L) our Insurance group has  indicated
that we will have no problem obtaining 12 months renewable business
interruption insurance when we go operational on gas.  This should solve
the issue over the revised warranty with Siemens because it covers defects,
design, and workmanship on the turbines and includes lost profits, etc.
Incidentally, for insurance purposes the turbines are designated DE3 which
is not a new technology designation.   The duration of BI coverage is 18
months per event with US$150,000 deductible.

Stone & Webster is advising the Lenders to have an insurance advisor review 
this
point.

Thanks in advance for your response.  Hope all is well.

Bradley

this is also an ok approach .Please clear with Eddy

Rick, Dean & Rob --

I have some hesitations about having the Bank say re the conditions to the 
GSA cannot be satisfied.  I suppose we are not really concerned that YPF will 
anticipatorily cancel the GSA, but t would seem to be an invitation to them 
to do that.

Also, do we really want the Banks to say it is not fruitful to proceed with 
the consent?  Would it be better for the Banks simply to stick to their guns 
re the consent, decline all of YPF's suggested changes, and insist on their 
version of December 2000.  That way, YPF could be portrayed as partly to 
blame for failure to achieve a financial close by May 4, 2001.  It might help 
deflect the argument that we had control over all of the C.P.s and rigged it 
to get out of the GSA.

What do you think?

Please proceed along the lines you suggest in your discussion with schumacher 
and Rob/Rick needs to talk to the business people at the Bank. Lets see if 
the Lenders can respond in writing.

A quick update in regards to Doris Rodriguez's letter regarding the YPF
Consent:

I have left a message for David Schumacher asking that he call me to Doris's
letter.  Given the current status of things, it would seem to me that there
is no value in proceeding with the consent.  On the other hand, we need to
continue to build our case in the event of an arbitration with YPF.  It
would seem to me that the best thing would be for the lenders to tell Doris
that the lenders'  understanding is that, under the current project
schedule, the conditions precedent under the YPF GSA cannot be satisfied,
and that Enron and YPF have had some discussions regarding this issue and
will continue to discuss the issue.  Until the YPF GSA is restructured in
some form, there is little value in proceeding on the consent, especially
given that YPF and the lenders are still so far apart on the consent.

The status of the YPF consent is as follows: Doris sent a revised draft of
the consent to the lenders in August 2000.  The lenders responded with
comments (which included several of my comments) in October 2000.  Doris
then responded with a counter-draft in December 2000.  Doris' latest draft
again had numerous, significant comments, which I have not thoroughly
reviewed.  A quick review, however, indicates that Doris has cut in half
many of the time periods for the lenders to cure SCG defaults.  In addition,
Doris has restructured several provisions in order to make certain YPF
commitments run in favor of SCG only and not the lenders, which may be of no
value to the lenders in a situation in which the lenders have to step into
SCG's shoes.  I am confident that the lenders will not accept Doris's
comments, since many are proposals the lenders have rejected before.

Let me know whether I should suggest to Dave Schumacher a response to Doris
along the lines I recommend.

My e-mail is: RGGDEE@AOL.com

home phone is 281-334-2360.

Will advise of cel # when I get one (soon).

Donna:  what is Gay day?  I do not want to miss any significant events.  

Mr. Gay,

My name is Daniel Lisk, your new Gas Scheduler.  I'm slated to begin work on
the Monday the 18th, and must say I am VERY excited to get started.  It will
be an honor to work for Enron.  I know I am just beginning a long and
productive career with an amazing company.

I received your email address from Molly Magee.  I had a few questions
regarding Holiday plans and start-day preparation and she directed me to
this email address.  I know you are very busy, so please reply at your
convenience.

My first question regards holiday planning.  If I remember correctly, it was
mentioned someone was working or on call one weekend a month.  It may be too
early to tell, but if I'm scheduled to work that weekend (December 22nd -
25th) I would like to make plans accordingly.  My mother in Missouri can be
very persistent (aka annoying) and wants to know my plans.

Also, I would like to put my name first on volunteers to work that weekend.
However, I understand my lack of experience may prevent me from accepting
that responsibility this soon.  If I will not be working, may I ask that you
tell me what days I will have off.  I need to know if I should buy a plane
ticket, get my car serviced for the drive, or make plans in Houston.

Finally, I've bought a training video covering Excel and begun reading a
book titled "Trading Natural Gas", by Fletcher J. Sturm (former senior
I look forward to seeing you again next week Mr. Gay.  My schedule on Monday
appears to be; "New Hire Training" from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm.  If possible, I
can be on your floor early to observe, leave for training from 8 to 4, then
return at 4:10 pm and stay until the close of business if you like?

Thank you.

Respectfully,

Daniel D. Lisk

Attached is the e-mail that I revised pursuant to our discussions.  I have 
also sent to Bob Carter, the ENA lawyer on the National Gypsum deal.  As you 
can see, he does not see any issues that would prevent sending to my contact 
at National Gypsum.

Do you have additional comments or changes?

(Also, I will pursue getting the name of the entity that sent it to National 
Gypsum.)

I want to send this to our customer, National Gypsum, but thought you
should review prior to it going out.  Do you have any comments?

I've talked with several people familar with gas sales and distribution in
the southwestern portion of the US.  Summarized below is their collective
response:

     1.   The pipeline capacity is limited due to an order by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), and FERC has jurisdiction over the
interstate sale and distribution of natural gas.  The Department of
Transportation has jursidiction only over certain safety issues resulting
from the gas explosion.
     2.   The spot market has risen in the Arizona area -- currently it is
at $  17.11__ for 30-day _Jan'01__.  The reason prices are high is due to the
excessive demand in California for natural gas for its power plants.  Thus,
gas is flowing into California -- the only way gas will flow east away from
California is in response to higher prices.
     3.   Enron is not "holding back supplies to the area".  Enron is not a
producer of natural gas, does not have ANY physical supplies, and does not
have or utilize storage capacity in this area.  Also, Enron controls
pipeline capacity over the El Paso Gas Pipeline of only 80,000 cf per day
-- this pipeline has a capacity of 4 BILLION cf per day (at full capacity).
The dominant holder of capacity on this pipleline is a gas marketing
subsidiary of El Paso Gas.  Moreover, there are numerous marketers of
natural gas in the area, ensuring competition and pricing visibility and
liquidity.  Thus, there is no way that Enron could control or influence the
price of physical suppliles in the area.
     4.   Gas trading generally occurs over monthly or seasonal (e.g.,
winter) periods, not annual periods.  And, the winter season for which
marketers generally quote prices is considered to be November to March (not
on December 1 as the note below suggests).
     5.   Finally, Enron would not want to hold back physical supplies to
the area.  Enron is primarily a trader of natural gas, engaged in the
buying and selling of the non-physical and financial side of natural gas
supplies.  Through Enron On Line, Enron is both a seller AND a buyer,
making margins on trades of positions in natural gas.   Thus, Enron would
be disadvantaged by not selling gas positions, even if it could hold back
physical supplies to the area, because it is not engaged in buying and
selling of positions in natural gas.

Rich,

The following information was included in an email that was sent to our
executives and CEO.  The tone leaves a negative impression for Enron.  Can
you or someone at Enron comment on Enron's role or lack thereof with
respect
to this item?  I am afraid this will taint our plans if not addressed
quickly.  I want to circulate Enron's side of the story.

Carol

Excerpt from email circulated today:

Due to the lingering effects of the August gas pipeline explosion in New
Mexico that killed 10 people, coupled with some possible market
manipulation
by Enron, we're facing a potential problem at Phoenix in the short term and
possibly all three western plants longer term.  The pipeline which is owned
by El Paso Gas is back in operation, but is being limited to 50% of
capacity.  Weather has turned cold, spiking demand for gas in the region.
Enron appears to be holding back supplies to the area until at least
December 1st, when many of its contracts set the index price for the
following year.  Consequently, gas prices on the spot market in Arizona are
hitting $25 per MMBTU.  The situation has caused several marketers to
declare force majeure.  If our marketer does so, we'll be curtailed.  As
you
probably know, we don't have any backup fuel capabilities at these three
plants.  The U.S. Dept of Transportation controls this and is reported to
be
getting involved.  Will keep you posted as it unfolds.

Bob:  not too many new ones.

1.  Continued to see increased volumes and transactions on desk.  As of 
November, we have increased volumes to over 5 Bcf/day, up from about 2 
Bcf/day last six month period.  We are continuing to handle month end close, 
and get all volumes scheduled daily.

2.  Continued to give support to the contract exchange project.  We have 
given my time and the resources from the group.

3.  Re-staffed the group after we lost some key, experienced personnel.  We 
have the new guys up and running and hope to really make some things happen 
from here on out.  

If I think of any thing else I will let you know.  Thanks.

Bob:  per your request, here is the rundown on Patti's activities for August 
and beyond.

1.  We calculated the amount we made on her experience in handling El Paso's 
transport to be close to $1 million/ month.

2.  I could not even begin to calculate the amount made just by having her 
here.  If Patti had just quit with everyone else gone, the amount lost on El 
Paso would be huge, including loss of credibility on our part with our 
customers.  The exact amount would be close to $1 million/month I would think.

3.  The spreads out West have been huge this summer.  We were able to take 
advantage of this because Patti was here to do the scheduling during a very 
difficult time.

4.  When I was out for the entire month of August, Patti was not only holding 
down a desk that usually three people handle, but was also filling in on 
management duties.  

5.  Patti worked 14 weeks in a row, including weekends, without taking a day 
off.  She worked at least 12 hours a day during this time, handling several 
different jobs at a time.

6.  The exact value of what Patti did is hard to determine.  I would estimate 
that her presence here and stepping in to help out was woth about $5 million 
to the desk.

Joe,

Late last year Lucy Ortiz gave me your name as the contact regarding gas 
sales under the APEA contract.  I have also been coordinating with Randy Gay 
in our Houston office regarding payments and deliveries.

We have been notified by Coral Energy, representing the City of Glendale, 
that effective December 1, 2000, Glendale wants to receive their entire 
quantity (4,178 MMBtu/d) at the Nova Inventory Transfer ("NIT") point.  This 
point is located in Alberta and will be supplied by Enron's Calgary office.

Can you please notify Chase Manhattan, for purposes of settling the swaps 
associated with this transaction, to settle at NIT for December 2001 and 
beyond, unless another notice is issued to us.

If you no longer have responsibility for managing these issues, could you 
please forward this to the correct person.

Thanks,

Laird Dyer (415.782.7805)

Bob:  we would be looking at El Paso and Northwest Pipelines.  Thanks.

Julie:  the price should be $3.54.  Thanks.

Rob, listed below are my key accomplishments for 2000:

1) TGS:

-Key member of TGS Finance Committee; attended quarterly meetings, 
participated in major financing decisions and made recommendations to TGS 
and/or ESA management. 

-During 2000, assisted TGS finance staff in refinancing $300MM of 
non-recourse debt in two separate transactions;  a 3 year $150MM bank FRN, 
and a 3 year $150MM Eurobond issue.  Role included helping evaluate lead 
arranger proposals and term sheets, selecting lead arrangers and participants 
and participating in road shows representing Enron sponsorship.  Successfully 
raised $300MM during a very challenging time in Argentina as well as a very 
difficult time for the U.S. capital markets (i.e., Eurobond completed 
immediately following the largest single drop in history of the NASDAQ).  

2) TRANSREDES:

a) $10MM Liquidity Facility:  Lead approval and documentation effort for 
$10MM Enron-provided credit facility to provide liquidity for oil spill clean 
up expenditures and  Cuiaba construction cash calls.  Prepared DASH, managed 
approval process wtih RAC and TRSA management, and lead documentation to 
closure.  Loan was successfully repaid with proceeds from the Cuiaba buy-out 
transaction.  Credit facility allowed TRSA to avoid a severe liquidity crisis 
which could have stopped the clean up process and put its concession from the 
Bolivian government at risk.

b) Buy-out of TRSA's interests in the Cuiaba Project:  Selected for lead role 
in Enron's buy out of 50% of TRSA's interest in the Cuiaba Project for $40MM 
(Enron's share).  Prepared DASH and ESA risk committee and Enron Corp. board 
presentations, worked with RAC to obtain approval for transaction and 
coordinated legal documentation process with counsel (internal and external) 
and partners (Shell as co-buyer, TRSA as seller).  

Buy-out transaction restored much needed liquidity to TRSA's balance sheet 
and permitted Enron and Shell to move ahead on the Cuiaba financing without 
having to guarantee TRSA's pro-rata share of contingent sponsor support 
required by the Cuiaba lenders.  Restored liquidity to TRSA will permit it to 
meet its working capital needs until May 2001 when its new tariffs become 
effective (post Transition period).

c) Cuiaba Contingent Sponsor Support: In coordination with TRSA/Cuiaba 
buy-out effort, assisted Cuiaba team in obtaining approval of contingent 
sponsor support for OPIC/KfW financing.  Prepared DASH and worked with RAC to 
obtain internal approval and assisted in preparing ESA risk committee and 
Enron Corp. board presentations.  Contingent support package along with 
buy-out transaction was approved by Enron's board. 

c) Financial Advisory Assignment:

Selected by TRSA and ESA management to work with TRSA in a financial advisory 
capacity, to advise and assist in the arrangement of up to $700MM in new 
third party debt over the next 4 years to finance TRSA capital expansion 
program.  In exchange for such services ESA began receiving a $12,500/month 
retainer fee (October 2000 - May 2001 = $100,000 of fee income) plus the 
reimbursement of all out-of-pocket expenses.  

Roadshow with U.S. Exim, Bolivian pension funds, local banks and 
international banks with local presence and CAF now completed.  Assisting 
TRSA management with resolution of Supreme Decree and Tariff Reset and 
existing debt seniority issue.

GTB:

a) Financial Advisory Assignment:  Selected by GTB and ESA management to work 
with GTB in a financial advisory capacity, to advise and assist in the 
arrangement of up to $210MM in new third party debt over the next 4 years to 
finance GTB's capital expansion program.  In exchange for such services, ESA 
began receiving a $12,500/month retainer fee (October 2000 - May 2001 = 
$100,000 of fee income) plus the reimbursement of all out-of-pocket 
expenses.  

Roadshow with U.S. Exim, Bolivian pension funds, local banks and 
international banks with local presence and CAF now completed.  Letter of 
Interest obtained from U.S. Exim.  Working with GTB management to finalize 
credit rating process and clean up commercial contracts for financing. 

TRAINING:  Completed Executive Impact training course (requirement for 2000).

In the event you did not receive the amount of manager/peer feedback that you 
would like to see to prepare my review, I do have the feedback booklet that I 
got recently from the Executive Impact course that you could use.  I have it 
in my office...I can have Blanca get it for you if you want to see it.

Thanks for your support.

BRS

Who are you calling Ladies?

Phillip:  I agree with your conclusions, and we have already started 
addressing most of these issues.  

First of all, I would like to say that all of the schedulers are performing 
at a high level, except for Hillary and Jan.  We have formally addressed 
Hillary's performance problems, and he is on  a schedule for improvement or 
he is out.  We have informally addressed Jan's performance issues with her, 
and next week intend to formalize that also.  That Jan makes more than anyone 
else in the group makes her situation quite critical in my eyes, because we 
are not getting a return on that investment.

The rest of the group is paid based on lots of factors that you are already 
aware of, years of service, years in scheduling, level of performance, etc.  
In Stacey's particular case, I am recommending her for promotion at the end 
of the year, which will bump her pay scale up and make her pay more equitable 
with her job performance.  Also, I intend to help smooth over other 
inequities through the bonus pool.

In regards to Patti, I have recommended her for a bonus for her service 
during the rough time we've had when we were understaffed.  Bob Superty has 
supported this, and the information you provided him this last week should 
help in that endeavour.  Patti has had her pay increased this year after a 
salary survey was performed by our HR group.  I would like to point out that 
Patti is pretty well paid for someone with her experience level.  Also, Patti 
would move up in the pay scale if she is promoted to Manager.  I am not sure 
what the exact plan is for Patti and myself as far as how that will go.  I 
would like to say that I feel more comfortable being back as each day goes 
on, and am ready to make a move to trading anytime now if that is what you 
and Mike still want to do.  

As regards to the new hires:  yes, we can hire more like these at these 
prices.  We would love to have employees like Matt, and Ted and Shelly, 
especially at these prices.  Patti did an excellent job hiring these 
individuals.  We have already started the process of looking for more like 
these to start backfilling in for Hillary and Jan.  We also need to hire more 
for establishing a bigger physical presence in the west.  We probably need to 
sit down and go over with you and Mike as to what kind of plans you have for 
expanding the desk.  

Finally, I would like to bring up that Lucci has requested that the Denver 
office do all nominations for IM Denver deals.  This has met stiff resistance 
in the past, and I do not know how ya'll feel about it, but I promised that I 
would bring it up. I personally feel that Denver and CIG would be isolated 
from us if the operations were to move to Denver.  

If you have additional questions or comments please let me know.  Thanks.  

Ina:  my login is rgay.  Thanks

Ina:  could you please get me access to ECT Trading on the O drive?  Let me 
know if you need anything.  Thanks.

Cooper, Phillip Allen pointed me in your direction to be added to access for 
the westpower internet site?  Let me know if you need additional 
information.  Thanks.

Randy
x31991

Dwight:  thanks for the sessions we've had.  I think that moving forward in 
my new job will not allow me the time to continue our sessions.  Once again, 
thanks.

Phillip:  the changes I would like to make are to promote Patti to Manager 
whenever you feel the time is right, and then I am going to recommend Stacey 
for promotion to Sr. Specialist based on her recent performances.  I also 
would like to be able to use the bonus system this year to reward some of the 
people who have been here the last couple of years.  It seems like we have to 
keep paying outside people more and we don't get to reward the experienced 
people who stick with us enough.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Phillip:  I'm working on getting the official list. We should have it 
sometime this afternoon.  

Theresa:  thanks for all your help over the last week.  We really appreciate 
it and are glad we can cooperate so closely with the Denver office.  If you 
need anything, let us know.  Again, Thanks.

Check that.?  We have pre-bid starting at 3:00.   Anytime before that would 
be fine.  Thanks.

I attach DWS/Shell comments on the latest version of the ECA.  The comments
appear in the text in bold caps, underlined.

The following also need to be included in the draft:

1.  provisions for sponsor guarantee buyout, once agreed; and

2.  a provision along the lines of Section 7.06 of the TBS Security
Agreement (relating to step-in to the TBS agreements) so as to give
SOTL/Enron Corp privity in relation to these rights.  (This point was agreed
with Mary some time ago in one of the New York meetings.)

Consideration also needs to be given as to whether there should be express
recognition of the rights of STDC and Enron Netherlands to subscribe subdebt
under the ECA.

Regards

Read this, guys..it's really funny.? The format isn't exactly pretty, but 
you'll be able to figure it out: 
? 

The Real Debate 

Jim Lehrer:???? Welcome to the second presidential debate between Vice 
President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush. The candidates have agreed on 
these rules:? I will ask a question. The candidate will ignore the question 
and deliver rehearsed remarks 
designed to appeal to undecided women voters. 
The opponent will then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten 
senior citizens into voting for him. 
When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper softly while he 
continues 
to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more minutes. 

Let's start with the vice president. Mr. Gore, can you give us the name 
of 
a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that 
strains the bounds of common sense? 

Gore:??????????? As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly 
made???????????? love the way we have so often during the 30 years of 
our 
rock-solid marriage, the downtrodden have a clear choice in this 
election. 
My opponent wants to cut taxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans. 

I, on the other hand, want to put the richest 1 percent in an iron clad 
lock box so they can't hurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper, who 
is 
here tonight. Mrs. Frampinhamperhas been selling her internal organs, 
one 
by one, to pay for gas so that she can travel to these debates and 
personify problems for me. 

Also, her poodle has arthritis. 

Lehrer:??? Gov. Bush, your rebuttal. 

Bush:???? Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, 
crying with them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity 
exists.? I want to empower those crying people to make their own 
decisions, 
unlike my opponent, whose mother is not Barbara Bush. 

Lehrer:??? Let's turn to foreign affairs. Gov. Bush, if Slobodan 
Milosevic 
were to launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia, would you be able 
to 
pronounce his name? 

Bush:??????? The current administration had eight years to deal with 
that 
guy and didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do 
about that guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies. And then Dick 
would present me several options for dealing with that guy. And then 
Dick 
would tell me which one to choose. 

You know, as governor of Texas, I have to make tough foreign policy 
decisions every day about how we're going to deal with New Mexico. 

Lehrer:??? Mr. Gore, your rebuttal. 

Gore:??????? Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly 
interested 
in. I served my country in Vietnam. I had an uncle who was a victim of 
poison gas in World War I.? I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian 
War. 
And when that war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper 
in 
a way that any undecided woman voter would find romantic. 

If I'm entrusted with the office of president, I pledge to deal 
knowledgeably with any threat, foreign or domestic, by putting it in an 
iron clad lock box. 

Because the American people deserve a president who can comfort them 
with 
simple metaphors. 

Lehrer:??? Vice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security 
system? 

Gore:??????? It's a vital issue, Jim. That's why Joe Lieberman and I 
have 
proposed changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to 
every senior citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a 
single 
penny until the year 2250. In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion 
over 
the next 10 years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs 
delivered free to their homes every Monday by a federal employee who 
will 
also help them with the child-proof cap. 

Lehrer:??? Gov. Bush? 

Bush:??????? That's fuzzy math. I know, because as governor of Texas, I 
have to do math every day. I have to add up the numbers and decide 
whether 
I'm going to fill potholes out on Rt. 36 east of Abilene or commit funds 
to 
reroof the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds. 

Lehrer:??? It's time for closing statements. 

Gore:??????? I'm my own man. I may not be the most exciting politician, 
but 
I will fight for the working families of America, in addition to turning 
the White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me. 

Bush:??????? It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by 
electing no one but Republicans. 

Lehrer:??? Good night.

Can you believe this?  We have more red tape than Washington on this.  
	
	

Stacy Dickson called, and she said penalties for non-performance in the past 
have been handled by supplying information to Legal and they will then write 
a letter to the counterparty stating that per the contract you were supposed 
to deliver X but you didn't perform, so now you owe us $Y.  I asked her what 
she would need to do this and she gave me the following list of items.  
Please coordinate getting this to her - the spreadsheet you prepared may 
already have the volume comparison, prices, and penalty calc in it - we just 
need to get copies of the confirms and contracts.  Let me know if you have 
any questions.  Thanks.

Counterparty Legal Name
Copy of contract
Confirm
Actual Volumes
Prices (prob gas daily)
Amount we think the penalty should be

Guys:  currently the system is designed to match upstreams and downstreams 
for buy/sells in contract exchange, and the scheduler would then recreate 
these paths in Unify.  In my opinion this does not guarantee data integrity 
between the systems.  Carrie and I have scheduled a meeting for 1:30 pm today 
in 21c2 to discuss.  Please feel free to attend and give your opinions.

Hello!

Randy and I were discussing some additional functionality after the meeting 
today. . .

Is there any reason that we could NOT automate the creation of the buy/sell 
or brokered paths in UNIFY once the deals have been matched in the Contract 
Exchange module?  Will the Contract Exchange module contain enough 
information to create the UNIFY path just a scheduler would?  

In other words, is the path creation process for buy/sell deals only manual 
"re-entry" of the data that will be sitting out in Contract Exchange?  OR is 
there additional information that you need to create the path that is not 
sitting in Contract Exchange?

This, of course, assumes that the meter has been added to the deal in 
Contract Exchange and the deal has bridged from SITARA to UNIFY.

It seems to us that this should be possible and valuable, but please give us 
your input!

Thanks,
Carrie

Excellent job.  Thanks for the good work.

Brandee:  i do not plan on being out any time in October as of this time.  
Thanks.

Thanks Laine,

Yes it is very helpful.  However, I think it is apparent that they have an 
increasing anxiety level on a variety of fronts which I am sure is being 
conveyed to the lenders and could significantly impact their willingness to 
fund.  Did you get the same impresion Laine?

Rob and Rick -

 Spoke today with Sue Garven and Brad Barta.  Below find comments/notes -

Brad mentioned his concern about turnover of O&M staff with Duane's 
departure.   Responded that we had a capable plant manager with 10 years 
plant experience plus key people at the lower levels had remained.  Also told 
Brad that the two I&C consultants we have had since the outset of the project 
are still working at the facility and that we were taking on 6 technicans 
from Siemens during combined cycle start-up.  Brad seemed okay with the 
response.

Discussed two key contractual issues -
TAA - They expressed the importance of keeping the TAA in place with no 
dilution since it is so important to the lenders.  Furthermore they mentioned 
that SCC's position is Siemens will come after us to dilute the TAA and that 
in fact it is no longer valid.  (I agree Siemens will come after us for the 
risk profile modification) Responded that we felt that the TAA was still 
valid and mentioned that Siemens might want the TAA to commence at completion 
on oil.  Sue's commented that we need to calculate how much it would cost us 
to keep the start date at Substantial Completion on fuel.
Phase II - Explained that given the current commissioning program that we had 
no intention of lowering the dampners and testing for simple cycle Phase II 
on gas.  They are on board with this concept.  We just need to get a white 
paper to them to explain in detail.

Drilling -
The comment was the formations are tough but will get there slowly but surely.
Using 1 May as gas available at the plant date.

Change Orders -
Transmitted SCCs frustration on little movement on change orders related to 
the pipeline.  Told them that many of the change orders still without 
documents and in any case the strategy was to settle up at the end of the job.
Brad and Sue mentioned that they would feel more comfortable with the process 
and putting a number on the value of the change orders if we were closer to 
resolution.
worried about the size of the change orders - especially the outside case.
have not given this to the banks
there outside change order case is as follows -

    Power Plant  Pipeline  Total

Total EPC         US$ 419 mm
Approved Change Orders                    22 mm
Pending Change Orders  US$  10 mm  US$ 25 mm               35 mm
Cont Change Orders                8 mm            24 mm               32 mm

Hope this information is useful.

Sabra:  so thank you for giving blood, which means as much to me as the 
playground equipment.  Your support has been like everyone else's, 
overwhelming.  Take care.

Randy

FYI:  our NWPL out of balance is the Canadian desk not keeping up.
PSCO and WIC are the Denver office.

Thanks

Rob,

It has been some time now since I forwarded you my resume, and in that I
have not heard back from you, I suspect that your particular group had no
open positions.  I am genuinely interested in Enron, and feel that my
diverse background, experience and education could possibly benefit your
company in a number of capacities.  Therefore, I would greatly appreciate
your assistance in advising me as to whom I should direct my expression of
interest.  Should it go to Human Resources, Department Heads, or perhaps
specific individuals ?

I am attaching hereto, a current copy of my resume should that be helpful in

Thanks in advance for your cooperation.   Please feel free to call Shelly 
Butler @
713-853-4584 or Jana Giovannini @ 713-853-9233 with any questions you might 
have.

of course.  You should probably sit with Stacey, because she has the most 
daisy chains and confirming to do.  Any day but Friday will do this week.  
Let me know.

that is my reputation

sure

... and retirement.  I resigned on Friday but it won't be effective until Feb 
28.  Check out the cabinet I made.

Love 

Rob

Thanks Stacey

I think we are on the right track from our meeting yesterday.  I talked to 
Patti today and she is confirming the way we want to do things from a users 
perspective.  My thought is that we get a good, general, working model as to 
how the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go over 
different scenarios within each region, such as Opal Plant, Socal, etc.  We 
can see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with.

I also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and I did 
not want to forget them.  

1.  When we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, how 
will we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred.  

2.  Should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changes 
at a late time?  We could do the rest over the phone.

3.  On EDI pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 11:45 am, but it 
would affect customers whose noms are due at 11:30.  

I thought these were just questions we might want to think about.  I'm sure 
there are a lot of others.

Thanks.

Bob:   I have not met with them in a long time, and do not plan to anymore.  
Thanks.

  Randy, 

  Bob Superty would like you to attend this meeting, if you are available

Hi

I'm sorry we missed you at the Christmas Party.  My wife and daughter had 
tickets to a Christmas Play that conflicted, otherwise it would have been 
nice to see everyone.  Things are fine with me, though big changes are in 
store.  I'm really worried about Peter and Brian because they have not heard 
anything yet from anyone about what their role will be.  I should have more 
to say about my situation by tomorrow afternoon.

Cheers

Heather:  no West Deskers need to go late.  Thanks.

Russell:  i sold JC Energy 1.284/day @ socal @ Index flat for the month of 
August.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Hi Kathleen, Randy and Chris,

I've made some headway this afternoon.  Juanita gave me info on Alma Roeshot
so a short article can be inserted.  Joh Scott gave me info on the upcoming
water board and I'd like to include that article, with your okay, Kathleen.

Still don't know who lives at 509 Narcissus, but Juanita explained all that
was involved!

Looking forward to a quick response!

Thanks,

Melissa Raciti is asking whether we can hold the critical path call on
Friday rather than Wednesday.  Frank will be back from vacation tomorrow,
and the Lenders are hoping to use the 10am EDT time slot for an internal
call.  Does anyone object to this change in schedule?

Donna:  this sounds acceptable to us.  Thanks.

Hi Kathleen, Randy, Chris, and Trish,

Attached is the text of the August issue of The Islander.  The headings will
be lined up when Trish adds the art and ads.  A calendar, also, which is in
the next e-mail.

I'll appreciate your comments by the end of tomorrow, Monday.

There are open issues which I sure hope get resolved before printing:

1.  I'm waiting for a reply from Mike Bass regarding tenses on the Home Depot
article.  Don't know if there's one developer or more and what the name(s)
is/are.

2.  Didn't hear back from Ted Weir regarding minutes for July's water board
meeting.  I think there are 2 meetings minutes missed, 6/22 and July.

3.  Waiting to hear back from Cheryl Hanks about the 7/6 City Council and 6/7
BOA meetings minutes.

4.  Don't know the name of the folks who were honored with Yard of the Month.
 They're at 509 Narcissus.

I'm not feeling very good about the missing parts but need to move on
schedule!  I'm also looking for a good dictionary to check the spellings of
ettouffe, tree-house and orneryness.  (Makes me feel kind of ornery, come to
think about it!)

Please let me know if you have revisions.  Hope your week is starting out
well.

What would be the basis for their allegation that the TAA is not valid.  Is 
their a legal basis for their contention?

Laine A Powell@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT
12/10/2000 04:22 PM
Rob and Rick -

 Spoke today with Sue Garven and Brad Barta.  Below find comments/notes -

Brad mentioned his concern about turnover of O&M staff with Duane's 
departure.   Responded that we had a capable plant manager with 10 years 
plant experience plus key people at the lower levels had remained.  Also told 
Brad that the two I&C consultants we have had since the outset of the project 
are still working at the facility and that we were taking on 6 technicans 
from Siemens during combined cycle start-up.  Brad seemed okay with the 
response.

Discussed two key contractual issues -
TAA - They expressed the importance of keeping the TAA in place with no 
dilution since it is so important to the lenders.  Furthermore they mentioned 
that SCC's position is Siemens will come after us to dilute the TAA and that 
in fact it is no longer valid.  (I agree Siemens will come after us for the 
risk profile modification) Responded that we felt that the TAA was still 
valid and mentioned that Siemens might want the TAA to commence at completion 
on oil.  Sue's commented that we need to calculate how much it would cost us 
to keep the start date at Substantial Completion on fuel.
Phase II - Explained that given the current commissioning program that we had 
no intention of lowering the dampners and testing for simple cycle Phase II 
on gas.  They are on board with this concept.  We just need to get a white 
paper to them to explain in detail.

Drilling -
The comment was the formations are tough but will get there slowly but surely.
Using 1 May as gas available at the plant date.

Change Orders -
Transmitted SCCs frustration on little movement on change orders related to 
the pipeline.  Told them that many of the change orders still without 
documents and in any case the strategy was to settle up at the end of the job.
Brad and Sue mentioned that they would feel more comfortable with the process 
and putting a number on the value of the change orders if we were closer to 
resolution.
worried about the size of the change orders - especially the outside case.
have not given this to the banks
there outside change order case is as follows -

    Power Plant  Pipeline  Total

Total EPC         US$ 419 mm
Approved Change Orders                    22 mm
Pending Change Orders  US$  10 mm  US$ 25 mm               35 mm
Cont Change Orders                8 mm            24 mm               32 mm

Hope this information is useful.

Hi Mike,

Thanks for the update.  Unfortunately, the Civic Club is unable to run the
article in The Islander, because of its political nature.  President Kathleen
Gay reviewed the article, as it was previously written, and advised me last
night that it is against Civic Club policy and bylaws to be involved in
political issues.

If you have questions or comments, please contact Kathleen.

Is it to late to change the Home Depot article. The issue with the county has
been resolved

Here is a revised version

"The developer of the Home Depot/ Target Center on FM2094 is proceeding on
plan.

The developers have requested that the Texas Department of Transportation
modify the new FM 2094 road to include three left turn lanes and a light at
Miller Road. The Water District has agreed to also include the new center in
their district as long as they pay any extra costs and meet certain other
conditions. The Developers have agreed to pay the extra cost for both
requests. The City passed a resolution to support both requests by the
developer and to express our intention to annex the property once the
developer closes on the property and makes an annexation request of the City.

The County and the Developers have also agreed to share in resurfacing part,
about 2100 feet, of Hanson Road- - a $200,000 cost. This is a significant
expense on top of all the other cost mentioned above.

But the project is proceeding as planned. The developers are still planning
on closing on the property in the next few weeks."

Mike Bass

Maybe just half a day for me.

Patti will definitely be out on Friday.  I am thinking about being out (I 
have a lot of vacation left).  

Bob:  the only other thing I might add is that it makes a record of confirmed 
nomination information that may help in discrepancies (wrong contract #'s, 
etc.).  Otherwise, this is a great starting point.

Bob:  just to update my previous memo, Cynthia Lara has just accepted our 
offer, with a tentative start date of Monday July 17th.  Thanks.

Rebecca has asked for a review of the Cuiaba project.   Her current thinking 
is that it should be under one shop - not split responsibility.   Which shop 
is not clear to me - I presume this will be decided pretty soon.

The review will take place the week of Dec 4th.   She wants a straight 
forward  decription of what is left to be done and what the issues are.  I am 
thinking the presenters are Laine, Rick, Jose.  In attendance are Rob and 
John.     Can divide the presentation up into - 

getting the construction finished/cost issues/EECC - subcontractor issues. - 
Laine 
Furnas/Electrobras issues - Rick 
YPF - gas supply - Mark to market position - opportunities - Rick
MAE/ONS issues - current thinking.  - Jose
Current economics. - Rick

Everyone should have a page prepared ahead of time with the discussion topics 
on it - she doesn't want a detailed presentation - just the facts.   Can we 
send the page per topic around by this friday.  

I will ask Rebecca for two hours the week of the 4th and let you know.

Joe - we should talk about where the project should best end up - I think 
Rebecca is flexible -   don't really know what Dave is thinking.

I spoke with Mary Mervene this morning and the llenders declined to convene 
this week although we will arrange an ECA call for Thursday or Friday.  Mary 
has requested that we do the following:

1) Send the Lenders and S&W the new budget info and the revised change order 
summary.

2) Revise the model to reflect the new costs and the new timeline.

3) S&W will review the model and then we will repeat the exercise of 
calculating fuel oil and Furnas penalty exposures.

4) Finalize sponsor support elements.

This can all occur fairly quickly except I am concerned because we have not 
resolved the budget with Shell,  and theoretically the lenders can take 30 
days to review the model and budget when submitted.

We also need to discuss strategy because we may want to delete the 
contingency from the budget since the lenders are going to want the sponsors 
to commit to some general contingency supporty anyway.  

Bob:  as of right now, the following are leaving 

Denise Squirrel  leaving company
Natalie Baker  Central Desk rates group

The following have outstanding offers:

Cynthia Lara  Sr. Specialist  $60,000

The following will be made an offer

Josh Chapa  Sr. Specialist  $60,000

I am also planning to bring in an associate  (Phillip is working on this).  

If you need anything else just let me know.  Thanks.

Toni:  please make the offer to Josh Chapa asap.  Thanks.

Toni:  can you please work up an offer for Josh Chapa for $60,000?  Do not 
make the offer until you hear back from me, but I would like to move on this 
asap.  Thanks. 

Toni:  I've been gone the last few days, so could you give me an update as to 
where we are on Cynthia's offer and/or her response?  Thanks.

received (I did receive them).  Thanks.

Jana:  I would definitely like to have an analyst start as soon as possible.  
Let me know what the procedure is (i.e. do I interview, will an anlyst just 
be assigned to me, etc.)  I had already talked to Mason Hamlin before, and he 
opted for another rotation, although he was perffectly acceptable to me.  So 
let me know what I need to do and when I could expect an analyst.  Also, a

Bob:  here is our status from this mornings outage event.

NWPL:  we were able to manually input 80% of next days nominations.  Since we 
were not able to EDI, we will have to manually input all successive 
nominations for the day, as well as all actual scheduled volumes in Unify.  
We were also only able to get in our 80% of nominations with NWPL's help, as 
they extended the nomination deadline for us.  The other 20% of next day 
business will be nominated as an intra-day.

El Paso:  basically the same as NWPL..  We were able to manually get in 100% 
of nominations, but only because El Paso kept their system open an extra hour 
for us.   

Let me know if you need aything else.  Thanks.  

Jana::  I am the manager of West Desk Logistics, and I would like to start 
having analysts rotate into my group.  The gas trading desk director, Phillip 
Allen is also very high on this idea.  Could you give me a call so we could 
discuss?  I would like to get one of the new hires as quickly as possible.  
My extension is 31991.  Thanks.

Toni:  give me a call so we can discuss Josh.  Also, I need Cynthia Lara 
scheduled for interviews as soon as possible.  Thanks.  You can reach me at

Copom surprises with larger interest rates reduction

Yesterday night the Brazilian Monetary Policy Committee (COPOM) made a larger
than expected basic interest rates reduction. It came from 18.5% to 17.5% per
year level, setting downward bias until next meeting on July 18-19. This will 
at
least influence favorably the local markets, except foreign exchange in the
short run, boosting the mood of the society which may follow business leaders
who have already declared such one as a very positive move to the economic
growth side.

Assuming the move as first of others, despite not so large for the coming
months, consumers expectations may boost promoting additional economic growth 
in
the second semester. Argentina would eventually benefit in such scenario since
it may export more to Brazil, helping its difficult situation by generation of
additional reserves.

At this moment, what local players are trying to do is to understand the
rational of such move, which overcome the forecast of even the most optimistic
of the analysts.

The authority to justify the stronger move mentioned inflation forecasts
declining. The last inflation targeting report of the Central Bank shows a
forecast of 6.3% for the official index the IPCA in comparison with the
inflation-target of 6% for 2000 year. In fact, the new forecast in the market 
is
5.5% for 2000, in the best view. Additionally, the last inflation targeting
report shows a forecast of 3.3% against a target of 4% for 2001 year. However,
market argues that this do not justifies the intensity of the decline, 100 
basis
points against markets maximum expectation of a 50 bp reduction. So, there 
must
be other reasons to be understood.

We can list some other positive reasons. Fiscal primary surplus performance is
overcoming even the IMF goals. The cost of funding abroad is declining, as 
shown
by yesterday?s successful sovereign placement of an EUR 750 millions Eurobond 
to
yield 9.2%, comparably less than last September similar issue at 11.53%. We
could include the better mood on the US economic growth adjustment; Argentina
resistance to change the dollar pegged currency regime by new fiscal measures
and some better mood in the world growth as potential factors affecting
expectations. However, even all that does not justify the COPOM move for the
majority of local market makers. They agree in the direction of the move, but
not on the intensity and mainly not on the speed of the interest rates 
decline.

We can list two other potential reasons for such move. One is related to a
probable Standard & Poors upgrade on Brazil in the coming months, which may
eventually be followed by Moody`s later. The second is a political influence 
to
boost government?s popularity and I will risk saying even to make Finance
Minister Pedro Malan?s candidacy to the Presidency in 2002 feasible. On that
evaluation see the analisys of a political think tank based in Brasilia: 
?That?s
the most important political movement of the year. On political terms it 
became
clear a favourable economic scenario, rebounding President Cardoso popularity
and the chances of political victory increasing a lot, all that not ment<oning
that the political noise in Brasilia will diminish".

We have done some preliminary testing of the latest version of Sybase 
(version 12).  We have seen very positive results from our initial tests and 
would like to proceed with a "stress test" (not to be confused with me 
showing up each day at work).  We would like to do 2 tests next week due to 
hardware and business restrictions.

The test would be similar to those from late-1998 (ah, those were the 
days!).  We will ask all users, as well as I.T. folks, to run as many of 
their usual processing during a scripted time frame from approx noon - 1:30pm 
on Tuesday and Wednesday. Be sure to order some yummy pizza or sandwiches for 
your staff!

The Sybase 12.0 environment can be accessed via Start/Programs/Test 
Applications/Unify Applications/Unify Gas-Power Stage.  On the Login window, 
select server = "ASE 12 Test".  If you usual Production password does not 
work, try "houston".  If that does not work, try a neighbor's (Audit says 
that fine, its just a test).  Each user should plan to run several sessions 
where permissible to simulate a heavy load on the system and to make up for 
those not able to participate during this time.  Please have your staff try 
to login some time Monday to insure they have access.

The test script during the time period will be:
12:00 - 1:30 Logistics:  pathing, nominating, running some reports
12:20 - 1:30 Volume Management: do your thing
12:40 - 1:30 Settlements/Accounting:  pile in

Please let me know if your area would NOT be able to assist in this very 
important test.  The results of these 2 tests will dictate whether we should 
pursue our migration to this new release in mid-July.  The less bid weeks 
with poor system performance the better!

Thanks in advance for your help, d.n.

Toni:  Debra is a nice enough person, but does not really fit our needs.  She 
did not seem to fully understand what our job would entail, and I had a hard 
time figuring out what she does now.  She does not seem to possess the energ 
y level or the sense of urgency our job requires.  She is clearly not a hire 
from my perspective.  Call me if you need anything else. 

Jennifer:  we can agree to Southwestern's volume amount for the 10 mmbtu's.  
Thanks.

Hey guys:  just to follow up after our discussion this morning on unfinaled 
invoices, the following will be our procedures.

10th day of month:  invoices sent out
1st business day after 10th:  we will get the unfinaled invoice report from 
settlements and start working on clearing all discrepancies.  We will have 
all discrepancies cleared by the 5th work day after the 10th.
25th day of month:  purchase stuff goes out.
1st work day after 25th:  unfinaled invoice report from settlements, same 
timetable to clear all discrepancies.

Remember:  a discrepancy will consist of anything that could hold an invoice 
from going out the door.  
We need to be very receptive to other groups in helping them clear these up.  
We know more about these deals than anyone, so let's be helpful.
Let's also try to clear these up in a way so as to avoid causing these 
problems in the future, if we can.  

Thanks in advance for everyone's help. 

Toni:  just about any day would be fine.  We are really busy between 7:30 and 
11:30 every morning.  Just let me know when you want to sit down with us.  
Thanks.

Toni:  I would be happy to interview thses candidates.  I also have a couple 
of people that I am already familiar with who I would like to bring in.  What 
do I need to do to make this happen?  Thanks.

Jennifer:  it will be done soon!

Cliff -- Can you please tell Rob and John what you need from them in order
to finalize a draft of the Hermes fee/reimbursement letter?

Bob:  here we go again. 

Bob:  here is what I have so far.  There may be additions (hopefully not 
deletions).   Thanks. 

Hello,

We had trouble calc'ing our BC Physical books yesterday and pinponted it to 
this deal, which had an addition yesterday.
In order to get a calc. we deleted the day from the deal. This of course will 
go back in, and I just wanted to let you know what is happening.
The deal was for 111 MMBTU's; EC - IM Canada BC buying from ENA - IM West; 
the entry was dated 05/24/00 to PGEN/KINGSGATE/KING from PGEN/KINGSGATE/KING 
for a fee of NOVA_AECO-DAILY-US-CGPR...   

I have let Rich Gebauer know about it on our end. 

Have a great weekend.

All - FYI, I would suggest copying this and keeping it handy so you can use 
off-hours when necessary (even though the help desk should do the contacting)

Alex - See me about this. I would like some of this info added to the second 
wallet cards your working on.

Thanks - Bob
	
	

Susan,

I am planning to set up an on-call pager and cell phone for Unify Logistics.  
In the meanwhile, please use the following for any Unify Logistics support 
call you may receive:

Seq Name   Home  Pager   Cell
1) On Call Pager    713-284-3757 (not yet activated)
2) Dave Nommensen 281-558-9145 1-888-487-1865  713-562-3986
3) Dave McMullan  281-855-4106 713-285-4982
4) Trisha Luong  281-565-8149 713-285-8715

6) Benedicta (BT) Tung 281-565-9669 713-285-0931

There are several subsystems within Unify.  The above list is strictly 
related to Unify Logistics.  They are they guys that schedule gas on a 7 X 24 
basis.
This does NOT cover the guys in Unify that do Settlements.

Once I have the on-call pager activated, I will let you know.

Thanks, d.n.

Tim:  thanks for the info.  We will follow this from now on.

Anita:  civic club news for this month.  If you have any questions call me at 
281-334-2024. 

The lenders have declined to meet with us at this time.  They have suggested 
the following instead:

1) Send the Lenders and S&W the new budget info and the revised change order 
summary.

2) Revise the model to reflect the new costs and the new timeline.

3) S&W will review the model and then we will repeat the exercise of 
calculating fuel oil and Furnas penalty exposures.

4) Finalize sponsor support elements.

Theoretically the lenders can take 30 days to review the model and budget 
when submitted.

We will arrange an ECA call for Thursday or Friday. 

Marlene:  the following information per your request to set up Transcolorado 
Pipeline in Global.

Let me know if we have any problems with this.  Thanks.
	
	

Based on feedback from multi-scheduler pipes, the refreshing of paths can 
tend to slow down the other scheduer on the same pipe.  This is especially 
noticeable when many paths are changed at once.  Even if it takes 1 - 2 
seconds to refresh a path, changing 20 - 30 paths could cause the other 
scheduler on that pipe to wait for 30 - 45 seconds.

We are developing a revised Auto Refresh option to let the scheduler pick 
whether they want Deal changes or Path changes (or both or neither).  To the 
scheduler, it will simply be a change on the Path Manager filter to replace 
the "Auto Refresh" checkbox with two checkboxes:
 - Auto Refresh Deals
 - Auto Refresh Paths
Once selected, this will be the default selection for the duration of that 
Path Manager session just as the current selection works.

This will have no impact on how or when the data is stored in Unify, only 
whether another PC should have its numbers updated.  Nominations will process 
all paths regardless of this new selection.

If our testing goes well, we may actually migrate this change to Unify 
Production tonight.  Please let me know if you know of any reason we should 
not go forward with this plan or have any questions or concerns.

Thanks, d.n.

	
	

I appreciate your inviting the Risk group on this outing.  I understand about

Thanks again.

Bob:  this should be no problem for us.  Thanks.

Alan,

In response to your e-mail, the Letter Agreement has not been further revised 
since I sent it to you on March 30th (that e-mail is attached hereto).

The open issues relate to the following items in Attachment 8 which contains 
certain provisions to be used as part of the "Base Agreement:"

1.  The issue detailed in the attached of whether WestLB will indemnify GEII 
against actions of the Enron entity acting as "Agent."  Rob Gay is reviewing 
this issue.  This issue would impact Section 20.1(a).

2.  The inclusion of certain language that Enron has requested which would 
more clearly establish that GEII's indemnity obligation includes 
consequential damage claims by third parties.  The language at issue appears 
in Sections 20.1(b) and 27.2.

At Brett Wiggs' request, Cheryl Costa is discussing the above issues with 
GEII.  If you have any questions or comments or would like to discuss the 
foregoing, please contact me at 713-655-5102.

Further information about the firm, a list of the Partners and their 
professional qualifications will be provided upon request.
Date: Thu, 30 Mar 2000 12:16:35 -0500
As requested, attached please find the e-mail I sent to Rob Gay to which the 
current draft of the Letter Agreement with GEII is attached and which briefly 
summarizes the indemnity issue we have been discussing.

If you have any questions or would like to discuss the attached further, 
please feel free to contact me at 713-655-5102.

Date: Tue, 28 Mar 2000 17:36:15 -0500
Rob,

Attached please find the current draft of the Letter Agreement (32581.7), 
including Attachment 8 (32573.7) which sets forth various provisions to be 
included in the Purchase Agreement.  Article 20 regarding indemnification is 
included in Attachment 8.

As we discussed, West LB has some concerns regarding including language in 
Article 20 which GEII requested by which West LB would indemnify GEII for 
Enron's acts (in its capacity as Agent).  West LB has suggested they would be 
willing to undertake this obligation if they are reimbursed by Enron through 
the Acquisition and Development Agreement.  Today, for the first time, West 
LB indicated that they may require a cap on this liability for Agent's acts 
in the Purchase Agreement.

GEII has requested that West LB undertake this obligation and Enron has 
agreed to pursue it with West LB.  In light of this, the language which would 
establish West LB's indemnity obligation for the Agent's acts is not included 
in the current draft of Attachment 8.

Please let me know how you would like to proceed.  As I mentioned, we are 
trying to finalize the Letter Agreement with GEII very shortly.  I apologize 
for any confusion and look forward to working with you on this matter.  If 
you have any questions or would like to discuss this matter further, please 
feel free to contact me at 713-655-5102.

Thanks,
Vanessa.

I spoke with Mary Mervene this morning and the llenders declined to convene 
this week although we will arrange an ECA call for Thursday or Friday.  Mary 
has requested that we do the following:

1) Send the Lenders and S&W the new budget info and the revised change order 
summary.

2) Revise the model to reflect the new costs and the new timeline.

3) S&W will review the model and then we will repeat the exercise of 
calculating fuel oil and Furnas penalty exposures.

4) Finalize sponsor support elements.

This can all occur fairly quickly except I am concerned because we have not 
resolved the budget with Shell,  and theoretically the lenders can take 30 
days to review the model and budget when submitted.

We also need to discuss strategy because we may want to delete the 
contingency from the budget since the lenders are going to want the sponsors 
to commit to some general contingency supporty anyway.

Here are some one-liners for people to enjoy, maybe you've heard them but
I'm a BIG Rodney fan.

Bu-bye

Rodney Dangerfield's Material...
 _______________________________________

 I was so poor growing up...If I wasn't born a boy.... I'd have nothing to
 play with.

 A girl phoned me the other day and said .... "Come on over, there's nobody
 home." I went over. Nobody was home.

 During sex, my girlfriend always wants to talk to me. Just the other night
 she called me from a hotel.

 One day as I came home early from work ..... I saw a guy jogging naked. I
 said to the guy .... "Hey buddy, why are you doing that?" He said,
 "Because you came home early."

 Its been a rough day. I got up this morning ... put on a shirt and a
 button fell off. I picked up my briefcase, and the handle came off. I'm
 afraid
 to go to the bathroom.

 I was such an ugly kid........When I played in the sandbox the cat kept
 covering me up.

 I could tell that my parents hated me. My bath toys were a toaster and a
 radio.

 I was such an ugly baby ... My mother never breast fed me. She told me
 that she only liked me as a friend.

 I'm so ugly ... My father carries around the picture of the kid who came
 with his wallet.

 When I was born .... the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my
 father "I'm very sorry.......We did everything we could......But he pulled
 through."

 I'm so ugly ... My mother had morning sickness.......AFTER I was born.

 I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to
 my father. He said he wanted more proof.

 Once when I was lost ..... I saw a policeman and asked him to help me find
 my parents. I said to him .... "Do you think we'll ever find them?" He said
 "I don't know kid ... there are so many places they can hide."

 My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.

 I'm so ugly ... I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how big I'd
 get.

 I went to see my doctor. "Doctor, every morning when I get up and look in
 the mirror, I feel like throwing up. What's wrong with me?" He said "I
 don't know but your eyesight is perfect."

 I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping pills. My
 doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.

ok

Richard:  is there any way that someone could act as your backup for the week 
you are off?  We can work around Suzanne's vacation schedule with others in 
her group.  Let me know if we can do anything about this.  Thanks.

Randy

Bob:  FYI, my guys tried again last night to update and were unable to. 

Bob:   I am still wonderring why the external modems my group had were 
removed.  It seems like I am always having to order modems and accessories 
every time we move anyone.  Since we are getting ready to move again, maybe 
we should get an inventory of everything each logistic's person has at their 
workstation, and this is what should be moved.

I talked to Rick but he is on his way to SP to try and resolve the Petrobras 
consent.  I will try and put together a meeting for us to resol the issues. 
Thanks for your patience.

Bob:  here is the completed version with changes.  

Let's try this with the attachment.  Thanks.  

Heather:  can you proof this and get this ready?   Thanks.

Bob:  we probably need to get everyone together on this and come up with a 
consolidated stance before we go outside the group.  As you pointed out, 
there are several areas that could open us up to potential problems.  We want 
ot be careful not to get things out in the iopen that we do not want out.

As far as I'm concerned this is fine if that is the deal.  However, I would
suggest that Owner obtain the Lenders' agreement to the position as it
constitutes a change to the Performance Tests under the EPC Contract.  See
Section 8.12(b)(ii)(D) of the Common Terms Agreement.

Laine,

This letter could be titled "Suggested Carve Out Language for Gatwick
Accord.  This is a response to your request for Language which we would
want to see in order  to go ahead and execute the Gatwick Accord.  Our main
issue results from our not wanting to be reposition the By-Pass Damper
after we finish Combined Cycle Oil Commissioning.

We structured this letter as a stand alone letter agreement so that we do
not need to wait until the EOT claim is executed to sign the Gatwick Accord
nor would we need to change the current language in the Gatwick Accord.

Dave:  sounds good to the West.

Bob:  The problem we were having is that if they could get in, it would lock 
them up for up to 5 minutes and then kick them out.  This would happen over 
and over again.  They said it was alright from 7:30 to 8:30 am, then became 
unusable about 8:30.  It has gotten to the point that on most days when they 
get cut off and they have to log back in they do not even consider this a 
problem.  We need to get back to exceptional service so they do not have to 
keep logging back in.  Thanks Bob.

Scotty:  we definitely want this.  Thanks.

Hi beautiful.  Thank you for the pictures.  You look so good.

Would any of the desks be opposed to enabling Unify to default the 
Destination rankings to the same rankings that are created in the Source 
rankings.  There would still be the ability to change to ranking on the 
Destination side however, it would not  affect the rankings on the Source 
side.  This will save time pathing and prevent the amount of data entry 
errors.   Would you please forward comments to your manager.    Dave 
Nommenson is aware that some of us are interested in this and would like to 
find out if it would be something worth putting into production.
Thanks.

Randy, 
We are in the process of setting up the following locations in red below in 
EOL as requested by Frank Ermis.
We need to get the pipe , zone (both required) and meter, if applicable, 
commercial would like these locations mapped into Sitara.
In order for these locations to flow into position manager in Sitara 
automatically (instead of manuelly entered) when these locations are hit on 
EOL, 
we need this information. Can you provide this information as soon as 
possible?

Thank you for your help!

Dale Neuner on 01/11/2000 02:20:58 PM
Frank would like to see the following 3 Locations approved from trading:

First:

already asked Frank to have Jeff Shankman look at thh product and offer 
approval. Please review.

Then:

Location: PGT Malin
Abbreviation: PGT Malin
Sort Code: 2850
Description: The transaction is for delivery at Pacific Gas Transmission 
Company - Malin.

Location: PG&E Pool
Abbreviation: PG&E Pool
Sort Code: 2840
Description: The transaction is for delivery at Pacific Gas & Electric 
Company - City Gate Pool Gas.

points and descriptions. Malin Lines 400 and 401 are no longer used, and PGE

Dave:  my concern not only is with the outage on Sunday, but what may happen 
between Sunday and Tuesday.  With everything else going on, I would hate for 
my group to come in here on Tuesday and have problems on top of everything 
else.  We are going to be having a lot to do and I would feel more 
comfortable without this distraction.  Let me know what you think.

Samantha:  could you please set Josh up to talk wityh me ASAP?  Thanks.  Randy

E-mail from Nov. 8, 2000
I was thinking of you today and I remembered a long conversation we had at 
the office one morning when we both arrived before everyone else.  You were 
wearing this pastel sun dress and you looked incredible.  I am thinking of 
you now too ...

Will do. Thanks.   Mary, please give me a call when you have a free minute.  
I have some news. 

Tom, Frank, Melissa and I are available tomorrow at 12:30 for the ECA call.
Can you ask Blanca to set up a dial in number and distribute?

Thanks

This is one of the things I will be doing to stay busy.

Rob, I just received a copy of a DASH asking for an increase on the letter of 
credit that is provided for the Cuiaba I project diesel fuel supply.  That 
DASH states that Shell has not agreed to participate in the cost of the 
letter of credit and as a result that Enron is entitled to charge  Shell 
Libor plus 4 % per annum on Shell's share of the guarantee under the terms of 
a letter agreement between Shell Cuiaba Holdings Ltd. and Enron. 

Has this been put into effect?  We are sensitive to this because we may have 
IRS transfer pricing issues with respect to guarantees that Enron makes on 
loans to its various project entities.

The last time I had talked was to Joanna back in late September/October and 
she said it had not been put into effect.

Regards,

Rick

Yes. They are actually antique windows that I found at an antique store and 
decided to feature in the cabinet.  It is really fun to visualize something 
like that and then make it happen. It happens a whole lot faster than Int'l 
Project Finance too!!

The call tomorrow is to discuss legal strucutre of the ECA and is not a 
numbers call.  We will need plenty of number soon though so please proceed.

Thanks

We may need to have some sensitivities ready when we meet with the Lenders 
tomorrow on the ECA.  In preparation for this, Felipe and I running the Bank 
Model for the different cases listed in the attachment below. Please review 
and provide comments on:

(1) accuracy of the Revised Base Case (A1) Assumptions
(2) the likelihood and reasonableness of the various cases
(3) answers to the items noted in Red

Regards,

I am not receiving any of the lender comments that were discussed below.  
Please keep me informed and include me in any discussions if possible as 
well.  Thank you.

Claudia spoke yesterday with Laterman who, despite having been in the 
meetings where it was agreed to move agreed items from the Consent to the 
Aditivo, seemed to think that there were new issues being raised.  Claudia 
was very firm with him that there was nothing new and that he needed to go 
back through an old draft of the Consent to confirm that every item in the 
Aditivo used to be in the Consent.  They have an internal meeting scheduled 
today and the hope is that Laterman will have done this exercise and can 
confirm that there is nothing new (otherwise he will look foolish if we have 
to later correct him, which we can do by showing Celso et al an old draft of 
the consent).  However, Laterman also confirmed what Adelino appeared to be 
saying below:  that they intend to hold up the Aditivo in order to get their 
"clarifications" inserted -- i.e., the same old issue regarding sharing the 
spot price pain on F/M delay.

Separately, Claudia spoke with Maur?cio and he relayed some innocuous 
drafting comments.  He also said, however, that he and Maria Aparecida had 
prepared a memo to go to Firmino describing the open "commercial" points 
which had never been agreed.  He would not tell Claudia what these points 
were and said they were for Firmino to decide and not for the lawyers.  
Claudia was very firm in insisting that this memo describe every issue they 
think is still open in the documents so we don't end up resolving open items, 
as we are close to doing with respect to the big 4, only to find that he and 
Maria Aparecida have more comments.   Action item: Jim or Jo?o Carlos -- we 
need to hit Firmino on any "new" commercial issues asap -- there should be 
none.  He's supposed to have received the memo yesterday so a call today may 
be appropriate.

This is beginning to feel like Ground Hog Day all over again!
 
Rgds,
 John

Joao Carlos called me to tell me that Celso had agreed to take the three key 
issue to the Diretoria, but that there were a number of issues in Aditivio #4 
that had not been agreed and required "clarification". He asked me to contact 
Adelino Rodrigues. I was concerned that we would be going back to square one 
- No release until we agree to clarify their language.  Joao Carlos said "no 
negotiations", "just clarifications". I was still concerned, because I was 
told that the only new aspect was the Guarantee language for the 
privatization event and clause 9, the details/mechanics of the 90 days 
payments.

I finally got hold of Adelino around 11:00 am. I asked him if he had received 
the Aditivo #4, he said he had it. I asked him if he had any questions, he 
said he was reading it.  I pressed him to give me a response today, he said 
he was meeting with the Contract Committee (internal) tomorrow at 9:00 AM. I 
asked him to get together by noon- he said he needed to report any issues to 
the Diretoria. I ask him to meet at 2:00 PM and he agreed.

Adelino wanted to include other Contract Clarifications issues in this 
Aditivo #4. I told him that this was not the place. This Aditivo was to 
provide a faithful portrait of the results of discussion in regards to the 
Lenders issues. It was to mirror the key clauses the Covenant. And it was 
created at the direction of Eletrobras to provide a better legal foundation.

I told Adelino that we would be signing other Aditivos in the future  and it 
was our intend to clarify the items we included in the Transfer Agreement.

Adelino felt that there were other items not previously agreed in this 
Aditivo.

I called Claudia. She told me that she had met with Celso and Adelino and 
that this had come up and she had assured them that there was nothing extra 
that had not been agreed. She told me that Celso had not agreed. She was to 
speak to the Legal department in Furnas to be backed up.

She was walking into a Furnas meeting with Adelino.  I asked her to press 
this matter with Adelino and the legal department.

I saw the exchange of the e-mail with the Lenders. They are reacting with one 
day delay so I do not know if they are current in their comments. John and 
Rick let's have a quick talk early tomorrow. I will call you.

Jose 

What's that number?  I think you said 917-971-0676.

I was just thinking about how much fun you are.  Since you asked for more 
pictures ...

I think we are going to have a hard time making this meaningful this week.  I 
suggest we postpone and we will advise everybody immediately if there is 
movement with Eletrabras and Furnas.  Thanks everyone.

interconnection. Not that you don't have enough to worry about.

Jose Bestard@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT

Created 12/15 05:42 PM   Modified 12/15 06:37 PM
Title: Cuiaba Events - Dec 15, 2000

I got hold of Adelino Rodrigues, Furnas, to find out the status of the review 
and approval of Aditivo #4, and the Termo de Consentimento.  [Joao Carlos had 
just called Celso Ferreira to see if it was worthwhile to meet. But, Celso 
just wanted to rehash his position]

Adelino  told me that Celso Ferreira, his boss, surprised him with the news 
that at the Diretoria meeting the President had taken the view that he would 
not approve the Aditivo unless  we also negotiate the Penalty Clauses of the 
Contract to pick up (something??) of what they owe to the MAE.

I told him, that negotiation was not in the cards. To renegotiate this 
clause,  or to not apply the clause, would imply that the financial models, 
which was the basis of the Loan commitment, would change, thus we would be 
without financing. Under that scenario, to protect our position we would have 
no choice but to proceed with our Termination Notice.

He said he understood hat we needed to protect our position but that there 
was nothing he could do with those instruction.

I said , fine, but if we were to set that issue aside, what were the comments 
that he had in Aditivo #4, and the Termo de Consentimento? I was being 
advised that the current versions in total, are a faithful reflection of what 
had been discussed from the moment that we signed the document, the Transfer 
Agreement, transferring the Contract from Eletronorte to Furnas to the 
present. It was meant to capture the Lenders issues. What I wanted to know, 
was there something different in the text? Could he fax me a hand-written 
text of the portion that they disagreed?

He could not give me an answer. But he promised to send me something by 
Tuesday next week.

I told him that after I received it. I would consult with my people to find 
out why there is a difference and call him.

Actions. 

1) Legal team must be ready to proceed with the filing Dec 21 of our Notice 
of Termination. They need to analyze the Furnas response to the Default 
Notice. In the notification we can extend the time (if we want, beyond the 30 
days, we can use the feriados as a reason). Rick Lammers.  Let' s discuss 
next call.

2) We need to inform Aneel about it.  Cover letter explaing the situation 
,and key memos. 

3) Jim. We need to discuss how to use leverage on Luis Carlos Santos. If this 
goes to the ultimate, this will become an international incident; but, maybe 
he does not mind that.

We can contact the USA embassy, but I am not sure if people are gone for 
vacation.

4) Will need to review closely the Termination Scenario In January. We do not 
necessarily want to do it in January because of the status of the 
commissioning schedule. There are a number of regulatory issues to resolve.

Attached was my decriptions of the scenarios. 

Jose

The discussions went well on the ECA this morning and there are no issues of 
any great significance left, other than Shell's sponsor buyout proposal.  We 
have one turn of the document to do but we are in good shape here (I guess 
that is to say we are perfectly positioned to offer millions and millions in 
sponsor support).  I want to take just a little more time on the model to 
make sure everything we send will tie, but we will get it to them  on  Monday 
for sure.

Rick,

I'm not sure Felipe understands that he needs to finalize the model with me 
first before he sends around a "lender package" for the senior guys to 
review. We are still trying to make everything make sense, make certain 
strategic decisions on presentation, and make all of the presentations tic 
and tie as Connie would say.  I believe we will have no problem accomplishing 
all of this by early Monday and then you and Laine can review and make 
additional changes if you like.  We can talk on Monday as well about how we 
handle Shell, but an expedited approach should be doable with the right 
spin.  However, I am concerned that the base case you agreed with Johanas is 
no longer accurate given the status of Laine's negotiations.

I did not understand specifically your question about cash below.  Could you 
clarify this particular concern further for me so I can look into it.  I am 
going to get much closer to the model this time than last because of the 
turnover due to Robert and Joana moving on.  Give me a call if there is 
anything else you want me to look into.

Regards, Rob

Richard A Lammers
12/15/2000 04:36 PM
hy are we excludung cash from the lender model.Did we not do this last time.I 
think shell required this. We also need to put on these models that this is 
Enron's latest update and send to shell simultaneaously or get shell's 
approval first( which ain't going to happen quick)

You and I are on the same page here.  I was aware of this, I'm just trying to 
figure out how to present this in a way that it does not invite much review 
or discussion.  It is one of the few elements which have to bridge the budget 
and the cash flow statement.  I am hopeful that the lenders will continue not 
to focus on it since there is no assurance that it will be received and more 
astute lenders would probably make us guarantee it.

Richard A Lammers
12/15/2000 05:08 PM
You may have received my email by now instructing him to clear the models 
with you before we go further.This is one of the mistakes I made when you 
first joined the team and I wont make it again.  We have $21mm in cash flow 
during operations that we plan to use to reduce our capital commitments and I 
just want to make sure we fight the lenders to give us asmuch credit as 
possible for this cash.Thanks.

spin.  However, I am concerned that the base case you agreed with Johanas is 
no longer accurate given the status of Laine's negotiations.

I did not understand specifically your question about cash below.  Could you 
clarify this particular concern further for me so I can look into it.  I am 
going to get much closer to the model this time than last because of the 
turnover due to Robert and Joana moving on.  Give me a call if there is 
anything else you want me to look into.

hy are we excludung cash from the lender model.Did we not do this last time.I 
think shell required this. We also need to put on these models that this is 
Enron's latest update and send to shell simultaneaously or get shell's 
approval first( which ain't going to happen quick)

Once again it is our intention to have the $21MM count toward the Budget.  
What is not firmly established is the total budget amount. We are removing 
the contingency which reduces the budget but that is offset by some fuel oil 
expense and F/X expense which is increasing.  Please plan for you and Laine 
to be available Monday AM to make sure we are all on the same page once this 
all settles.

Felipe Ospina
12/15/2000 06:59 PM
Ok. However, I dont see a reduction from cash from operations in the models 
that were sent to the lenders in August by Roberto. I dont remember either 
Robert or Roberto mentioning this assumptions at that time either. Thanks.

Felipe Ospina

I included cash from operations in the Project Cost Tab in the Consolidated 
Model to match the reconciliation file that Tracee has which will be shown to 
the lenders. If everyone agrees I can send to Shell so they can start 
reviewing, but what Tracee told me was that she and Rob and want to sign off 
first and they are still reviewing the models.

Mary,  thanks so much for your note.  In terms of managing costs this is a 
little like trying to save money on the project by turning out the lights in 
my office when I go home; However, I have noticed over the course of this 
deal that FF failed to accuratrely reflect the business deal on a number of 
occaisions when issues were resolved verbally.  This resulted in things 
having to be revisited and rehashed in a costly manner.  Therefore, with the 
ECA, I attempted to reach agreement on the commercial structure first and 
actually reflect the result in the table.  The concern I raised with Nancy 
was the fact that even when given a written record of the result reached by 
the business people, the document provided still reflected the principal 
terms poorly.   We were able to resolve this problem on Fridays call, but the 
call was costly (outside lawyers in attendance were Melissa, Stefan, Cliff, 
Mathew, and I believe Juliana).  In fact things went swimmingly on the call 
primarily because there was no new ground being broken.  

I am just trying to improve things a little bit with this discussion.  I 
remain extreemely appreciative of all of your efforts and I think the world 
of Melissa and the job she has done on this project.

Thanks for listening.

Rob

Nancy informed me that you were not happy because certain provisions/deals
discussed on the business side were not accurately reflected in the finance
agreements, which is creating additional legal expenses.  I assume you are
referring to a recent draft of the ECA in which the fall away provisions
that we discussed were not accurately reflected in the agreement.  This is
my fault - in the interest of trying to expedite getting the draft to the
sponsors, I authorized Melissa to send the draft out without reviewing the
provisions first.  Normally, KfW and OPIC review the agreements before
sending to you and our lawyers make the required changes before you see the
agreement.  I will no longer authorize her to send anything to the sponsors
before KfW and OPIC review the contents in full.  Hopefully - this will help
prevent this situation from occuring in the future.

Sorry for the inconvenience this caused the sponsors.

Pete -

 Starting today 16 December 2000 thru 3 January 2001I will be taking my "home 
leave".  During that time Gonzalo Figueroa will be responsible for operations 
at the plant and Celso Bernardi all financial and administrative issues.  As 
normal Tony Apps has any power plant construction issues and Mel Schulze any 
pipeline construction issues.  Since I will not be in either Brasil or the US 
during my holidays I will not be reachable by celphone.  However Clarissa 
Sauer, my assistant in Cuiaba, will know my whereabouts and how to get in 
touch in case of an emergency.  Her celphone is 55 65 9983-6009.

Happy holidays -

Laine

John, I jjust reviewed the interconnection memo from Claudia. Once again it 
is weak on the situation and our remedies.  Can you help Jose try to pull 
this together.  

This is the type of thing I'll be doing for the forseable future. It has been 
great working with you.

Regards,

Rob

   

I have been relying soley on Jose and Claudia for interpretations of the 
relevant regs. I have not seen Enlish translations of the regs or the CCT & 
CUST so I don't know how we get charged. I think Jose has some idea and I 
seem to recall US$.0007/kw-hr but I don't have anything official.

Jose and Rob- This note is short and sweet and seems to say what we want it 
to say,i.e the changes in the transmission regs came after the PPA was 
signed,this really is the responsibility of Furnas and any costs can be 
recovered thru economic equillibrium. However ,I think we need to bolster the 
change in law argument by referencing the section in the PPA , provide some 
economic examples of the type of financial exposure to the project and 
reference the sections in the operatin accord and ppa where Furnas is 
responsible for all charges after the delivery points.Jose- please focus on 
cleaning this document up today so we can deliver the note asap. The lenders 
raised the delay in getting this note to them again last Friday.Rob- do you 
have some calculations that you have done that everyone can review for 
inclusion into the note.We also need your review of the note for correct spin 
on how you want to deliver to the banks

Novak and I are still working on it. John's view is that the legal analysis 
provided by Tozzini is not supportable based on the facts of certain regs, 
etc.  We are trying to decide what are the implications so we can advise the 
banks. It seems that we probably do need to assign the agreements.

Rob,

Your name came up on the Cuiaba taks list call today.  The issue was the 
summary of the ONS contracts issue (who needs to signe ONS contracts... EPE 
or Furnas?).

Have you received the information you needed form Tozzini?  What is the 
status of that memo?

thank you,

What's up with Laine and the incompetence routine?  

Please confirm my inferences:

1) The Southeast curve has been provided by the MAE in its official capacity 
(do we have a reference from a press release or publication?)
2) I assume the Southeast curve predicts the maximum marginal cost expected 
to be dispatched for each period. Is this correct?  Is this for Peak demand 
periods?  Do we have a prediction on an intra-day basis?
3) The graph seems to  predict that EPE's cost will be below the Southeast 
curve; therefore we can epect full dispatch (?)

Felipe Ospina
12/18/2000 02:45 PM
As discussed on the conference call, here is a graph of the MAE forward curve 
v.s. the EPE marginal cost provided by Christiaan. It assumes EPE's marginal 
cost remains at R$97.84/Mwh until Aug-01, which I think is not the case as it 
will go down once gas arrives and the plant increases to 480 MW. The forward 
curve is as of Dec-06. One can see the impact of the dry season beginning mid 
year until around Sept as Laine was suggesting in the call.  Thanks.

Here is what we have concluded based on discussions this morning:

1) We believe that Furnas has agreed to contract and pay for 300 MW on oil to 
meet regulatory requirements concerning required capacity and reserve 
margin.  We do not believe that they intend for us to be dispatrched above 
220 MW. (Do we have any document which could substantiate this?)

2) Although  dispatch on a merit order basis would suggest that EPE runs full 
time (with 300 MW available),  there are practical constraints in the 
transmission system which will prohibit this from actually occuring. [ Please 
describe these constraints using some official sounding jargon but minimal 
detail and in particular indicate what is involved to de-bottleneck and how 
long this will take.  I presume that Furnas is solely responsible for the 
corrective measures.]

3) Based on our analysis, the optimal operating approach would be to generate 
220MW with  one turbine and 91 MW with the other for a total of 311 if 
dipatched above 220 MW.

If we can prove that 1) & 2) are correct or convince the lenders that they 
are, then I think we can suggest that fuel oil exposure is negligibe if gas 
is ready by April 01.  We will have to see how it looks when we add the Sue 
Garvin flex months.

Therefore, a merit order analysis is only necessary if i) our supposition 
about Furnas' motivations are incorrect and/or ii) the transmission problem 
is cleared.  If this happens it would be nice to be able to predict reduced 
fuel utilization due to a) reduced dispatch during daily off-peak hours or 
seasonal impacts, b) due to scheduled outages, and c) due to managing our 
availabilty in such a way as to reduce fuel consumption operating losses.  
Any data you can provide will be helpful.

Have I successfully connected the dots here?

If you have previously sent these materials to Felipe or Tracee please simply 
grumble to yourself if you have to do an extra e-mail to me.  Remember, you 
don't have to be nice to a short timer unless you need them to get something 
done.

Regards,

Rob

Team:

It is with much pleasure and gratitude that I confirm AES' stepping up to 
purchase our remaining interest in the Barge project located in Lagos, 
Nigeria.  Thanks to the dedication and hard work of everyone, we were able to 
create a robust and compelling project in spite of numerous detractors and 
doubters.  This latest development only reinforces the value of your efforts.

Please note that we still have interests in Nigeria (notably an EPC contract 
for the Barges) and we remain engaged in a strategic alliance with AES and YF 
Power to ensure the successful evacuation of power to all Nigerians via the 
Barge project and the IPP as quickly as possible.  Notwithstanding this sale, 
we remain committed to this endeavor and believe that the alliance is the 
most expedient vehicle to the realization of everyone's goals.   If you 
happen to have discussions with outsiders regarding these projects, please do 
your part to quell the notion that Enron has "abandoned" the project.  Feel 
free to talk to me regarding any questions you may have.

Thanks again and congratulations on a job well done.

Thanks Rick,

I too was concerned that he thinks I am pointing fingers.  Although I think 
the people with the authority also ultimately have to accept the 
responsibility, I think Laine has done an incredible job on many fronts 
simultaneously (and I have said so to Mariella when queried).  However, maybe 
this thing is just bigger than all of us. I just don't know any more.   It's 
true there is a lot of pressure and I'm sure Laine is absorbing most of the 
blows.  I have taken a lot of heat from Global Finance and Kishkill myself.

It's true that over the last 6 months I have not always been able to pay 
attention to the flood of e-mails this project generates each day. However, 
as you know, my style is to focus on a task with great intensity so I usually 
find the e-mails relevant to the issue I have square in my sights.  It's also 
true that on a number of occaisions I have been inadvertantly left out of the 
loop (such apparently was the case here).  I think it is unreasonable to 
assume that I have seamless communication with Tracee and Felipe or that 
these two young associates can even discern everything that is important.  
They are really struggling with the complexity of this project, everything is 
new to them, and they don't have the benefit of experience to know what is 
normal.  As a result, increased patience and communication are in order.   

At this point I am trying to insure that the model we put in front of the 
lenders is credible and if we elect to present an undocumented issue in our 
favor than I want to be sure that I can defend the position.  I think we made 
great strides in toward developing a story which hangs together yesterday, 
although albeit in a painful fashion.  I want to reassure both you and Laine 
that I am committed to getting this done, I no longer have anything on my 
plate but this, and I am not going to break ranks when questioned by  the 
numerous folks nosing around.  The tough projects are what determine what we 
are made of.

I am comfortable with you forwarding these comments to Laine at your 
discretion.

I talked to him after the call and he was concerned about the outbirst. We 
are both getting alot of heat from Corp right now for the overruns . I would 
not take it personal and I do not think he intended the remark towards the 
group on the phone but to others that he has talked to. His only comment to 
me after the call was that he felt he was sending you the info but that at 
times you had not had time to read it. I am not sure this is the case or if 
you even need to read all the notes that come to you but you may want to just 
ask Tracee to automatically forward you everything that you are not copied 
on. Overall- I would not dwell on it .We accomplished what we needed to on 
the call and at least from my point of view I can see that you are truly 
focused on pushing this thing across the goal line.Call me on my cell if you 
want to talk further.

Rob,

Regarding items 1 and 2, please contact Lucio Reis in Sao Paulo office and he 
can explain.

Item 3 is incorrect. The 300 MW would be generated by the two gas turbines at 
about 100 MW each and the remaining 100 MW coming from the steam turbine. The 
steam turbine receives its energy from the exit gases from the gas turbines 
and they both contribute equally to the resulting steam turbine output 
(theoretically at least, in practice depending on optimization of machines)

Again, please talk with Lucio.

I have been informed that Cuiaba I is in Global Assets shop and that I have 
been tasked with responsibility for bringing it to successful closure.

Think there are different definitions of successful closure.   Financial 
close is key step -  gets Enron's money out, but does not improve the 
economics of the project.   I am looking to get as much of Enron's money out 
as possible and improve the economics of the remaining investment.

Cuiaba I is very much intertwined with the GTB/Transredes chain - also with 
Cuiaba II - restructuring of the project is complex - but we have pretty 
clear contractual rights to restructure the supply -  if the Furnas consent 
does not come - poker game becomes very high stakes during January -  and of 
course compounding all this is construction and budget and the mark to market 
position.

I would like to meet with Jose, John, Joao Carlos, Rick, Rob, Laine, 
Christiaan, and Felipe in Houston on the 8th, 9th and 10th (if needed) of 
January to go through this from top to bottom and figure out the game plan
